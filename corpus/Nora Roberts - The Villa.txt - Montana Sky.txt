 sisters yet strangers they must live together at mercy ranch the home bequesthed to them by the late father in order to inherit their share being dead didnt make jack mercy less of a son of a bitch one week of dead didnt offset sixtyeight years of living mean plenty of the people gathered by his grave would be happy to say so the fact was funeral or no funeral bethanne mosebly muttered those sentiments into her husbands ear as they stood in the high grass of the cemetery she was there only out of affection for young willa and she had bent her husbands tired ear with that information as well all the way up from ennis as a man who had listened to his wifes chatter for fortysix years bob mosebly simply grunted tuning her and the preachers droning voice out not that bob had fond memories of jack hed hated the old bastard as did most every living soul in the state of montana but dead was dead bob mused and they had sure come out in droves to send the fucker on his way to hell this peaceful corner of mercy ranch set in the shadows of the big belt mountains near the banks of the missouri was crowded now with ranchers and cowboys merchants and politicians here where cattle grazed the hills and horses danced in sunny pastures generations of mercys were buried under the billowing grass i jack was the latest hed ordered the glossy chestnut coffin himself had it custommade and inscribed in gold with the linked ms that made up the ranchs brand the box was lined with white satin and jack was inside it now wearing his best snakeskin boots his oldest and most favored stetson and holding his bullwhip jack had vowed to die the way he had lived in nosethumbing style word was willa had already ordered the headstone according to her fathers instructions it would be white marbleþno ordinary granite for jackson mercyþand the sentiments inscribed on it were his own here lies jack mercy he lived as he wanted died the same way the hell with anybody who didnt like it the monument would be raised once the ground had settled to join all the others that tipped and dotted the stony ground from jack mercys greatgrandfather jebidiah mercy who had roamed the mountains and claimed the land to the last of jacks three wivesþand the only one whod died before he could divorce her wasnt it interesting bob mused that each of mercys wives had presented him with a daughter when hed been hellbent on having a son bob liked to think of it as gods little joke on a man who had stepped on backsþ and heartsþto get what he wanted in every other area of his life he remembered each of jacks wives well enough though none of them had lasted long lookers every one he thought now and the girls theyd birthed werent hard on the eyes either bethanne had been burning up the phone lines ever since word came along that mercys two oldest daughters were flying in for the funeral neither of them had set foot on mercy land since before they could walk and they wouldnt have been welcome only willa had stayed thered been little mercy could do about that seeing as how her mother had died almost before the child had been weaned without any relations to dump the girl on hed passed the baby along to his housekeeper and bess had raised the girl as best she could each of the women had a touch of jack in her bob noted scanning them from under the brim of his hat the dark hair the sharp chin you could tell they were sisters all right even though theyd never set eyes on each other before time would tell how they would deal together and time would tell if willa had enough of jack mercy in her to run a ranch of twentyfive thousand acres she was thinking of the ranch and the work that needed to be done the morning was bright and clear with the hills sporting color so bold and beautiful it almost hurt the eyes the mountains and valley might have been painted fancy for fall but the chinook wind had come in hot and dry and thick early october was warm enough for shirtsleeves but that could change tomorrow thered already been snow in the high country and she could see it dribbling along the black and gray peaks slyly coating the forests cattle needed to be rounded up fences needed to be checked repaired checked again winter wheat had to be planted it was up to her now it was all up to her jack mercy was no longer mercy ranch willa reminded herself she was she listened to the preacher speak of everlasting life of forgiveness and the welcome of heaven and thought that jack mercy would spit on anyones welcome into a place other than his own montana had been his this wide country of mountain and meadow of eagle and wolf her father would be as miserable in heaven as he would in hell her face remained calm as the fancy coffin was lowered into the newest scar in the earth her skin was pale gold a legacy from her mother and her blackfoot blood as much as the sun her eyes nearly as black as the hair shed hurriedly twisted into a braid for the funeral remained fixed on the box that held her fathers body she hadnt worn a hat and the sun beamed like fire into her eyes but she didnt let them tear she had a proud face high cheekbones a wide haughty mouth dark exotic eyes with heavy lids and thick lashes shed broken her nose falling off an angry wild mustang when she was eight willa liked to think the slight left turn it took in the center of her face added character character meant a great deal more to willa mercy than beauty men didnt respect beauty she knew they used it she stood very still the wind picking up strands from her braid and teasing them into a dance a woman of average height and tough rangy build in an illfitting black dress and dainty black heels that had never been out of their box before that morning a woman of twentyfour with work on her mind and a raging tearing grief in her heart she had despite everything loved jack mercy and she said nothing not one word to the two women the strangers who shared her blood and had come to see their father buried for a moment just one moment she let her gaze shift let it rest on the grave of mary wolfchild mercy the mother she couldnt remember was buried under a soft mound of wildflowers that bloomed like jewels in the autumn sun adams doing she thought and looked up and into the eyes of her half brother he would know as no one else could that she had tears in her heart she could never let free when adam took her hand willa linked fingers with his in her mind and heart he was all the family she had now he lived the life that satisfied him adam murmured his voice was quiet peaceful if they had been alone willa could have turned rested her head on his shoulder and found comfort yes he did and now its done adam glanced over at the two women jack mercys daughters and thought something else was just beginning you have to speak with them willa theyre sleeping in my house eating my food deliberately she looked back at her fathers grave thats enough theyre your blood no adam youre my blood theyre nothing to me she turned away from him and braced herself to receive the condolences neighbors brought food for death there was no stopping the bone deep tradition any more than willa could have stopped bess from cooking for three days straight to provide for what the housekeeper called the bereavement supper and that was a double pile of horseshit in willas mind there was no bereavement here curiosity certainly many of the people who packed into the main house had been invited before more many more had not his death provided them entry and they enjoyed it the main house was a showplace jack mercy style once a cabin of log and mud had stood there but that had been more than a hundred years before now there was a sprawling rambling structure of stone and wood of glistening glass rugs from all over the world spread over floors of gleaming pine or polished tile jack mercy had liked to collect when hed become master of mercy ranch he had spent five years turning what had been a lovely home into his personal palace rich lived rich he liked to say so he had collecting paintings and sculpture adding rooms where the art could be displayed the entrance was a towering atrium floored with tiles in jewel tones of sapphire and ruby in a repeating pattern of the mercy ranch brand the staircase that swept to the second floor was polished oak shiny as glass with a newel post carved in the shape of a howling wolf people gathered there now many of them goggling over it as they balanced their plates others crowded into the living room with its acre of slick floor and wide curve of sofa in creamcolored leather on the smooth river rock of the wallspanning fireplace hung a lifesize painting of jack mercy astride a black stallion his head was cocked his hat tipped back a bullwhip curled in one hand many felt that those hard blue eyes damned them as they sat drinking his whiskey and toasting his death for lily mercy the second daughter jack had conceived and discarded it was terrifying the house the people the noise the room the housekeeper had given her the day before when shed arrived was so beautiful so quiet she thought now as she moved closer to the rail of the side porch the lovely bed the pretty golden wood against the silky wallpaper the solitude she wanted that now so very much as she looked out toward the mountains such mountains she thought so high so rough nothing at all like the pretty little hills of her home in virginia and all the sky the shuddering and endless blue of it curving down to more land than could possibly exist the plains that wild roll of them and the wind that seemed never to stop and the colors the golds and russets the scarlets and bronzes of both hill and plain exploding with autumn and this valley where the ranch spread in a spot of such impossible strength and beauty shed seen deer out the window that morning drinking from a stream that glowed silver in the dawn shed heard horses the voices of men the crow of a rooster and what she thoughtþhopedþmight have been an eagles cry she wondered whether if she found the courage to walk into the forest that danced up those foothills she would see the moose the elk the fox that she had read about so greedily on the flight west she wondered if she would be allowed to stay even another dayþand where she would go what she would do if she was asked to leave she couldnt go back east not yet selfconsciously she fingered the yellowing bruise shed tried to hide with makeup and sunglasses jesse had found her shed been so careful but hed found her and the court orders hadnt stopped his fists they never had divorce hadnt stopped him all the moving and the running hadnt stopped him but here she thought maybe here thousands of miles away in a country so huge she could finally start again without fear the letter from the attorney informing her of jack mercys death and requesting her to travel to montana had been like a gift from god though her expenses had been paid lily had cashed in the firstclass airfare and booked zigzagging flights across the country under three different names she wanted desperately to believe jesse cooke couldnt find her here she was so tired of running of being afraid she wondered if she could move to billings or helena and find a job any job she wasnt without some skills there was her teaching degree and she knew how to use a keyboard maybe she could find a small apartment of her own even just a room to start until she got on her feet again she could live here she thought staring out at the vast and terrifying and glorious space maybe she even belonged here she jumped when a hand touched her arm barely stifled the scream as her heart leaped like a rabbit into her throat not jesse she realized feeling the fool the man beside her was dark where jesse was blond this man had bronzed skin and hair that streamed to his shoulders kind eyes dark very dark in a face as beautiful as a painting but then jesse was beautiful too she knew how cruel beauty could be im sorry adams voice was as soothing as it would have been if hed frightened a puppy or a sick foal i didnt mean to startle you iced tea he took her hand noting the way it trembled and wrapped it around the glass its a dry day thank you i didnt hear you come up behind me in a habit she wasn t even aware of lily took a step aside putting distance between them running room i was just looking its so beautiful here yes it is she sipped cooling her dry throat and ordered herself to be calm and polite people asked fewer questions when you were calm do you live nearby very he smiled stepped closer to the rail and gestured east he liked her voice the slow warm southern flavor of it the little white house on the other side of the horse barn yes i saw it you have blue shutters and a garden and there was a little black dog sleeping in the yard lily remembered how homey it had looked how much more welcoming than the grand house thats beans adam smiled again yhe dog he has a fondness for refried beans im adam wolfchild willas brother oh she studied the hand he offered for a moment then ordered herself to take it she could see the points of resemblance now the high slashing cheekbones the eyes i didnt realize she had aþthat would make us no her hand seemed very fragile and he let it go gently you shared a father willa and i shared a mother i see and realizing that shed given very little thought to the man theyd buried today she felt ashamed were you close to him your stepfather no one was it was said simply and without bitterness youre uncomfortable here hed noticed her keeping to the edges of groups of people shying away from contact as if the casual brush of shoulders might bruise her just as hed noticed the marks of violence on her face that she tried to hide i dont know anyone wounded adam thought he had always been drawn to the wounded she was lovely and injured dressed neatly in a quiet black suit and heels she was only an inch or so shorter than his five ten and too thin for her height her hair was dark with a sheen of red and it fell in soft waves that reminded him of angel wings he couldnt see her eyes behind the sunglasses but he wondered about their color and about what else he would read in them she had her fathers chin he noticed but her mouth was soft and rather small like a childs there had been the faint hint of a dimple beside it when shed tried to smile at him her skin was creamy very paleþa fragile contrast to the marks on it she was alone he thought and afraid it might take him some time to soften willas heart toward this woman this sister i have to check on a horse he began oh it surprised her that she was disappointed she had wanted to be alone she was better when she was alone i wont keep you would you like to walk down see some of the stock the horses iþ dont be a coward she ordered herself he isnt going to hurt you yes id like that if i wouldnt be in your way you wouldnt knowing shed shy away he didnt offer a hand or take her arm but merely led the way down the stairs and across the rough dirt road several peopf saw them go and tongues wagged as tongues do lily mercy was one of jacks daughters after all though as was pointed out she hardly had a word to say for herself something that had never been willas problemþno indeed that was a girl who said plenty whatever and whenever she wanted as for the other oneþwell that was a different kettle of fish altogether snooty she was parading around in her fancy suit and looking down her nose anybody with eyes could see the way shed stood at the gravesite cold as ice she was a picture to be sure jack had sired finelooking daughters and that one the oldest one had his eyes hard and sharp and blue it was obvious she thought she was better than the rest of them with her california polish and her expensive shoes but there were plenty who remembered her ma had been a las vegas showgirl with a big braying laugh and a bawdy turn of phrase those who did remember had already decided they much preferred the mother to the daughter tess mercy could have cared less she was here in this godforsaken outback only until the will could be read shed take what was hers which was less than the old bastard owed her and shake the dust off her ferragamos ill be back by monday at the latest she carried the phone along as she paced about with quick jerky motions nervous energy searing the air around her shed closed the doors of what she supposed was a den hoping to have at least a few moments of privacy she had to work hard to ignore the mounted animal heads that populated the walls the scripts finished she smiled a little tunneled her fingers through the straightedge swing of dark hair that curved at her jaw damn right its brilliant and itll be in your hot little hands monday dont hassle me ira she warned her agent ill get you the script then you get me the deal my cash flows down to a dribble she shifted the phone and pursed her lips as she helped herself to a snifter of brandy from the decanter she was still listening to the promises and pleas of hollywood when she saw lily and adam stroll by the window interesting she thought and sipped the little mouse and the noble savage tess had done some quick checking before shed made the trip to montana she knew adam wolfchild was the son of jack mercys third and final wife that hed been eight when his mother had married mercy wolfchild was blackfoot or mostly his mother had been part italian the man had spent twentyfive years on mercy ranch and had little more to show for it than a tiny house and a job tending horses tess intended to have more as for lily all tess had discovered was that she was divorced childless and moved around quite a bit probably because her husband had used her for a punching bag tess thought and made herself clamp down on a stir of pity she couldnt afford emotional attachments here it was straight business lilys mother had been a photographer whod come to montana to snap pictures of the real west shed snapped jack mercyþfor all the good it had done her tess thought then there was willa tesss mouth tightened as she thought of willa the one who had stayed the one the old bastard had kept well she owned the place now tess assumed shrugging her shoulders and she was welcome to it no doubt shed earned it but tess mercy wasnt walking away without a nice chunk of change looking out the window she could see the plains in the distance rolling rolling endlessly as empty as the moon with a shudder she turned her back on the view christ she wanted rodeo drive monday ira she snapped annoyed with his voice buzzing in her ear your office twelve sharp then you can take me to lunch with that as a goodbye she replaced the receiver three days tops she promised herself and toasted an elk head with her brandy then shed get the hell out of dodge and back to civilization shouldn t have to remind you that you got guests downstairs will bess pringle stood with her hands on her bony hips and used the same tone shed used when willa was ten willa jerked her jeans onþbess didnt believe in little niceties like privacy and had barely knocked before striding into the bedroom willa responded just as she might have at ten then dont she sat down to pull on her boots rude is a fourletter word sos work but it still has to be done and youve got enough hands around this place to see to it for one blessed day youre not going off somewhere today of all days it aint fittin what was or wasnt fitting constituted the bulk of besss moral and social codes she was a bird of a woman all bone and teeth though she could plow through a mountain of hotcakes like a starving field hand and had the sweet tooth of an eightyearold she was fiftyeightþand had changed the date on her birth certificate to prove itþand had a head of flaming red hair she dyed in secret and kept pulled back in a dontgivemeanylip bun her voice was as rough as pine bark and her face as smooth as a girl s and surprisingly pretty with mossgreen eyes and a pug irish nose her hands were small and quick and able and so was her temper with her fists still glued to her hips she marched up to willa and glared down you get your sassy self down those stairs and tend to your guests ive got a ranch to run willa rose it hardly mattered that in her boots she topped bess by six inches the balance of power had always tottered back and forth between them and theyre not my guests im not the one who wanted them here yheyve come to pay respects thats fittin yheyve come to gawk and prowl around the house and its time they left maybe some of them did bess jerked her head in a little nod but theres plenty more who are here for you i dont want them willa turned away picked up her hat then simply stood staring out her window crushing the brim in her hands the window faced the mountains the dark belt of trees the peaks of the big belt that held all the beauty and mystery in the world i dont need them i cant breathe with all these people hovering around bess hesitated before laying a hand on willas shoulder jack mercy hadnt wanted his daughter raised soft no pampering no spoiling no cuddling hed made that clear while willa had still been in diapers so bess had pampered and spoiled and cuddled only when she was certain she wouldnt be caught and sent away like one of jacks wives honey you got a right to grieve hes dead and hes buried feeling sorry wont change it but she lifted a hand closed it over the small one on her shoulder he didnt even tell me he was sick bess he couldnt even give me those last few weeks to try to take care of him or to say goodbye he was a proud man bess said but she thought bastard selfish bastard its better the cancer took him quick rather than letting him linger he wouldve hated that and it wouldve been harder on you one way or the other its done she smoothed the wide circling brim of her hat settled it on her head ive got animals and people depending on me the hands need to see right now that im in charge that mercy ranch is still being run by a mercy you do what you have to do then years of experience had taught bess that what was fitting didnt hold much water when it came to ranch business but you be back by suppertime youre going to sit down and eat decent clear these people out of the house and i will she started out turning left toward the back stairs they wound down the east wing of the house and allowed her to slip into the mudroom even there she could hear the beehive buzz of conversations from the other rooms the occasional roll of laughter resenting all of it she slammed out the door then pulled up short when she saw the two men smoking companionably on the side porch her gaze narrowed on the older man and the bottle of beer dangling from his fingers enjoying yourself ham sarcasm from willa didnt ruffle hamilton dawson hed put her up on her first pony had wrapped her head after her first spill hed taught her how to use a rope shoot a rifle and dress a deer now he merely fit his cigarette into the little hole surrounded by grizzled hair and blew out a smoke ring itsþanother smoke ring formedþa pretty afternoon i want the fence checked along the nonhwest boundary been done he said placidly and continued to lean on the rail a short stocky man on legs curved like a wishbone he was ranch foreman and figured he knew what needed to be done as well as willa did got a crew out making repairs sent brewster and pickles up the high country we lost a couple head up there looks like cougar another drag another stream of smoke brewsterll take care of it likes to shoot things i want to talk to him when he gets back i expect you will he straightened up from the rail adjusted his mudcolored dishrag of a hat its weaning time yes i know he expected she did and nodded again ill go check on the fence crew sorry about your pa will she knew those simple words tacked onto ranch business were more sincere and personal than the acres of flowers sent by strangers ill ride out later he nodded to her to the man beside him then hitched his bowlegged way toward his rig how are you holding up will she shrugged a shoulder frustrated that she didnt know what to do next i want it to be tomorrow she said tomorrowll be easier dont you think nate because he didnt want to tell her the answer was no he tipped back his beer he was there for her as a friend a fellow rancher a neighbor he was also there as jack mercys lawyer and he knew that before too much more time passed he was going to shatter the woman standing beside him lets take a walk he set the beer down on the rail took willas arm my legs need stretching he had a lot of them nathan torrence was a tall one hed hit six two at seventeen and had kept growing now at thirtythree he was six six and lanky with it hair the color of wheat straw curled under his hat his eyes were as blue as the montana sky in a face handsomely scored by wind and sun at the end of long arms were big hands at the end of long legs were big feet despite them he was surprisingly graceful he looked like a cowboy walked like a cowboy his heart when it came to matters of his family his horses and the poetry of keats was as soft as a down pillow his mind when it came to matters of law of justice of simple right and wrong was as hard as granite he had a deep and longstanding affection for willa mercy and he hated that he had no choice but to put her through hell ive never lost anybody close to me nate began i cant say i know how you feel willa kept walking past the cookhouse the bunkhouse by the chicken house where the hens were going broody he never let anyone get close to him i dont know how i feel the ranch this was dicey territory and nate negotiated carefully its a lot to deal with weve got good people good stock good land it wasnt hard to smile up at nate it never was good friends you can call on me anytime will me or anyone in the county i know that she looked beyond him to the paddocks the corrals the outbuildings the houses and farther to where the land went into its long endless roll to the bottom of the sky a mercy has run this place for more than a hundred years raised cattle planted grain run horses i know what needs to be done and how to do it nothing really changes everything changes nate thought and the world she was speaking of was about to take a sharp turn thanks to the hard heart of a dead man it was better to do it now straight off before she climbed onto a horse or into a rig and rode off wed best get to the reading of the will he decided ack mercys office on the second floor of the main house was big as a ballroom the walls were paneled in yellow pine lumbered from his own land and shellacked to a rich gloss that lent a golden light to the room huge windows provided views of the ranch the land and sky jack had been fond of saying he could see all a man needed to see from those windows which were undraped but ornately trimmed on the floor were layered the rugs hed collected the chairs were leather as hed preferred in rich shades of teal and maroon his trophies hung on the wallsþheads of elk and bighorn sheep of bear and buck crouched in one corner as though poised to charge was a massive black grizzly fangs exposed glassy black eyes full of rage some of his favored weapons were in a locked display case his greatgrandfathers henry rifle and colt peacemaker the browning shotgun that had brought down the bear the mossberg hed called his dove duster and the magnum hed preferred for handgun hunting it was a mans room with male scents of leather and wood and a whiff of tobacco from the cubans he liked to smoke the desk which hed had custommade was a lake of glossy wood a maze of drawers all hinged with polished brass nate sat behind it now fiddling with papers to give everyone present time to settle tess thought he looked as out of place as a beer keg at a church social the cowboy lawyer she thought with a quick twist of her lips duded up in his sunday best not that he wasnt appealing in a rough country son of fashion a young jimmy stewart she thought all arms and legs and quiet sexuality but big gangling men who wore boots with their gabardine werent her style and she just wanted to get this whole damn business over with and get back to la she rolled her eyes toward the snarling grizzly the shaggy head of a mountain goat the weapons that had hunted them down what a place she mused and what people besides the cowboy lawyer there was the skinny hennahaired housekeeper who sat in a straightbacked chair with her knobby knees tight together and modestly covered with a perfectly horrible black skirt then the noble savage with his heartbreakingly beautiful face his enigmatic eyes and the faint odor of horses that clung to him nervous lily tess thought continuing her survey with her hands pressed together like vises and her head lowered as if that would hide the bruises on her face lovely and fragile as a lost bird set down among vultures when tesss heart began to stir she deliberately turned her attention to willa cowgirl mercy she thought with a sniff sullen probably stupid and silent at least the woman looked better in jeans and flannel than she had in that baggy dress shed worn to the funeral in fact tess decided she made quite a picture sitting in the big leather chair her booted foot resting on her knee her oddly exotic face set like stone and since shed yet to see a single tear squeeze its way out of the dark eyes tess assumed willa had no more love for jack mercy than she herself did just business she thought tapping her fingers impatiently on the arm of her chair lets get down to it even as she had the thought nate lifted his eyes met hers for one uncomfonable moment she felt he knew exactly what was going through her mind and his disapproval of her of everything about her was as clear as the sky spread in the window behind him think what you want she decided and kept her eyes cool on his just give me the cash theres a couple ways we can do this nate began theres formal i can read jacks will word for word then explain what the hell all that legal talk means or i can give you the meaning the terms the options first deliberately he looked at willa she was the one who mattered most to him up to you do it the easy way nate all right then bess he left you a thousand dollars for every year youve been at mercy thats thirtyfour thousand thirtyfour thousand besss eyes popped wide good lord nate what am i supposed to do with a fat lot of money like that he smiled well you spend it bess if you want to invest some i can give you a hand with it goodness overwhelmed at the thought of it she looked at willa back at her hands and at nate again goodness and tess thought if the housekeeper gets thirty grand i ought to get double she knew just what shed do with a fat lot of money adam in accordance with an agreement jack made with your mother when they married youre to receive a lump sum of twenty thousand or a two percent interest in mercy ranch whichever you prefer i can tell you the percentage is worth more than the cash but the decision remains yours its not enough willas voice snapped out making lily jump and tess raise an eyebrow its not right two percent adams worked this ranch since he was eight years old hesþ willa from his position behind her chair adam laid a hand on her shoulder its right enough the hell it is fury for him the injustice of it had her shoving the hand away weve got one of the finest strings of horses in the state thats adams doing the horses should be his nowþand the house where he lives he should have been given land and the money to work it willa patient adam put his hand on her again held it there it s what our mother asked for its what he gave she subsided because there were strangerseyes watching and because she would fix the wrongness of it shed have nate draw up papers before the end of the day sorry she laid her hands calmly on the wide arms of the chair go on nate the ranch and its holdings nate began again the stock the equipment vehicles the timber rights he paused and prepared himself for the unhappy job of destroying hopes mercy ranch business is to continue as usual expenses drawn salaries paid profits banked or reinvested with you as operator will under the executors supervision for a period of one year wait willa held up a hand he wanted you to supervise the running of the ranch for a year under certain conditions nate added and his eyes were already full of apology if those conditions are met for the course of a year beginning no later than fourteen days from the reading of the will the ranch and all its holdings will become the sole property and sole interest of the beneficiaries what conditions willa demanded what beneficiaries what the hell is going on nate hes left each one of his daughters a onethird interest in the ranch he watched the color drain from willas face and cursing jack mercy continued with the rest in order to inherit the three of you must live on the ranch leaving the property for no longer than a oneweek period for one full year at the end of that time if conditions are met each beneficiary will have a onethird interest this interest cannot be sold or transferred to anyone other than one of the other beneficiaries for a period of ten years hold on a minute tess set her drink aside youre saying ive got a third interest in some cattle ranch in nowhere montana and to collect ive got to move here live here give up a year of my life no way in hell she rose gracefully unfolding her long legs i dont want your ranch kid she told willa youre welcome to every dusty acre and cow thisll never stick give me my share in cash and im out of your way excuse me ms mercy nate sized her up from his seat behind the desk mad as a twoheaded hen he thought and cool enough to hide it it will stick his terms and wishes were very well thought out very well presented if you dont agree to the terms the ranch will be donated in its entirety to the nature conservancy donated staggered willa pressed her fingers to her temple there was him and rage and a terrible dread curling and spreading inside her gut somehow she had to get beyond the feelings and think she understood the tenyear stipulation that was to keep the land from being taxassessed at the market price instead of the farm rate jack had hated the government like poison and wouldnt have wanted to give up a penny to it but to threaten to take it all away and give it to the type of organization he liked to call tree huggers or whale kissers didnt make sense if we dont do this she continued struggling for calm he can just give it away just give away whats been mercy land for more than a century if these two dont do what it says on that paper if i dont nate exhaled deeply hating himself im sorry willa there was no reasoning with him this is the way he set it up any one of the three of you leaves it breaks the conditions and the ranch is forfeited youll each get one hundred dollars thats it a hundred dollars the absurdity of it struck tess straight in the heart flopped her back into her chair laughing that son of a bitch shut up willas voice whipped out as she got to her feet just shut the hell up can we fight it nate is there any point in trying to fight it you want my legal opinion no itd take years and a lot of money and odds are youd lose ill stay lily fought to regulate her breathing home safety security it was all here just at her fingertips like a shiny gift im sorry she got to her feet when willa rounded on her its not fair to you its not right i dont know why he did this but ill stay when the years over ill sell you my share for whatever you say is fair and right its a beautiful ranch she added trying to smile as willa only continued to stare at her everyone here knows its already yours it s only a year after all thats very sweet tess spoke up but im damned if im staying here for a year im going back to la in the morning with her mind whirling willa sent her a considering look however much she wanted both of them gone she wanted the ranch more much more nate what happens if one of the three of us dies suddenly funny tess picked up her brandy again is that montana humor in the event one of the beneficiaries dies within the transitory year the remaining beneficiaries will be granted half shares of mercy ranch under the same conditions so what are you going to do kill me in my sleep bury me on the prairie tess flicked her fingers in dismissal you cant threaten me into staying here living like this maybe not willa thought but money talked to certain types of people i dont want you here i dont want either one of you but ill do what has to be done to keep this ranch miss hollywood might be interested to know just how much her dusty acres are worth nate at an estimate current market value for the land and buildings alone not including stock between eighteen and twenty million brandy slopped toward the rim of the snifter as tesss hand jerked jesus christ the outburst earned tess a hiss from bess and a sneer from willa i thought that would get through willa murmured whens the last time you earned six million in a year sis could i have some water lily managed and drew willas gaze sit down before you fall down she gave lily a careless nudge into a chair as she began to pace im going to want you to read the document word for word after all nate i want to get this all straight in my head she went to a lacquered liquor cabinet and did something shed never done when her father had been alive she opened his whiskey and drank it she drank quietly letting the slow burn move down her throat as she listened to nates recital and she forced herself not to think of all the years she had struggled so hard to earn her fathers love much less his respect his trust in the end he had lumped her in with the daughters hed never known because in the end she thought none of them had really mattered to him a name nate mumbled had her ears burning hold it hold just a damn minute did you say ben mckinnon nate shifted cleared his throat hed been hoping to slide that one by her for the time being shed had enough shocks for one day your father designated myself and ben to supervise the running of the ranch during the probationary year that chicken hawks going to be looking over my shoulder for a goddamn year dont you swear in this house will bess piped up ill swear the damn house down if i want why the hell did he pick mckinnon your father considered three rocks second only to mercy he wanted someone who knows the ins and outs of the business mckinnon can be mean as a snake nate remembered mercy saying and he wont take any shit off a damn woman neither of us will be looking over your shoulder nate soothed we have our own ranches to run this is just a minor detail bullshit but will reined it in does mckinnon know about this he wasnt at the funeral he had business in bozeman hell be back tonight or tomorrow and yes he knows had a hell of a laugh over it didnt he had nearly choked with laughter nate remembered but now he kept his own eyes sober this isnt joke will its business and temporary at that all you have to do is get through four seasons his lips curved thats what all of us have to do ill get through it god knows if these two will she studied her sisters shook her head what are you trembling about she asked lily youre facing millions of dollars not a firing squad for christs sake drink this she thrust the whiskey glass into lilys hand stop picking on her incensed instinctively moving to protect lily tess stepped between them im not picking on her and get out of my face im going to be in your face for a goddamn year get used to it then you better get used to how things run around here you stay youre not going to sit around on your plump little ass youre going to work at the plump little ass remark tess sucked air through her nose shed sweated and starved off every excess pound shed carried through high school and she was damn proud of the results remember this you flatchested knockkneed bitch i walk you lose and if you think im going to take orders from some ignorant little piefaced cowgirl youre a hell of a lot more stupid than you look youll do exactly what i say willa corrected or instead of having a nice cozy bed in this house youll be pitching a tent in the hills for the next year ive got as much right to be under this roof as you do maybe more since he married my mother first that just makes you older will tossed back and had the pleasure of seeing that nice shaft strike home and your mother was a bottleblonde showgirl with more tits than brains whatever tess would have done or said in retaliation was broken off when lily burst into tears happy now tess demanded and gave willa a hard shove stop tired of the sniping adam seared them both with a look you should both be ashamed of yourselves he bent down murmuring to lily as he helped her to her feet you want fresh air he said kindly and some food youll feel better then take her for a little walk bess told him and got creakily to her own feet her head was hammering like a threearmed carpenter ill put dinner on im ashamed enough for both of you she said to tess and willa i knew both of your ms theyd expect better of you she sniffed and with dignity turned to nate youre welcome to stay for dinner nate theres more than plenty thanks bess but he was getting the hell out while he still had all of his skin ive got to get on home he gathered his papers together keeping a wary eye on the two women who remained in the room scowling at each other im leaving three copies of all the documents any questions you know where to reach me if i dont hear from you ill check back in a couple days and see and see he ended he picked up his hat and his briefcase and left the field in control again willa took a cleansing breath ive put sweat and ive put blood into this ranch from the day i was born you dont give a damn about that and i dont care but im not losing whats mine you figure that puts me over a barrel but i know youre not walking away from more money than youve ever seen before or hoped to so that makes us even with a nod tess sat on the arm of a chair and crossed her silky legs so we define terms of our own for living through the next year you think its a snap for me to give up my home my friends my lifestyle for a year its not tess gave a quick sentimental thought to her apartment her club rodeo drive then she set her jaw but no im not walking away from whats mine either yours my ass tess merely inclined her head whether either one of us likes it and i doubt either one of us does im as much his daughter as you are i didnt grow up here because he tossed me and my mother aside thats fact and after being here for a day im beginning to be grateful for it but ill stick the year out thoughtfully willa picked up the whiskey lily hadnt touched ambition and greed were excellent motivators shed stick all right and at the end of it you can buy me out the image of all that money made her giddy or failing that you can send the checks for my share of profits to la which is where ill be one day after the year is up will sampled the whiskey again and reminded herself to concentrate on now can you ride ride what with a snons will drank figures probably dont know a hen from a cock either oh i know a cock when i see one tess drawled and was surprised to hear willa laugh people live here they work here thats another fact ive got enough to do handling the men and cattle without worrying with you so youll take your orders from bess you expect me to take orders from a housekeeper steel glittered in willas eyes youll take orders from the woman whos going to feed you tend your clothes and clean the house where youll be living and the first time you treat her like a servant will be the last time i promise you youre not in la now hollywood out here everybody pulls their weight i happen to have a career yeah writing movies there were probably less useful enterprises but willa couldnt think of any well therere twentyfour hours in a day youre going to figure that one out fast enough tired will wandered to the window behind the desk what the hell am i going to do with the little lost bird more like a crushed flower surprised at the compassion in the tone willa glanced back then shrugged did she say anything to you about the bruises i havent talked to her any more than you have tess struggled to push away the guilt noninvolvement she reminded herself this isnt exactly a family reunion shell tell adam sooner or later everyone tells adam what huns for now at least well leave the wounded lily to him fine im going back to la in the morning to pack one of the men will drive you to the airport dismissing tess willa turned back to the window do yourself a favor hollywood and buy some long underwear youll need it will rode out at dusk the sun was bleeding as it fell behind the western peaks turning the sky to a rich ripe red she needed to think to calm herself beneath her the appaloosa mare pranced and pulled on the bit okay moon lets both run it off with a jerk of the reins will changed directions then gave the eager mare her head they streaked away from the lights the buildings the sounds of the ranch and into the open land where the river curved they followed its banks riding east into the night where the first stars were already gleaming and the only sounds were the rush of water and the thunder of hooves cattle grazed and nighthawks circled as they topped a rise will could see mile after mile of silhouette and shadow trees spearing up the waving grass of a meadow the endless line of fence and in the distance in the clear night air the faint glint of lights from a neighboring ranch mckinnon land the mare tossed her head snoned when will reined in we didnt run it out did we no the anger was still simmering inside her just as the energy simmered inside her mount willa wanted it gone this tearing bitter fury and the grief that boiled under it it wouldnt help her get through the next year it wouldnt help her get through the next hour she thought and squeezed her eyes tight tears would not be shed she promised herself not for jack mercy or his youngest daughter she breathed deep drew in the scent of grass and night and horse it was control she needed now calculated unbending control she would find a way to handle the two sisters who had been pushed on her to keep them in line and on the ranch whatever it took she would make certain that they saw this through she would find a way to deal with the overseers who had been pushed on her nate was an irritant but not a particular problem she decided as she set moon into an easy walk he would do no more and no less than what he considered his legal duty which meant in willas opinion that he would stay out of the daytoday business of mercy ranch and play his pan in broad strokes she could even find it in her heart to feel sorry for him shed known him too long and too well to think even for an instant that he would enjoy the position hed been put in nate was fair honest and content to mind his own business ben mckinnon will thought and that bitter anger began to stir again that was a different matter she had no doubt that he would enjoy every minute hed push his nose in at every opportunity and shed have to take it but she thought with a grim smile she wouldnt have to take it well and she wouldnt have to make it easy for him oh she knew what jack mercy had been about and it made her blood boil she could feel the heat rise to her skin and all but steam off into the cool night air as she looked down at the lights and silhouettes of three rocks ranch mckinnon and mercy land had marched side by side for generations some years after the sioux had dealt with custer two men whod hunted the mountains and taken their stake to texas bought cattle on the cheap and drove them back nonh into montana as panners but the partnership had severed and each had claimed his own land his own cattle and built his own ranch so there had been mercy ranch and three rocks ranch each expanding prospering struggling surviving and jack mercy had lusted after mckinnon land land that couldnt be bought or stolen or finessed but it could be merged willa thought now if mercy and mckinnon lands were joined the result would be one of the largest certainly the most important ranches in the west all he had to do was sell his daughter what else was a female good for willa thought now trade her as you would a nice plump heifer put her in front of the bull often enough and nature would handle the rest so since hed had no son he was doing the next best thing he was putting his daughter in front of ben mckinnon and everyone would know it will thought as she forced her hands to relax on the reins he hadn t been able to work the deal while he lived so he was working the angles from the grave and if the daughter who had stood beside him her entire life had worked beside him had sweated and bled into the land wasnt lure enoughþwell he had two more goddamn you pa with unsteady hands she settled her hat back onto her head the ranch is mine and its going to stay mine damned if ill spread my legs for ben mckinnon or anyone else she caught the flash of headlights murmured to her mare to settle her she couldnt make out the vehicle but noted the direction a thin smile spread as she watched the lights veer toward the main house at three rocks back from bozeman is he instinctively she straightened in the saddle brought her chin up the air was clear enough that she heard the muffled slam of the trucks door the yapping greeting of dogs she wondered if he would look over and up on the rise he would see the dark shadow of horse and rider and she thought he would know who was watching from the border of his land well see what happens next mckinnon she murmured well see who runs mercy when its done a coyote sang out howling at the threequarter moon that rode the sky and she smiled again there were all kinds of coyotes she thought no matter how pretty they sang they were still scavengers she wasnt going to let any scavengers on her land turning her mount she rode home in the halflight he son of a bitch ben leaned on his saddle horn shaking his s head at nate his eyes shielded by the wide brim of a dark gray hat glittered cold green im sorry i missed his funeral my folks said it was quite the social event it was that nate slapped a hand absently against the black geldings flanks hed caught ben minutes before his friend was taking off for the high in nates opinion three rocks was one of the prettiest spreads in montana the main house itself was a fine example of both efficiency and aesthetics it wasnt a palace like mercy but an attractive timberframed dwelling with a sandstone foundation and varying rooflines that added interest with plenty of porches and decks for sitting and contemplating the the mckinnons ran a tidy place busy but without clutter he could hear the bovine protests from a corral calves being separated from their mamas for weaning didnt go happily the malesll be unhappier yet nate mused when theyre castrated and dehorned it was one of the reasons he preferred working horses i know youve got work to see to nate continued i dont want to hold you up but i figured i should come by and let you know where we stand yeah ben did have work on his mind october bumped into november and that shaky border before winter didnt last long right now the sun was shining over three rocks like an angel horses were cropping in the near pasture and the men were going about their duties in shinsleeves but drift fences needed to be checked small grains harvested the cattle that werent to be wintered over had to be culled out and shipped but his gaze skimmed over paddocks and pastures to the rise toward mercy land he imagined willa mercy had more than work on her mind this morning nothing against your lawyering skills nate but that legal bullshit isnt going to hold up is it the terms of the will are clear and very precise its still lawyer crap theyd known each other too long for nate to take offense she can fight it but itll be uphill and rough all the way ben looked southwest again pictured willa mercy shook his head he sat as comfortably in the saddle as another man would in an easy chair after thirty years of ranch life it was more his natural milieu he didnt have nates height but stood a level six feet his wiry build ropey with muscle his hair was a golden brown gilded by hours in the sun and left long enough to tease the collar of his chambray shin his eyes were as sharp as a hawks and often just as cold in a face that had the weathered craggy good looks of a man comfortable in the outofdoors a horizontal scar marred his chin a souvenir of his youth and a slip of the hand when hed been playing mumbletypeg with his brother ben ran his harld over the scar now an absentminded habitual gesture hed been amused when nate had first informed him of the will now that it was coming into effect it didnt seem quite so funny hows she taking it hard shit im sorry for that she loved that old bastard christ knows why he took off his hat raked his fingers through his hair adjusted it again and its got to stick in her craw that its me nate grinned well yeah but i think itd sit about the same with anybody no ben mused not quite he wondered if willa knew that her father had once offered him ten thousand acres of prime bottomland to marry his daughter like some son of fucking king ben thought now trying to merge kingdoms mercy would give it away he thought squinting into the sun hed give it away rather than ease his hold on the reins she doesnt need either one of us to run mercy ben said but ill do what it says to do and hell his grin spread slow arrogant and shifted the planes on his face itll be entertaining to have her butting heads with me every five minutes what are the other two like different thoughtful nate leaned back on the fender of his range rover the middle oneþthats lilyþshe spooks easy looks like shed jump out of her skin if you made a quick move her face was all bruised up she have an accident looked like shed accidentally run into somebodys fists shes got an exhusband and shes got a restraining order on him hes been yanked in a few times for wife battering fucker if there was one thing worse than a man who abused his horse it was a man who abused a woman she jumped on staying nate continued and in his quiet methodical way began to roll a cigarette i have to figure shes looking at it as a good place to hide out the older one shes slicker hails out of la italian suit gold watch he slipped the pouch of drum back in his pocket struck a match she writes movies and is royally pissed at the idea of being stuck out in the wilderness for a year but she wants the money itll bring her shes on her way back to california to pack up she and will ought to get along like a couple of shecats theyve already been at each other nate blew out smoke contemplatively have to admit it was entertaining to watch adam simmered them down hes about the only one who can simmer willa down with a creak of leather ben shifted in the saddle spook was growing restless under him signaling his wishes to be off with quick head tosses ill be talking to her ive got to check on a crew we sent up to the high country were getting some storms moms got coffee on at the main house thanks but ive got to get back ive got work of my own see you in a day or two yeah ben called to his dog watching as nate climbed into his range rover nateþwere not going to let her lose that ranch nate adjusted his hat reached for his keys no ben were not going to let her lose it it was a good ride across the valley and up into the foothills ben took it at an easy pace scanning the land as he went the cattle were fat theyd be cutting out some of the angus for finishing in feedlots before winter others they would rotate from pasture to pasture hold over for another year the choices and the selling had been his province for nearly five years as his parents were gradually turning over the operation of three rocks to their sons the grass was high and still green glowing against the paintbrush backdrop of trees he heard the drone overhead and looked up with a grin his brother zack was doing a flyover ben lifted the hat off his head waved it charlie the longhaired border collie raced in barking circles the little plane tilted its wings in a salute it was still hard for him to think of his baby brother as a husband and a father but there you were zack had taken one look at shelly peterson and had fallen spurs over stetson less than two years later theyd made him an uncle and ben thought made him feel incredibly old it was beginning to feel as though there were thirty rather than three years separating him and zack he adjusted his hat and guided his horse uphill through a stand of yellow pine the air freshened and cooled he saw signs of deer and another time might have given in to the urge to follow the tracks to bring fresh venison home to his mother charlie was sniffing hopefully at the ground glancing back now and then for permission to flush game but ben wasnt in the mood for a hunt he could smell snow he was still far below the snow line but he could smell it teasing the air already hed seen flocks of canadian geese heading south winter was coming early and he thought it would come hard even the rush of water from the creek spurting downhill sounded cold as the trees thickened the ground roughened he followed the water the forest was as familiar to him as his own barnyard there the dead larch where he and zack had once dug for buried treasure and there in that little clearing he had brought down his first buck with his father standing beside him theyd fished here plucking trout from the water as easily as plucking berries from a bush on those rocks hed once written the name of his love in flint the words had faded and washed away with the years and pretty susie boline had run off to helena with a guitar player breaking bens eighteenyearold heart the recollection still brought him a tug though hed have suffered torments of hell before admitting he was a sentimental man he rode past the rocks and the memories and climbed keeping to the beaten path through trees as lively with color as women at a saturday night dance as the air thinned and chilled and the scent of snow grew stronger he whistled between his teeth his time in bozeman had been productive but it had made him yearn for this the space the solitude the land though hed told himself hed brought a bedroll only as a precaution he was already planning on camping for a night maybe two he could shoot himself a rabbit fry up some fish maybe hang with the crew for the night or camp pan theyd drive the cattle down to the low country this much snow in the air could mean an early blizzard and disaster for a herd grazing in the high mountain meadows but ben thought they had time yet he paused a moment just to look out over a pretty ridgetop meadow dotted with cows bordered by a tumbling river to enjoy the wave of autumn wildflowers the call of birds he wondered how anyone could prefer the choked streets of a city the buildings crowded with people and problems to this the crack of gunfire made his horse shy and cleared his own mind of dreamy thoughts though it was a country where the snap of a bullet usually meant game coming down his eyes narrowed at the next shot he automatically turned his horse in the direction of the sound and kicked him into a trot he saw the horse first wills appaloosa was still quivering her reins looped over a branch blood had a high sweet smell and scenting it ben felt his stomach clutch then he saw her holding the shotgun in her hands not ten feet away from a downed grizzly a growl in his throat the dog streaked ahead coming to a quivering halt at bens sharp order ben waited until shed glanced over her shoulder at him before he slid out of the saddle her face was pale he noted her eyes dark is he all the way dead yeah she swallowed hard she hated to kill hated to see blood spilled even seeing a hen plucked for dinner could cause her gorge to rise i didnt have any choice he charged ben merely nodded and taking his rifle out of its sheath approached big bastard he didnt want to think what would have happened if her aim had been off what a bear that size could have done to a horse and rider shebear he said keeping his voice mild probably has cubs around here willa slapped her shotgun back in its holder i figured that out for myself want me to dress her out i know how to dress game ben merely nodded and went back for his knife ill give you a hand anyway its a big bear sorry about your father willa she took out her own knife the keenedged bowie a near mate to bens you hated him you didnt so im sorry he went to work on the bear avoiding the blood and gore when he could accepting it when he couldnt nate stopped by this morning i bet he did blood steamed in the chilly air charlie snacked delicately on entrails and thumped his tail ben looked over the carcass of the bear and into her eyes you want to be pissed at me go ahead i didnt write the damn will but ill do what has to be done first thing is im going to ask you what youre doing riding up here alone same thing as you i imagine ive got men up in the high country and cattle that need to come down i can run my business as well as you can run yours ben he waited a moment hoping shed say more hed always been fascinated by her voice it was rusty always sounding as though it needed the sleep cleared out of it more than once ben had thought it a damn shame that such a contrary woman had that straight sex voice in her well weve got a year to find that out dont we when that didnt jiggle a response out of her he ran his tongue over his teeth you going to mount this head no men need trophies they can point to and brag on i dont he grinned then we sure do like them you might make a nice trophy yourself you re a pretty thing willa i believe thats the first time ive said that to a woman over bear guts she recognized his warped way of being charming and refused to be drawn in over the last couple of years refusing to be drawn to ben mckinnon had taken on the proportions of a second career i dont need your help with the bear or the ranch youve got it on both counts we can do it peaceable or we can do it adversarial he gave charlie an absent pat when the dog sat down beside him dont matter much to me either way there were shadows under her eyes he noted like smudged fingerprints against the golden skin and her mouth which hed always found particularly appealing was set in a hard thin line he preferred it snarlingþand figured he knew how to bring that about are your sisters as pretty as you when she didnt answer his lips twitched bet theyre friendlier ill have to come calling see for myself why dont you invite me to supper will and we can sit ourselves down and discuss plans for the ranch now her eyes flashed up to his and he grinned hugely thought that would do it christ almighty youve got a face and nothing suits it better than pure orneriness she didnt want him to tell her she was pretty if thats what he was doing it always made her insides fumble around why dont you save your breath for getting this carcass up to bleed out rocking back on his heels he studied her we can get this whole thing over quick just get ourselves married and be done with it though her hand clenched on the bloody knife she took three slow easy breaths oh he was riding her and she knew hed like nothing better than to watch her scream and shout and stomp her feet instead she angled her head and her voice was as cool as the water in the nearby stream theres about as much chance of that as there is of whats left of this bear rearing up and biting you on the ass he rose as she did circled her wrist with his fingers and ignored her quick jolt of protest i dont want you any more than you want me i just thought it would be easy on everybody if we got it out of the way lifes long willa he said more gently a year isnt much sometimes a days too much let go of me ben her gaze lifted slowly a man who hesitates to listen to a woman with a knife in her hand deserves whatever he gets he could have had the knife out of her hand in three seconds flat but he decided to leave it where it was youd like to stick me wouldnt you the fact that he knew it to be true both aroused and irritated him but then she usually managed to do both get it through your head i dont want whats yours and i dont plan on being bartered for more land and more cattle any more than you do she went pale at that and he nodded we know where we stand will could be ill find one of your sisters to my taste but meanwhile its just business the humiliation of it was as raw as the blood on her hands you son of a bitch he shifted his grip to her knife hand just in case i love you too sweetheart now ill hang the bear you go wash up i shot it i canþ a woman who hesitates to listen to a man with a knife in his hand deserves what she gets he smiled again slow and easy why dont we try to make this business go down smooth for both of us it cant all the passion and frustration that whirled inside her echoed in the two words you know it cant how would you take it if you were standing where i am im not he said simply go wash the blood off weve got a ways to ride yet today he let her go crouched again knowing she was standing over him fighting to regain control he didnt fully relax until shed stomped off toward the stream with his dog happily at her heels blowing out a breath he looked down at the exposed fangs shed rather a bite from you than a kind word from me he muttered goddamn women while he finished the gruesome task he admitted to himself that hed lied he did want her the puzzle of it was the less he wanted to the more he did it was nearly an hour before she spoke again they wore sheepskin jackets now against the cold and wind and the horses were plodding through nearly a foot of snow with charlie happily blazing the trail you take half the bear meat its only right willa said im obliged being obliged is the problem isnt it neither of us wants to be he understood her he thought better than she might like sometimes you have to swallow what you cant spit out and sometimes you choke one of the wounds in her heart split open he left adam next to nothing ben studied her profile jack drew a hard line and adam wolfchild wasnt blood ben thought that would have been uppermost in jacks mind adam should have more will have more she promised herself im not going to disagree with you when it comes to adam but if i know anyone who can take care of himself and make his own its your brother hes all ive got left she nearly said it before she caught herself before she remembered it would be a mistake to open any part of her heart to ben hows zack i saw his plane this morning checking fences id have to say hes happy the way he goes around grinning like a fool day and night he and shelly dote on that baby they all did ben thought but he wasnt going to mention the fact that he couldnt keep his hands off his infant niece shes a pretty baby its still hard to see zack mckinnon settling down to family life shelly knows when to yank his reins unable to resist ben grinned at her youre not still carrying a torch for my baby brother are you will amused she shifted and smiled sweetly there had been a brief time when they were teenagers that she and zack had made calfs eyes at each other every time i think of him my heart goes pittypat once a womans been kissed by zack mckinnon shes spoiled for anyone else honey he reached over flipped her braid behind her back thats because ive never kissed you id sooner kiss a twotailed skunk laughing he shifted his horse just enough so that his knee bumped willas zackd be the first to tell you i taught him everything he knows maybe so but i think i can live without either one of the mckinnon boys she jerked a shoulder then turned her head slightly smoke there was relief in that in the sign of people and the near end of her solitary ride with ben the crews probably in the cabin its dinnertime with another woman any other woman ben thought he could have reached over pulled her close and kissed her breathless just on principle since it was willa he eased back in the saddle and kept his hands to himself i could eat im going to want to round up the herd get them down more snow s coming she only grunted she could smell it but there was something else in the air at first she wondered if it was the sensory echo from the bear and the blood on her hands but it lingered seemed to grow stronger somethings dead she murmured what somethings dead she straightened in the saddle scanned the ridges and trees it was dead quiet dead still cant you smell it no but he didnt doubt she could and he turned his horse as she did already on the scent charlie was moving ahead its the indian in you one of the hands probably shot dinner it made sense they would have brought provisions and the cabin was always stocked but fresh game was hard to resist still that didnt explain the dread in her stomach or the chill along her spine there was the scream of an eagle overhead the wild soulstirring echo of it then the utter silence of the mountains the sun glittered off the snow blinding following instinct willa left the rough path and walked her horse over broken uneven ground we dont have a lot of time for detours ben reminded her then go on he swore reaching around to check that his rifle was within easy reach there were bear here too and cougar he thought of camp hardly more than ten minutes away and the hot coffee that would be boiling to mud on the stove then he saw it his nose might not have been as sharp as hers but his eyes were blood was splattered and pooled over the snow splashed against rock the black hide of the steer was coated with it the dog stopped circling the mangled steer and raced back to the horses well shit ben was already dismounting made a mess of it wolves it was more than the market price to willa it was the waste the cruelty he started to agree then stopped short a wolf didnt kill then leave the meat a wolf didnt hack and slice no predator but one did a man willa drew a sharp breath as she stepped closer saw the damage the throat had been slit the belly disemboweled charlie pressed against her legs shivering its been butchered mutilated she crouched and thought of the bear no choice there but to kill and the field dressing had been done efficiently with the tools at hand but thisþthis was wild and vicious and without purpose almost within sight of the cabin she said the bloods frozen it was probably done hours ago before sunup its one of yours ben told her after checking the brand doesnt matter whose but she noted the number on the yellow ear tag the death would have to be recorded she rose and stared over at the stream of smoke rising it matters why have you lost any cattle this way no he straightened to stand beside her have you not until now i cant believe its one of my men she took a shallow breath or yours there must be someone else camping up here maybe he was frowning down at the ground they stood shoulder to shoulder now linked by the waste at their feet she didnt jerk away when he ran a hand down her braid or when he laid that hand companionably on her arm we had more snow a lot of wind the ground s pretty trampled up but it looks like some tracks heading north ill take some men and check it out its my cow he shifted his eyes to hers it doesnt matter whose he repeated we have to get both herds rounded up and down the mountain and we have to report this i figure i can count on you for that she opened her mouth closed it again he was right she was next to useless at tracking but she could organize a drive with a nod she turned back to her horse ill talk to my men will now he laid a hand over hers leather against leather before she could mount watch yourself she vaulted into the saddle theyre my men she said simply and rode toward the rising smoke she found her men about to have their midday meal when she came into the cabin pickles was at the little stove sturdy legs spread ample belly spilling over the wide buckle of his belt he was barely forty and balding fast compensating for it with a gingercolored mustache that grew longer every year hed earned his name from his obsessive love of dill pickles and his personality was just as sour when he saw willa he grunted in greeting sniffed and turned back to the ham he was frying jim brewster sat with his booted feet on the table enjoying the last of a marlboro he was just into his thirties with a face pretty enough for framing two dimples winked in his cheeks and dark hair waved to his collar he beamed at willa and sent her a cocky wink that made his blue eyes twinkle got us company for dinner pickles pickles gave another sour grunt belched and flipped his ham barely enough meat for two as it is get your lazy ass up and open some beans snows coming willa tossed her coat over a hook and headed for the radio anther week easy she turned her head met pickless sulky brown eyes i dont think so well start rounding up today she waited holding his gaze he hated taking his orders from a female and they both knew it your cattle he muttered and turned the ham out onto a platter yes they are and one of thems been butchered a quarter mile east of here butchered jim paused in the act of handing pickles an open can of beans cougar not unless cats are carrying knives these days someone opened one up hacked it to pieces and left it bullshit eyes narrowed pickles took a step forward thats just shit will weve lost a couple to cougar jim and me tracked a cat just yesterday she must circled around and got another cow thats all i know the difference between claws and a knife she inclined her head go look for yourself dead east about a quarter mile damned if i wont pickles stomped over for his coat muttering about women sure it couldnt have been a cat jim asked the minute the door slammed yeah im sure get me some coffee would you jim im going to radio the ranch i want ham to know were heading down mckinnons men are up here butþ no she shook her head pulled out a chair no cowboy i know does that she contacted the ranch listening to static waiting for it to clear the coffee and the crackling fire chased the worst of the chill away as she made arrangements for the drive she was on her second cup when she finished passing the information along to the mckinnon ranch pickles slammed back in son of a bitching bastard accepting this as the only apology shed get willa moved to the stove and filled her plate i rode up with ben mckinnon hes following some tracks were going to help get his herd down with our own has either of you seen anyone around here campers hunters eastern assholes came across a campsite yesterday when we were tracking the cat jim sat again with his plate but it was cold two or three days cold left goddamn beer cans pickles ate standing up like it was their own backyard oughta be shot for it sure that cow wasnt shot jim looked to pickles for confirmation a fact that willa struggled not to resent you know how some of those city boys areþshoot at anything that moves wasnt shot aint no tourist done that pickles shoved beans into his mouth fucking teenagers what it is fucking crazy teenagers all doped up maybe if it was benll find them easy enough but she didnt think it had been teenagers it seemed to willa it took a lot more years to work up that kind of rage jim pushed the barely warm beans around on his plate ah we heard about how things are he cleared his throat we radioed in last night and ham he figured he should you know tell us how things are she pushed her plate away and stood then ill tell you just how things are her voice was very cool very quiet mercy ranch runs the way it always has the old mans in the ground and now im operator you take your orders from me jim exchanged a quick look with pickles then scratched his cheek i didnt mean to say different will we were just sorta wondering how you were going to keep the others your sisters on the ranch theyll take their orders from me too she jerked her coat off the hook now if youve finished your meal lets get saddled up goddamn women pickles muttered as soon as the door was safely closed behind her dont know one that isnt a bossy bitch thats cause you dont know enough women jim strolled over for his coat and that one is the boss for the time being shes the boss today jim shrugged into his coat pulled out his gloves and todays what weve got tn dealings with her motherþand tess always thought of contacts i with louella as dealingsþtess prepped herself with a dose of extrastrength excedrin there would be a headache she knew so why chase the pain she chose midmorning knowing it was the only time of day she would be likely to find louella at home in her bel air condo by noon she would be out and about having her hair done or her nails indulging in a facial or a shopping spree by four louella would be at her club louellas joking with the bartender or regaling the waitresses with tales of her life and loves as a vegas showgirl tess did her very best to avoid louellas though the condo didnt make her much happier it was a lovely little stucco in california spanish with a tiled roof graceful shrubbery it could and should have been a small showplace but as tess had said on more than one occasion louella mercy could make buckingham palace tacky when she arrived promptly at eleven she tried to ignore what louella cheerfully called her lawn art the lawn jockey with the big stupid grin the rearing plaster lions the glowing blue moonball on its concrete pedestal and the fountain of the serenefaced girl pouring water from the mouth of a rather startledlooking carp flowers grew in profusion in wild clashing colors that seared the eyes there was no rhyme or reason to the arrangement no plot or plan whatever plants caught louellas eye had been plunked down wherever louellas whim had dictated and tess mused she had a lot of whims standing amid a bed of scarlet and orange impatiens was the newest addition the headless torso of the goddess nike tess shook her head and rang the bell that played the first bumpandgrind bars of the stripper louella opened the door herself and enfolded her daughter in draping silks heavy perfume and the candy scent of discount cosmetics louella never stepped beyond her own bedroom door in less than full makeup she was a tall woman lushly built with milelong legs that still couldþ and didþexecute a high kick the natural color of her hair had been forgotten long ago it had been blond for years as brassy a tone as louellas huge laugh and worn big in a teased and lacquered style admired by tv evangelists she had a striking face despite the troweledon layers of base and powder and blush with strong bones and full lips slicked now with highgloss red her eyes were baby blue as was the shadow that decorated their lids with the brows above them mercilessly plucked and stenciled into dark thin brackets as always tess was struck with conflicting waves of love and puzzlement mom her lips curved as she returned the embrace and her eyes rolled as the two yapping pomeranians her mother adored set up an earpiercing din in their excitement at having company back from the wild west are you louellas east texas twang had the resonance of plucked banjo strings she kissed tess on the cheek then rubbed away the smear of lipstick with a spitdampened finger well come tell me all about it they sent the old bastard off in proper style i hope it was interesting ill bet lets have us some coffee honey its carmines morning off so well have to fend for ourselves ill make it she preferred brewing the coffee herself to facing her mothers studly houseboy tess tried not to imagine what other services the man provided louella she moved through the living area decorated in scarlets and golds into a kitchen so white it was like being snowblinded as usual there wasnt a crumb out of place whatever else carmine did during his daily duties he was tidy as a nun got some coffee cake around here too im hungry as a bear with her dogs scrambling around her feet louella rummaged in cupboards through the refrigerator within minutes there was chaos tesss lips twitched again chaos followed her mother around as faithfully as the yapping mimi and maurice did you meet your kin out there if you mean the half sisters yes with trepidation tess eyed the coffee cake her mother had unearthed louella was slicing it into huge slabs with a steak knife being transferred to a plate decorated with gargantuan roses were approximately ten billion calories well what are they like with the same generous hand louella cut a piece for her dogs setting the china plate on the floor the dogs bolted cake and snarled at each other the one from wife number two is quiet nervous thats the one with the ex who likes to use his fists clucking her tongue louella slid her ample hips onto the counter stool poor thing one of my girls had that kind of trouble husband would as soon beat the shit out of her as wink we finally got her into a shelter shes living up in seattle now sends me a card now and again tess made a small sound of interest her mothers girls were anyone who worked for her from the waitresses to the bartenders the strippers to the kitchen help louella embraced them all lending money giving advice tess had always thought louellas was part club part halfway house for topless dancers how about the other one louella asked as she attacked her coffee cake the one thats part indian oh that ones a real cowgirl tough as leather striding around in dirty boots i imagine she can punch cattle literally amused at the thought tess poured out coffee she didnt trouble to hide the fact that she didnt want either of us there with a shrug she sat down and began to pick at her cake shes got a half brother yeah i knew about that i knew mary wolfchildþat least id seen her around she was one beautiful woman and that little boy of hers sweet face angel face hes grown up now and hes still got the angel face he lives on the ranch works with horses or something his father was a wrangler as i recall louella reached in the pocket of her scarlet robe found a pack of virginia slims how about bess she let out smoke and a big lusty laugh christ that was a woman had to watch myps and qs around her had to admire herþshe ran that house like a top and didnt take any crap off jack either shes still running the house as far as i could tell hell of a house hell of a ranch louellas brightred lips curved at the memory hell of a country though i cant say im sorry i only spent one winter there goddamn snow up to your armpits why did you marry him when louella arched a brow tess shifted uncomfortably i know i never asked before but im asking now id like to know why its a simple question with a simple answer louella poured an avalanche of sugar into her coffee he was the sexiest son of a bitch id ever seen those eyes of his the way they could look right through you the way hed cock his head and smile like he knew just what hed be up to later and wanted to take you along she remembered it all perfectly the smells of sweat and whiskey the lights dazzling her eyes and the way jack mercy had swaggered into the nightclub when shed been on stage in little more than feathers and a twentypound headdress the way hed puffed on a big cigar and watched her somehow shed expected that hed be waiting for her after the last show and shed gone with him without a thought from casino to casino drinking gambling wearing his stetson perched on her head within fortyeight hours shed stood with him in one of those assemblyline chapels with canned music and plastic flowers and shed had a gold ring on her finger it was hardly a surprise that the ring had stayed put for less than two years trouble was we didnt know each other it was hot pants and gambling fever philosophically louella crushed out her cigarette on her empty plate i wasnt cut out for life on a goddamn cattle ranch in montana maybe i couldve made a go of itþwho knows i loved him tess swallowed cake before it stuck in her throat you loved him for a while i did with the ease of years and distance louella shrugged a woman couldnt love jack for long unless she was missing brain cells but for a while i loved him and i got you out of it and a hundred large i wouldnt have my girl and i wouldnt have my club if jack mercy hadnt walked in that night and taken a shine to me so i owe him you owe the man who kicked you and his own daughter out of his life cut you off with a lousy hundred thousand dollars a hundred k went a lot farther thirty years ago than it does today louella had learned to be a mother and a businesswoman from the ground up she was proud of both and from where im sitting i got a pretty good deal mercy ranch is worth twenty million do you still think you got a good deal louella pursed her lips it was his ranch honey i just visited there for a while long enough to make a baby and get the boot i wanted the baby mom most of tesss anger faded at the words but the injustice of it remained hot in her heart you had a right to more i had a right to more maybe maybe not but that was the deal at the time louella lit another cigarette decided to be late for her afternoon session at the beauty parlor there was more here she thought time goes on jack ended up making three daughters and now hes dead you want to tell me what he left you a problem tess took the cigarette from louellas hand and indulged in a quick drag smoking was a habit she didnt approve ofþwhat sensible person did but it was either that or the several million calories still on her plate i get a third of the ranch a third of theþgood jesus and little fishes tess honey thats a fortune louella bounced up she might have been five ten and a generous onefifty but shed been trained as a dancer and could move when she had to she moved now skimming around the counter to crush her daughters ribs in an enthusiastic hug what are we doing sitting here drinking coffee we need ourselves some french champagne carmines got some stashed somewhere wait mom wait as louella tore into the fridge again tess tugged on her robe its not that simple my daughter the millionaire the cattle baron louella popped the cork spewing champagne fucking a i have to live there for a year tess blew out a breath as louella cheerfully clamped her mouth over the lip of the bottle and sucked up bubbles all three of us have to live there for a year together or we dont get zip louella licked champagne from her lips you have to live in montana for a year on the ranch her voice began to shake with the cows you with the cows thats the deal me and the other two together one hand still holding the bottle the other braced on the counter louella began to laugh she laughed so hard so long that tears streamed down her face running with maybelline mascara and loreal ivory base jesus h christ the son of a bitch always could make me laugh im glad you think its so funny tesss voice cracked like ice you can chuckle over it nightly while im out in bumfuck watching the grass grow with a flourish louella poured champagne into the coffee cups honey you can always spit in his eye and go on just as you are and give up several million in assets i dont think so no louella sobered as she studied her daughter this mystery she had somehow given birth to so pretty she mused so cool so sure of herself no you wouldnt youre too much your fathers daughter for that youll do the time tess and she wondered if her daughter would get more out of it than a third interest in a cattle ranch would the year soften the edges louella wondered or hone them she lifted both cups handed one to tess when do you leave first thing in the morning she sighed loud and long ive got to go buy some goddamn boots she muttered then with a small smile toasted herself what the hell its only a year while tess was drinking champagne in her mother s kitchen lily was standing at the edge of a pasture watching horses graze shed never seen anything more beautiful than the way the wind blew through their manes the way the mountains rose behind all blue and white for the first time in months she had slept through the night without pills without nightmares lulled by the quiet it was quiet now she could hear the grind of machinery in the distance just a hum in the air shed heard willa talking to someone that morning about harvesting grain but she had wanted to stay out of the way she could be alone here with the horses bothering no one with no one bothering her for three days shed been left to her own devices no one said anything when she wandered the house or went out to explore the ranch the men would tip their hats to her if they passed by and she imagined there were comments and murmurings but she didnt care about that the air here was sweet to the taste wherever she stood it seemed she could see something beautifulþwater rushing over rocks in a stream the flash of a bird in the forest deer bounding across the road she thought a year of this would be paradise adam stood for a moment the bucket in his hand watching her she came out here every day he knew hed seen her wander away from the house the barn the paddocks and head for this pasture she would stand by the fence very still very quiet very alone hed waited believing she needed to be alone healing was often a solitary matter but he also believed she needed a friend so now he walked toward her careful to make enough noise so that she wouldnt be startled when she turned her smile came slow and hesitant but it came im sorry im not in the way here am i youre not in anyones way because she was already learning to be relaxed around him she shifted her gaze back to the horses i love looking at them you can have a closer look he didnt need the bucket of grain to lure f the horses to the fence any of them would come for him at a quiet handed the bucket to lily just give it a shake did then watched delighted as several pairs of ears perked up trotted over to crowd at the fence without thinking she dipped into the grain and fed a pretty buckskin mare youve been around horses before adams comment she pulled her hand back im sorry i should have before i fed her all right he was sorry to have startled that smile away from her hat quick light that had come into eyes that were somewhere between nd blue like lake water he thought caught in the shadows of sun ome along molly her name the roan mare pranced along the fence toward the gate r led her into a corral and slipped a bridle over her head conscious again lily wiped grain dust on her jeans took one hesiep closer her names molly ps he kept his eyes on the horse giving lily a chance to settle again res prettyes a good saddle horse kind her gaits a bit rough but she tries you girl can you ride western lily þwhat you probably learned on english keeping it light adam spread the t hed brought along over mollys back nate keeps some english f youd rather we can borrow a saddle from him hands reached for each other as they did when her nerves jitteredi understand you want to ride dont you he slid one of willas old saddles onto s back i thought wed go up in the hills a little way might see some found herself caught between yearning and fear i havent ridden s been a long time you dont forget how adam estimated the length of her legs and ad i the stirrups accordingly you can go alone once you know your way he turned then noting the way she kept glancing back toward the house as if gauging the distance you dont have to be afraid of me believed him that was what she was afraid ofþthat it was so easy to believe him how often had she believed jesse that was done she reminded herself that was over her life could again if shed let it id like to go for a little while if youre sure its all right why wouldnt it be he moved toward her stopping instinctively before she shied again you dont have to worry about willa she has a good heart and a generous one its just hurting right now i know shes upset she has every right to be unable to resist lily lifted a hand to stroke mollys cheek even more upset since they found that poor cow i dont understand who would do something like that shes so angry and shes so busy shes always got something to do and im well im just here do you want something to do with the horse between them it was easy to smile not if it involves castrating cows i could hear them this morning she shuddered then managed to laugh at herself i got out of the house before bess could make me eat breakfast i dont think id have held it down for long its just one of the things you get used to i dont think so lily exhaled barely noticing how close her hand was to adams on the mares head willas natural with all of it shes so sure and confident i envy that that knowing just who you are to her im just a nuisance which is why i havent been able to work up the courage to talk to her to ask if theres something i could do around here to help you dont have to be afraid of her either he brushed his fingertips against hers continuing to stroke the mare even when lilys hand slid out of reach but meanwhile you could ask me i can use some help with the horses he added when she only stared at him you want me to help you with the horses its a lot of work more when winter gets here knowing hed planted the seed he stepped back think about it then he cupped his hands smiled again ill give you a leg up you can walk her around the corral get acquainted while i saddle up her throat was closed so that she had to swallow hard to clear it you dont even know me i figure well get acquainted too he stood as he was hands linked in a cup his eyes patient on hers you just have to put your foot in my hands lily not your life feeling foolish she grabbed the saddle horn and let him boost her into the saddle she looked down at him her eyes solemn in her battered face adam my life is a mess he only nodded as he checked her stirrups youll have to start tidying it up he rested a hand on her ankle a moment wanting her to grow easy to his touch but today you just have to take a ride into the hills the little bitch letting that halfbreed paw her sniveling little whore thought she could get rid of jesse cooke figured she could run and wouldnt catch her put the cops on his ass she was going to pay for that jesse stared through the field glasses while little bubbles of fury burst in his blood he wondered if the halfbreed horse wrangler had already gotten her on her back well the bastard would pay too lily was jesse cookes if e and he was going to be reminding her of that soon enough stupid little cunt thought she was real clever hightailing it to montana it the day jesse cooke couldnt outwit a woman was the day the sun didnt in the east iled known she wouldnt make a move without contacting her dear old ma so hed just camped himself within sight of the pretty house in virginia and every morning hed gotten to the mail and checked through it for letter from lily persistence had paid off the letter had come as hed known it would hed taken it back to the motel room steamed it open oh jesse cooke was roodys fool hed read it seen where she was going what she was up to going to cash in on an inheritance he thought bitterly and cut her own sband out of his share of the pie not in this lifetime jesse mused the minute the letter had been resealed and put back in the box hed aded for montana and had gotten there he thought now two full days fore his idiot wife long enough for a man as smart as jesse cooke to get lay of the land and get himself a job on three rocks a miserable fucking job he thought now keeping machines in repair well he knew his way around engines and there was always a rig that eded finetuning when he wasnt doing that they had him out checking ces day and night but that came in handy damn handy like now a man out riding in a urwheel to check fences could take a little detour and check out what else as going on and he saw plenty jesse rubbed his fingers over the mustache hed grown and dyed likes hair medium brown just a precaution he thought just a temporary disasse in case lily blabbed about him if she did theyd have their eye out a cleanshaven man with blond hair he had let his hair grow too and uld keep on letting it grow like a fucking pansy he thought resenting lp necessity of giving up his severe marine corps crew cut it would all be worth it in the end when he had lily back when he rended her who was boss who was in charge until that happy day he would stay close and he would watch you have a good time bitch jesse muttered his eyes narrowing beind the highpowered lenses as lily walked her mount beside adams rayback times coming most of the day had died out of the sky by the time willa got back to the ranch house dehorning and castrating cattle was a messy miserable job and a tedious one she knew she was pushing herself and knew she would continue to push she wanted the men to see her at every angle at every job shifting operators under the best of circumstances could be a rough transition and these were far from the best of circumstances which is why shed been on hand when a herd of elk had trampled through a fence creating havoc and why shed personally headed the crew to chase them off again to repair the fence now with the work done for the day and the hands settling down for supper and cards in the bunkhouse she wanted nothing more than a hot bath and a hot meal she was halfway up the steps to get the first when the knock sounded on the door knowing that bess was likely in the kitchen willa stomped back down to answer she greeted ben with a scowl what do you want a cold beer would go down good this isnt a saloon but she swung away from the door and into the living room to the cold box behind the bar make it fast ben i havent had my supper neither have i he took the bottle she handed him but i dont expect im going to get an invitation im not in the mood for company ive never known you to be in the mood for company he tipped back the beer and drank deep i havent seen you since we were up in the high country thought i should let you know i didnt find anything trail died out on me id have to say whoever was up there knew his way around tracking she took a beer for herself and since her feet were aching dropped down beside ben on the sofa pickles thinks it was kids doped up and crazy and you i didnt she moved a shoulder now that sounds like the best explanation maybe theres not much use going back up weve got the cattle down is your sister back from la willa stopped rolling her head to loosen her shoulders and frowned at him youre awfully interested in mercy business mckinnon thats part of my job now he liked reminding her of it just as he liked looking at her with her hair falling out of her braid and her boots propped beside his have you heard from her shell be here tomorrow so if that concludes your prying into my business you canþ going to introduce me to please himself he reached out to toy with her hair maybe ill take a shine to her and keep her occupied and out of your way for a while she knocked his hand aside but he only brought it back do women always fall at your feet all but you darling and thats just because i havent found the right way to tip your balance he skimmed a fingertip down her cheek watched her eyes narrow but im working on it what about the other one the other what willa wanted to shift over a couple of inches but she knew it would make her look like a fool the other sister shes around somewhere he smiled slowly im making you nervous isnt that interesting your ego needs pruning again but she started to rise he stopped her with a hand on her shoulder well well he murmured feeling her vibrate under his hand it looks like i havent been paying close enough attention come here she concentrated on evening her breathing slowly changed her grip on the beer she held oh he looks so arrogant she thought so cocky so sure ill melt if he bothers to push the right button you want me to come there she purred watching his eyes widen slightly in surprise at the warm tone and whatll happen if i do he might have called himself a foolþif thered been any blood left in his head to allow him to think but all he could do at that moment was feel the gradual simmer of lust set off by that husky voice id say its long past time we found out he curled his fingers into her shirt tightened his grip and pulled her against him if his gaze hadnt drifted down from hers to lock onto her mouth he would have seen it coming instead he found himself an inch away from that mouth and soaked from the beer she dumped over his head youre such a jerk ben pleased with herself she leaned forward to set the empty bottle on the table you think i could live on a ranch surrounded by randy men all my life and not see a move like that a mile off slowly he dragged a hand through his wet hair guess not but then againþ he moved fast when she found herself trapped under him willa thought even a snake rattles before he strikes now she could only be disgusted with herself for being pressed into the couch by a wiry male with blood in his eye you didnt see that coming he handcuffed her wrists hauled her arms over her head her face was flushed but he didnt think it was only temper temper didnt make her tremble didnt put that sudden female awareness in her eyes are you afraid to let me kiss you willa afraid youll like it her heart was beating too fast felt as though it would shatter through her ribs her lips were tingling as if the nerves centered there were revving up for action if i want your mouth on me ill tell you he only smiled leaned down closer to her face why dont you tell me you dont go ahead tell me his voice thickened as he nipped lightly at her jaw tell me you dont want me to taste you just once she couldnt it would have been a lie but lying didnt worry her she simply couldnt get a word through her dry throat so she took the other option and brought her knee up fast and hard she had the pleasure of seeing him go dead pale before he collapsed on her get off me get off you goddamn idiot youre crushing my lungs desperate for air she arched bucked making him moan she managed to gasp in a breath before she grabbed a handful of his hair and yanked they rolled off the couch and crashed to the floor she saw stars as her elbow hit the edge of the table it was pain and fury that had her tearing into him something shattered on the floor as they wrestled over it grunting and cursing he was trying to defend himself but she was obviously out for blood and proved it by biting his arm just under the shoulder yelping certain that she was going to take a chunk out of him he managed to get a grip on her jaw and squeeze under the pressure the tear of her teeth loosened they rolled boots clattering and digging for purchase elbows jabbing hands grappling willa didnt realize she was laughing until he had her pinned she kept right on laughing helpless even to stop for breath as he stared down at her you think its funny he had to squint then huff out a breath to get the hair out of his eyes but all in all he was grateful she hadnt managed to tear it out of his head by the handful you bit me i know her voice hitched as she ran a tongue over her teeth i think ive got some of your shirt in my mouth turn me loose ben so you can bite me again or try to kick my balls into my throat since they were still achingþmore than a littleþhe narrowed his eyes sneered you fight like a girl so what it works his mood was shifting again he could feel that hot slick transition from temper to lust from insult to interest the way theyd ended up her breasts were pressed nicely against his chest and her legs were spread with his snugged between them yeah it does you being female seems to suit the situation she saw the change in his eyes teetered between panic and longing dont his mouth was barely an inch from hers now and her breath was gone again why not its not going to hurt anybody i dont want your mouth on me he lifted a brow and he smiled liar and she shuddered yeah his mouth was only a whisper from hers when she heard the first piercing screams ben rolled gained his feet this time as willa ran behind him she could admire the speed with which he could move the screams were still echoing when he wrenched open the front door christ he muttered it even as he stepped over the bloody mess on the porch and gathered lily in his arms its all right honey automatically he shifted so that he blocked her view and with his hands stroking easy down her back looked over her head into willas eyes the shock was there but it wasnt the quaking glassyeyed horror of the woman he held this one was fragile he thought whereas willa would always be sturdy you ought to get her inside he said to willa but willa was shaking her head staring down now at the mangled and bloody mess at her feet must be one of the barn cats or it had been she thought grimly before someone had decapitated it and cut its guts open and left it like a gory gift at her front door take her inside will ben repeated the screams had brought others running adam was the first to reach the porch the first thing he saw was lily weeping in bens arms the quick hitch in his gut had almost as much to do with that as what he saw spread on the porch instinctively he stepped up laid a hand on her arm soothing when she jerked its all right lily adam i saw nausea churned a storm in her stomach i know you go on inside now look at me he murmured carefully easing her away from ben and leading her around and toward the door willas going to take you inside look ive gotþ take care of your sister will adam interrupted and taking her hand placed it over lilys willa lost the battle when lilys hand trembled under hers with a mumbled oath she tugged come on you need to sit down i sawþ yeah i know what you saw forget it willa closed the door with a decisive click leaving the men to ponder the headless corpse on the porch christ adam is that a cat jim brewster swiped a hand over his mouth somebody sure did a number on it adam glanced back studying each man in turn jim face pale adams apple bobbing ham tightlipped pickles with a rifle over his shoulder there was billy vincent barely eighteen and all eager eyes and wood book stroking his silky black beard it was wood who spoke his voice calm wheres the head dont see it there he stepped closer it was wood who oversaw the planting tending and harvesting of grain and his wife nell who cooked for the ranch hands he smelled of old spice and peppermint candy adam knew him to be a steady man as implacable as the rock of gibraltar whoever did this might like trophies adams words stopped the murmurs only billy continued to babble jeesus christ you ever seen anything like that spread the guts all over hell and back didnt he now whod do that to some stupid cat what do you thinkþ shut the hell up billy you asshole the weary order came from ham he sighed once took out his pack of smokes get on back to supper all of you nothing for you to do here now but gawk like a bunch of old ladies at a fashion show dont have much appetite jim murmured but he and the others drifted back sure is a sorry mess ham commented guess a kid might do this woods boys are a little wild but theyre not mean you ask me it takes mean to do this but ill talk to them ham mind if i ask if you know what the men have been up to for the past hour ham studied ben through a haze of smoke been here and there washing up for supper and the like i havent had my eye on them if thats what youre asking the men that work here dont go cutting up a cat for frolic ben merely nodded it wasnt his place to ask more and they both knew it it had to have happened in the last hour ive been here awhile and this wasnt here before ham sucked in more smoke nodded ill talk to woods boys he gave one last look at what lay on the porch sure is a sorry mess he repeated then walked away youve had two animals torn up in a week adam adam crouched down laid his fingertip on the bloody fur his name was mike he was old mostly blind in one eye and should have died in his sleep im sorry about that ben understood the affection even the intimacy with animals well and dropped a hand on adams shoulder i think youve got a real problem here yeah woods boys didnt do this theyve got no harm in them and they werent up in the hills slaughtering a steer either no i wouldnt say they were how well do you know your men adam lifted his gaze whatever the grief it was hard direct the men arent my territory the horses are still warm he thought as he stroked the matted fur cooling fast but still warm i know them well enough all but billy have been here for years and he signed on last summer youd have to ask willa shed know more he looked down again and grieved for an old halfblind torn who had still liked to hunt lily shouldnt have seen this no she shouldnt have ben sighed and wondered how close shed come to seeing who it was ill help you bury him inside willa paced the living room how the hell was she supposed to take care of the woman and why had adam pushed such a useless task on her all lily did was cower in the corner of the sofa and shake shed given lily whiskey hadnt she shed even patted her head for lack of anything better she had a problem on her hands for gods sake and she didnt need some weakstomached easterner to add to it im sorry those were the first words shed managed since shed come inside taking a deep breath lily tried them again im sorry i shouldnt have screamed that way ive never seen anything id been with adam helping with the horses and then i i justþ drink the damn whiskey would you willa snapped then cursed her self as lily cringed and obediently lifted the glass to her lips disgusted with herself willa rubbed her hands over her face i expect anybody would have screamed coming across something like that im not mad at you lily hated whiskey the burn of it the smell jesse had favored seagrams and as the level in the bottle dropped his temper rose always but now she pretended to drink was it a cat i thought it was a cat lily bit down hard on her lip to keep her voice steady was it your cat the cats are adams and the dogs and the horses but they did it to me they didnt leave it on adams porch they did it to me likeþlike the steer willa stopped pacing glanced over her shoulder yes like the steer heres a nice pot of tea bess hurried in carrying a tray the minute she set it down she began fussing will what are you thinking of giving the poor thing whiskey its just going to upset her stomach is all gently bess took the glass from lily and set it aside you drink some tea honey and rest yourself youve had a bad shock will stop that pacing and sit down you take care of her im going out though she poured the tea with a steady hand bess gave willas retreating back a hard look that girl never listens shes upset arent we all lily lifted the cup with both hands felt the warmth spread at the first sip she takes it deeper its her ranch bess cocked her head yours too no lily drank again gradually grew calmer itll always be hers the cat was gone but there was still blood pooled over the wood willa went back for a bucket of soapy water a scrub brush bess would have done it she knew but it wasnt something she would ask of another on her hands and knees in the glow of the porch light she washed away the signs of violence death happened she had believed she accepted and understood that cattle were raised for their meat and a chicken who stopped laying ended up in the pot deer and elk were hunted and set on the table that was the way of things people lived and died even violence wasnt a stranger to her she had sent a bullet into living flesh and dressed game with her own hands her father had insisted on that had ordered her to learn to hunt to watch a buck go down bleeding that she could live with but this cruelty this waste this viciousness that had been laid at her door wasnt part of the cycle she erased it every drop and with the bloody bucket beside her she sat back on her heels and stared up into the sky a star died even as she watched blazing its white trail across the night and falling into oblivion from somewhere near an owl hooted and she knew prey would be scrambling for cover for tonight there was a hunters moon full and bright tonight there would be deathþin the forest in the hills in the grass there was no denying it it should not have made her want to weep she heard the footsteps and hastily composed herself she was getting to her feet as ben and adam came around the side of the house i would have done that will adam took the bucket from her there was no need for you to do this its done she reached out touched his face im sorry adam about mike he used to like to sun himself on the rock behind the pole barn we buried him there he glanced toward the window lily bess is with her shell do her more good than i would ill get rid of this then check on her all right but she kept her hand on his cheek another moment murmured something in the language of their mother it made him smile not the comforting words as much as the tongue she rarely used it and only when it mattered most he stepped away and left her with ben youve got a problem on your hands will ive got several of them whoever did that did it while we were inside wrestling he thought like a couple of idiot children hams going to talk to woods kids joe and pete will snorted then rocked on her heels to comfort herself no way in hell and back ben those boys like to run wild around here and regularly beat the hell out of each other but they arent going to torture some old cat he rubbed the scar on his chin saw that did you ive got eyes dont i she had to take a steadying breath as her stomach tipped again cut little pieces off of him and it looked like burns probably from a cigarette on the fur it wasnt woods boys adam gave them a couple of kittens last spring they spoil those cats like babies adam piss anybody off lately she didnt look down at him they didnt do it to adam they did it to me okay because he saw it the same way he nodded and he worried you piss anybody off lately besides you he smiled a little climbed up a step until they were eye to eye youve been pissing me off all your life hardly counts i mean it willa he closed a hand over hers linked fingers is there anybody you can think of whod want to hurt you baffled by the link she stared down at their joined hands no pickles and wood they might have their noses a little out of joint now that im in charge pickles especially its the female thing but they havent got anything against me personally pickles was up in high country ben pointed out would he do something like this to get at you scare the female she sneered out her pride do i look scared id feel better if you did but he shrugged would he do it a couple of hours ago id have said no now i cant be sure that was the worst of it she realized not being sure who to trust or how much to trust them i wouldnt think so hes got a temper and he likes to bitch and stew but i cant see him killing things for no reason id say theres a reason here thats what we have to figure out she angled her chin do we your land marches with mine will and for the next year youre part of my responsibilities he only tightened his grip when she tugged at her hand thats a fact and i imagine well both get used to it i aim to keep my eye on you and yours you keep it too close ben its liable to get blackened ill take that chance but just in case he took her other hand held them both at her sides i have a feeling im going to find the next year interesting all around interesting i havent wrestled with you in must be twenty years you filled out nice knowing she was outweighed and outmuscled she stood still youve got a real way with words ben like poetry you should feel my heart thudding honey id love to but youd just try to deck me she smiled and felt better for it no ben i would deck you now go away im tired and i want my supper im going but not quite yet he thought he slid his hands up to her wrists and was intrigued to find her pulse hammering there you wouldnt have known it from her eyes so cool and dark you wouldnt know a lot he decided from just a quick look at willa mercy arent you going to kiss me good night id just spoil you for all those other women you like to play with id take my chances on that too but he backed off it wasnt the time or the place still he had a feeling hed be looking for both very soon ill be back yeah she dipped her hands into her pockets as he climbed into his rig her pulse was still drumming i know she waited until his taillights disappeared down the long dirt road then she glanced over her shoulder at the house at the lights she wanted that hot bath that hot meal and a long nights sleep but all of that would have to wait mercy ranch was hers and she had to talk to her men as operator she tried to stay away from the bunkhouse she believed the men were entitled to their privacy and this woodframed building with its rocking chairs on the porch was their home here they slept and ate read their books if reading was what pleased them they played cards and argued over them watched television and complained about the boss nell would cook the meals in the bungalow she shared with wood and their sons then cart the food over she didnt serve the men and one of them was assigned cleanup duty every week that way they could eat as they pleased they might eat dusty from work or in their underwear they could lie about women or the size of their cocks it was after all their home so she knocked and waited to be hailed inside they were all there but wood who was eating his supper at home with his family the men ranged around the table ham at the head his chair tipped back since hed just finished his meal billy and jim continued to shovel in chicken and dumplings like a pair of wolves vying for meat pickles washed his back with beer and scowled im sorry to interrupt your meal were about done here ham told her billy get to the dishes you eat any more youll bust you want some coffee will i wouldnt mind she walked to the stove herself poured a cup and left it black she understood that this was a delicate matter and shed have to be both tactful and direct i cant figure who would slice up that old cat she sipped let it stew anybody have an idea i checked on woods boys ham rose to pour coffee for himself nell says they were in the house with her most of the evening now they both have pocketknives and nell had them fetch them to show me they were clean he grimaced as he drank the younger one pete he busted out crying when he heard about old mike tall boy pete you forget hes only eight i heard about kids doing shit like that pickles sulked in his beer grow up to be serial killers willa spared him a glance if anybody found a way to make things worse it was pickles i dont think woods boys are john wayne gags in training could been mckinnon billy clattered dishes in the sink and hoped willa would notice him he was always hoping shed notice him his crush on her was as wide as montana he was here he jerked his head to flop his strawcolored hair out of his eyes scrubbed harder than necessary at dishes so the muscles on his arms would flex and his men were up in the hills when the steer got laid open you ought to think before you start flapping your lips you asshole ham made the statement without heat anyone under thirty in his mind had the potential to be an asshole billy with his eager eyes and imagination had more potential than most mckinnon isnt a man whod cut up some damn cat well he was here billy said stubbornly and slanted his eyes sideways to see if willa was listening he was here she agreed and he was inside with me i let him into the house myself and there wasnt anything on the porch then nothing like this happened when the old man was around pickles tipped back his beer again and flicked a glance at willa come on pickles uncomfortable jim shifted in his creaking chair you cant blame will for something like this just stating fact thats right willa nodded equably nothing like this happened when the old man was around but hes dead and im in charge now and when i find out who did this ill take care of them personally she set her cup down id like all of you to think about it to see if you remember anything or saw anything anyone if something comes to you you know where to find me when the door closed behind her ham kicked at pickless chair and nearly sent it out from under him why do you have to be such a damn fool that girls never done anything but her best shes a female aint she and that he thought was that you cant trust them and you sure as hell cant depend on them whos to say whoever cut up a cow and a cat wont try it on a man next he swigged his beer while he let that little seed root are you going to look to her to watch your back i know im not billy bobbled a dish his eyes were huge and filled with glassy excitement you think somebodyd try to do that to one of us try to knife us oh shut the hell up ham slammed down his cup pickles is just trying to get everybody worked up cause his peckers in a twist at having a woman in charge killing cows and some old fleabitten cat isnt like doing a man hams right but jim had to swallow and he wasnt interested in the rest of the dumpling on his plate but maybe it wouldnt hurt to be careful for a while there are two more women on the ranch now he pushed away his plate as he rose maybe we should look after them ill look after will billy said quickly and earned a quick cuff on the ear from ham youll do your work like always im not having a bunch of pussies jumping at shadows over a cat he topped off his coffee picked up the cup again pickles if you havent got anything intelligent to say keep your mouth shut that goes for the rest of you too he took a moment to aim a beady eye at every man then nodded satisfied im going to watch jeopardy i tell you this pickles said under his breath im keeping my rifle close and a knife in my boot if i see anybody acting funny around here ill take care of them and ill take care of myself he took his beer and stalked outside jim bypassed the coffeepot for a beer himself glancing at billys pale face along the way poor kid he thought hell be having nightmares for sure hes just blowing it out his ass billy you know how he is yeah butþ he wiped a hand over his mouth it was just a cat he reminded himself just an old mangy cat yeah i know how he is willa had nightmares they woke her in a cold sweat with her heart pounding against her ribs and a scream locked in her throat she fought her way out of the tangle of sheets struggling for air alone and shivering she sat in the center of the bed as the moonlight streamed through her windows and a fitful little breeze tapped slyly on the glass she couldnt remember clearly what had haunted her sleep blood fear panic knives a headless cat stalking her she tried to laugh over it dropped her head on her drawnup knees and tried hard to laugh at herself it came perilously close to a sob her legs threatened to buckle when she climbed out of bed but she made herself walk into the bath switched on the light lowered her head over the sink and ran the water icy cold into her cupped hands it was better then with the clammy sweat washed off lifting her head she studied herself in the mirror it was still the same face that hadnt changed nothing had changed really it had simply been a hellish night didnt she have the right to be shaken just a little by all that was going on worry was like lead on her shoulders and she had to carry it alone there was no passing it off no sharing the load the sisters were hers and the ranch and whatever was plaguing it she would handle it all and if there was a change inside her something irksome something she recognized as essentially female she would handle that as well she didnt have the time or the temperament to play mating games with ben mckinnon oh he was just trying to rile her anyway she brushed the hair away from her damp cheeks poured cold water into a glass hed never been interested in her if he was now it was only for the hell of it which was just like ben she nearly smiled as she let the water cool her throat she thought she might kiss him after all just to get it out of the way a kind of test she might sleep better for it that might chase him out of her dreams and nightmares and once she stopped wondering stopped thinking about what kept stirring inside her she would be able to concentrate more fully on the ranch she looked toward the bed shuddered she needed to sleep but she didnt want to see the blood again to see the mangled bodies so she wouldnt she took a deep breath before climbing back into bed shed will them away think of something else of spring that was so far off of flowers blooming in meadows and warm breezes floating down from the hills but when she dreamed she dreamed of blood and death and terror aom tess mercys journal v after two days of life on the ranch ive decided i hate montana i hate cows horses cowboys and most particularly chickens ive been assigned the chicken coop by bess pringle the scrawny despot who runs the house where im being held prisoner i learned of this new career move after dinner last night a dinner i might add of roast hunk of bear it seems danielle boone went up in the hills and shot herself a grizzly it was yummy actually it was quite good until i learned what i d been eating i can report that grizzly does not despite what may have been stated by others taste remotely like chicken whatever else i could say about bessþand i could say plenty given the way she eyeballs meþthe woman can cook im going to have to watch myself or i ll be back to the tubby stage i lived through in my youth theres been some excitement around the ponderosa while i was back in the real world apparently someone butchered a cow up in what they call high country when i said i thought thats what you did with cows annie oakley did her best to wither me with a look i have to admit she s got some good ones if she wasn t such a tightassed knowitall i might actually like her but i digress the cow butchering was more in the way of a mutilation and has caused some concern among the rank and file the night before my return one of the barn cats was decapitated and left on the front porch poor lily found it i dont know whether to be concerned that this isn t a usual event around here or to pretend it is and make sure my door is locked every night but the cowgirl queen looks worried under other circumstances that would give me a small warm glow of satisfaction she really gets under my skin but with the way things stand and thinkingþor trying not to thinkþof the long months ahead of me lfind myself uncomfortable lily spends a lot of her time with adam and his horses the bruises are fading but her nerves are alive and well i dont think she has a clue that the gorgeous noble savage is developing a case on her it s kind of fun to watch i cant help but like lily shes so harmless and lost and after all the two of us are in the same boat so to speak the other characters in the cast include ham hes perfect straight out of central casting the bowlegged grizzled cattleman with a beady eye and a callused hand he tips his hat to me and says little then theres pickles i have no idea if the man has another name hes a sourfaced surly character who looks like a bloated string in pointytoed boots and is nearly hairless but for an enormous reddish mustache he scowls a lot but i did see him working with the cattle and he seems to know his stuff there s the bookfamily nell cooks for the hands and has a sweet homely face she and bess get together to gossip and do womenontheranch things i dont want to know about her husband is wood which ive discovered is shortfor woodrow he has a lovely black beard a very nice smile and manner he calls me maam and suggested very politely that i should get myself a proper hat so as not to burn my face when im out in the sun they have two boys about ten and eight i d say who love to run around whooping and pounding on each other theyre awfully pretty i saw them practicing their spitting behind one of the outbuildings they seemed to be quite skilled theres jim brewster who seems to be one of the good ol boy types hes the lanky im getting to it boss sort hes very attractive looks appealing in jeans with that little round outline in the back pocket which im sure is something revolting like chewing tobacco he s given me a few cocky grins and winks so far i have been able to resist billy is the youngest he looks barely old enough to drive and has his puppy eyes on ourfavorite cowgirl he s a big talker and is constantly being told by anyone within hearing distance to shut up he takes it well and rarely listens if eel almost maternal toward him i havent seen the cowboy lawyer since my return and have yet to meet the infamous ben mckinnon of three rocks ranch who appears to be the bane of willas existence im sure ill like him enormously for that alone i believe i ll have to find a way to soften bess up in order to get all the dish on the mckinnons but meanwhile i have a date in the chicken coop im going to try to think of it as an adventure tess didn t mind rising early she was invariably up by six in any case an hour at the gym perhaps a breakfast meeting then she would hunker over her work until two then shed take a dip in the pool or take another meeting perhaps do a little shopping maybe shed have a date or maybe she wouldnt but her life was hers and ran just as she liked rising early to deal with a bunch of chickens had an entirely different flavor the chicken house was big and certainly looked clean to tesss untrained eye the fifty hens mercy boasted seemed a legion of beadyeyed ominously humming predators she dumped the feed as bess had instructed dealt with the water then dusted off her hands and eyed the first roosting hen im supposed to get the eggs i believe you may be sitting on one so if you dont mind gingerly she reached out her eyes locked on the hens it was immediately apparent who was in charge yelping as beak nipped flesh tess jumped back look sister ive got my orders it was an ugly battle feathers flew tempers snapped the henhouse erupted with clucking and squawking as neighboring hens joined the fray tess managed to get her hand around a nice warm egg wrenched it clear then stepped back redfaced and panting thats quite a technique you got there at the voice behind her tess let loose of the egg it spurted out of her fingers and fell splat on the floor goddamn it after all that i spooked you the commotion inside the henhouse had lured nate instead of heading on to see willa hed detoured and found the california connectionþin her designer jeans and shiny new bootsþbattling chickens he could only think she made a picture looking for breakfast more or less she pushed her hair back from her face what are you looking for ive got some business with will your hands bleeding he added i know it in a bad temper she sucked on the wounds on the back of her hand that vicious birdbrain attacked me youre just not going about it right he offered her a bandanna to wrap around her hand then stepped up to the next roost and managed tess noted to look graceful despite the necessity of stooping and bending to keep from bashing his head on the ceiling youve just got to go in like its natural make it quick but not abrupt he demonstrated slipping a hand under the roosting hen and pulling it out with an egg not a feather stirred its my first day on the job pouting only a little she held up the bucket i like to find my chicken in the freezer section wrapped in cellophane as he walked along gathering eggs she followed behind i suppose you keep chickens used to i dont bother with them now cattle nope she raised an eyebrow sheep isnt that a risk ive seen all those western movies the range wars i dont raise sheep either he settled an egg in the bucket just horses quarter horses you ride miz mercy no she tossed her hair back with a shrug though im told id better learn and i suppose it would give me something to do around here adam would teach you or i could really she smiled slowly with a flutter of lashes and why would you do that mr torrence just being neighborly she sure had a nice smell about her he thought something just a little dark just a little dangerous and all female he set another egg inside the bucket its nate all right her voice warmed to a purr and her eyes slanted up a sly look under thick spiky lashes are we neighbors nate in a manner of speaking my place is east of here you smell good miz mercy for someone whos been fighting with chickens its tess are you flirting with me nate just flirting back his smile was slow and easy thats what you were doing wasnt it in a manner of speaking habit well if you want adviceþ and lawyers are full of it she interrupted we are my advice would be to tone down the power the boys around here arent used to women with as much style as youve got oh she wasnt sure if shed been complimented or insulted but she decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and are you used to women with style cant say i am he gave her a long thoughtful look out of quiet blue eyes but i recognize one youll have them crazy and thinking of killing each other within a week now that she decided was a compliment that ought to liven things up from what i hear theyve been lively enough dead cats and cows she grimaced a nasty business im glad i missed it youre here now that seems to be the lot he added and she looked down in the bucket plenty of them and christ theyre filthy it was liable to put her off omelets for quite a while theyll wash he took the bucket from her and started out you settling in as best i can its not my milieuþmy usual environment he tucked his tongue in his cheek folks from yourþwhat was itþ milieu come out here all the time not that they stay automatically he ducked down to avoid rapping his head on the low doorway of the henhouse those hollywooders come charging out buying up land plunking down houses that cost the earth and more think theyre going to raise buffalo or save the mustangs or god knows what you dont like californians californians dont belong in montana as a rule they go running back to their restaurants and nightclubs soon enough he turned studied her thats what youll do when your years up you bet your ass you can keep your wideopen spaces pal ill take beverly hills and smog mudslides earthquakes she only smiled please youre making me homesick she figured she had his number montanaborn and bred a slow thorough thinker who liked his beer cold and his women modest the sort who would have kissed his horse at the end of the last reel in any b western but my oh my he was cute why the law nate somebody sue your horses not lately he continued to walk shortening his stride to let her keep pace it interested me the system and it helps keep the ranch going takes time and money to build up a solid herd and a reputation so you went to law school to supplement your ranch income where university of montana her mouth was smug and amused there is a university in montana isnt there ive heard there is recognizing the sarcasm he slid his gaze down to hers no i went to yale toþ as shed stopped dead he was well ahead of her before she recovered she had to scramble to catch up yale you went to yale and came back here to play range lawyer for a bunch of cowboys and ranch hands i dont play at the law he tipped his hat in goodbye and circled around to a corral beside the pole barn yale she said it again shook her head fascinated now she shifted the bucket hed handed back to her and scurried after him hey listen nateþ she stopped there was a great deal of activity in the corral two men and willa were doing something to a small cow something the cow didnt appear to appreciate tess wondered if they were branding and thought shed like to see how that little trick was done besides she wanted to talk to nate again and he was moving to the action she hefted her bucket strode up to the gate and through it no one bothered to look at her they were focused on their work and the cow had all their attention lips pursed tess stepped closer leaned forward to check out the activity over willas shoulder when she saw jim brewster quickly neatly and efficiently castrate the calf her eyes rolled back in her head and she fainted dead away with barely a sound it was the crash of the bucket and breaking eggs that made willa glance around well jesus christ will you look at that shes done passed out cold will jim informed her and earned a bland scowl i can see that deal with the calf she straightened but nate was already lifting tess into his arms looks like a handful shes not a featherweight he grinned your sisters built just fine will you can enjoy that little benefit while you haul her into the house damn it she scooped up the bucket she busted damn near every egg bessll have a fit disgusted she looked back at jim and pickles you two keep at it im going to have to see to her first as if ive got nothing better to do than find smelling salts for some brainless city girl you shouldnt be so hard on her will nate began as he carried tess across the road toward the ranch house his lips twitched shes out of her milieu i wish to hell shed get back in it and out of mine ive got this one fainting on me and the other one tiptoeing around as if id shoot her between the eyes if she looked at me youre a scary woman will he glanced down as tess stirred in his arms i think shes coming around dump her somewhere willa suggested pulling open the door of the house ill get some water he had to admit tess was an interesting armful not one of the bony pencilthin california types but a soft round woman who had her weight distributed just where it belonged she groaned and her lashes fluttered as he carried her toward a sofa her eyes blue as cornflowers stared blankly into his what was the best she could manage take it easy honey you just had yourself a swoon thats all a swoon it took a moment for her brain to get around to the word and its meaning i fainted thats ridiculous went down real graceful too shed toppled like a tree he remembered but didnt think shed appreciate the analogy didnt hurt your head did you my head still dazed she lifted a hand to it i dont think so i and then she remembered oh god that cow what they were doing to that cow what are you grinning at im imagining what it was like for you to see a bull turned into a steer for the first time guess you dont see much of that in beverly hills we keep all our cattle in the guest house he nodded appreciatively there now youre coming around she was indeed enough to realize she was being cradled against his chest like a baby why are you carrying me well it didnt seem neighborly to drag you by the hair your colors coming back havent you put her down yet willa demanded as she strode back into the room holding a glass of water i like it this way she smells pretty the exaggerated drawl made willa chuckle and shake her head stop playing with her nate and dump her ive got work to do cant i keep her will i dont have me a female out on the ranch gets lonely you two are a riot striving to restore some dignity tess swiped the hair out of her eyes put me down you idiot beanpole yesm from a considerable height he dropped her onto the leather couch she bounced once scowled and pushed herself up drink this with little sympathy willa thrust the glass of water into tesss hand and stay away from the corrals you can be sure i will furious with herself and the fact that she was still shaky tess drank what you were doing out there was revolting barbaric and cruel if mutilating a helpless animal isnt illegal it should be she set her teeth when nate beamed at her and stop grinning at me you fool i dont imagine youd appreciate having your balls snipped off with pruning shears he felt them draw up cleared his throat no maam i cant say i would we dont castrate the men around here till were through with them willa said dryly look hollywood weaning and castration are part of ranch life just what do you think would happen if we left every cow with his works wed have bulls humping everything cattle orgies every night nate put in then backed off at the searing looks delivered by both women i dont have time to explain the facts of life to you willa continued just get over it and stay away from the corral for the next couple of days bessll find work for you inside the house oh joy i dont see what else youre good for you cant even gather eggs without breaking the lot of them when tess hissed at her she turned to nate you wanted to talk to me yeah i did he hadnt expected quite so much entertainment first i wanted to see if you were all right i heard about the trouble youve been having im all right enough willa took the glass of water out of tesss hand and drank the rest of it down herself there doesnt seem to be a lot i can do about it the men are a little spooked and theyre keeping their eyes out she set the empty glass down pushed her hat back you havent heard about this sort of thing happening to anyone else no and it worried him i dont know what i can do to help but if there is anything just ask i appreciate it willa took his hand and squeezed it a gesture that caused tess to purse her lips thoughtfully were you able to deal with that other business we talked about her will he thought naming adam as beneficiary and the papers transferring his house the horses and half of her interest in mercy to him at the end of the year yeah ill have a draft to you on all of it by the end of the week thanks she released his hand adjusted her hat you can talk to her if youve got time to waste on it she sent tess a wicked smile ive got cows to castrate as willa strode out tess folded her arms and tried to settle her temper i could learn to hate her it wouldnt take any effort at all you just dont know her i know shes cold rude unfriendly and riding on a power trip thats more than enough for me no she realized as she got to her feet the temper wasnt going to settle i havent done a damn thing to deserve that attitude from her i didnt ask to be stuck out here and i sure as hell didnt ask to be related to that gnatassed witch she didnt ask for it either nate sat on the arm of a chair methodically rolled a cigarette he had a little time and thought there were things that needed to be said let me ask you something how would you feel if you suddenly found out your home could be taken away your home your life everything youve ever loved his eyes were mild as he struck a match held it to the tip of the cigarette to keep it you have to rely on strangers and even if you manage to hold on you wont keep it all good chunks of it are going to belong to those strangers people you dont know never had the opportunity to know are living in your house with as much legal right as you theres nothing you can do about it added to that youve got all the responsibility because these strangers dont know squat about ranching its up to you to hold it together all they have to do is wait and if they wait theyll get as much as you even though you were the one to work to sweat to worry tess opened her mouth closed it again put that simply it changed the hue im not to blame for it she said quietly no youre not but neither is she he turned his head studied the portrait of jack mercy above the fireplace and you didnt have to live with him what was heþ she broke off cursed herself she didnt want to ask didnt want to know what was he like nate blew out smoke ill tell you he was hard cold selfish he knew how to run a ranch better than anyone i know but he didnt know how to raise a child remembering that thinking of that fired him up now his voice was clipped he never gave her an ounce of affection or as far as i know one single word of praise no matter how she worked her skin off for him she was never good enough or fast enough or smart enough to suit him guilt wasnt going to work tess told herself he wasnt going to make her feel guilt or sympathy she could have left yeah she could have left but she loved this place and she loved him you dont have to grieve for your father tess you lost him years ago but willas grieving it doesnt matter that he didnt deserve it he didnt want her any more than he wanted you or lily but she wasnt lucky enough to have a mother all right guilt was going to work a little im sorry about that but it doesnt have anything to do with me he took a slow drag on his cigarette then crushed it out carefully as he rose it has everything to do with you he studied her and his eyes were suddenly cool and detached and uncomfortably lawyerlike if you dont understand that youve got too much of jack mercy in you ill be going he touched the brim of his hat in farewell and walked out for a long time tess stood where she was staring up at the portrait of the man whod been her father miles away on three rocks land jesse cooke whistled between ss teeth as he changed the points and plugs in an old ford pickup he was feeling fine pumped up from the conversation over breakfast about the animal mutilations at mercy what was more rewarding what was so damn perfect was that lily had come across that headless cat he only wished he could have seen it but legs monroe had it straight from wood book over at mercy that the little city woman with the black eye had screamed her head off oh that was sweet jesse whistled a country tune as his clever fingers made adjustments hed always hated country music the whiny women sobbing over their men dickless men moaning over their women but he was adjusting every damn one of his bunkhouse mates was a fan and it was all anyone listened to he could handle it in fact he was beginning to think montana was the place for him it was a land for real men hed decided men who knew how to handle themselves and keep their women in line after hed taught lily a proper lesson theyd settle down here she was going to be rich the thought of that had him chuckling and tapping his foot to his own tune imagine dumbass lily inheriting a third of one of the top ranches in the state worth a fucking fortune too all it was going to take was a year jesse pulled his head out from under the hood and looked around the mountains the land the skyþthey were all hard hard and strong like him so this was his place and lily was going to learn that her place was with him divorce didnt mean shit in jesse cookes book the woman belonged to him and if he had to use his fists to remind her of that from time to time well that was his right all he had to do was be patient that was the hard part he admitted wiping a greasy hand over his cheek if she found out he was close shed run he couldnt afford to let her run until the year was up that didnt mean he wasnt going to keep his eye on her no indeedy he was going to keep watch over his useless stick of a wife it was easy enough to make friends with a couple of the asshole hands over at mercy drink a few beers play some cards and pump them for information he could wander over to the neighboring ranch at will as long as he didnt let lily see him and the day jesse cooke exmarine let a woman outwit him was the day theyd eat cherry popsicles in hell ducking under the hood again he got back to work and reviewed his plans for his next visit to mercy sarah mckinnon flipped flapjacks on the griddle and enjoyed the fact that her older son was sitting at her kitchen table drinking her coffee more often than not these days he brewed his own in his quarters over the garage she missed him fact was she missed having both of her boys underfoot squabbling and picking on each other god knew thered been times shed thought they would set her crazy that she would never have a moments peace again now that they were grown and she had that peace she found herself yearning for the noise the work the tempers shed wanted more children with all her heart shed wanted a little girl to fuss over in her houseful of men but she and stu had never had any luck making a third baby shed comforted herself that theyd made two healthy beautiful boys and that was that now she had a daughterinlaw she loved and a granddaughter to dote on she would have more grandchildren too if she could ever push ben toward the right woman the boy was damn particular she mused slanting a look toward him as he frowned over the morning paper he wasnt still single at thirty for lack of opportunity lord knew thered been women in and out of his lifeþand his bed too but she didnt care to dwell on that but hed never stumbled over a woman and sarah supposed it was just as well you had to stumble before you could fall and falling in love was a serious business when a man chose carefully he usually chose well but damn it she wanted those grandchildren with a plate heaped with flapjacks in her hand she paused a moment by the kitchen window dawn had broken through the eastern sky and she watched it bloom going rosy with light and lowlying clouds in the bunkhouse the men would be up and at their own breakfast within moments she would hear her husbands feet hit the floor above her head shed always risen before him hoarding these first cozy moments to herself in the core of the house then he would come down all freshshaven and smelling of soap his hair damp hed give her a big morning kiss pat her bottom and slurp up that first cup of coffee as if his life depended on it she loved him for his predictability and she loved the land for its lack of it she loved her son this man who had somehow come from her for his combination of both as she set the plate on the table she ran her hand over the thick mop of bens hair remembered with odd and sudden clarity his first paidfor haircut at the age of seven how proud hed been and how foolishly shed wept at those gilded curls hitting the barbershop floor whats on your mind fella hmm he set the paper aside reading at the table was allowed until the food was on it nothing much beautiful whats on yours she sat cradled her coffee cup i know you benjamin mckinnon the gears are turning in there ranch business mostly to buy time he started on his breakfast the flapjacks were so light they should have been floating an inch off his plate and the bacon was crisp enough to crack nobody cooks like my ma he said and grinned at her nobody eats like my ben she settled back and waited he said nothing for a while enjoying the food the smells the light glowing through the window as morning spread enjoying her she was as dependable as the sunrise he thought sarah mckinnon with her pretty green eyes and her shiny strawberry blond hair she had the milkywhite irish complexion that defied the sun there were lines on it he mused but they were so soft so natural you didnt even see them instead you saw that smile warm and confident she was a slip of a woman slim in her jeans and plaid shirt but he knew the strength in her not just the physical though she had lifted him off his feet with her hand on his rump many a time could ride tirelessly on horse or tractor through the bitter cold or the merciless heat and could heft a fiftypound bag of feed on her shoulder like a woman lifting a cooing baby but what was inside where it counted most was iron she never faltered in all his life hed never seen her turn her back on a challenge or a friend if he couldnt find a woman as strong as kind as generous hed live his life a bachelor the idea of that would have rocked sarahs heart ive been thinking about willa mercy sarahs brows lifted perked by a kernel of hope oh have you not that way ma though he had he very much had shes in a bad spot the dancing light in her eyes faded im sorry for that shes a good girl doesnt deserve this heartache ive been thinking of riding over paying a call but i know how busy she is just now sarahs lips curved and im dying of curiosity about the others i didnt get much time to look them over at the funeral i think will would appreciate a visit biding his time he forked up more flapjacks weve got things under control around here i think i could spare a little extra time over at mercy not that will would like it but having an extra man around there now and again might smooth things out some if you wouldnt poke at her so much youd get along better maybe he lifted a shoulder the fact is i dont know how much of the managing she did before the old man died you have to figure she can handle it but with mercy dead theyre a man short i havent heard anything about her hiring another hand there was some speculation shed hire someone out of the university as foreman that was how gossip ran from ranch to ranchþspeculations over the phone wires a nice young man with experience in animal husbandry not that ham doesnt know his business but hes getting on in years she wont do it shes got too much to prove and too much fondness for ham i can give her a hand he continued not that she thinks much of my college degree i thought id ride over later this morning feel her out i think thats very kind of you ben im not doing it to be kind he grinned over the rim of his cup and it was the same wicked devil of a grin hed had since childhood itll give me the chance to poke at her again she chuckled and rose to fetch the coffeepot shed heard her husbands feet hit the floor well thatll help keep her mind off her troubles she could have used a distraction wood s boys had snuck into the bull pasture to play matador with their mothers red christmas apron theyd escaped with their lives and only one sprained ankle between them shed rescued them herself hauling a dazed and clammyfaced pete over the fence and leaving an angry fireeyed bull behind the ensuing lecture shed delivered to two hanging heads had given her no pleasureþnor had the boneshaking fear that the incident had shot through her she ended up playing accessory after the fact by taking the red apron and agreeing to launder it herself before nell could notice it was missing this earned her undying and desperate admiration from the culprits and willa hoped instilled enough fear in them to keep them from shouting toro at a snorting black angus bull again anytime in the near future one of the tractors had thrown a rod and shed had to ship billy off to town for parts elk had broken through a portion of the northwest fence again and now there were cattle to round up bess was down with a cold tess had broken most of the eggs for the third time this week and lily the mouse was in temporary charge of the kitchen to top it all off her men were bickering a man plays poker and has a run of luck i say he sticks around to give the rest of the table a chance to even the score pickles adjusted the annoyed calf s horns in the squeeze shoot and popped them off to the tune of tammy wynette backed up by insulted moos you cant afford to lose jim shot back you dont play a mans got a right to get back his own and a mans got a right to turn in when he wants aint that right will she medicated the cow plunging the needle in swiftly and efficiently it was cooler today autumn coming in strong but the jacket shed started out with was now slung over a rail as she sweated through her shirt im not getting in the middle of your petty feuds pickless frown carved vertical lines between his brows and set his mustache quivering between jim and that cardsharp over to three rocks they took me for two hundred jcs not a cardsharp more to spite pickles than anything else jim flew to his new friends defense he just played better than you you couldnt bluff a blind man on a galloping horse and youre just pissed off because he fixed hams rig and had it purring like a kitten because it was true down to the ground pickless chin jutted like a lance i dont need some ahole from over to three rocks coming round and fixing our rigs and taking my money at cards ida fixed the rig when i had the chance youve been saying that for a week ida got to it grinding his teeth pickles got to his feet i dont need somebody coming around taking over i dont need somebody changing the way things are ive been working this ranch for eighteen years come next may i dont need no johnnycomelately aholes telling me whats what whore you calling an ahole eyes hot jim sprang to his feet pushed his face into pickless you want to take me on old man come ahead thats enough even as fists raised whiteknuckled willa stepped between them i said enough using both hands she shoved the men apart one sweeping glance dared either one to take a punch as far as i can see there are two assholes right here who dont have the sense to keep their minds on their work when theyre hipdeep in it i can do my work pickless jaw clenched as he glared down at her i dont need him or you to tell me what has to be done thats fine then and i dont need you to start a pissing contest when were hipdeep in balls and horns you go cool off and when youve cooled off you ride out and check on the fence crew ham doesnt need anybody checking on him and ive got work right here willa stepped closer bumped her temper against his i said go cool off then get your butt in your rig and check fences you do it and do it now or you pack up your gear and pick up your last paycheck his color rose high as much in anger as at the humiliation of being ordered around by a woman half his age you think you can fire me i know i can and so do you she jerked her head toward the gate now get moving youre in my way here they stared at each other for ten humming seconds then he stepped aside spat on the ground and stalked toward the gate beside willa jim blew out a breath between his teeth you dont want to lose him will hes ornery christ knows but hes a hell of a cowboy hes not going anywhere if she had been alone she could have pressed a hand against her jittery stomach instead she crouched and prepared the next hypo once he clears the mad out hell be all right he didnt mean to swipe at you jim he likes you as well as he likes anybody grinning now jim hauled a cow toward the squeeze shoot that aint saying much i guess not she smiled herself prickly old bastard how much you win off him last night about seventy got my eye on some pretty snakeskin boots youre such a dude brewster i like to look sharp for the ladies he winked at her and the routine fell back into place maybe youll come dancing with me sometime will it was an old joke and cleared more tension willa mercy didnt dance and maybe youll lose the seventy back to him tonight she wiped sweat off her forehead and kept her voice casual this guy from three rocks jc hes okay did he have any news from over there not much as jim worked he recalled that jc had been more interested in the workings of mercy he said how john conners girl broke things off and john got himself shitfaced drunk and passed out in the toilet it was easier now and again routine old gossip familiar names sissy breaks up with conner every other week and he always gets shitfaced just so you know things are as usual they grinned at each other two people hunkered down in blood and manure with the cool breeze blowing the stink everywhere twenty says he buy her a bauble and shell take him back by monday no bet i aint no greenhorn they worked together for another twenty minutes communicating with grunts and hand signals when they paused long enough to cool dry throats jim shifted his feet will pickles didnt mean to ride you either hes missing the old man is all pickles had a powerful respect for him i know she ignored the nagging ache in her heart as she squinted her eyes the line of dust coming down the road meant billy was back she thought shed go hunt down pickles soothe his ruffled feathers and give him the tractor to repair go on and get your dinner jim my favorite words she took her own meal with her climbing into the cab of her land rover and eating the roast beef sandwich onehanded as she negotiated the dirt road crisscrossed with tire tracks and hoofprints the path cut through pastures toward hillocks then rose and gave her a breathless view of autumn color it was passing its peak she mused going soft as it faded and leaves were stripped from the trees but she could hear a meadowlarks high insistent call as she left the window down to the play of the wind it should have soothed her that familiar music she wanted it to soothe her and she couldnt understand why it didnt with a careful eye she studied the fencing she passed satisfied that it was for now in good repair cattle grazed placidly a cow occasionally raised its head to stare with marked disinterest at the passing rig and driver to the west the sky was growing dark and badtempered casting shadow and eerie light on the peaks she imagined thered be snow in the mountains and rain here in the valley before evening god knew they could use the rain she thought but she had little hope it would be the slow serene soaker that the land would absorb likely as not it would come in hard brittle drops that would batter the crops and bounce like bullets off the ground already she yearned to hear it pound on the roof like angry fists to be alone with that violent sound and her own thoughts for a few hours and to look out her window she thought at a wall of mean rain that masked everything and everyone maybe it was the coming storm that was making her so restless so edgy she thought as she caught herself checking her rearview mirror for the fourth time or maybe she was just annoyed that shed come across evidence of the fence crew and not the crew themselves no rig no sound of hammer no men walking the fence line in the distance nothing but road and land and hills rising into a bruised sky she felt too alone and that made no sense to her she liked being alone on her own land even now she was longing for time by herself with no one asking her questions demanding answers or listing complaints but the nerves remained jumping like trout in her stomach crawling over the back of her neck like busy ants she found herself reaching behind her laying her fingers on the stock of the shotgun in her gun rack then very deliberately stopping the rig and stepping out to scan the land for signs of life t was risky he knew it was risky but he had a taste for it now and couldnt stop himself he thought hed chosen his time and place well enough there was a storm brewing and the fence crew had finished in this section he imagineeir dinner it didnt give him much of a window but hd they were back at the ranch yard by now hunting up the knew how to make the best of it hed chosen a prime steer out of the pasture one that was fat and sleek and would have brought top money at market hed chosen his spot carefully once he was finished he could ride fast and soon be back at the ranch yard or on a far point of mercy land one edge of the road butted the rising hills that went rocky under a cloak of trees no one would come upon him from that direction the first time hed done it his stomach had revolted at the first spurt of blood hed never cut into anything so alive so big before but thenþwell then it had been so interesting cutting into such a weighty living thing feeling the pulse beat then slow then fade like a clock run down watching the life drain blood was warm and it pulsed at least it pulsed at first then it just pooled red and wet like a lake the steer didnt fight him he lured it with grain then led it with a rope he wanted to do it dead center of the ranch road sooner or later someone would come along and my oh my what a surprise the birds would circle overhead drawn by the smell of death the wolves might come down lured by it hed had no idea how seductive death could smell until hed caused it he smiled at the steer munching from the bucket of grain ran a hand over the coarse black hide then tugging at the plastic raincoat to be sure it covered him well he raked the knife over the throat in one smooth moveþhe really thought he was getting better at itþand laughed delightedly as blood flew get along little dogie he sang as the steer crumpled to the ground then he got to the interesting work pickles was having a fine time sulking as he drove along the fence line he played several conversations in his head he and jim he and willa then he tried out the words hed use when he complained to ham about how willa had gotten in his face and threatened to fire him as if she could jack mercy had hired him and as far as pickles was concerned nobody but jack mercy could filre him as jack was deadþgod rest his soulþthat was that could be hed just up and quit he had a stake laid by growing interest in the bank down at bozeman he could buy his own ranch start out slow and easy and build it into something fine hed like to see what that bossy female would do if she lost him never make it through the winter he thought sourly much less through a whole damn year and maybe hed just take jim brewster along with him pickles thought conveniently forgetting he was mighty put out at jim the boy was a good hand a hard worker even if he was an ahole most of the time he might just do it buy him some land up north raise some herefords he could take billy along too just for the hell of it and hed keep the ranch pure he thought adding to his fantasy no damn chickens or small grains no pigs no horses but what a man needed as a tool this diversifying shit was just that shit as far as he was concerned it was the only wrong turn jack mercy had ever made letting that indian boy breed horses on cattle land not that he had anything against adam wolfchild the man minded his business kept to himself and he trained some fine saddle horses but it was the principle the girl had her way she and the indian would be running mercy shoulder to shoulder and in pickless opinion theyd run it straight into the ground women he told himself belonged in the goddamn kitchen not out on the land ordering men around fire him his ass he thought with a sniff and turned onto the left fork to see if ham and wood had finished up storm brewing he thought absently then spotted the rig stopped in the road it made him smile if a rig had broken down he had his toolbox in the back hed show anybody in southwest montana with sense enough to scratch their butt that he knew more about engines than anybody within a hundred miles he stopped his rig and tucking his thumbs in the front pockets of his jeans sauntered over got yourself some trouble here he began then stopped short the steer was laid wide open and there was enough blood to bathe in the stink of it had his nostrils flaring as he stepped closer barely glancing at the man crouched beside the body we got us another one jesus fucking christ whats going on around here he bent closer its fresh he began then he sawþthe knife the blood running off the blade and the eyes of the man who held it god almighty you whyd you do it because i can he watched knowledge come into the mans eyes and saw them dan quickly toward the rig because i like it he said softly with some regret he jerked the knife up and plunged it into pickless soft belly never killed a man before he said and yanked the knife upward with a steady nerveless hand its interesting interesting he thought again studying the way pickless eyes went from shocked to pained to dull he kept the knife moving up toward the heart leaning with the body as it fell then straddling it all his fascination with the steer was forgotten this he realized was far bigger game a man had brains he mused pulling his knife free with a wet sucking sound a cow was just stupid and a cat while clever was just a small thing considering he leaned back wondering how to make this moment this new step something special something people would talk about everywhere and for a long long time l then he smiled giggled until he had to press his bloody hand to his mouth he knew just how to make his mark he turned the knife in his hand and went cheerfully to work when willa saw the rider galloping over her pasture she stopped the rig she recognized the big black that ben rode and the dog charlie who was bounding along beside spook like a shadow relief was the first reaction and one she didnt welcome but there was something eerie in the air and shed have been grateful to see the devil himself riding up though it was an impressive sight she sniffed the way he and the black gelding sailed over the fence with a careless bunch and flow of muscle you make a wrong turn mckinnon nope he reined in his horse beside the rig charlie in happy welcome lifted a leg and peed on willas front tire you get that fence fixed he smiled when she stared at him zack saw you had one down when he went up this morning the elk have been a real pain in the ass this year they always are i expect hams dealt with it by now i was going to ride by and check he swung off the horse then leaned in the window is that a sandwich over there she glanced at the second half of her dinner yeah so you going to eat it with a sigh she picked it up and handed it to him did you hunt me down for a free meal thats just a side benefit im going to be shipping some cattle down to the feedlot in colorado but i thought you might want to take a couple hundred head off my hands to finish companionably he broke off a corner of the sandwich tossed it to the hopeful dog she watched the dog gulp down bread and beef then grin the grin she mused wasnt so far off from his masters arrogant selfsatisfied smirk you want to dicker over price here i thought we could do it friendlier over a drink later he reached a hand through the window to toy with the hair that had come loose from her braid i still havent met your oldest sister will shoved the jeep in gear shes not your type slick but you come ahead by if you want she watched him mow through the last bite of sandwich after supper want me to bring my own bottle too she only smiled and eased on the gas after a moments thought ben remounted and trotted after her they both knew she was keeping her speed slow enough so that he could adam going to be around ben raised his voice so she could hear it clearly over the engine im interested in a couple new saddle ponies ask him im too busy to socialize ben to irritate him she accelerated spewing dust in his face still she was disappointed when she took the left fork and he turned and rode off in the opposite direction she wished she could have fought with him about something made him mad enough to grab hold of her again shed been thinking quite a bit about the way hed grabbed hold of her she didnt do a lot of thinking about menþnot that way but it was certainly diverting to thinkþthat wayþabout ben even if she didnt intend to do anything about it unless she changed her mind she grinned to herself she might just change her mind too just to see what it was all about she had a feeling that ben could show her more clearly and more thoroughly than most just what a man could do with a woman maybe shed irritate him into kissing her tonight unless he got distracted by bigbusted tess and her fancy french perfume at that idea she gunned the engine then braked hard as she spotted pickless rig on the curve of the road well shit found him and now she thought shed have to placate him she climbed out scanning the fence line and the pasture on either side she didnt see any sign of him or any reason why he would have left his rig across the road gone off somewhere to sulk she muttered and moved toward the cab of the rig to sound the horn then she saw him him and the steer stretched out in front of the rig side by side in a river of blood she didnt know why she hadnt smelled it not with the way the air was thick and raw with death but the smell reared up and slammed into her gut now and she stumbled toward the side of the road and violently threw up her dinner her stomach continued to heave painfully as she staggered toward her own rig and lay hard on the horn she kept her hand pressed down her head against the window frame as she fought to get her breath turning her head she tried to spit out the taste of sickness clawing in her throat then rubbed her hands over her clammy face when her vision grayed and wavered she bit down hard on her lip but she couldnt make herself walk back down the road couldnt make herself look again giving in she folded her arms and laid her head down she didnt lift it even when she heard the thunder of hoofbeats and charlie s high barks hey ben slid off his horse the rifle slung by its strap over his shoulder willa a springing wildcat wouldnt have surprised him as much as her turning burying her face in his chest ben oh god her arms came around him clung oh god its all right darling its all right now no she squeezed her eyes tight no in front of the rig the other rig theres god the blood okay baby sit down ill see to it grimfaced he eased her down on the running board of the rig frowning when she put her head between her knees and shuddered just sit there will by the look on her face and the din his dog was sounding ben thought it must be another steer or one of the ranch dogs he was already furious before he stepped up to the abandoned rig before he saw it was more much more than a steer sweet jesus he might not have recognized the man not after what had been done to him but he recognized the rig the boots the hat covered with blood lying near the body his stomach twisted with both sickness and fury one thought broke through both as he gave charlie a sharp order to silence whoever did this wasnt simply mad he was evil he turned quickly at the sound behind him then spread out an arm to block willas path dont his voice was rough and the hand on her arm firm theres nothing you can do and no need for you to see that again im all right now she put a hand on bens and stepped closer he was mine and ill look at him she rubbed the heels of her hands under her eyes they scalped him ben for gods sake for gods sweet sake they cut him to pieces and scalped him thats enough his hands werent gentle as he turned her around forced her head back until their eyes met thats enough willa go back to your rig radio the police she nodded but when she didnt move he wrapped his arms around her again cradled her head on his chest just hold on a minute he murmured just hold on to me i sent him out here ben she didnt just hold she burrowed he pissed me off and i told him to ride out here or pack up and pick up his check i sent him out here stop it alarmed by the way her voice fractured on each word he pressed his lips to her hair you know youre not to blame for this he was mine she repeated then shuddering once drew away cover him up ben please he needs to be covered up ill take care of it he touched her cheek wishing he could rub color back into it stay in the rig will he waited until she was back in the vehicle then pulled the greasestained tarp out of the bed of pickless truck it would have to do from the kitchen window lily could see the forest and the climb of mountains into the sky night was coming more quickly as october gave way to november from the window she could watch the sun drop toward the peaks it had hardly been two weeks since shed come to montana but already she knew that once the sun fell behind those shadowy hills night would come swiftly and the air would quickly chix the dark still frightened her she looked forward to the dawns to the days there was so much to do she could spend hours on the chores she was grateful to be useful again to feel a part of something in so short a time she had come to depend on seeing that wide spread of sky the rise of mountains the sea of land shed come to count on hearing the sounds of horses cattle and men and the smell of them she loved her room the privacy of it and the grace and the house with all its space and polished wood the library was stuffed with books and she could read every night if she chose to or listen to music or leave the tv murmuring no one cared what she did with her evenings no one criticized her small mistakes or raised a hand to her not yet adam was so patient and he was gentle as a mother with the horses with her as well she admitted when he guided her hands down a horse s leg to show her how to check for strains he didnt squeeze hed shown her how to use a dandy brush how to medicate a split hoof how to mix supplements for a pregnant mare and when hed caught her feeding an apfie to a yearling on the sly he hadnt lectured hed just smiled the hours they worked together were the best of her life this new world that had opened up for her had given her hope a chance for a future now that could be over a man was dead she shuddered to think of it to be forced to admit that murder had slunk into her bright new world in one vicious stroke a man s life was over and she was once again helpless to control what happened next it shamed her that she thought more of herself and what would happen to her than of the man who had been killed it was true that she hadnt known him with the skill of the hunted lily had easily avoided the men of mercy ranch but he had been part of her new world and it was selfish not to think of him first christ what a mess lily jumped as tess swung into the kitchen and her hand tensed on the dishrag shed forgotten she was holding i made coffee fresh are they is everyone still here wills still talking to the cowboy cops if thats what you mean tess wandered to the stove wrinkled her nose at the coffeepot i stayed out of the way so i dont know whats going on exactly she walked to the pantry opening and closing the door in jerks anything stronger than coffee around here lily twisted the dishrag in her hands i think theres wine but i dont think we should disturb willa to ask tess just rolled her eyes and wrenched open the refrigerator this adequate if slightly inferior bottle of chardonnay is as much ours as hers taking it out tess asked got a corkscrew i saw one earlier she made herself put down the cloth shed already wiped the counters clean twice opening a drawer she took out a corkscrew and handed it to tess i ah made some soup she gestured toward the pot on the stove bess is still running a fever but she managed to eat a bowl of it i thinkþi hope shell be feeling better by tomorrow uhhuh tess searched out wineglasses herself poured sit down lily i think we should talk maybe i should take out some coffee sit down please tess slipped onto the wooden bench of the breakfast nook and waited all right lily sat down across the polished table and folded her hands in her lap tess slid the wineglass over lifted her own i suppose eventually we should get into the story of our lives but this doesnt seem to be the right time from her pocket she took the single cigarette shed slipped out of her secret emergency pack twirling it in her fingers before reaching for the book of matches this is a pretty ugly business yes automatically lily rose fetched an ashtray and brought it back to the table that poor man i dont know which one he was butþ the balding one with the big mustache and bigger belly tess told her and with a shrug for willpower lit the cigarette oh now that she had a face to focus on lily felt the shame grow yes ive seen him he was stabbed wasnt he i think it was worse than that but i dont have a lot of the details other than will found him on one of those roads that go all over the ranch it must have been horrible for her yeah tess grimaced picked up her wine she might not have been fond of her youngest half sister but she wouldnt have wished this particular experience on anyone shell handle it they breed them tough out here anyway she sipped found the wine not quite as inferior as shed thought what about you are you staying or going more out of a need to do something with her hands than a desire for wine lily reached for her glass i dont really have anyplace else to go i suppose youll be going back to california ive thought about it tess leaned back studied the woman across from her keeps her eyes down tess mused and her hands busy shed been certain that shy lily would already have booked a flight to anywhere i figure it this way people are murdered every day in la kids regularly whack each other for painting graffiti in the wrong territory there are drug hits every time you blink shootings knifings muggings bludgeonings she smiled god i love that town catching lilys appalled expression tess threw back her head and laughed sorry she managed after a moment pressing a hand to her heart my point is that as bad as this is as close as it is its only one murder comparatively it just isnt that big a deal certainly not big enough to chase me away from collecting whats mine lily drank again struggled to gather her thoughts youre staying youre going to stay yeah im going to stay nothings changed i i thoughtþ closing her eyes lily let the relief run through her and twine with the shame i was sure you wouldnt and then id have to leave she opened her eyes again soft quiet blue with hints of haunted gray thats horrible that poor mans dead and all ive been able to think about is how it affects me thats just honest you didnt know him hey because there was something about lily that tugged at her tess reached for her sisters hand dont beat yourself up over it weve all got a lot at stake here were entitled to think about whats ours lily looked down at the joined hands tesss were so pretty she thought with the glitter of rings and the enviable strength and confidence in the fingers she lifted her gaze i didnt do anything to deserve this place neither did you tess merely nodded and withdrawing her hand lifted her glass again i didnt do anything to deserve being ignored my entire life and neither did you willa came into the kitchen stopped short when she saw the women at the table her face was still pale her movements still jerky after all the questions the going over and over her discovery of the body shed been more than happy to see the police on their way well this is cozy she slipped her hands into her pockets as she stepped toward the table her fingers still tended to shake i figured the two of you would be packing not sitting around having a chat weve been talking about that tess lifted an eyebrow but made no comment when will picked up her wineglass and drank were not going anywhere is that so because wine seemed like a fine idea willa crossed to the cupboards and took out a tumbler then she just stood there unable to move barely able to think she hadnt been able to fully consider the loss of the ranch it had been there in the back of her mind the certainty that the two women who had been pushed on her would run and with them would go her life but it wasnt until now until she knew they would stay that it hit her and it hit hard giving in she rested her head against the cupboard door and closed her eyes pickles dear god would she see him for the rest of her life what had been done to him what had been left of him and all that blood baking in the sun the way his eyes had stared up at her the horror frozen in them but the ranch for now was safe oh god oh god oh god she didnt realize shed moaned it out loud until lily laid a tentative hand on her shoulder shrinking from the touch willa straightened quickly i made soup lily felt foolish saying it but could think of nothing else you should eat something i dont think i could handle food right now willa stepped back afraid that too much comfort would break her she walked back to the table and under tesss fascinated eye filled the tumbler full of wine thats good tess murmured watching in admiration as willa gulped wine like water thats damn good how long can you do that and still stand up well have to find out she turned when the kitchen door opened drew a steadying breath when ben came in she didnt want to berate herself for leaning on him for collapsing in his arms for letting him do the dirty work while she had sat by too ill to function but it was hard to swallow ladies in a gesture that mimicked willas habit he took the glass from her hand and sipped heres to the end of a lousy day ill drink to that tess did as she studied him the gilded cowboy she mused and a mouthwaterer im tess you must be ben mckinnon nice to meet you sorry it isnt under more pleasant circumstances he lifted a hand to willas chin turned her face to his go lie down i have to talk to the men no you dont what you have to do is go lie down and turn this off for a while im not going to pull the covers over my head becauseþ theres nothing you can do he interrupted she was trembling he could feel just how hard she was fighting it but the tremors came through and into his fingertips youre sick and youre tired and youve just had to relive an ugly experience half a dozen times adam is taking the cops down to talk to the men in the bunkhouse and theres nothing for you to do but try to get some sleep my men areþ whos going to pull them together tomorrowþand the day afterþif you break down he inclined his head when she shut her mouth now you can go up and lie down under your own steam will or ill take you myself either way thats what youre going to do right now tears burned the back of her eyes bubbled hot in her throat too proud to shed them in front of him she shoved his hand aside swiveled on her heel and stalked out im impressed tess murmured when the kitchen door slammed i didnt think anyone could push her around shed have pushed back but she knew shed break will wont let herself break he frowned into his wine wishing hed been able to gentle her into it instead of browbeating her i dont know many who could have gotten through what she did today without breaking should she be alone lily pressed her fingers to her lips i could go up with her but i dont know if shed want that no shes better off alone but ben smiled pleased that shed offered this hasnt exactly been a weekend at a dude ranch resort for either of you but ill say welcome to montana anyway i love it here the minute shed said it lily flushed and scrambled to her feet as tess chuckled would you like something to eat i made soup and theres plenty of fixings for sandwiches angel if thats your soup im smelling id be grateful to have a bowl good tess sure why the hell not since lily seemed eager to serve tess stayed where she was tapping her fingers on the table do the police think it was someone from the ranch who did it ben slid in across from her i imagine theyll concentrate here first anyway theres no public access to the ranch but that doesnt mean someone from outside couldnt have found the way out there a horse a jeep he moved his shoulders skimmed a hand through his hair its easy enough access from three rocks to mercy land hell i was there myself he lifted an eyebrow at tesss speculative look of course i can tell you i didnt do it but you dont know me its also possible to get there through the rocking r ranch or nates place or the high country wellþtess poured herself more wineþthat certainly narrows things down doesnt it ill tell you thisþanyone who knows the mountains the land around here could hide out for months go pretty much wherever the hell he pleased and be damn hard to find we appreciate your easing our minds she flicked a glance at lily as she set steaming bowls on the table dont we lily id rather know lily sat on the edge of the bench next to tess and folded her hands again you can take precautions better if you know thats exactly right id say a good precaution would be for neither of you to wander far from the house here alone for the time being im not much of a wanderer though her stomach suddenly felt uneasy tess spooned up soup and lily sticks pretty close to adam she looked at ben is he a suspect i dont know what the police think but i can tell you that adam wolfchild would no more gut and scalp a man than hed sprout wings and fly to idaho he glanced over when tesss spoon crashed onto the table hed have cursed himself if it would have done any good im sorry i thought you knew the details no tess went for the wine rather than the soup we didnt she saw that lily twisted her hands in her lap she found that and shell live with that they both would ben thought for it was an image he knew would never completely fade from his memory i dont want to scare you i just want you to be careful you can count on it tess promised him but what about her she jerked a thumb toward the ceiling youre not going to keep her close to the house without shackles adam will keep an eye on her and so will i hoping to ease the tension he spooned up more soup and hanging around here isnt going to be much of a hardship if this is the kind of cooking im in for both women jumped when the outside door opened adam came in along with the night chill theyre done with me for now join the party tess invited soup and wine is our menu tonight he gave her a solemn look before studying lily i think id go for coffee no sit he added when lily started to get up i can get it myself i just came by to check on willa ben made her go up and lie down nerves and relief had words bubbling out before lily could stop them she needed to rest i can fix you some soup you should eat something and theres plenty i can get it sit down theres bread i forgot to put the bread out i shouldþ you should sit he spoke very quietly as he ladled up soup and try to relax he filled a second bowl brought both to the table and you should eat ill get the bread she stared at him baffled while he moved competently around the kitchen none of the men in her life had so much as picked up a dish unless it was to ask for seconds she flicked a glance at ben looking for the sneer but he continued to eat as though there was nothing unusual at all about having a man serve food do you want me to stay over adam give you a hand with things for a day or two no thanks anyway well have to take it a step at a time he sat down across from lily and looked her in the eye are you all right she nodded picked up her spoon and tried to eat pickles didnt have any family adam continued i think there was a sister maybe down in wyoming i guess well try to find her if shes still around but id say well handle the arrangements once they release the body you ought to have nate do that ben broke off a hunk of bread willa will pass that to him if you suggest it all right ill do that i dont think shed have gotten through this without you i want you to know that i just happened to be there it still unnerved him the way shed all but crawled into his arms and the way shed fit when she had once shes over the shock shell likely be sorry it was me who was youre wrong shell be grateful and so am i he turned his hand over palm up where there was a long thin scar between the lines of heart and head brother bens lips twitched as he looked at the similar mark on his own hand and he remembered when two young boys had stood on the banks of a river in the halflight of a canyon and solemnly mixed their blood in brotherhood uhoh male ritual time absurdly touched tess nudged lily so that she could slide out thats my cue to leave you gentlemen to your port and cigars while i go up and do something exciting like paint my toenails appreciating her ben grinned i bet theyre real pretty too sweetheart they are awesome it was simple to decide she liked him and not a very large step from there to decide to trust him i guess ill range myself with adam and say im grateful you were here good night ill go too lily reached down for tesss halfeaten bowl of soup dont go adam laid a hand over hers you havent eaten youll want to talk i can take it up with me dont run off on my account pretty sure that he saw how the wind blew here ben slid off the bench ive got to get home i appreciate the meal lily he reached up to touch her cheek felt her instinctive wince of defense smoothly he dropped his hand as if the moment hadnt happened you eat while its hot he advised ill be around tomorrow adam good night ben adam kept his hand over lilys giving it a coaxing tug until she sat again then he took her other hand linked his fingers in hers and waited until she lifted her eyes to his dont be afraid i wont let anything happen to you im always afraid her hands flexed under his but he judged it was time to take the chance so he continued to hold them you came to a strange place with only strangers around you and you stayed theres courage there i only came to hide you dont know me adam i will when you let me he released one of her hands lifted his own and brushed his thumb over the faded bruise beneath her eye she went very still watched him warily as he traced his thumb down to the marks on her jaw i want to know you lily when youre ready why his eyes smiled and stirred her heart because you understand horses and you sneak kitchen scraps to my dogs the smile moved to his mouth when she flushed and because you make good soup now eat he said and released her hand before its cold watching him from under her lashes she picked up her spoon and ate upstairs armed with a book shed chosen from the library and a bottle of mineral water shed taken from behind the bar tess walked toward her room she had decided to read until her eyes crossed hoping that it would bring her undisturbed and dreamless sleep her imagination was much too vivid she thought it was the very reason she was beginning to make her mark as a screenwriter and the very reason that the details ben had provided were going to shift and stir until they formed many ugly visions in her head she had great hope that the thick paperback romance whose cover promised plenty of passion and adventure would steer her mind to other venues then she passed willas door and heard the bitter broken weeping she hesitated wished to hell shed thought to come up the other stairs more wished the helpless sobbing didnt touch a chord in her when a strong woman wept she thought the tears came from the deepest and darkest corners of the heart she lifted a hand to knock then on an oath just laid her palm on the wood perhaps if they had known each other or if they had been complete strangers she could have gone in if they had had no ghosts between them no harbored resentments she could have opened that door and offered something but she knew she wouldnt be welcomed there could be no womantowoman comfort here much less sister to sister and realizing she was sorry for that very sorry she continued to her own room carefully closed carefully locked the door behind her but she no longer thought her dreams would be undisturbed in the dark in the middle of the night when the wind kicked up and threatened and the rain came hard and vicious he lay smiling reliving every moment of the kill second by second brought a curious thrill it had been like being someone else while it was happening he realized someone with vision so clear with nerves so steady he was barely human he hadnt known hed had that inside him he hadnt known he would like it so much poor old pickles to keep from laughing aloud he pressed both hands to his mouth like a child giggling in church he hadnt had anything against the old fart but hed come along at the wrong time and needs must needs must he thought again snorting into his hands thats what his dear old ma had always said even when shed been stoned shed been happy to dispense such homilies needs must a stitch in time early to bed and a penny saved bloods thicker than water recovered he let out a breath and dropped his hands on his belly he remembered how the knife had slid into pickless belly all those layers of fat he mused patting himself it had been like stabbing a pillow then there had been that sucking sound the kind you could make giving a woman a nice fat hickey to brand her but the best the very best had been lifting what was left of pickles s hair not that it made much of a trophy all thin and straggly but the way the knife had made that wicked flap had been so fascinating and the blood good jesus did he bleed he wished he could have taken more time with it maybe done a little victory dance now the next time he had to stifle another chuckle for there would be a next time he was through with cattle and pets humans were much more challenging hed have to be careful and hed have to wait if he took another one too quick it would spoil the anticipation and he wanted to choose the next one not just stumble over someone maybe he should do a woman he could take her into the trees where he had hidden his trophies he could cut her clothes away while she was begging him not to hurt her then he could rape the shit out of her he grew hard thinking of it idly stroked himself while he planned it would certainly add a new thrill to be able to take his time over it to watch his prey watch the eyes bulge with fear as he explained every little thing he was going to do it had to be even better that way when they knew but he would need to practice a woman would be the next stage and he hadnt perfected this one yet no rush he thought dreamily and began to masturbate in earnest no rush at all f wint f þ l l s j l f s f s they that know the winters of that country know them to be sharp and violent þwilliam bradford even murder couldnt stop work the men were jumpy but they etook orders now that they were another hand short willa pushed herself to take up the slack she rode fences drove out to the fields to check on the harvest manned the squeeze shoot herself and huddled over the record books at night the weather turned and turned fast the chill in the air threatened winter and there was frost on the pastures every morning what cattle wouldnt be wintered over had to be shipped to feed pens for finishingþmercys own outside of ennis or down to colorado if she wasnt on horseback or driving a fourwheeler she went up with jim in the plane shed considered getting her pilots license but had quickly discovered that air travel didnt suit her she didnt care for the noise of the engine or how the quick dips and turns affected her stomach her father had loved to buzz the land in the little cessna the first time shed flown with him shed been miserably ill it had been the last time he had taken her up now that there was only jim qualified to pilotþand he had a tendency to hotdogþshe wondered if shed have to reconsider an operation like mercy needed a backup pilot and maybe if she was at the controls she wouldnt gct lightheaded or nauseous pretty as a picture from up here grinning jim dipped the wings and willa felt her breakfast slide greasily toward her throat looks like we got another fence down cheerfully he dropped altitude to get a closer look willa gritted her teeth and made a mental note of their position she forced herself to scan the cattle take a broad head count we need to rotate those cows before they take the grass down she hissed between her teeth when the plane angled sharply cant you fly this damn thing straight sorry he tucked his tongue in his cheek to hold back a chuckle but when he got a look at her face he leveled off gently she was a pale shade of green you oughtnt to come up will leastwise without taking some of those airsick pills first i took the damn things she concentrated on her breathing wished she could appreciate the beauty of the land the pastures green and glinting with frost the hills thick with trees the peaks white with snow want me to take us down im handling it barely well finish but when she looked down again she saw the road where she had found the body the police had taken the body away had even taken the mutilated carcass of the steer theyd combed the area looking for and gathering evidence and the rain had washed away most of the blood still she thought she could see darker patches on the dirt that had soaked in deep she couldnt tear her eyes away and even when they flew past and over pasture she could still see the road the dark patches jim kept his eyes trained on the horizon the police came by again last night i know they havent found anything its been damn near a week will they dont have squat the anger in his voice cleared her vision helped her turn her eyes away and toward his face i guess its not like the tv shows jim sometimes they just dont get the bad guy i keep thinking how i won that money off him the night before it happened i wish i hadnt won that money off him will i know it doesn t mean a damn but i wish i hadnt she reached over gave his shoulder a quick squeeze and i wish i hadnt had words with him that doesnt mean a damn either but i wish i hadnt goddamn bitchy old fart thats what he was just a goddamn bitchy old fart his voice hitched and jim cleared his throat iþwe heard you were maybe going to bury him in mercy cemetery nate hasnt been able to locate his sister or anyone well bury him on mercy land i guess bess would say that was fittin it is its good of you will to put him where theres only family he cleared his throat again the boys and me were tlking we thought maybe we could be like the pallbearers and wed pay for his stone his color rose when he caught willa staring at him it was hams idea but we all agreed to it if you do then thats the way well do it she turned her head stared out the window lets go down jim ive seen enough for now when willa drove back rnro the ranch yard she spotted nates rig and bens deliberately she stopped in front of adams little white house she needed time before she faced anyone her legs werent much steadier than her stomach there was a headache brought on she supposed by the incessant humming of the plane kicking behind her eyes she climbed out stepped through the gate of the picket fence and indulged herself by squatting down to pet beans he was fat as a sausage with floppy ears and huge mop paws elated to see her he rolled over to offer his belly for a rub you fat old thing you going to lie here and sleep all day he thumped his tail in agreement and made her smile your back ends wide as a barn her voice brought adams spotted hound nosey racing around the side of the house with his ears perked up and his tail waving like a flag he trotted over and pushed himself under willas arm been up to no good again havent you nosey dont think i dont know youve had your eye on my chickens he grinned at her and in his attempt to lick her hands her face stepped on his buddy when the two dogs began to wrestle and dance willa got to her feet she felt better maybe it was just being in adam s yard where the fall flowers were still stubbornly blooming and dogs had nothing better to do than play you finished fooling with those useless dogs she looked over her shoulder ham stood on the other side of the gate a cigarette dangling from his mouth his jacket was buttoned and he wore leather gloves making her think perhaps he felt the cold more these days i reckon i am and youre finished flying around in that death trap she ran her tongue over her teeth as she walked toward him in his sixtyfive years ham had never been inside a plane of any kind and he was damn proud of it seems like we need to rotate cattle ham and weve got another fence down i want those cows moved from the southmost pasture today ill put billy on it only take him twice as long to do it as anybody with half a brain jim can handle the fencing woods got his hands full down at the fields and ive gotta get the shipment down to the feedlot is this your notsosubtle way of telling me were running thin im going to talk to you about that he waited until she came through the gate took his time enjoying his smoke we could use another hand two would be best but its my thinking you should wait till spring at least to hire on he flicked the miserly butt of his cigarette away watched it fly behind them beans and nosey whined at the gate hoping for more attention pickles was a pain in the ass the man would bitch if the sun was shining or if a cloud covered it up he just liked to complain but he was a good cowboy and a halfway good mechanic jim told me that you and the men want to buy his stone only seems right worked with the picky old bastard damn near twenty years he continued to stare out at middle distance hed already looked into her face seen what was there you aint helping anybody blaming yourself for what happened to him i sent him out thats crap and you know it you may be a stiffnecked temperamental female but you aint stupid she nearly smiled i cant get past it ham i just cant he knew that understood that because he knew her understood her finding him the way you did thats going to prey on you nothing much to do about that but wait it out he looked back at her again shifted his disreputable hat against the angle of the sun working yourself into the ground isnt going to make it go away any quicker were two hands short she began but he only shook his head will you aint sleeping much and youre eating less beneath the grizzled beard his lips curved slightly bess being back on her feet i get plenty of the news from inside the main house that woman can talk the ears off a rabbit and even if she wasnt rattling away at me every chance she gets i could see it for myself ive got a lot on my mind i know that his voice roughened with his own brand of affection im just saying you dont have to have your hand in every inch of this ranch ive been here since before you were born and if you dont trust me to do my job well maybe you should be looking for three new hands come spring you know i trust you its notþ she broke off sucked in a breath thats low ham pleased with himself he nodded yeah he knew her all right he understood her and he loved her as long as it makes you stop and think we can get through the winter the way things are that oldest boy of woods is coming along fine hell be twelve before long and he can pull his weight the younger ones a goddamn farmer bmed by it ham took out another cigarette rolled fresh that morning rather bale hay than sit a horse but hes a good worker so wood claims well do well enough through winter with what weve got all right anything else again he took his time but since he had her attention he figured he might as well finish up them sisters of yours you might tell the shorthaired one to buy her some jeans that dont fit like skin every time she walks by that fool billy drops his tongue on his boots hes going to hurt himself it was the first laugh shed had in days and i dont suppose you look do you ham i look plenty he blew out smoke but im old enough not to hurt myself the other one sits a horse real pretty he squinted gestured with his cigarette well you can see that for yourself willa looked down the road saw the riders heading east adam sat on his favored pinto hatless and flanked by two riders willa had to admit that lily handled the roan mare well moving as smooth as silk with the mares gait on the other hand tess was jogging in the saddle atop a pretty chestnut her heels were up rather than down her butt bouncing against leather in quick jerky slaps that had to hurt and she appeared to be gripping the saddle horn for dear life christ will she be sore tonight amused willa leaned on the gate how long has that been going on last couple days seems she took it in her mind to learn to ride adams been working with her he shook his head as tess nearly slid out of the saddle dont know if even that boy can do anything with her you could saddle moon and catch up with them they dont need me thats not what i said you should take yourself a nice long ride will its always what worked best for you maybe she thought about it a nice long gallop with the wind slapping her face and clearing her mind maybe later for another moment she watched the three riders and envied them the easy camaraderie maybe later she repeated and climbed back in her rig willa wasn t surprised to find both nate and ben in the kitchen enjoying besss barbecued beef to keep bess from scolding her for not eating she took a plate herself pulled up a chair about time you got back a bit disappointed that she hadnt been able to order the girl to eat bess fell onto the next best thing past dinnertime foods still warm willa commented and made herself take the first bite since youre busy feeding half the county you shouldnt have missed me got worse manners than a field hand bess plopped a mug of coffee at willas elbow sniffed ive got too much work to do to stand around here trying to teach you better she flounced out wiping her hands on a dish towel shes been watching for you for the past half hour nate pushed his empty plate away picked up his own coffee she worries she doesnt need to she will as long as you keep riding out alone willa spared ben a look then shell have to get over it pass the salt he did so slapping it in front of her on the opposite end of the table nate rubbed the back of his neck im glad you got back will ive got some papers for you fine ill look at them later she drizzled salt over her beef that explains why youre here she looked pointedly at ben i had business with adam horse business and i stuck around in my supervisory capacity and for the free meal i asked ben to stay nate put in before willa could snarl i talked to the police this morning theyll be releasing the body tomorrow he waited a moment for willa to nod to accept some of the papers i have for you deal with the funeral arrangements theres also some financial business pickles had a small passbook savings account and a standard checking combined were only talking about maybe thirtyfive hundred he owed nearly that on his rig im not worried about the money she couldnt have eaten now if thered been a gun to her head id appreciate it if youd just handle the details and bill the ranch please nate all right he took a legal pad out of the briefcase at his feet scribbled some notes as to his personal effects theres no family no heirs and he never had a will made there wouldnt be much anyway misery settled over her heavy and thick his clothes his saddle tools ill leave that to the men if thats all right i think thats the way it should be ill handle the legal points he touched a hand to hers let it linger briefly if you think of anything or you have any questions just give me a call im obliged no need to be he unfolded himself and stood if you dont mind im going to borrow a horse ride out after adam to ah youre going to have to think faster than that ben told him if youre going to lie about sniffing after a woman nate only grinned and took his hat from the hook by the back door thank bess for the meal ill be around willa frowned at the door nate closed behind him sniffing after what woman your big sister wears some mighty pretty perfume she snorted picked up her plate and took it to the counter beside the sink hollywood nates got more sense than that the right perfume can kick the sense right out of a man you didnt eat your dinner lost my appetite curious she turned back leaned on the counter is that what yanks your chain ben fancy perfume it doesnt hurt he leaned back in his chair of course soap and leather on the right kind of skin can do the same damn thing being females a powerful and mysterious thing he picked up his coffee watching her over the rim of the cup but i guess youd know that doesnt matter around a ranch which way your skin stretches like hell every time you go within five feet of young billy his eyes cross she smiled a little because it was pure truth hes eighteen and randy as they come saying the word breastaround him drains all the blood out of his head into his lap hell get over it not if hes lucky feeling friendlier she crossed her feet at the ankles i dont know how you men tolerate it having your ego your personality and your idea of romance all dangling between your legs its a trial are you going to sit down and finish your coffee ive got work thats what youve said every time ive come within five feet of you the last couple of days he picked up her mug rose and carried it to her you keep working and not eating willa youre going to end up flat on your face he took her chin in his hand and gave her a long long look and the face isnt half bad youre grabbing onto it enough lately she jerked her head struggling to remain cool when his fingers stayed put whats your problem mckinnon i dont have one to test them both he skimmed a finger up and over her mouth it had a shape to it he mused even in a snarl that made a man want a bite but you seem to have one ive been noticing youre jumpy around me lately used to be you were just mean maybe you cant tell the difference yeah i can he shifted boxing her neatly between the counter and his body you know what i think will he had broad shoulders long legs lately shed been entirely too aware of the size and shape of him im not interested in what you think being a cautious man with a good memory he pressed against her to block a wellaimed knee ill tell you anyway he took his hand off her chin and gathered up the hair shed left loose that morning you do smell of soap and leather now that im close enough to tell any closer youd be on the other side of me then theres all this hair a good yard of it straight as a pin and soft as silk he kept his eyes on hers drew her head back a fraction more your hearts pounding and theres this little pulse right here in your throat he used his free hand to trace it feel it skitter jumping so hard its a wonder it doesnt come right through the skin and bounce into my hand she wasnt entirely sure it wouldnt happen if he didnt give her room to breathe youre irritating me ben it took every ounce of effort to keep her voice even im seducing you willa he all but purred it in words like honey and his smile came slow and potent when she trembled thats what youre afraid of to my way of thinking that i could and i will and you wont be able to do a damn thing about it back off her voice wasnt steady now nor were the hands she lifted to his chest no he tugged her hair again not this time you said yourself not long ago that you dont want me any more than i want you what was happening inside her she wondered in panic the shivering and shakes the long liquid pulls theres no point in playing like you do just to annoy me i was wrong what i should have said was that i want you every bit as much as you want me i was irritated over it youre just scared of it im not scared of you what was happening inside her was frightening but not because of him she promised herself it wasnt because of him prove it those eyes of his sharp green and close lit with challenge right here right now fine accepting the dare afraid not to she grabbed a handful of his hair and dragged his mouth down to hers he had the mckinnon mouth she realized like zacks it was full and firm but there the similarity ended none of the dreamy kisses shed shared with zack years before compared to this burst this shock of having a mans skillful lips devouring hers or the hot impatient way he used tongue and teeth to simply overpower to focus every thought every feeling every need into that point where mouth met mouth the edge of the counter bit into her back the fingers shed twined through his hair curled into a hard taut fist and the primal male taste of him coursed through her body and left it in ruins he hadnt given her even a moment to defend herself he didnt intend to he felt her body jerk stiffen against the onslaught and wondered if what was battling through her was even close to what was battling through him hed expected heat or cold she had both in her hed expected power for she was anything but weak hed hoped to find pleasure as her mouth seemed to have been created to give and to take it he hadnt known hed find them all a rage of all that would slam into him like bareknuckled fists and leave him reeling goddamn it he dragged his mouth away stared into her eyes so big and dark and shocked goddamn it all to hell and his mouth came down on hers again to feed she moaned a sound trapped in her throat a sound he could feel when he closed his hand over that smooth column and squeezed lightly he wanted to taste there just there where that pulse jumped and that moan sounded but for the life of him he couldnt get enough of her mouth and she was holding him now holding hard moving against him hips grinding he closed a hand over her breast so firm through the flannel when it wasnt enough not nearly enough he yanked her shirt free of her jeans and streaked under to flesh the feel of his hand hard and callused and strong on her had the muscles in her thighs going loose the tension in her stomach pushing toward pain his thumb flicked over her nipple ricocheting bullets of heat from point to point through her overtaxed system she went limp might have slid through his arms like vapor if he hadnt changed his grip that sudden and utter surrender aroused him more than all the flash and fire we need to finish this he cupped her breast fingers skimming stroking as he waited for her eyes to open and meet his and though its tempting to go right on with it here bess might be miffed if she came in and found us waxing her floor the way i have in mind back off she fought to suck in air i cant breathe back off im having some trouble with that myself well breathe later he lowered his head nipped at her jaw come home with me willa let me have you im not going to do that she struggled free stumbled to the table and braced her palms on it for balance she had to think had to but she could only feel keep away she snapped when he moved toward her keep away and let me breathe it was the lick of real panic in her voice that had him leaning back against the counter all right breathe it isnt going to change anything he reached for the mug of coffee beside him and when he noted his hands werent steady left it where it sat i dont know if im too pleased about this either fine thats just fine steadier she straightened faced him you think because youve talked a dozen women onto their backs you can just come in here and talk me onto mine easy pickings too since ive never done it before cant be more than ten women by my count he said easily and i didnt have to he broke off eyes going wide jaw dropping never done what exactly you know damn well what exactly ever he pushed his hands into his pockets at all ever she merely stared waiting for him to laugh then shed have the perfect excuse to kill him but i figured you and zack he trailed off again realizing that might not have sat too well with him under the circumstances did he say i did her eyes narrowed to slits as she poised ready to spring no he neverþno at a loss ben dragged a hand out of his pocket and raked it through his hair i just figured thats all i just figured you at some time or other well hell willa youre a grown woman of course i figured youdþ slept around no not exactly hand me a shovel he thought im getting tired of digging this hole for myself with my bare hands youre a goodlooking woman he began and winced knowing he could have done better than that would have too if his tongue wasnt so tangled up i just assumed that youd had some experience in the area well i havent temper was clearing just enough to let in flickers of embarrassment and its up to me when and if i want to change that and who i want to change it with absolutely i wouldnt have pushed if id realized he couldnt take his eyes off her the way she stood there all flushed and rumpled with that sexy mouth swollen from his or maybe id have pushed different ive been thinking about you that way for a while suspicion flickered in her eyes why damned if i know it just is now that ive had my hands on you id have to say im going to be thinking more youve got a nice feel to you willa the humor came back curving his lips and you were doing a damn fine job of kissing me back for an amateur youre not the first man ive kissed and you wont be the last that doesnt mean you cant practice on meþwhen you get the urge he walked over to take his hat and jacket from the pegs by the door if either of them noticed that he gave her a wide berth neither commented what are friends for i dont have any trouble controlling my urges youre telling me he said with feeling and fit his hat on his head but i have a notion im about to have a hell of a time controlling mine where youre concerned he opened the door gave her one long last look youve got one hell of a mouth willa one hell of a mouth he shut the door shrugged into his jacket as he circled around the house toward his rig he let out a whistling breath hed thought a little nuzzling in the kitchen would take both of their minds off the trouble hanging over mercy it had done a hell of a lot more than that he rubbed a hand over his belly knowing the knots twisting inside would be there for quite a while yet shed gotten to him and gotten to him hard and the fact that she had no idea what they could do to each other in the dark only made it more terrifying and arousing hed always chosen women who knew the ropes who understood the pleasures the rules and the responsibilities women he admitted who didnt expect more than a good healthy ride where nobody got hurt nobody got hobbled he glanced back at the house as he climbed behind the wheel turned the key in the ignition it wouldnt be so simple with willa not when hed be her first he drove away from mercy without a clue to what he would do about her all he knew for certain was that willa was going to have to accept that ben mckinnon was going to be the one shed change things with he glanced toward the bunkhouse as he drove past and thought of everything shed been through in the past few weeks enough he thought to break anyone to bits anyone but willa letting out a long sigh he headed for his own land hed be there for her whether she liked it or not and hed take it slow in that certain area hed even try his hand at being gentle but hed be there snow came hard and fast and early it buried the pastures and had the drift fences groaning men worked day and night to see that the cattleþtoo stupid to dig through the snow to grassþwere fed and tended november proved to be a poor boundary against winter and before the end of it the valley was socked in skiers came flocking to big sky and other resorts to schuss down slopes and drink brandy by roaring fires tess gave some thought to joining them for a day or two not that shed ever been much on skiing but the brandy sounded fine in any case there would be people conversations perhaps flirtations certainly civilization it might be worth strapping herself to a couple of slats of wood and tumbling down a mountain she talked to her agent constantly using ira more as a bridge to her life than a representative of her work she wrote making progress with a new screenplay and detailing daily life in her journal not that she considered the routine on the ranch much of a life she continued to take charge of the chickens and was actually rather pleased that she had a handle on the job now and could slip an egg from under a broody hen without so much as a peck she had a bad moment very bad one day when she strolled behind the coop and walked into bess quickly competently ruthlessly wringing the neck of one of tesss flock thered been a lot of squawking thenþthough not from the chickens two of them lay dead as judas on the ground while the women shouted at each other over the corpses tess had skipped dinner that nightþchicken pot pieþbut it had taught her the error of assigning names to her beaked and feathered friends every evening she made use of the indoor pool with its curvedglass wall and southern exposure and shed decided there was something to be said for looking at snow while she lounged in her personal lake with steam rising around her yet every morning she rose crossed her eyes at the view of snow out her window and dreamed of palm trees and lunching at mortons she kept up her horseback riding out of sheer stubbornness it was true that she didnt climb whimpering out of the saddle with muscles screaming now and shed developed a certain wary affection for marie the mare adam had assigned her still riding out into the wind and the cold wasnt her idea of high entertainment jesus jesus christ tess stepped outside hunched inside the thick wool jacket and wished shed pulled on two pairs of long underwear its like breathing broken glass how does anyone stand this adam says it makes you appreciate spring more to ward off the wind lily wrapped her scarf more securely around her neck yet she appreciated the winterþthe majestic powerful sweep of it the way the snow seemed to freeze the peaks into sharp relief against the sheer wall of sky the dark belt of trees that clung to the rising foothills was so prettily draped with snow and the silver of rock and ridge formed shadows and contrasts like folds in a stunning blanket its so beautiful miles and miles of white and the pines the skys so blue it almost hurts your eyes she smiled at tess its nothing like a city snow i dont have much experience with snow but id say this is nothing like anything she flexed her fingers in her gloves as they walked toward the horse barn at least the ranch yard was negotiable tess thought paths to and from paddocks and corrals had been plowed and the roads had been scraped off as well with a blade attached to one of the fourwheelers young billy had done that she remembered hed appeared to be having the time of his life she watched her breath plume out in front of her and was tempted to complain again but it was beautiful coldly beautiful the sky was such a hard brittle blue she expected it to crack at any moment and the mountains that speared into it were so well defined in the clear air that they seemed to have been painted sunlight danced off the fields of snow in glittering sparks and when the wind rushed it lifted that snow and those dancing lights into the air in thin drifts palm trees warm beaches and mi tis seemed lightyears away whats she up to today tess pulled out sunglasses and put them on willa she went out early in one of the pickups tesss mouth thinned alone she almost always goes alone asking for trouble tess muttered and stuck her hands in her pockets she must think shes invincible if whoever killed that man is still around you dont think that do you alarmed lily began to scan the fields as if a madman might rise up out of one of the drifts like a grinning gnome the police havent come up with anything i thought it had to be someone camped in the hills with this weather he couldnt still be here and its been weeks sinceþsince it happened sure thats right though she was far from convinced tess saw no reason to set lilys nerves more on edge nobodyd camp out in this cold especially some itinerant maniac i guess she just gets under my skin she narrowed her eyes at the rig heading toward the ranch from the west road speak of the devil maybe if youþ lily broke off shook her head no go ahead maybe if i what maybe if you didnt try so hard to irritate her oh its not so hard tesss lips curved in anticipation in fact its effortless she changed directions as the rig pulled up been out surveying the lower forty tess asked as willa rolled down her window are you still here i thought you were going to big sky to soak in a jacuzzi and hustle men im thinking about it willa shifted her attention to lily if adams taking you out go soon and dont stay long snows coming in she flicked her eyes toward the sky the telltale clouds piling together in thick layers you may want to tell him i spotted a herd of mule deer northwest of here about a mile and a half you might like to see them i would she patted her pocket i have my camera can you come with us bess sent plenty of coffee along no ive got things to do and nates coming by later oh tess lifted an eyebrow struggled to sound casual when willa slid the gearshift into first later she repeated and drove away toward the house she knew very well that tess had her eye on nate and she didnt intend to encourage it as far as she was concerned nate would be completely out of his depth with a slick hollywood piranha and maybe he had his eye focused right back but that was only because men always got dopey around beautiful stacked women grabbing her thermos of coffee from the seat beside her willa climbed out of the rig tess was beautiful and stacked she admitted with just a quick twinge of envy and confident and quicktongued so sure of herself and her control over her own femininity and her power over men willa wondered if shed be more like that if shed had a mother to teach her the ropes if shed been raised in a different environment where there were females giggling over hairdos and hemlines over lipstick shades and perfume not that she wanted that she assured herself as she stepped inside and pulled off her gloves she wasnt interested in all that fussing and foolishness but she was beginning to think those very things could add to a womans confidence around men and she wasnt feeling as confident as she wanted to at least not around one man she shucked her coat and hat then carried the thermos with her to the office upstairs shed changed nothing inside it yet it was still jack mercys domain with its trophy heads and whiskey decanters and entering walking over seating herself at his desk always brought a quick twist to her gut grief she wondered or fear she just wasnt sure any longer but the office itself brought on a swarm of unpleasant and unhappy emotions and memories she had rarely come in there when he was alive if he sent for her ordered her to take a chair across from that desk it was to criticize or to shuffle her duties she could see him perfectly sitting where she sat now a cigar clamped between his fingers and if it was evening and the workday finished a glass of whiskey on the blotter girl hed called her hed rarely used her name girl you fucked up good this time girl you better start pulling weight around here youd better get yourself a husband girl and start having babies youre no use otherwise had there ever been kindness in this room she asked herself and rubbed hard at her temples she wanted badly to remember even one moment one incident when she came in here and found him sitting behind this desk and smiling one time only one time when hed told her he was proud of what shed done of anything shed done but she couldnt smiles and kind words hadnt been jack mercys style and what would he say now she wondered if he walked in here and saw her if he knew what had happened on the land to one of his men while shed been in charge you fucked up girl she rested her head in her hands a moment wishing she had an answer for that in her mind she knew shed done nothing to cause a vicious murder but in her heart the responsibility weighed heavy done and over she murmured she opened a drawer took out record books she wanted to check them over the careful detailing of number of head of weight the pasture rotations the additives and grain shed make sure there was not one figure out of place before nate came later today to look over her accounts burying her resentment that he or anyone had power over mercy she got to work nearly two miles from the ranch house lily happily snapped pictures of mule deer it made her laugh to look at them with their shaggy winter coats and bored eyes the prints would likely be out of focusþshe knew she hadnt inherited her mothers skill with a cameraþbut they would please her im sorry she let the camera dangle from the strap around her neck im taking too long i get caught up weve got some time yet after a brief study of the clouds adam shifted in the saddle and turned to tess youre riding well you learn selfdefense she claimed but felt a warm spurt of pride i never want to hurt the way i did those first couple of days and i need the exercise no youre enjoying it all right im enjoying it but if it gets much colder than this i wont be enjoying it till spring itll get colder than this but your bloodll be thicker your mind tougher he leaned down to stroke the neck of his mount and youll be hooked every day you dont ride youll feel deprived every day i cant stroll down sunset boulevard i feel deprived i manage he laughed when you get back to sunset boulevard youll think of the sky here and the hills then youll come back intrigued she tipped down her sunglasses peered at him over the tops what is this indian mysticism and fortunetelling nope psychology oneohone can i use the camera ily ill take a picture of you and tess all right you dont mind do you she asked tess i never turn away from a camera she walked her horse around adams turned herþrather smoothly she thoughtþand came close to lilys right hows this its good he lifted the camera focused two beautiful women in one frame and snapped twice when you look at these youll see how much you share the shape of the face the coloring even the way you sit in the saddle automatically tess straightened her shoulders she felt what she considered a mild affection for lily but she was far from ready for sisterhood lets have the camera adam ill take the two of you the virginia magnolia and the noble savage the minute it was out of her mouth she winced sorry i tend to think of people as characters no offense none taken adam passed her the camera he liked her the way she went after what she wanted said what was on her mind he doubted very much shed appreciate being told those were two of his favorite qualities about willa how do you think of yourself shallow gal thats why my screenplays sell smile i like your movies lily said when tess lowered the camera theyre exciting and entertaining and play to the least common denominator nothing wrong with that she handed the camera back to lily you write for the masses you take off your brain and keep it simple youre not giving yourself or your audience enough credit adam flicked his gaze toward the trees scanned maybe not but tess trailed off as a movement caught her eye theres something back there in the trees something moved yes i know its upwind i cant smell it casually he laid his hand on the butt of his rifle bears are hibernating now right tess moistened her lips and tried not to think of a man and a knife it wouldnt be a bear sometimes they wake up why dont you start heading home ill take a look you cant go up there alone instinct made lily reach over grab his reins at the abrupt movement his horse shied and kicked up snow you cant it could be anything it could beþ nothing he said calmly and soothed his horse a few innocent flakes danced into the air he didnt think theyd stay innocent for long but its best to see lilys right shivering tess kept her eyes trained on the tree line and its starting to snow lets just go right now i cant do that adam locked his dark quiet eyes on lilys its probably nothing he knew better by the way his horse was beginning to quiver beneath him but kept his voice easy but a man was killed barely a mile from here i have to see now head back and ill catch up with you you know the way yes butþ please do this for me ill be right behind you knowing she was useless in an argument lily turned her horse stay together adam told tess then rode toward the tree line hell be all right her teeth threatened to chatter as tess made the reassurance hell lily its probably a squirrel too much movement for a squirrel she thought or a moose or something well have to tease him about saving the womenfolk from a marauding moose and what if its not lilys quiet southern voice fractured like glass what if the police and everyone are wrong and whoever killed that man is still here she stopped her horse we cant leave adam alone hes the one with the gun tess began i cant leave him alone quaking at the prospect of defying an order lily nonetheless turned and started back hey dontþoh hell thisll make a dandy scene in a script tess muttered and trotted after her you know if he shoots us by mistake were going to be really sorry lily only shook her head and veering off the road started into the hills following adams tracks you know how to get back if you had to ride quickly yeah i think butshrist this is insane lets justþ the gunshot split the air and echoed like thunder before tess could do more than cling to her skittish horse lily was galloping headlong into the trees nate didn t come alone ben drove up behind him with his sisterinlaw and his niece shelly came into the house chattering and immediately began unwrapping the baby i should have called i know but when ben said he was coming by i just grabbed abigail and jumped into the rig weve been dying for company i know youve got business to tend to but abby and i can visit with bess while youre talking i hope you dont mind of course i dont its good to see you it was always good to see shelly with her happy chatter and sunny smile she was willa had always thought perfect for zack they meshed like butter on popcorn both lively and entertaining with the baby happily kicking on the sofa shelly peeled off her hat and fluffed her sunny blond hair the short sassy cut suited her pixie face and petite build and her eyes were the color of fog in the mountains well i didnt give ben much choice but i swear ill stay out of your way until youve finished dont be silly i havent been able to play with the baby in weeks and shes grown so havent you sweetheart indulging herself willa lifted abby and hefted her high over her head her eyes are turning green shes going to have mckinnon eyes shelly agreed youd think shed have the gratitude to take after me a bit since im the one who carried her around for nine months but she looks just like her pa i dont know i think shes got your ears willa brought abby close to kiss the tip of her nose do you shelly perked up immediately you know shes sleeping right through the night already only five months old after all the horror stories i heard about teething and walking the floor i figured idþ she held up both hands as if to signal herself to stop there i go and i promised id stay out of the way zack says i could talk the bark off a tree zackll talk you blind ben put in surprises me that with the two of you as parents abby didnt pop out talking he reached out to tweak the babys cheek and grinned at willa shes a pretty handful isnt she and sweetnatured which proves she isnt all mckinnon with some regret willa passed the cooing baby back to her mother bess is back in the kitchen shelly i know shed love to see you and abby i hope you have time for a little visit when youre done will shelly laid a hand on willas arm sarah wanted to come by too but she couldnt get away weve been thinking about you ill be down soon maybe you can talk bess into parting with some of the pie shes been making for supper everythings up in the office she added to the others and started upstairs you understand this is just for forms sake will nate began just so theres no question about adhering to the terms of the will yeah no problem but her back was stiff as she led the way into the office didnt see your sisters around theyre out riding with adam willa told him moving behind the desk i dont imagine theyll be out too much longer hollywoods bloods too thin for her to handle the cold for more than an hour or so nate sat stretched out his legs so i see you two are still getting along beautifully we stay out of each others way she handed him a record book it works well enough its going to be a long winter ben eased a hip onto the edge of the desk you two ought to think about making peace or just shooting each other to get it done the second part doesnt seem quite fair she wouldnt know the difference between a winchester and a posthole digger ill have to teach her was nates comment as he scanned figures things all right around here otherwise well enough unable to sit will pushed away from the desk from what i can tell the men are convinced that whoever killed pickles is long gone the police havent been able to prove any different no signs no weapon no motive is that what you think ben asked her she met his eyes thats what i want to think and thats what ill have to think its been three weeks that doesnt mean you should let your guard down ben murmured and she inclined her head ive no intention of letting my guard down in any area everything here looks in perfect order to me nate passed the record book to ben all things considered youve had a good year i expect the next will be even better she paused she didnt clear her throat but she wanted to im going to be sowing natural grasses come spring that was something pa and i disagreed on but i figure theres a reason for what grows native to this area so were going back to it intrigued ben flicked a glance at her hed never known her to talk about change when it came to mercy we did that at three rocks more than five years ago with good results she looked at ben again i know it and once were reseeding well be rotating more often no more than three weeks per pasture pacing now she didnt notice that ben set the book aside to study her im not as concerned as pa was with producing the biggest cattle just the best past few years weve had a lot of trouble at birthing time with oversized calves it might change the profit ratio at first but im thinking long term she opened the thermos shed left on the desk and poured coffee though it was no more than lukewarm by now ive talked to wood about the cropland hes had some ideas about it that pa wasnt keen on but i think its worth some experimenting weve got a little more than six hundred acres cultivated for small grains and im going to give wood control of them if it doesnt work it doesnt but mercy can carry some experimentation for a year or two he wants to build a silo well ferment our own alfalfa she shrugged she knew what some would say about the changes and her interest in crops and silos and her other plans to ask adam to increase the string of horses she was forgetting the cattle forgetting that mercy had been pure for generations but she wasnt forgetting anything she was looking ahead she set her cup down do either of you in your supervisory capacity have a problem with my plans cant say that i do nate rose but then im not a cattleman i think ill go on down and see if theres pie leave yu two to discuss this well willa demanded when she faced ben alone well he echoed and picked up her cup damn will thats cold he winced as he swallowed it down and stale i didnt ask your opinion on the coffee he stayed where he was sitting on the edge of the desk and leveled his eyes to hers whered all these ideas come from ive got a brain dont i and an opinion true enough ive never heard you talk about changing so much as a blade of grass around here its curious there wasnt any point talking about it he wasnt interested in what i thought or had to say ive done some studying up she added and stuck her hands in her pockets maybe i didnt go to college like you but im not stupid i never thought you were and i never knew you wanted to go to college it doesnt matter with a sigh she walked to the window and stared out storms coming she thought those first pretty flecks of white were only the beginning what matters is now and tomorrow and next year winters planning time figuringthingsout time im starting to plan thats all she went stiff when his hands came down on her shoulders easy im not going to jump you he turned her to face him if it matters i think youre on the mark it did matter and that was a surprise in itself i hope youre right ive been getting calls from the vultures he smiled a little developers bastards jumped right in theyd give me the moon and the sun to sell the land so they can break it up make a fancy resort or fucking vanity ranches for hollywood cowboys if shed had fangs they would have been gleaming theyll never get their fat fingers on a single acre of mercy land while im standing on it automatically he began to knead her shoulders sent them off scalded did you darling one called just last week told me to just call him arnie i told him id see him skinned and staked out for the coyotes if he set a foot on my property the corner of her lip quirked i dont think hell be coming by thats the way yeah but the other two she turned looked out again at the snow and the hills and the land i dont think they understand yet just how much moneys involved what those jackassesll pay to get hold of a ranch like this hollywood shell figure it out sooner or later and then theyve got me two to one ben the will holds the land for ten years i know what it said but things change with enough money and enough pressure they could change quicker and ten years was nothing she thought in the grand scheme of things her grand scheme to turn mercy into not one of the best but the best i cant buy them out after the years up ive figured it every way it can be figured and i just cant theres money sure but most of its in the land and on the hoof when the years up theyll own twothirds to my one no point worrying over what cant be changed or what may or may not happen he stroked a hand down her hair once then a second time maybe what you need is a distraction just a little one he turned her again then shook his head dont go shying off ive been thinking a lot about this since the first time he touched his lips to hers a teasing brush see that didnt hurt anything her lips were vibrating but she couldnt claim it was painful i dont want to get all started up again there s too much going on for distractions darling he leaned down toyed with her lips again thats just when you need them most and im willing to bet this makes us both feel a lot better his eyes stayed open and on hers as he gathered her close as he lowered his head rubbed lip to lip its working for me already he murmured then quick as lightning deepened the kiss the jolt the heat the yearning all melded together to swim in her head through her whole body and she forgot when the sensations seized her to be worried or tired or afraid it was easy to move into him to press close and let everything else fall away and harder much harder than shed anticipated to pull back and remember maybe ive been thinking about it too she raised a hand to keep the distance between them but i havent finished thinking about it as long as im the first to know when you do he twined her hair around his finger released it wed better go downstairs before i give you too much to think about the riders coming in fast caught his eye with one hand resting on willas shoulder he stepped closer to the window adam s back with your sisters she saw them and more somethings wrong somethings happened he could see for himself the way adam helped lily out of the saddle and held on to her something s happened he agreed lets go find out they were halfway down the stairs when the front door swung open tess strode in first the cold had whipped strong color into her cheeks but her eyes were huge her lips white it was a deer she said just a deer bambis mom she managed and a tear slipped out of her eye as nate came down the hall from the kitchen oh god why would anybody do that to bambis mom ssh nate draped an arm over her shoulders lets go sit down honey lily lets go in with tess she shook her head and kept her hand gripped tight in adams no i m all right really im going to make some tea it would be better if we had some tea excuse me adam willa watched lily hurry toward the kitchen what the hell happened did you shoot a doe while you were out no but someone had revolted he peeled off his coat tossed it over the newel post theyd left it there torn to pieces not for the game not even for the trophy just to kill the wolves were at it he rubbed his hands over his face i fired to scatter them and get a better look but lily and tess rode up i wanted to get them back here ill get my coat before willa could turn adam stopped her theres no point there wont be much left by now and i saw enough shed been shot clean in the head then shed been gutted hacked left there he cut off her tail i guess that was enough trophy this time around like the others then like the others can we track him ben demanded snows come in since it was done a day ago at least mores coming in now maybe if i could have set off right then id have had some luck adam moved his shoulder a gesture that communicated both frustration and acceptance i couldnt go off and leave them to get back here alone wed better have a look anyway ben was already reaching for his hat ask nate to drive shelly home willa im coming with you theres no point and you know it ben took her shoulders no point im coming anyway ill get my coat n he snow came down in sheets white and wild and wicked by nightfall there was nothing to see from the windows but a constant fall of thick flakes that built a wall between the glass and the rest of the world lily stared at it tried to stare through it while the heat from the blazing logs in the fire licked at her back and worry ate at her nerves will you sit down tess snapped and hated the edge in her voice theres nothing you can do theyve been gone a long time tess knew how long theyd been gone exactly ninetyeight minutes like i said theres nothing you can do you could use some more tea this is cold even as lily turned to gather the tray tess leaped to her feet will you stop just stop waiting on meþon everyone you re not a servant around here just sit the hell down for christs sake she shuddered once pressed her fingers to her eyes and took a long deep breath im sorry she murmured as lily stood where she was hands locked together eyes blank ive got no business yelling at you ive never seen anything like that never seen anything like that its all right empathy eased the tension in her fingers it was horrible i know horrible they sat on either end of the long leather couch silent for a full thirty seconds while the wind beat at the windows with vicious gusts tess found herself holding back a sickly laugh oh hell she blew out a breath and repeated oh hell what have we got ourselves into here lily i dont know the wind sent a demon howl down the chimney are you scared damn right im scared arent you eyes sober and steady lily pursed her lips in consideration she lifted a fingertip rubbed it lightly over her bottom lip it tended to quiver she knew when fear had a grip on her i dont think i am i dont understand it not really but im not scared not the way i expect to be just sorry and sad and worried she added as her eyes were pulled back to the window and her mind drew a picture of three riders lost in whirling white about adam and willa and ben theyll be all right they live here nerves bouncing tess rose to pace the sharp snap of a flame in the fireplace made her jump swear they know what theyre doing if they didnt she thought who the hell did maybe thats why im so scared right now i dont know what the hell im doing and i always do you know its one of my best things set the goal form the plan take the steps but this time i dont know what im doing turning she sent lily a thoughtful look you do you know what youre doing with your tea trays and soup simmering and fire building lily shook her head forced herself to keep her eyes away from the windows those arent important things maybe they are tess said softly then stiffened when she saw the glare of lights through the curtain of snow someones here because she once again didnt know what to doþrun hideþtess turned deliberately and walked into the foyer to the front door to open it moments later nate appeared coated with white get back inside he ordered nudging her out of the way as he closed the door behind him are they back yet no lily and i she gestured toward the living area what are you doing here its a bad one he said i got shelly and the baby home all right but barely made it back he took off his hat shook off snow its been two hours now ill give them a few more minutes before i head out after them youre going out again in that shed never experienced a blizzard but was certain she was living through one now and blizzards killed are you insane he merely gave her shoulder an absent patþa man with his mind obviously elsewhere got any coffee hot i could use a cup and a thermos to go youre not going out in that in a gesture she knew to be foolish even as she made it she stepped between nate and the door no ones going out he smiled traced a fingertip down her cheek he didnt see her gesture as foolish but as sweet worried about me terrified was closer to it but shed think about that later frostbite hypothermia death she snapped off the words like frozen twigs id be worried about anyone who didnt have the good sense to stay inside during a storm like this three of my friends are out in it his voice was quiet the purpose behind them unshakable coffee would help tess black and hot before she could speak he held up a hand cocked his head there that should be them i didnt hear anything theyre back nate said simply and settling his hat again went out to meet them he was right which made tess decide nate had the ears of a cat they came in out of the howling wind layered with snow gathered in the living room drinking coffee bess had delivered within minutes they thawed out too much snow to see anything ben sank into a deep chair as adam sat crosslegged in front of the fire we got out all right but there was already a couple new inches down no way to track but you saw tess perched on the arm of the sofa you saw what was there yeah with a quick glance at adam willa moved her shoulders she didnt see any point in adding that the wolves had come back ill talk to the men about it in the morning theres enough to do now to do now tess echoed theyre already out rounding up the herd getting them into shelter ill find ham wait certain that she was the only sane person left tess held up a hand youre going back out in this for cows theyd die in this willa said briskly as tess watched in amazement everyone but her and lily shrugged back into outdoor gear and headed out with a shake of her head she reached for the brandy for cows she muttered for a bunch of stupid cows theyll be hungry when they get back lily didnt look out the window this time nor did she listen for the engine of the fourwheeler ill go help bess with supper she could be irritated tess thought or resigned she decided that being resigned was easier on the system im not going to sit here alone but she took the brandy with her as she caught up with lily do you get storms like this back east distracted lily shook her head we get our share of snow in virginia but i havent seen anything quite like this it comes in so quickly with so much wind i cant imagine having to be out in it to work in it i expect nate will stay the night dont you ill have to ask bess if theres a room ready for him she pushed open the kitchen door and found bess already at the stove nursing an enormous pot steaming fragrantly stew bess announced sampling from a wooden spoon enough for an army needs an hour or two yet to simmer theyve gone out again automatically lily went to the pantry to take an apron from a peg tess raised an eyebrow at the ease of the gesture already routine she realized figured as much said bess im going to put together an apple cobbler here she glanced at tess sniffed at the brandy in her hand you looking to be useful not particularly the woodboxes are half empty bess told her and hauled a basket of apples out of the pantry the men dont have time to bring in fuel tess swirled the brandy in her hand you expect me to go outside and bring in wood the power goes out girl youll want to keep your butt warm just like the rest of us the power at the idea of losing power of being stuck in the cold in the dark through the night her color drained we got a generator bess moved her shoulders as she began briskly paring apples but we cant waste it on heating bedrooms when we got plenty of fuel you want to sleep warm you bring in wood you give her a hand lily she needs it more than i do theres a rope leading from that door there to the woodpile you follow that and bring it in by hand you wont be able to push the wheelbarrow through the snow and theres no use shoveling the path out until its done falling get bundled up good take a flashlight all right lily took one look at tesss annoyed face i can bring it in why dont you stay inside and you can carry wood up to the bedrooms it was tempting very even now tess could hear the frigid howl of the wind threatening the kitchen windows but the smirk on besss face caused her to set her snifter aside well both bring it in not with those fancy ladys gloves bess called out as they started out get yourself some work gloves from the mudroom after youve got the rest of your gear on hauling in wood tess muttered on her way to the foyer closet theres probably enough inside already to last a week shes just doing this to get to me she wouldnt ask us to go out if it wasnt necessary tess dragged on her coat then shrugged she wouldnt ask you she agreed then plopped down at the base of the steps to tug on her boots the two of you seem to be pretty chummy i think shes great lily wound the knit scarf around her neck twice before buttoning her coat over it shes been nice to me shed be nice to you too if youd squashing a ski cap onto her head tess nodded no dont spare my feelings if id whatþ well its just that youre a little abrasive with her abrupt well maybe i wouldnt be if she wasnt always finding some idiotic chore for me to do then complaining that i dont do it to her specifications ill get frostbite bringing in this damn wood and shell say i didnt stack it right you wait and see miffed she headed back down the hall again went through the kitchen without a word and into the mudroom to hunt up a pair of thick oversized work gloves ready lily grabbed a flashlight and prepared to follow tess the minute tess opened the door the wind slapped iceedged snow into their faces wideeyed they stared at each other it was lily who took the first step into the wolf bite of the wind they grabbed the leading rope pulling themselves along as the wind shoved them rudely back a step for every three they took boots sank kneedeep into snow and the flashlight bobbled along through the dark like a drunken moonbeam they all but stumbled over the tarpcovered woodpile tess kept a grip on the flashlight and held her arms out while lily filled them with wood legs spread to hold her balance the tip of her nose tingling tess gritted her teeth hell has nothing to do with fire she shouted hell is winter in montana lily smiled a little and began to fill her own arms once were inside and warm with the fires going well look out and think its pretty bullshit tess muttered as they fought their way back to the house to dump the first load how bad do you want a warm bed lily looked toward the toasty kitchen then back out into the thundering storm pretty bad yeah tess sighed rolled her shoulders me too once more into the breach they repeated the routine three times and tess began to get into the swing of it until she lost her footing and fell headlong and face first into a threefoot drift the flashlight buried itself like a mole in topsoil are you all right did you hurt yourself in her rush to help lily leaned over lost her balance overcompensated and sat down hard on her butt with her breath gone she stayed where she was sunk to the waist while tess rolled over and spat out snow fuck fuck fuck struggling to sit up tess narrowed her eyes at lilys giggles whats so goddamn funny well be buried any minute and they wont find us until the spring thaw but she felt her own laughter bubbling up as she studied lily sitting in a deep throne of snow like some miniature ice queen and you look like an idiot so do you breath hitching lily pressed a snowcoated glove to her heart and youre the one with a beard philosophically tess swiped the snow off her chin and tossed it into lilys face it was all they needed despite the mule kick of the wind they scooped snow into lopsided balls and pummeled each other shrieking now scrambling to their knees they heaved and tossed and dodged they were no more than a foot apart so aim wasnt a factor in the battle speed was all that mattered as snow slapped her face and snuck down the collar of her coat tess had to admit that lily had her there she might appear delicate but she had an arm like a bullet there was only one way to even the odds tess tackled her and sent them both rolling laughing like hyenas white as snowmen they plopped on their backs to catch their breath flakes drifted down on them huge and heavy with the iced edges smoothed out we used to make snow angels when i was a kid lily said and lazily demonstrated by skimming her arms and legs over the snow and once it snowed enough for us to be out of school for two days we built a snow fort and an army of snow people my mother came out and took pictures of it tess blinked up trying to see the black sky through the curtain of white the one and only time i went skiing i decided snow and i werent compatible she mimicked lilys moves i guess its not so bad really its beautiful then she laughed im freezing ill buy you a huge mug of coffee laced with brandy ill take it still smiling lily sat up then her heart leaped into her throat blocking the scream her hand clamped over tesss as the shadow moved became a man came closer did you all take a tumble tesss head jerked around her pulse roaring in her ears they were alone she thought in panic too far from the house for a shout to carry over the wind the image of the butchered deer reared up in her mind turning her to helpless mush the flashlight she thought as her eyes darted right and left he had one the beam strong enough to blind her while keeping him in silhouette she wanted to run ordered herself to run to drag lily with her but she couldnt seem to move you shouldnt be out here in the dark he said and stepped closer now she moved survival instincts springing free like a cat out of a cage she bounded up snatched a log from the woodpile and prepared to swing stay back she ordered and despite her shaking hands the order was strong and firm lily get up get up goddamn it hey i didnt mean to spook you he angled the light so that it played along the snow its wood miss tess billy and me just got in and the wife thought you might need some help up here his voice was easy nonthreateningþeven tess thought slightly amused but they were alone basically helpless and he was a strong man with his face still in shadow trust no one she decided and took a firmer grip on the log were fine lily go inside and tell bess that woods here tell her she hissed and lily finally snapped into action and moved no need to put bess to any trouble wood angled the flashlight toward the woodpile skimmed the beam over the trampled path to the house the wifes got supper on for me but i can haul some logs in for you powers bound to go before long completely alone with wood now tess prayed that lily was inside and alerting bess fear licked along her spine with a sharpedged tongue she took one step back then two weve already taken some in cant have too much in this kinda storm he held the flashlight out to her and she jerked back visualizing a knife you want to take this he said gently ill load up still poised to run tess reached out took the light wood bent to the pile as lily came flying back bess has coffee on her voice rose and fell like an arpeggio she said there was plenty if wood wanted a cup well now i appreciate that he continued to stack logs competently in the crook of one arm but ill get one back to home the wifes waiting on me you all go back in use that light now i can find my way well enough yes lets go in lets go inside tess shivering lily tugged on tess s arm thank you wood dont mention it he murmured shaking his head as they backed down the path women he said to himself i was so scared lily managed the moment they were inside the mudroom she threw her arms around tess you were so brave i wasnt brave i was terrified as fresh realization set in she clutched lily and shook violently how could we have forgotten how could we be playing out there like a couple of idiots after everything thats happened god god it could be anyone why did it take so long for that to sink in she drew back met lilys eyes it could be anyone not adam after tearing her gloves off lily rubbed her chilled hands together he couldnt hurt anyone or anything and he was with us when weþwhen we found it today tess opened her mouth closed it again what point was there in speculating that adam could have gone out before dawn done what had been done then led them to it taken them to see what hed wanted them to see i dont know lily i just dont know but if were going to stay here get through this winter wed better start thinking and wed better start watching our backs she pulled off her hat her coat i cant imagine adam doing that or ben or nate hell i cant imagine anyone doing it and thats the problem we have to start imagining it were safe here lily turned her back carefully hung her coat were safe i havent felt safe in a long time and im not going to let anything spoil it lily tess laid a hand on her shoulder staying safe means staying careful and staying smart we both want something here she continued as lily turned back and we want it badly enough to risk being here the way i see it we have to look out for each other and we have to trust each other if i see anything odd im going to tell you and youre going to do the same anything that doesnt feel right anyone who doesnt act right agreed yes ill tell you and willa she shook her head before tess could protest she deserves that tess she has every bit as much at stake she has more at stake exactly tess thought then shrugged okay well play it that way for now anyway now i want that coffee they had coffee and waited they ate stew and waited the wind screamed at the windows the fire snapped in the grate and the grandfather clock in the study bonged the hours away it was past midnight when willa came in and she came in alone tess stopped pacing the living room and studied her willas face was sheetwhite with exhaustion those dark exotic eyes bruised with it she walked directly to the fire trailing snow and wet behind her over the exquisite rugs and gleaming floors where are the others tess asked her they had to get back theyve got their own worries with a nod tess went to the whiskey decanter and poured a generous glass shed have preferred having nate and ben in the house but she was learning that montana was filled with little disappointments she handed the glass to willa cows all tucked in for the night without bothering to answer will tossed back half the whiskey shuddered hard ill run you a bath with her mind too weary to focus willa blinked at lily what im going to run you a hot bath youre frozen and exhausted you must be starving theres stew on the stove tess you fix willa a bowl willa had just enough energy left to be amused her baffled smile followed lily out of the room shes going to run me a bath can you beat that our resident domestic expert anyway you could use one you smell willa sniffed winced guess i do because the first blast of whiskey had her head reeling she set the glass aside im too tired to eat you need something you can eat in the tub in the tub eat in the tub why the hell not willa spared tess one smirking glance why the hell not she agreed and stumbled her way upstairs to strip lily had the water steaming and frothy with bubbles naked willa stared down at it for a full ten seconds a bubble bath she thought she couldnt remember the last time shed had a bubble bath the big scarlet tub had been one of her fathers indulgences and shed rarely used it and then only when hed been away he was away now she reminded herself dead away she swung a leg over the side hissed as hot water met chilled skin then with an enormous sigh she lowered herself to the chin she emptied her mind of snow of wind of the raging dark the brutal fight to round up cattle they would have missed some and they would lose some that was inevitable the blizzard had come in too fast and too mean to prevent that but they had done their best her muscles wept as she laid her head back closed her eyes cant think she realized as her mind clicked on and off had to think what to do every movement every chore every decision made come morning would be instinctive she knew what to do there it wasnt her first blizzard nor would it be her last but murderþmurder and butchery what to do fall asleep in there and youll drown tess said from the doorway willa sat up scowling she wasnt particularly modest the scowl was for the intrusion even if it did include the heavenly scent of stew you ever try knocking you left the door open champ rather amused at her role of server tess settled the tray across the tub i want to talk to you willa only sighed she scooted up enough to manage the meal dipped a spoon into the stew while bubbles melted off her breasts so talk tess sat on the wide ledge of the tub quite a bathroom she mused it was as plush as any movie stars fantasy with its ruby sapphire and white tiles its forest of ferns in brass and copper pots the separate shower was walled in clear glass boasted half a dozen showerheads at different angles and heights and the tub where willa was lounging was easily big enough for a small tasteful orgy idly she dipped a finger into the bubbles sniffed at them violets she commented must be lilys you want to talk about bubble baths willa scooted up higher as she gained more enthusiasm for the meal she could have eaten a truckload of stew well leave the girl stuff for later she glanced over as lily came to the doorway her gaze politely fixed inches above willas head ive got your robe for when youre finished ill just hang it on the back of the door come on in have a seat willa invited with a wave of her hand tess wants to talk when lily hesitated willa rolled her eyes weve all got tits here lily and hers are barely noticeable anyway tess added with a smug smile have a seat she ordered youre the one who wanted to bring her in on all of this all of what willa demanded with her mouth full lets just say lily and i are a little nervous wouldnt you agree with that lily flushing lily lowered the lid on the toilet and sat yes despite the heat of the water willas skin chilled you two planning to bolt were not cowards tess inclined her head or fools the three of us have equal interest in getting through this year i assume we all have equal interest in getting through it in one piece somebody very possibly somebody on this ranch isþlets say knife happy how do we deal with it willas mouth went stubborn i know my men we dont tess pointed out maybe we should start by you filling us in telling us what you know about each one of them as appealing as it sounds the three of us cant travel in a pack twentyfour hours a day for the next nine or ten months youre right the careless agreement caused tesss mouth to drop open well well i must mark this day on my calendar willa mercy agrees with me i still cant stand you scraping her bowl willa continued but i do agree the three of us need to cooperate if were going to get through this until the police or we find out who killed pickles i dont think either of you should wander around alone i can defend myself ive taken classes tesss announcement made willa snort i could take you down tess tossed out in ten seconds id have you on your back seeing stars but thats beside the point she had a lowgrade urge for a cigarette and promised herself shed indulge it soon lily and i cant very well attach ourselves to each other at the hip im with adam most of the day with the horses willa nodded at lily and slid back into the water you can depend on adam and bess and ham why ham tess wanted to know he raised me willa said shortly the weathers going to keep the two of you close to the house for the next little while anyway what about you lily asked ill worry about me willa submerged holding her breath under the water then came up feeling nearly human again i havent had the benefit of hollywoods selfdefense courses but i know the men i know the land if either one of you is nervous you can saddle up and go to work with me now unless one of you wants to scrub my back id like some privacy tess rose and as an afterthought reached down for the tray being cocky isnt much protection against a knife a winchester is and satisfied with that willa reached for the soap she slept poorly exhaustion as powerful as it was couldn t beat back the nightmares willa tossed and turned fighting for sleep as images of blood and gore raced through her head when that thin winter light crept through the wall of steadily falling snow she shivered and wished there was something someone to hold on to for just a little while someone else woke in that same stingy light with those same images running like a river through his head but they made him smile from tesss journal v im beginning to like snow or im going slowly insane each morning when i look out my bedroom window there it is white and shiny miles of it i can t say i care for the cold or the fucking wind but the snow particularly when im inside looking out has a certain appeal or maybe im beginning to feel safe again its a week before christmas and nothing has happened to interrupt the routine no murdered men no slaughtered wildlife just the eerie quiet of snowsmothered days maybe the cops were right after all and whoever killed that poor bald guy was a psychotic hiker we can only hope lily is big into the holiday spirit funny sweet woman she s like a child about it hustling bags into her bedroom wrapping presents baking cookies with bess great cookies which means ive been adding an extra fifteen minutes to my morning workouts we took a trip into billings for what its worth to do some christmas shopping lily was easy enough i found a pretty brooch of a rearing horse very delicate and feminine figured i had to come up with something for sourface bess and settled on a cookbook lily approved it so l suppose im safe the cowgirl s another matter i still haven t pinned her down is this woman fearless or stupid she goes out every day more often than not alone she works her ass off swaggers down to the old bunkhouse every evening to talk to her men when shes in the house shes often buried up to her eyeballs with ledgers and cow reports im afraid im starting to admire her and im not sure i like it i got her a cashmere sweater i dont know why she never wears anything butflannel but its screaming siren red very soft andfemale shell probably end up tossing it on over her long underwear and castrating cows in it hell with it for adam because he appeals to me on a surprisingly fraternal level i found a lovely little watercolor of the mountains it reminded me of him after much debate with myself i decided to spring for a token giftfor both ben and nate since they spend so much time around here i picked up a video of red riverfor ben kind of a gag that i hope will be taken in the proper spirit and after some subtle probing i learned that nate has a weakness for poetry hes getting a volume of keats well see between the shopping the smells from the kitchen and the decorating im getting in the holiday mood myself just shipped off a ton of presents for mom with her its not the quality but the quantity and i know shell be happily ripping off shiny paper for hours the damnedest thing i miss her despite all the santa clausing im antsy too many hours indoors i think im using this extra timeþwinter is chockfull of time around here since its dark beforefive in the eveningþto play with an idea for a book just for fun just to pass the time during these incredibly long nights and speaking of long nights since all seems quiet again im taking one of the jeepsþi mean rigsþand driving over to nates to deliver my gift ham gave me directions to natesþwhat would i call itþspread i suppose ive been waiting weeks for an invitation to his house and for him to make a move i guess its up to me to start the ball rolling i cant decide how subtle i should be about getting him into bed and so will play it by ear at the rate he s going it could be spring before i get laid the hell with that too gc oing somewhere willa demanded as tess glided downstairs as a matter of fact she tilted her head took in willas usual uniform of flannel and denim you s i just got in some of us dont have time to primp in front of a mirror for an hour willas brow furrowed youre wearing a dress am i feigning surprise tess looked down at the simple formfitting blue wool that skimmed above her knees well how did that happen with a snicker she came down the rest of the way and walked to the closet for her coat i have a christmas present to deliver you remember christmas dont you even with your busy schedule you must have heard of it there was a rumor sexy dress heels fuckme perfume willa mused and narrowed her eyes whos the present for im dropping in on nate tess swirled on her coat i hope he has some wassail handy should have figured it willa muttered youre going to break your neck getting to the rig in those ice picks ive got excellent balance with a careless wave tess glided out dont wait up sis yeah good balance willa repeated watching as tess made her way gracefully to the rig i hope nates got good balance she turned away walked into the living room and stretched out on the sofa after one long look at the tall elaborately decorated tree framed in the front window she buried her face in the leather christmas had always been a miserable time of year for her her mother had died in december not that she remembered but she knew it and it had always put a cloud over the holidays bess had tried god knew to make up for it with decorations and cookies with silly presents and carols but there had never been family gathered around the piano or family huddled under the tree opening gifts on christmas morning she and adam had exchanged theirs on christmas eve always after her father was riproaring drunk and snoring in his bed there had been presents under the tree with her name on them bess had seen to that and for years had put jacks name on them but when willa had turned sixteen shed stopped opening those they were a lie after all and after a couple of further attempts bess had given up the pretense christmas morning had meant hangovers and bad temper and on the one occasion shed been brave enough to complain a stinging backhand shed stopped looking forward to the holidays a long time ago and now she was tired so damn tired the winter had come so soon and so brutally theyd lost more cows than shed expected and wood was worried they hadnt gotten the winter wheat in soon enough the market price per head had dippedþnot enough for panic but enough for worry and she found herself waiting every day waiting to find something or someone slaughtered on her doorstep again no one to talk to she thought so she kept her worries to herself she didnt want lily and tess terrified every minute of the day but neither could she relax and ignore it she made certain that either she or adam or ham kept an eye on both of them when they were out of the house now tess was gone driving off and willa hadnt had the energy or the wisdom to stop her call nate she told herself get up and call nate to tell him shes coming hell look out for her but she didnt move just couldnt seem to swing her legs down and sit up to sit up and face that brightly pitifully cheerful tree with the pretty presents under it if youre going to sleep you should go to bed she heard bens voice resigned herself to it im not sleeping im just resting a minute go away i dont know when i come over here you dont tell me to leave again so he sat down settling in the middle of the sofa youre wearing yourself out will reaching down he turned her face away from the back of the sofa the tears on it made him drop his hand as if shed burned him youre crying i am not humiliated she pressed her face into leather again im just tired thats all then her voice hitched broke and disgraced her leave me alone leave me alone im tired come here darling though he had little experience with weeping females he figured he could handle this one as easily as if shed been a child he lifted her up cradled her on his lap whats the matter nothing im just everything she managed and let her head rest on his shoulder i dont know whats wrong with me im not crying okay deciding they were both better off pretending she wasnt he gathered her closer lets just sit here awhile anyway youre a comfortable armful for a bony woman i hate christmas no you dont he pressed his lips to the top of her head youre just worn out you know what you should do will you and your sisters should take a few days off and go to one of those fancy spas get yourself pampered and pummeled take mud baths she snorted felt better yeah right me and the girls swapping gossip in the mud thats my style all right better yet you could go with me we could get a room with one of those big bubble tubs a heartshaped bed with a mirror over it that way you can see whats going on when we make love youll learn faster that way it had a certain decadent dizzying appeal but she shrugged im not in any hurry im getting to be in one he muttered then tilted her head back havent done this in a while and closed his mouth over hers she didnt pretend to resist or protest not when it was exactly what she needed the warmth the steady hand the skilled mouth instead she slid her arms around his neck turned into him and let all those worries and doubts and bad memories fade away here was comfort and regardless of anything someone who would listen and perhaps even care she sank into that into the wanting of that as much as the wanting of him he felt the need hed kept carefully reined strain at its tether the unexpected sweetness of her the surprising and arousing pliancy the little licks of heat that hinted of passion simmering beneath innocence the combination came close to snapping that straining tether so it was he who drew back she who protested struggling to temper instinct with sense he shifted her again settled her head once more in the curve of his shoulder lets just sit here awhile she felt his heart beat fast under her hand heard her own pound in her head you get me stirred up i dont know why its you who gets me stirred up ben i just cant figure it well i feel heaps better now he sighed once then rested his head against hers this isnt so bad no i guess it isnt so she sat in his lap while her feelings settled again she watched the twinkle of the lights on the tree and the fall of light snow just a whisper of white through the window beyond tess went over to nates she said at length he heard the tone knew her well enough to interpret it youre worried about that nate can handle himself probably she made a restless movement then gave up and let her eyes drift closed its tess youre worried about maybe some yes nothings happened for weeks now but she exhaled i cant watch her every minute of the day and night no you cant she thinks she knows all the answers miss big city girl with her selfdefense courses and her snappy clothes shit shes as lost out here as a mouse in a roomful of hungry shecats what if the rig breaks down or she runs off the road she drew a deep breath and said what was most on her mind what if whoever killed pickles is still around watching like you said nothings happened in weeks odds are hes long gone if you believe that why are you here most every day using every lame excuse in the book to drop by they arent so lame he muttered then shrugged theres you he didnt bother to scowl when she snorted there is you he repeated and theres the ranch and yeah i think about it he tilted her head up again and kissed her hard and quick tell you what ill just ride by nates and make sure she got there nobodys asking you to check up on my problems nope nobody is he lifted her set her aside then rose one day you might just ask me for something willa you might just break down and ask meanwhile ill do things my own way go on to bed he told her you need a decent nights sleep ill see to your sister she frowned after him as he walked out and wondered what he was waiting for her to ask tess got there she considered it a fine adventure to drive through the light snowfall in the deep country dark she had the radio turned up to blast and by some minor miracle she found a station that played downright rock she wailed along with rod stewart as she approached the lights of nates ranch tidy as a currier and ives painting she decided the wellplowed dirt road with its fresh sprinkle of white the neat outbuildings and rectangles of fence the rising shadows of trees her headlights must have stirred the horses as three trotted out of the barn and into the corral to watch her drive by pretty as a painting themselves she thought with their flowing tails and dancing hooves one of them loped over to the fence luring her into slowing down to study its trim lines and glossy color she drove on taking the gentle curve in the road that led to the main house it too was pretty and neat unpretentious she decided a boxy two stories with a generous covered porch white shutters against dark wood double chimneys with smoke pumping into the snowy sky simple she mused hold the pretenses and fancywork just like the man who lived there she was smiling as she gathered up her bag the gift and climbed out of the rig and managed barely to hold back the scream when she spotted the wildcat she took three stumbling steps back rapped up hard against the rig the cats eyes stared into hers it was dead stone cold dead and draped over the hitching rail but it gave her a very bad moment the fangs and claws were lethally sharp and told her exactly what would happen to a woman careless enough to stumble onto a live one it hadnt been mutilated and the lack of blood settled her thundering heart it was simply draped like a rug she thought in wonder over the rail with a shudder she gave it a wide berth and climbed the steps to the front door what kind of people she wondered draped the carcass of a wildcat over their front entrance with a nervous laugh she looked down at the gift in her hand then read keats jesus what a country even as she lifted her hand to knock the door opened in the mood she was in tess was pleased she didnt add a shriek to her jolt the short dark woman studied her solemnly she was nearly as wide as she was tall wrapped now in a thick black coat and many scarves her black hair was bundled under yet another scarf but tess could see it was salted with gray senorita she said in a gorgeous fluid voice may i help you the liquid sexy voice coming out of the tiny wrinkled face fascinated tess and she immediately started casting character her smile spread and brightened hello im tess mercy yes senorita mercy at the mercy name the woman opened the door wider stepping back in invitation id like to see nate if hes free hes in his office just down the hall i will show you youre on your way out and tess didnt want her arrival announced i can find it senora cruz she blinked a moment at tesss offered hand then took it in a brisk grip mister nate will be pleased to see you will he tess thought but she continued to smile i have a little gift for him she said and held up the brightly wrapped book a surprise that is very generous it is the third door on the left the ghost of a rmile around the womans mouth told tess that the underlying reason for er visit was all too obvious at least to another female good night senorita mercy good night senora cruz and tess chuckled to herself as the door closed between them and she was left alone in the quiet hall bright geometricpatterned rugs over dark wood floors clever penandink sketches on ivorytoned walls lovely driedflower arrangements in brass urnsþthat would be the senoras touch tess assumed as she wandered a fire was burning nicely in the living room simmering in a stone hearth beneath a stone mantel on which stood pewter candlesticks and a collection of intriguing paperweights the furniture was wide and deeply cushioned and masculine dark colors to contrast with light walls and the bright rugs an interesting mix tess decided simple male yet pleasing to the eye she caught the low strains of a mozart concerto as she walked closer to the open office door and there he was all gangling and sexy and jimmy stewartish in a high backed leather chair behind a big oak desk the desk lamp slanted light over his hands as he made notations on a yellow legal pad his brow was knotted his tie loose his hair all that thick gold of it mussed from his own hands she noted as he raked his fingers through it well well she thought just feel my heart go pittypat amused at herself she watched him another minute pleased to be able to study him when he was working and unaware of her the room was filled with books and a single mug of coffee sat at his elbow while the lovely music murmured in the background nate she decided giving her hair a brief stroke youre a goner well good evening lawyer torrence well aware that she was posed in the doorway she smiled slowly as his head jerked up as his eyes cleared of business then surprise and focused well hello miz mercy tension whipped into him as he saw her there snow still lightly dusted over her hair and the shoulders of her coat that tension increased when he saw the secret female smile on her lips but he leaned back in his chair like a man perfectly at ease this is a pleasant surprise i hope so and i hope im not interrupting something vitally important not vital the notes hed been taking had already gone completely out of his mind senora cruz let me in she started toward the desk thinking of the wildcat she would take a page from the feline book and toy with her prey before moving in for the kill your housekeeper my keeper he was quite simply baffled should he get up offer her a drink stay where he was why the hell was she looking at him as though she was already licking the remains of him from her lips maria and her husband miguel keep things running around here is this a social visit tess or do you need a lawyer social for the moment completely social she slipped off her coat and watched his eyes flicker yes she concluded the dress was definitely a success to be honest i needed to get out of the house she draped her coat over the back of a chair then eased a hip onto the corner of his desk letting the skirt slide sneakily up her thigh a little cabin fever it happens he hadnt forgotten her legs but it had been a while since hed seen them in anything but jeans or thick wool pants displayed in sheer hose to well above the knee they made his mouth go dry can i get you a drink that would be lovely she crossed her legs slowly another sneaky slide what have you got ah he couldnt remember and felt like an idiot better and better she decided and slithered off the desk ill just see for myself shall i she walked to the decanters on a cabinet across the room and chose vermouth would you like one sure thanks he nudged the coffee aside caffeine sure as hell wasnt going to get him through this i havent been able to get over for a couple of days how are things quiet she poured two glasses brought them to the desk after handing nate his she slipped onto the desk again on his side though festive she leaned down just a bit tapped her glass to his happy holidays in fact she took a small sip thats one of the reasons i came by reaching over she picked up the package shed put on the desk merry christmas nate you got me a present he narrowed his eyes at the package expecting a slam just a little one youve been a good friend and counselor she smiled over the last word do you want to open it now or wait till christmas morning she touched her tongue to her top lip and all the blood drained out of his brain into his lap i can come back im a sucker for presents he told her and ripped the paper off when he saw the book he teetered between being faintly embarrassed and gently moved im a sucker for keats too he murmured so i hear i thought when you read it you might think of me he lifted his eyes to hers i manage to think of you without visual aids do you she inched closer leaning down so that she could take hold of his loosened tie and what do you think i think at the moment youre trying to seduce me youre so quick so smart she laughed and slid into his lap and so right one quick tug on the tie and she had his mouth on hers like the house like the man the hunger was simple and without pretense his hands closed over her breasts the warm full weight of them and when she shifted to straddle him his hands moved around to cup her bottom she had already tossed his tie aside and was working on his shirt before hed taken the first breath if id had to go another week without your hands on me id have screamed she fastened her teeth low on his neck id rather scream with them on me he still hadnt managed to breathe but his hands were busy enough pushing that short snug skirt of the dress up her hips finding the delight of firm bare skin over the lacy tops of stockings we cantþhere he went back to her breasts unable to decide where he needed to touch first upstairs he managed as he savaged her mouth ill take you upstairs here she threw back her head as his lips ran down her throat he had a wonderful mouth shed been sure of it right here right now on the verge of exploding already she dragged at his belt hurry the first time fast well worry about finesse later he was with her there hard as steel aching desperate he struggled with the zipper in the back of her dress as she struggled with his i havent got any christ youre built he dragged the dress down far enough to find those lovely full breasts spilling over the top of a lowcut black bra he nipped the bra down with his teeth then used them on her it was a shock shed always considered herself healthily sexual but when that busy mouth on her flesh shot her over the edge without a net her body bucked her mind spun god oh my god letting her head fall back she absorbed that first delightful orgasm more now shed exploded over himþwildly gorgeouslyþand dazed him with his hands full of her he pressed his lips to hers and tried to think we have to go upstairs tess i dont generally have sex at my desk im not prepared for it thats okay she let her brow rest against his drew three deep breaths lord she was quaking like a schoolgirl i am reaching back she fumbled over the surface of the desk knocking a number of things to the floor as he took advantage of the thrust of her breast and suckled she heard her breath wheeze swore she could feel her eyes cross as she groped behind her for her bag she opened it tossed it aside and let a trail of condoms spill out he blinked a quick guess told him there were at least a dozen so nate cleared his throat i dont know whether to be afraid or flattered it made her laugh sitting there half naked and aroused to hell and back she let loose a low rocking laugh consider it a challenge good call but when he reached for them she drew them teasingly out of reach oh no allow me with her eyes on his she ripped a packet off tore it open mozart continued to play with grace and dignity as she freed nate from his slacks gave a feline hum of anticipation and slowly torturously protected them both his lungs clogged his fingers dug into the arms of the chair her hands were clever delicate as a rose and he was suddenly terrified that he would disgrace himself like a teenage virgin goddamn youre good she smiled shifted ive been thinking about this since the first time i saw you he gripped her hips as she rose over him held her there while both of them quivered yeah well that makes two of us she braced her hands on his shoulders let her fingers dig in for purchase whyd we wait so long damned if i know slowly his eyes locked on hers he lowered her pierced her filled her she shuddered once moaned low and long in her throat and didnt move a muscle her eyes closed then opened yes she said and smiled again yes his hands stayed fastened on her hips as she rode him hard and fast and well later when she was limp in his arms he managed to reach the phone she moaned a little as he shifted her dialed will its nate tess is here yeah shell be staying here tonight he turned his head nipped at her bare shoulder and realized hed never gotten that dress completely off plenty of time for that he thought and tuned back in to willas voice no shes fine shes great shell be back in the morning bye that was considerate of you tess murmured shed popped a few of the buttons off his shirt somewhere along the line and now enjoyed the smooth bare skin of his chest under her lazy fingertips shed worry he worked the bunchedup dress from around her waist and pulled it over her head now she wore nothing but lacetopped stockings sexy high heels and a satisfied smirk the smirk was the only thing he wanted to see slip off her how do you feel i feel wonderful tossing back her hair she linked her hands behind his neck and you he slipped his hands under her bottom lifting her as he rose lucky he told her and laid her back on his desk he took a moment to toss the legal pad that rested beside her head over his shoulder and about to get luckier surprised interested she grinned my my round two already just hold on honey he ran his hands up and over her pleased when she trembled and hold on tight it didnt take long for her to take the warning seriously the temperature rose on new years eve one of el ninos wild weather patterns that make sense only to god brought bright blue skies sunlight and warm air though it would mean mud and slopþand ice when the wind blew capriciously againþit was a moment to be enjoyed willa rode fences in a light denim jacket whistling as she made repairs the mountains were snowcapped the white lacing deep in the folds and waves the chinook had teased patches of ground and grass through the white in pastures while the snowpack along the ranch roads was still higher than a rig but the cottonwoods had lost their ermine trim and stood bare and black with wet while the pines rose sassily green she thought it was lilys simple happiness that was influencing her mood the womans holiday mood was still in high gear and only a true grinch could have resisted it why else willa thought had she agreed to lilys hesitant request for a new years eve party all those people in the house willa mused having to dress up make conversation with everything else on her mind it should have been a misery but she could admit at least to herself that she was looking forward to it even now lily and bess and nell were huddled in the kitchen creating the feast the house had been scrubbed raw and polished blind and willa had orders to be bathed and dressed by eight sharp she would do it willa realized for lily somehow over the months shed fallen in love with the stranger who had become her sister who wouldnt she asked herself as she mounted moon and rode on lily was sweet and kind and patient and vulnerable no matter how hard shed tried to maintain a distance between them they had grown closer and closer until now she couldnt imagine mercy without lilys touch lily liked to gather twigs stick them in old bottles and somehow she made them look cheerful and charming she hunted up old bowls out of cupboards filled them with fruit or dumped pinecones into straw baskets she snuck plants out of the pool house and scattered them through the rooms when no one complained shed foraged for more digging candlesticks out of closets buying scented candles and lighting them in the evening so that the house smelled of vanilla and cinnamon and lord knew what else but it was pleasant it was willa decided homey and anyone with eyes could see that adam was in love with her a little afraid of that vulnerability lily carried around willa mused but quietly in love it could work she supposed with time and care she doubted that lily realized just how deep adams feelings went as far as willa could see lily thought he was being kind dismounting she began to repair more broken wire then there was tess willa couldnt claim to be in love with miss hollywood but she might have become slightly less resentful for the most part tess stayed out of her way closeting herself for several hours a day with her writing or phone calls to her agent she did the chores assigned to her not cheerfully and not often well but she did them willa was fully aware of what was going on between tess and nate she just didnt choose to dwell on it that she concluded would never work the minute the time was up tess would be on a flight back to la and would never give nate another thought she only hoped he was prepared for it and what about you will she wondered leaning on a fence post she looked up into the mountains wished for a moment that she could mount moon and ride off up and up until she lost herself in snow and trees and sky the quiet that was there the utter peace of it the music of water thawing and forcing its way through ice over rocks the sweep of wind through pine and that glorious scent that was the land just breathing no responsibilities just for a day no men to order no fence to ride no cattle to feed just a day to do nothing but stare at the sky and dream of what she asked herself and shook her head with all the love and longing the sex and snapping air around her would she dream of that would she indulge herself in a little fantasy about what it would be like to let ben show her what a man could do to a woman and for her or would she dream of blood and death of failure and guilt would she ride into those hills and find something or someone else slaughtered because shed let down her guard she couldnt take the chance turning back to moon she laid a hand over her rifle sighed once then mounted she saw the rider and hoped it was ben galloping toward her with charlie running by his side and it shamed her that she was disappointed even for an instant that it was adam how beautiful he is she thought and how sturdy dont see you riding alone much these days she called out he grinned reining in god what a day he drew a deep breath of it lifting his face to the sky lilys party planning and shes rooked tess into it so you settled for me she watched his face laughed at his stunned and guilty expression im only teasing adam and even though i know its no hardship on you im grateful youre keeping an eye on them lilys put it out of her mind all of it he turned his mount to ride alongside willa i imagine its how she dealt with her marriage i dont know if its healthy but it seems to give her peace of mind shes happy here you make her happy he understood that willa would know his deepest feelings she always did she needs time yet to feel safe to trust that i can want her and not hurt her because of it has she told you anything about her exhusband bits and pieces adam shrugged his shoulders restlessly he wanted more he wanted all of it and it was difficult to wait she was teaching when she met him and they got married very quickly it was a mistake she says little more than that but inside shes still afraid if i move too quickly turn abruptly she jumps it breaks my heart it would she thought the wounded always broke his heart ive seen her change in the short time shes been here been with you she smiles more talks more he angled his head youve grown fond of her some he smiled and the other one tess fondisnt the word id use she said dryly im working on toler shes a strong woman smart focused more like you than lily please dont insult me she is she confronts things makes them work for her she hasnt your sense of duty and perhaps her heart isnt as soft but she has both duty and heart i like her very much her brow knit as she turned to look at him do you really yes when i was teaching her to ride she fell off several times she would get up brush off her jeans and climb right back on with a look on her face he remembered that was the mirror of the one willa wore when she was fighting to conquer a new problem that takes courage and determination and pride she makes lily laugh she makes me laugh and ill tell you something she doesnt know secrets grinning willa nudged her horse closer to his dropping her voice though there was no one for miles the sun was easing down toward the western peaks softening the light tell all shes fallen for the horses she doesnt know it or isnt ready to admit it but i see it the way she touches them talks to them sneaks them sugar when she thinks i dont see willa pursed her lips well be into foaling season soon lets see how well she likes birthing i think shell do well and she admires you bullshit you arent ready to see that but i do he squinted gauged the distance back home race you to the barn youre on with a whoop she kicked moon into action and hustled back at a dead run s he walked into the house with color in her cheeks and a gleam in her eye no one beat adam on horseback but shed come close damn close and it had lifted her moodþwhich plummeted immediately when tess came down the stairs there you are upstairs annie oakley party time and your eau de sweat wont do for tonight ive got two hours which may be barely enough time to transform you into something resembling a female hit the showers shed intended to do just that but now her back was up ive got some paperwork oh you cant lily came up behind her hands fluttering its already six so nobodys coming that i need to impress nobodys coming you need to offend either with a sigh tess took her arm and began to haul her up the stairs hey come on lily this is going to take both of us biting her lip lily took willas other arm its going to be so nice really it is to see people youve been working so hard tess and i want you to enjoy yourself then take your damn hands off me she dislodged lily easily enough but tess tightened her grip and steered willa into the bedroom five more seconds and i deck you if you dontþ she broke off staring at the dress laid out on the bed what the hell is that i went through your closet and as theres nothing in it remotely resembling party wearþ hold on this time willa jerked free spun around you went through my clothes i didnt see anything in there to be proprietary about in fact i thought id stumbled into the rag bin but bess assured me it was indeed your wardrobe though her palms had gone damp lily stepped between them we altered one of tesss dresses for you hers with a sneer willa looked tess up and down youd have had to lose half the material to make that work true enough tess shot back and all in the bust but it turns out that bess is very clever with a needle its possible that even with your toothpick legs and flat chest you might look oddly attractive in it tess lily hissed the word and nudged her older sister aside its a beautiful color dont you think youd look so dramatic in jewel tones and this shade of blue is just made for you it was so generous of tess to let it be altered for you i never really cared for it tess said carelessly one of those little fashion mistakes lily closed her eyes briefly and prayed for peace i know im putting you to a lot of trouble with this party will i appreciate so much that youd let me plan it and all but take over the house the last couple of days i know its an inconvenience for you done in willa dragged a hand through her hair i dont know whos better at getting to me but the hell with it just get out both of you i can manage to shower and put on some stupid handmedown dress all by myself accepting victory tess took lilys arm and urged her toward the door wash your hair champ go to hell willa kicked the door shut behind them she felt like a fool a fool who would undoubtedly freeze her ass off in this excuse for a dress before the evening was over as she stood in front of her mirror willa tugged at the hem that little action had the effect of moving it down close to an inch while the lowcut neckline dipped distressingly in reaction toward her navel tits or ass she thought scratching her headþwhich did she want to cover more the dress did have sleeves which was something but they began at midshoulder and nothing she tried seemed to convince them to settle a bit closer to her neck whatever the dress was made of was thin and soft and clung like a second skin grudgingly she stepped into her heels and got a quick lesson in physics as she went up so did the hemline oh screw it stepping closer to the mirror she decided she might as well go all out and use her miserly hoard of cosmetics it was after all new years eve and the dress what there was of it was a pretty color electric blue she supposed maybe she didnt have much cleavage despite the best efforts of that dipping clinging v neck but her shoulders werent half bad and damned if her legs were toothpicks they were long sure but they were muscled and the darktoned panty hose she struggled into hid the couple of new bruises shed discovered after her shower she refused to fuss with her hair she wasnt any good with curls or complicated styles in any case so she left it straight spilling down her back which would at least keep the flesh warm that the plunge back bared she remembered earrings only because adam had given them to her for christmas and she fixed the pretty dangling stars on her lobes now if she could manage to stay on her feet all nightþsince sitting down in that dress wasnt an optionþshed be fine oh you look wonderful were the first words out of lilys mouth when willa came downstairs just wonderful she repeated dancing to the landing in something floaty and winter white tess come see willa looks fabulous tesss comment was a grunt as she stepped out of the room looking dangerous in basic black not half bad she decided secretly thrilled with the results as she tapped her pearl choker and circled willa a little makeup and youll do i have makeup on christ the woman has eyes like a goddess and doesnt know how to use them come on im not going back up there and glopping gunk on my face willa protested as tess dragged her back up the stairs honey for what i pay its firstclass gunk hold the fort lily all right dont be long though and she beamed after them flushed with the warmth of sisterhood she wished they could see how much fun they were together from her point of view squabbling just as she imagined sisters would and now sharing clothes makeup dressing for a party together she was so grateful to be a part of it all giving in to the thrill she spun in a circle then stopped short when she saw adam standing in the hall behind her i didnt hear you come in i came in the back he could have looked at her endlessly the darkhaired fairy in a floating white dress you look beautiful lily thank you she felt very nearly beautiful but he he was so outrageous so perfect in every detail she could barely believe he was real a thousand times over the past months shed longed to touch him not just a hand a brush of shoulders but to touch him part of her was certain he would be offended or amused and that she wouldnt risk im glad youre here she said speaking too quickly now tess took will back up for some lastminute touches and people will start coming any minute i dont do very well playing hostess i never know what to say she stepped back as he stepped forward then made herself stop her heart turned over when he brushed his fingers down her cheek youll be fine they wont know what to say either once they look at you i dont iþ oh she would make a fool of herself now she was certain with this need to fling herself into his arms and be held close just to be held i should help bess in the kitchen shes got everything under control he kept his eyes on hers and his moves slow as he reached for her hand why dont we pick out some music we might even squeeze in a dance before anyone comes i havent danced in a long time youll dance tonight he promised and led her into the great room theyd no more than made their initial selections and filled the cd player when the first headlights glanced off the window promise me the midnight dance he said twining their fingers together again of course im nervous she admitted with a quick smile stay close wont you as long as you need me he glanced over as tess and willa came down sniping at each other because it was expected and warranted adam let out a heartfelt whistle tess winked willa scowled im going to want a drink as soon as possible hissing through her teeth willa strode to the door and greeted the first guests within an hour the house was filled with people and voices and clashing scents apparently no one was too weary to attend another holiday party too jaded to drink another glass of champagne or too restrained to refrain from discussing politics and religion or their neighbors and friends willa remembered why she didnt care for socializing when bethanne mosebly sidled up to her and began to pump her for details of the murder we were all shocked to hear about what happened to john barker bethanne inhaled champagne between sentences with such fervor that willa was tempted to offer her a straw must have been a terrible shock for you though willa didnt immediately snap to john barker and pickles being one and the same bethannes greedily excited eyes tipped her off it s not an experience im looking to repeat excuse me im just going toþ that was as far as she got before bethannes hand clamped down on her arm they said he was cut to pieces she toasted the fact with another gulp of champagne leaving her small birds mouth wet and gleaming just hacked to ribbons the long needle fingers pinched harder and scalped it was the glee that sickened her even more than the image that burst fullblown into her brain even knowing that bethanne had no harm in her other than an overly welldeveloped affection for chatter and gossip willa had to fight off a shudder he was dead bethanne and it was brutal too bad i didnt have my video camera for pictures at eleven the disgust and sarcasm couldnt puncture the avid interest bethanne inched closer giving willa an unwelcome whiff of wine scope and obsession they say it could have been anyone anyone at all who did it why you could be murdered in your own bed any night of the week why i was just telling bob on the drive here how much its been on my mind willa forced her lips into a thin smile ill sleep easier knowing youre so worried about it youre out of champagne bethanne the bars that way willa ducked away then kept moving her one thought was to find air how could anyone breathe with so many people gulping up the oxygen she wondered she pushed her way into the hall and didnt stop until she reached the front door wrenched it open and found herself facetoface with ben he gawked at her and she fumbled recovering before he did she shoved past him and strode over to lean on the porch rail it was cold enough now to send her breath steaming in clouds to make the chill bumps rise on her skin but the air was fresh as a wish and that was exactly what she needed when his hands came to her shoulders and turned her around she ground her teeth the partys inside i wanted to make sure i wasnt hallucinating no he thought she was real enough cool bare skin shivered a bit under his hands those big doe eyes seemed even darker even larger the bold blue of the dress gleamed in the starlight and clung intimately to every curve and angle before it stopped dead teasingly high on long firm thighs god almighty will you look good enough to eat in three quick bites and youre going to freeze your pretty butt off standing out here his coat was already open he made use of it by stepping forward and wrapping it around her enjoying the added benefit of having that tight little body pressed up hard to his turn me loose she squirmed but he had her caught arms pinned body trapped i came out here to be alone for five damn minutes well you shouldve put on a coat pleased with the situation he sniffed at herþmore like a dog than a loverþand heard her muffling a chuckle smell good that idiot tess spraying stuff on me but she was beginning to relax again in the warmth gunking up my face it looks good gunked he grinned when she tipped it back to his eyeing him pityingly whats wrong with men anyway that they fall for this kind of stuff whats so hot about looks that come out of pots and tubes were weak will weak and foolish and easy wanna neck he rooted at her throat and made her laugh cut it out mckinnon you ass but her arms were around his waist now comfortable and shed forgotten what had put her in such a foul mood youre late she added your parents are already here and zack and shelly i thought you werent coming i got hung up h e kissed her before she could duck drew the kiss out when she forgot to protest miss me no liar so because he was grinning just a bit too smugly she looked over his shoulder through the brightly lit window at the crowd of people i hate parties everybody just stands around and yaks whats the point social and cultural interaction a chance to dress up drink for free and ogle each other im planning on ogling you once were back inside unless youd rather go off to the horse barn and let me get you out of that pretty dress more intrigued with the prospect than she wanted to be she lifted a brow are those my only choices we could use my rig but it wouldnt be as cozy why do men think about sex day and night because thinkings the closest thing to doing you got anything on under this sure i had to slick myself down with oil to get it on he winced tried not to moan i deserved that lets go inside and stand around and yak when he stepped back the cold hit her like a slap she shivered her way to the door still she stopped with her hand on the knob turned to him ben why have you suddenly developed this thing about getting my clothes off theres nothing sudden about it he opened the door himself nudged her inside very much at home he shrugged out of his coat and tossed it over the newel post unlike willa he liked parties just fine the noise and fuss and smells of them people deep in conversation were sitting on the staircase with plates of food others jammed into the hall spilled back through the open doors of other rooms most had a greeting for him or a few words to exchange as he kept one hand firmly on willas arm to prevent her escape escape was what she had in mind he knew but he had a point to make he was going to make it to her and to everyoneþincluding several dudedup cowhands who had their eye on her the end of the old year the beginning of the new with all its mysteries and possibilities seemed like the perfect time if youd turn loose of me a minute she muttered close to his ear i couldþ i know what you could im hanging on get used to it what the hells that supposed to mean she could only swear under her breath as he tugged her into the great room guests had moved back making room for dancing ben grabbed a beer on his way and watched with pleasure as his parents executed a quick intricate twostep you can tell something about people who dance together that way he said willa looked up at him what they know each other inside and out and like what they see on both sides now take them he inclined his head toward nate and tess who were swayingþyou couldnt call it dancingþon the edge of the crowd and grinning at each other they dont know each other yet not all the way but theyre having a hell of a good time finding out shes just using him for sex and he looks all broken up about it doesnt he with a chuckle ben set his beer aside come on horrified she pulled back trying to dig in those unfamiliar heels as he towed her to the dance floor i cant i dont want to i dont know how so learn he put a firm hand on her waist positioned hers on his shoulder i dont dance everybody knows i dont dance he merely propped the hand shed taken away back on his shoulder again sometimes you can go a long way following someone who knows where he s going he swung her around so it was either move her feet or fall on her butt she felt miserably clumsy embarrassingly spotlighted and held herself rigid as a board relax he murmured in her ear it doesnt have to hurt look at lily there pretty as a picture with her face all flushed and her hair mussed brewsters having the time of his life teaching her to twostep she looks happy she is and jim brewsterll be half in love with her before the dance is over then hell partner up with another woman and fall half in love with her because she was thinking about that and forgetting to pull back he eased her a little closer thats the beauty of dancing you get your hands on a woman get the feel of her the scent of her and move on to the next sometimes you do sometimes you dont look here a minute willa she did saw the flicker in his eye and barely had time to blink in shock before his mouth was on hers he kissed her slow and deep a stunning contrast to the quick moves of the dance her heart circled giddily in her chest then seemed to plop over and thud to bursting she was moving with him when he lifted his head why did you do that the answer was simple and he planned to be honest so all the men eyeing you know whose brand youre wearing these days and he wasnt disappointed in her reaction her eyes went wide with shock then narrowed with fury her skin went rosy with it even as she hissed he clamped his lips to hers again you might as well get used to that too he told her then he stepped back ill get you a drink he figured by the time he got back with it she wouldnt be tempted to throw it in his face willa was thinking more about shredding his face layer by layer when shelly bustled up to her you and ben i didnt have a clue that man can keep secrets from god as she spoke she steered willa toward a corner when did all this start whats going on it hasnt nothing temper percolated dangerously she could feel it physically feel it bubble under her skin that son of a bitch branding me he said he was branding me he did a romantic through and through shelly patted a hand to her heart oh my zack never said anything like that to me which is why hes still breathing are you kidding id love it she burst out laughing at willas stunned gape come on will macho arrogance is sexy in small doses i get all gooey inside when zack flexes his muscles willa shifted looked hard into shellys eyes how much have you had to drink im not drunk and im not kidding and sometimes he just scoops me up and tosses me over his shoulder with the baby its not quite as spontaneous but boy does it work for you maybe i dont like pushy men i know it was horrible the way everyone just stood around while you were beating ben off shelly drawled it out dipped a finger in her wine licked it off anyone could see how much you detested being kissed brainless willa searched for an intelligent pithy response shut up shelly was the best she could do before she stalked off tc he cowgirl s got a bur up her butt tess commented ben likes to irritate her tess raised an eyebrow at nate i think hed like to do more than that looks like speaking of doing more than that he leaned down and whispered a suggestion in her ear that made her blood pressure spike lawyer torrence you do have a way with words we could slip out go to my place and see the new year in more privately nobodyd miss us um she turned so that her breasts nestled against his chest too far upstairs my room five minutes his eyes widened with all these people in the house and a nice sturdy lock on the door top of the stairs turn left make the first right three doors down on the right she skimmed her fingertips over his jaw ill be waiting tess i thinkþ but she was already gliding away with one smoldering look back over her shoulder he could have sworn he heard his brain cells die he took two steps after her stopped and tried to be sensible the hell with it he hadnt been sensible since shed swaggered into his office with sex on her mind it didnt even matter that he was falling headlong in love and she wasnt even close to tripping they fit whether she saw it or not it had clicked for him hoping to be discreet he snagged a bottle of champagne and two glasses and made it as far as the base of the stairs private party ben asked then chuckled at the flush that spread up nates throat give tess a happy new years kiss from me get your own woman i aim to but he took his time seeking her out and pinning her down again his goal was to have her firmly planted in his arms at midnight he gave her plenty of rope and as the countdown began firmly reeled her in dont you stan on me again only a minute to go he said easily i always think of that last minute between years as untime when her brow furrowed he knew he had her attention and slid his arms around her not now not then not anything if we were alone i could do what i want with you for those sixty seconds but it wouldnt be real so im going to wait till it is put your arms around me it doesnt count yet not for seconds yet she couldnt hear anything but his voice none of the noise the laughter the excited countdown of time penetrated as if in a dream she lifted her arms wound them around his neck tell me you want me he murmured it doesnt count not yet i do but i dontþ no buts it doesnt matter he slid a hand up over her bare back under her hair kiss me its not real not yet you kiss me willa just once you kiss me she angled in kept her eyes open and her mind blank as she fit her lips to his so warm so welcoming so unexpectedly gentle that she shuddered in reaction and time ran out on her cheers echoed somewhere in the back of her head people jostled her in their hurry to exchange new years greetings and as the seconds slid away from the end to the beginning her heart ached with it it is real it was as much accusation as statement when she drew away her eyes glittered with the fresh awareness and the fear of it it is yeah he stunned her by taking her hand bringing it to his lips starting now he slid an arm around her waist kept her close to his side look there darling he shifted her just a little thats a pretty sight even through her own confusion she had to admit it was adam with his hands cupped on lilys face and lilys fingers holding his wrists see how their eyes meet and hold she thought how her lips tremble just a little how gently he brushes them with his and how they stay there just so fixed in that bare whisper of a kiss hes in love with her willa murmured emotions churned inside her too much to feel she thought with a hand pressed to her stomach too much to think too much to wonder whats going on i wish i could understand whats going on nothings the same anymore nothings simple anymore they can make each other happy thats simple no she shook her head no it wont be cant you feel it theres something she shuddered again because she could feel it and it was cold and vicious and close ben theres somethingþ that was when the screaming started there wasnt much blood the police would conclude that she had been killed elsewhere then brought to the ranch no one recognized her her face was largely unmarred just a bruise under the right eye her hair was gone her skin was faintly blue that willa had seen for herself when she rushed outside and found young billy struggling to calm mary anne walker after theyd stumbled over the body she was naked and her skin had crisscrossing slashes in it like hatch marks on a drawing very little blood and what there was had dried on that pale blue skin mary anne had been sick right there on the front steps and billy had soon followed suit chucking up his share of the beer hed guzzled in the rig while he was busy getting mary annes panties down to her ankles willa had gotten them both back inside and ordered everyone who was crowding out on the porch gawking and tlking at once to come back inside she told herself she would think about the woman later the woman with the blue skin and no hair who was dead at the foot of the steps she would think about that later bess has already called the police adam laid a hand on her arm waiting until her eyes shifted to his the voices around them were too loud too frightened i should go out there with ben stay withþstay with her until the police come can you handle this yes she looked up in relief as nate came rushing down the stairs yes go on outside she said reaching for nates hand please go out with ben and adam theres theres another she turned and started into the great room stu mckinnon had already shut off the music was using his strong soothing voice to calm the guests willa let him take charge for the moment while she just stood there staring at her fathers portrait over the fireplace those cold blue eyes stared back at her she could almost see him sneering at her blaming her barefoot her dress not quite zipped tess barreled down the steps just as lily came rushing down the hall what happened someone was screaming theres been another murder lily gripped tesss hand hard i didnt see adam wouldnt let me go out but its a woman no one seems to know who she is she was just there just there in front of the house oh my god tess pressed her free hand to her mouth forced herself to stay in control happy fucking new year okay she took a deep breath lets do whatever comes next they stepped up to willa instinctively flanking her none of them was fully aware that they had linked hands i dont know her willa managed i dont even know her dont think about it now tess tightened her grip on willas hand dont think about it lets just get through this hours later just as dawn broke she felt a hand on her shoulder shed fallen asleep god knew how in front of the living room fire she jerked away struggled away as ben tried to lift her im taking you upstairs youre going to bed no she got to her feet her head was eerily light her body numb but her heart was pounding again no i cant dazed she stared around the room the remnants of the party were all there glasses and plates food going stale ashtrays overflowing whereþ everyones gone the last of the police left ten minutes ago they said they wanted to talk to me again take me into the library again she thought question me again take me through the steps again and again all leading to that moment when she had rushed outside to see two terrified teenagers and a dead woman with pale blue skin what she pressed a hand to her head bens voice was like a buzz in the front of her brain i said i told them they could talk to you later oh coffee is there any coffee left hed already had a good look at her curled in the chair her white face a hard contrast to the dark shadows under her eyes she might be standing at the moment but he knew it was only sheer will that kept her on her feet and that was simple enough to deal with he lifted her off them and into his arms youre going to bed now i cant i have things to do she knew there were dozens of things to do but couldnt seem to think of even one where my sisters his eyebrows lifted as he carried her up the steps he figured she was too punchy to realize it was the first time shed called lily and tess her sisters tess went up an hour ago lilys with adam ham can handle whatever needs to be done today go to sleep will thats all you need to do they asked so many questions she didnt protest couldnt when he laid her on her bed everybody asking questions and the police taking people into the library one at a time she looked at him then into his eyesþcold green now she thought cold and hard and unreadable i didnt know her ben no he slipped off her shoes debated with himself briefly then gritted his teeth and turned her over to unzip her dress theyll check missing persons reports check her prints hardly any blood she murmured quiet as a child as he slid the dress down not like before she didnt seem real not like a person at all do you think he knew her did he know her when he did that to her i dont know darling and as tenderly as if shed been a child he tucked her under the blankets put it away for now sitting on the edge of the bed he stroked her hair just let it go and sleep he blames me her voice was thick and drunk with exhaustion who blames you pa he always did and she sighed he always will ben left his hand on her cheek a moment and he was always wrong when he rose and turned he saw nate in the doorway she out nate asked for now ben laid the dress over a chair knowing will she wont sleep long i talked tess into taking a pill he smiled wanly didnt take much talking he gestured down the hall together they walked to willas office shut the door its early nate said but im having whiskey hate to see you drink alone three fingers he added when nate poured dont think she was from around here no neither did he but nate wanted bens take why well ben sipped hissed through his teeth at the lightning bolt of liquor fingernails and toenails painted up with some shiny purple polish tattoos on her butt and her shoulder looked like three earrings in each ear that says city to me didnt look more than sixteen that says runaway to me nate drank and drank deep poor kid could have been riding her thumb or working the streets in billings or ennis wherever this bastard found her he kept her bens attention sharpened oh i got a little out of the cops abrasions around the wrists and ankles shed been tied up they couldnt say for sure until they run the tests but they seemed fairly sure shed been raped and that shed been dead at least twentyfour hours before he left her here that adds up to being kept somewhere ben paced it off for a moment the frustration and disgust why here why dump her here someones focused on mercy or on someone at mercy ben added and saw by the look in nates eyes that they agreed all this started after the old man died after tess and lily came here maybe we should start looking closer at them and whod want to hurt them im going to talk to tess when she wakes up we know theres an exhusband in lilys past one who liked to knock her around ben nodded and absently rubbed the scar across his chin its a long jump from wife abuse to slicing up strangers maybe not that long a jump i d feel better knowing where the ex is and what hes up to we feed his name to the cops hire a detective were on the same beam there you know his name no but adam will ben downed the rest of the whiskey set the glass aside might as well get started they found him in the stables examining a pregnant mare she s going to foal early adam said as he straightened up another day or two after a last stroke he stepped out of the foaling stall slid the door closed will sleeping ben told him for the moment he nodded moved down the concrete aisle to the grain bin lily s in on my couch she wanted to help with the morning feeding but she dropped off while she was waiting for me to change im glad she didnt see it tess either his usual fluid movements were jerky with tension and fatigue im sorry will did shell get through it ben moved to a hay net filled it with fresh how much do you know about lilys exhusband not a lot adam continued to work as unsurprised by the assistance as the question his names jesse cooke they met when she was teaching got married a couple months later she left him about a year after that the first time she hasnt told me much more and i havent been pushing does she know where he is ignoring his best suit nate filled a feeding trough she thinks back east thats what she wants to think for the next few minutes they worked in silence three men accustomed to the routine the smells the work the stables were lit with the morning sun trailing through the open corral door with hay motes dancing cheerfully in every slanting beam horses shifted on fresh bedding munched on feed blew an occasional greeting from the chicken house a rooster called and there was the jangle of boots on hardpacked dirt as men went about their chores in the ranch yard no radio played tinny country this morning nor was the winter silence broken by the voices of men at work if glances were tossed toward the main house the porch the space beneath no one commented an engine gunned a rig headed out and the silence came back a lingering guest at a party gone wrong you may have to push her a bit now ben said at length its an angle we cant afford to ignore not after this ive already thought of that i want her to get some rest first goddamn it the grain scoop adam held snapped at the handle with the quick flex of his hands she should be safe here the temper he rarely acknowledged swirled up so fast so huge it choked his words he wanted to pound something rip something to shreds but he had nothing even his hands were empty now that was a child out there how could someone do that to a child he whirled on them his hands in fists his eyes dark and burning with rage how close was he was he out there looking through the windows or was he inside with us did the son of a bitch touch her dance with her if shed walked outside to get a breath of air would he have been there he looked down at his hands opened them to stare at the palms i could kill him myself and it would be easy his gaze shifted skimmed both men it would be so easy adam lilys voice was hardly a whisper quiet fear at the edge of his black rage with her arms crossed her fingers digging hard into her shoulders she stepped closer you should be sleeping his muscles quivered with the effort to hold back the fury were nearly done here go on home to bed i need to talk to you shed heard enough seen enough to know the time had come alone please she turned to ben and nate im sorry i need to speak with adam alone take her inside nate suggested ben and i can finish this take her in he repeated shes cold you shouldnt have come out here adam moved to her careful not to touch lets go in have some coffee i put some on before i came out she noted that he stayed an arms length away and it made her ashamed it should be ready now he walked her out the back across the corral fence and to his rear door from habit he scraped his boots before going inside the kitchen smelled cozily of coffee just brewed but the light was thin and stingy and it prompted him to flip the switch and fill the room with hard artificial light sit down she began ill get it no he stepped in front of her as she reached for the cupboard door still he didnt touch her you sit youre angry she hated the tremor in her voice hated the fact that anger from a man even this man could turn her knees to water im sorry for what it snapped out of him before he could stop it even when she backed up a step he couldnt block it all what the hell have you got to apologize to me for for everything i havent told you you dont owe me explanations the cupboard door slammed against the wall as he wrenched it open and out of the corner of his eye he saw her jerk in reaction dont flinch from me he leveled his breathing kept his eyes on the cups set neatly in rows on the shelves dont do that lily id cut off my hands before id use them on you that way i know tears swam into her eyes and were blinked brutally back i know that in my heart its my head adam and i do owe you she walked to the round kitchen table with its simple white bowl of glossy red apples more than explanations youve been my friend my anchor youve been everything ive needed since i came here you dont pay someone back for friendship he said wearily you wanted me her breath hitched once as he turned slowly to face her i thought it was just just the usual her nervous hands brushed at her hair at the thighs of the jeans shed pulled on before leaving the main house that morning but you never touched me that way or pressured me or made me feel obliged you cant know what its like to feel obliged to let someone have you just to keep peace how degrading that is i have things to tell you she couldnt look at him turned her face away ill start with jesse could i cook breakfast he held a cup in his hand as he stared at her what it will be easier for me if i have something to do while i talk i dont know if i can get it out just sitting here since it was what she wanted he set the cup down wlked to the table and sat theres bacon in the refrigerator and eggs she let out a long unsteady breath good she went to the coffee first poured him a cup but her gaze avoided his i told you a little she began as she went to the refrigerator about how i was teaching i was never as smart or as creative as my mother shes amazing adam so strong and vital i didnt know until i was twelve how much hed hurt her my father i heard her talking to a friend once crying shed just met my stepfather and she was i realize now afraid of her feelings for him she was talking about prefemng to be alone about never wanting to be vulnerable to a man again about how my father had turned her out and shed been so much in love with him hed turned her out she said because she hadnt given him a son adam said nothing as she arranged bacon in a black iron frying pan and set it to sizzle so it was because of me that she was alone and afraid you know better than that lily it was because of jack mercy my heart knows it she smiled a little its my head again in any case i never forgot that she did marry my stepfather two years later and theyre very happy hes a wonderful man he was strict with me never harsh but strict and a bit remote it was my mother he wanted and i came with the package he wanted the best for me gave me all he could but he could never give me the kind of easy affection there might have been between a father and daughter it was i guess too late in starting for us and you were hungry for that easy affection oh starved she whipped eggs in a bowl i got a lot of this out of therapy and counseling much later its so easy to see it now id never had a warm loving relationship with a male figure id never had a man focused on me and i was shy crushingly shy in school with boys i didnt date much and i was very serious about my studies her smile was a bit more natural as she grated cheese into the eggs terribly serious i couldnt see things the way my mother could so i rooted myself in facts and figures and i was good with children so teaching seemed a natural course i was twentytwo and teaching fifth grade when i met jesse in a coffee shop near my apartment my first apartment the first month i was out on my own he was so charming so handsome so interested in me i was dazzled automatically she sprinkled dill in the beaten eggs ground a hint of pep per over them i suppose he picked me up that was a new experience for me we went to the movies that same evening and he called me every day after school brought me flowers and little gifts he was a mechanic and he tuned up this pitiful car i had you fell in love with him adam concluded oh yes completely blindly in love i never looked past the surface with jesse didnt know i should later i could pick out the lies hed told me about his family his past his work his mother i found out later was in an institution shed beaten him as a child she drank and used drugs so did he but i never knew until we were married the first time he hit me she trailed off cleared her throat for a moment there was only the sound of grease crackling as she took bacon out of the pan it was about a month after we were married one of my friends at school was having a birthday and we were going to go to one of those clubs silly where the men dance and women tuck dollar bills into their jockstraps just foolishness jesse seemed to think of it that way too until i was dressing to go then he started on what i was wearing the dress the hair the makeup i laughed sure that he was teasing me suddenly he grabbed my purse emptied it out tore up my drivers license i was so shocked so angry i grabbed it back from him and he knocked me down he was slapping me shouting calling me names he tore my clothes and he raped me with surprisingly steady hands she poured eggs into the pan he cried afterward like a baby huge racking sobs she let out a little breath because it was too easy to remember to see it all again jesse had been in the marinesþhe was so proud of that of his discipline and strength you cant imagine what it was like to see someone id thought was so strong cry that way it was shocking and devastating and in a terrible way empowering strength adam thought had nothing to do with unifomms or biceps he hoped shed learned that as well he begged me to forgive him lily went on said hed gone crazy with jealousy thinking about other men being near me he said that his mother had left his father when he was a child ran off with another man before he had told me shed died both were lies but i believed him and i forgave him it wasnt easy to be honest all the way honest but she wanted to be i forgave him adam because it made me feel strong in that moment and because i thought if hed lost control that way it had to be because he loved me thats part of the trapþthe cycle he didnt hit me again for eight weeks slowly and with great concentration she stirred the bubbling eggs doesnt matter what it was over it was a pattern that i refused to see that i was just as much responsible for as he was he started to drink and he lost his job and he beat me i forgot the toast she said matteroffactly and walked over to the bread box lilyþ she shook her head i let him convince me it was my fault every time my fault i wasnt smart enough sexy enough quiet enough loose enough whatever the situation called for it went on for over a year twice he put me in the hospital and i lied and said id fallen then one day i looked at myself in the mirror i saw what my friends had been seeing all those months what they saw when they tried to talk to me about it to help me the bruises that animal look in the eye the bones sharp in my face because i couldnt keep weight on she went back to the eggs turning them gently as they set i walked out i dont remember exactly i know i didnt take anything and that i went home to my mother just like the cliche i know i was afraid because hed told me he would never let me go that if i ever left hed come after me but i knew id kill myself if i stayed even another day i had thought about it planned how i would do it with pills because im a coward she arranged the eggs the toast the bacon on a plate and brought it to the table he came after me she said and for the first time looked into adams face he was waiting for me one day when i went out and he dragged me to his car he choked me screaming at me he drove off with me half unconscious beside him he was calmer then explaining things to me the way hed always done why i was wrong why i needed to be taught how a wife was supposed to behave i was more terrified then than id ever been before when he was calm i was more afraid of what he would doþ could do to me she steadied herself because the fear could sneak back at any time peck away at her faltering courage he had to slow down for traffic and i jumped out the car was still moving but i didnt fall i always thought it was a miracle i went to the police and got a restraining order i started to move around he always found me the last time the time before i came here he found me again and i think he wouldve killed me that time but a neighbor heard me screaming and beat at the door started breaking in the door and jesse ran she sat folded her hands on the table so did i i didnt think he could find me here ive barely contacted my mother because i was afraid hed get to me through her but i spoke with her this morning before i came out to the stables she hasnt seen him or heard from him she drew a deep breath i know that you and ben and nate are going to talk to the police about this ill answer any questions about him but he never hurt anyone but me that i know of and he only ever used his hands it seems that if he had found me he would have come after me hell never hurt you again he nudged the plate aside so he could cover her hands with his whatever the answers are lily hell never touch you again i swear it if it is him she squeezed her eyes tight if it is adam then im responsible im responsible for two peoples lives no youre not if it is him she continued calmly i have to face that and live with it ive been hiding here adam using you and will and this place to keep all the bad things away it doesnt work she sighed turned her hands over in his i have to face it i learned that in therapy too i dont have courage not the natural kind like will and tess have what i have has been learned practiced i was afraid to tell you all this and now i wish i had told you right from the start it would make the rest of this easier theres more not about jesse and not about the horrible things but its hard you can tell me anything with all that happened last night my mind keeps coming back and rerunning this one moment with a nervous laugh she drew her hands out from under his i wish youd eat its going cold lily baffled he pressed his fingers to his eyes then obediently shifted his plate lifted his fork what one moment its just that i thought as i was saying before that you wanted me that it was the usual i didnt see how it could be anything but well that kneejerk sort of response men have pheromones she glanced up wary as he choked it seemed that way she said defensive now and you never said or did anything to indicate otherwise until last night and that moment when you took my face in your hands and you looked at me and everything went away but you when you kissed me everything went away except you then it all went wrong but for that moment just that one moment it was so lovely she rose quickly hurried to the stove i know it was new years people kiss at midnight and it doesnt meanþ i love you lily the words slid through her like hope she caught them held them to her and turned he stood now only a step behind her the thin winter sunlight on his hair and his eyes only for her i fell in love the minute i saw you but then id been waiting for you all my life just for you he held out a hand only for you joy broke through the hope a hot bubbling geyser through a calm pool its so simple really she took his hand when its right its so simple and went into his arms i dont want to be anywhere but with you were home here he buried his face in her hair stay with me yes she turned her lips to his throat caught the first sharp flavor of him ive wanted you to touch me adam touch me now he cupped her face as he had before kissed her as he had before but this time her arms came around him and her response was soft and sweet and shy when he drew her away he didnt have to ask but led her out of the kitchen into the bedroom with its tidily made bed and simple window shades then he touched her hair stepped back to give her room to decide is it too soon the wanting trembled inside her no its perfect youre perfect turning he pulled the shades so that the sun pulsed gold behind them and turned morning into dusk inside the small room she took the first step and it was easier than she could have imagined she sat on the side of the bed the color high in her cheeks as she removed her boots he sat beside her did the same then kissed her quietly are you afraid it was a wonder to her that she wasnt nervous yes but without real fear she knew the flavor of real fear and its bitter aftertaste well shaking her head she rose and lifted her hands to the buttons of her shirt i just dont want you to be disappointed the woman i love is going to lie with me how could i be disappointed watching him alert for every response she slipped the shirt off her shoulders for a moment she held it bunched in front of her breasts she would remember this lily thought every moment of this every word every movement every breath he stood walked to her a hand on her shoulder first a light stroke along the curve his eyes on hers gently he took the shirt from her let it fall his gaze lowered as did his hands both skimming softly over the tops of her breasts she let her eyes close as his fingers trailed dipped traced then she opened them slowly to unfasten the buttons of his shirt draw the flannel aside then watch the pale skin of her hands glide over the smooth copper of his chest i want to feel you against me he murmured it as he unhooked her bra slid the straps down let it slip to the floor between them gathering her close he held her a tremor rippled through him a calm lake disturbed by a lazy finger i wont hurt you lily no of that she could be certain of that she could be sure as his lips lowered to test the skin of her shoulders her throat there would be no pain here not even that of embarrassment here there was trust and desire could be kind she didnt jump when his fingers tugged at the snap of her jeans she shuddered but not with fear as he slid the denim down over her hips murmuring to her as he helped her step free her heart quaked when he stripped off his own jeans but it quaked in delight and wonder and keen anticipation he was so beautiful that golden skin taut over lean muscles that sleek shiny hair skimming strong shoulders and he wanted her wanted to belong to her it was to lily a fine glittering miracle adam she sighed out his name as they lowered themselves to the bed adam wolfchild with the good solid weight of him pressing her into the mattress she wrapped her arms tight around his neck drew his mouth down to hers love me i do i will while they celebrated life in a shadowy room another celebrated death in the daylight deep in the forest alone and gleeful he studied the trophies hed so carefully arranged in a metal box prizes of the kill he thought stroking the long golden hair of a young girl whod taken a wrong turn her name was traci shed told him when hed offered her a ride traci with an i she claimed to be eighteen but hed seen the lie in that her face was pudgy still with baby fat but her body when he took her into the hills later and stripped her was female enough it had been so easy a young girl with her thumb out along the side of the road a purple knapsack slung over her shoulders tight jeans showing off her short legs and that bright gold hair out of a bottle of course but it had gotten his attention gleaming like gilded fire in the sun her fingernails had been painted to match the knapsack a bright unnatural purple later hed seen that her toes were accented with the same color hed let her ramble awhile he remembered as he stroked the hair getting out of dodge she said and laughed thats where she was fromþ dodge city kansas youre not in kansas anymore he told her and nearly fell over laughing at his own wit hed let her ramble awhile he thought again about how she was going to work her way up to canada and see some of the world she took gum out of her sack offered him some he found four neatly rolled joints in it later but had she offered him any of that no indeedy he knocked her unconscious one quick fist to the cheek that had rolled her eyes back white and he took her up into the hills to where it was quiet and private and he could do whatever he liked he liked to do quite a lot he raped her first a man had his priorities tied her up good and tight so she couldnt use those purple nails to scratch she screamed herself hoarse bucking and squiggling on that narrow cot while he did things to her used things on her smoked her pot and did it all again she begged and pleaded with him to let her go then she begged and pleaded some more when she saw he was going to leave her there tied up and naked but a man had responsibilities and he wasnt able to stay when he came back twentyfour hours later he could have sworn she was happy to see him the way she cried so he did her again and when he told her to say how much she liked it she agreed that she had she told him everything he wanted to hear until she saw the knife it had taken him more than an hour to clean up the blood but it had been worth it well worth it and the best part the very best part had been the inspiration of dumping what was left of traci with an i from dodge city kansas right at the doorstep of mercy ranch oh that had been sweet tenderly he kissed the bloodied hair placed it carefully in the box they were all running scared now he thought as he put the box back in its hole rebuilt the small calm over it all of them trembling in their shoes afraid of him when he rose lifted his face to the cold winter sun he knew he was the biggest man in montana if anyone had told tess she would spend a frigid january night in a i horse stall kneeling in blood and birth fluid and enjoy every minute of it she would have given them the name of her agents psychiatrist but thats exactly what she had done for the second night running she had seen two foals born even had a small part in it and it thrilled her sure as hell gets your mind off your problems doesnt it she stood back with adam and lily as the newborn struggled to gain its feet for the first time youve got a nice touch with horses tess adam told her i dont know about that but its keeping me sane everybodys so jumpy i came out of the chicken house yesterday and walked right into billy i dont know which of us jumped higher its been ten days lily rubbed her hands together to warm them its starting to seem unreal i know will has talked to the police several times but theres still nothing look adam slid an arm around her shoulders drew her to his side as the foal began to nurse thats real and sos the ache in my back tess pushed a hand to it it was as good an excuse as any to leave them alone and she thought a hot bath and a few hourssleep would set her up for a visit to nates im going in you were a big help tess i appreciate it grinning she picked up her hat settled it on her head christ if my friends could see me now she chuckled over the idea as she walked out of the stables and into the wild cold of the morning what would they say at her favorite beauty salon if she walked in like this with god knew what under her nails jeans and flannel smeared with afterbirth her hair well that didnt bear thinking of and not a lick of makeup she imagined that mr william her stylist would topple over in a dead faint on his pink carpet well she thought the entire experience was going to make for some fascinating cocktail conversation once she was back in la she visualized herself at some tony party in beverly hills regaling her hostess with tales of shoveling manure gathering eggs castrating cowsþthat part she would embellishþand riding the range a far cry tess mused from the fancy vanity ranches some of the hollywood set indulged in then she would add that thered also been some psychopath on the loose she shuddered and drew her coat closer put it out of your mind she told herself doesnt help to think about it then she saw willa on the porch just standing on the second step staring out at the hills frozen tess thought like midass daughter at his touch not a clue tess realized what a picture she made willa was the only woman in tesss acquaintance who had no real concept of her own power as a female for willa it was all work the land the animals the men she was working at perfecting a sarcastic comment when she drew up close enough to see willas face devastated her hat dangled at her back over that black waterfall of loose hair her back was straight as an arrow her chin angled she should have appeared confident even arrogant but her eyes were haunted and blind with what might have been guilt or grief what is it willa blinked the only movement she made she didnt turn her head didnt shift her feet the police were just here now just a little while ago shed lost track of the time already couldnt have said how long shed been standing there in the cold you look like you need to sit down tess came up one step then two lets go in they found out who she was willa still didnt move but her gaze shifted until it rested on the space at the bottom of the steps her name was traci mannerly she was sixteen she lived in dodge city with her parents and her two younger brothers shed run away from home this was the second time about six weeks ago tess shut her eyes she hadnt wanted a name she hadnt wanted details it was easier to get through the day without them lets go in they told me shed been dead at least twelve hours before we found her here shed been tied up at the wrists and the ankles there were rope burns and abrasions where shed tried to get free thats enough and shed been raped they said repeatedly and sodomized and she was she was two months pregnant she was pregnant and she was sixteen and she was from kansas thats enough tess said again there were tears spilling out of her eyes as she wrapped her arms around willa they swayed there on the step weeping and holding tight and hardly aware of it a hawk screamed overhead the clouds bundled up to block the sun and threaten snow they stood together clutched by the fear and grief only women fully understand what are we going to do tess shuddered out a breath oh god what are we going to do i dont know i just dont know anymore willa didnt pull away even as she realized they were holding tight to each other in the rising wind she stayed where she was i can run this place even with all this i can do it but i dont know if i can stand thinking about that girl it doesnt do any good to think about it we can think about why why he brought her here we can think about that but not about her and we can think about us she eased back scrubbed the tears from her face wed better start thinking about us i think lily and i need lessons in how to handle a gun willa stared at her a moment began to see more than the glossy hollywood facade ill teach you she took a steadying breath slipped her hat back into place well get started now i cc t s a worrisome thing ham commented over his midday bowl of chili jim helped himself to a second bowl and winked at billy whats that ham the answer waited and the sound of gunfire echoed a woman with a gun ham said in his slow dry voice more worrisome is three women with three guns tell you the truthþjim dumped a biscuit into his bowl and took a hefty biteþthat tess looks mighty sexy with a rifle on her shoulder ham eyed him pityingly boy you aint got enough work to occupy you no amount of work ought to keep a man from looking at a pretty woman right billy right though for himself billy hadnt given women much thought since the night of the new years party bouncing on mary anne in the rig had been just fine and dandy but the awful experience of finding the body with her had put a pall over the entire event scary though he said with his mouth full theyve been at it better than a week and i aint seen tess hit a target yet makes a man leery of going out of doors while the shootings going on tell you what i think jim thumped a burp out of his chest and rose i think what they need is a man to show them how its done i got a few minutes nobody needs to show will what to do with a gun quick pride peppered hams voice after all hed been the one to teach her how to shoot she can outshoot you or anybody else in montana with one eye closed why dont you leave those women alone i aint going to touch jim shrugged into his coat unless i get the chance he stepped outside and spotted jesse climbing out of a rig hey jc grinning he threw up a hand havent seen you for a couple weeks been busy he knew he was taking a chance a big one coming over to mercy in the daylight hours he visited there as often as he could at night in the shadows often enough to know that his whorebitch of a wife was spreading her legs for wolfchild but that could wait i was down at ennis picking up some parts you had an order come in he tossed a package at jim then skimmed a finger over his mustache he was beginning to like the feel of it brought it by for you appreciate it jim set the package on the rail bout time for poker id say im up for it why dont you and your boys come around to three rocks tonight he grinned charmingly ill send you back lighter in the pocket might just do that he glanced over at the sound of gunshots chuckled we got us three females at target practice i was about to give them some pointers women ought to stay away from guns jesse took out a pack of cigarettes shook one out offered it theyre spooked youd have heard about the trouble here sure jesse blew out smoke wondered if he could risk a glimpse of lily in the daytime bad business kid wasnt it from nebraska kansas i hear runaway got the shit killed out of her young girls ought to stay home where they belong eyes narrowing jesse studied the flame of his cigarette learn how to be wives women want to be men these days you ask me this time his grin was just a little mean course maybe that dont bother you seeing as you got a woman for a boss jims back went up but he nodded easily enough cant say i care for it much generally but will knows whats what maybe the way i hear it by next fall youll have three women bosses well see his pleasant anticipation of showing off in front of the women faded he picked up the package appreciate you dropping this off no problem jesse turned back to the rig you come on by tonight and bring money im feeling lucky yeah soured jim adjusted his hat watched the rig drive off asshole he muttered and went back in the bunkhouse on the makeshift target range well behind the pole sarn lily shuddered getting cold tess asked no just a chill but she caught herself looking over her shoulder peering against the sun at the glint of it on the chrome of a departing rig someone walked over my grave she murmured well thats cheery resuming her stance tess drew a bead on the tin can with the little smith wesson ladysmithþwhat willa called a pocket pistolþand fired missed by a mile shit you can always beat him over the head with it will stepped behind her again steadied tesss arm concentrate i was concentrating its just a little bullet if i had a bigger gun like yoursþ youd fall on your ass every time you fired it youll use a girl gun until you know what youre doing come on even lily hits the mark five times out of ten i just havent found my groove she fired again scowled that was closer i know that was closer yeah at this rate youll be able to hit the side of a barn in a year willa drew the singleaction army colt out of the holster riding low on her hip the was a lot of gunþweighty and meanþbut she preferred it showing off only a little she picked off six cans with six shots annie fucking oakley tess sniffed and hated the surge of admiration and envy she felt how the hell do you do that concentration a steady hand and a clear eye smiling she slid the gun back into its sheath maybe you need something more hate anybody besides you willa merely raised an eyebrow who was the first guy to dump you and break your heart no one dumps me champ then her lips pouted there was joey columbo in sixth grade little son of a bitch led me on then twotimed me with my best friend put his face over that can standing on the fence rail there and plug one between his eyes teeth set tess shifted aimed her finger trembled on the trigger then she lowered the gun with a laugh christ i cant shoot a tenyearold hes all grown up now living in bel air and still laughing about the chubby dork he dumped in junior high bastard now her teeth bared as she took her shot i nipped it she shouted it dancing a bit and willa cautiously removed the gun from her hand before tess could shoot herself in the foot it moved probably the wind hell it was i killed joey columbo just a flesh wound hes lying on the ground watching his life pass in front of his eyes youre starting to enjoy this too much lily decided i just pretend im in one of those arcades at the carnival and im trying to win the big stuffed teddy bear her cheeks flushed when her sisters both turned and stared at her well it works for me what color willa asked after a moment what color teddy bear she elaborated pink lily slanted her eyes left at tesss chortle of laughter i like pink teddy bears and ive won a good dozen of them while youve been shooting thin air oh now shes getting nasty i think we should have a contest not you killer tess said nudging willa aside just me and the teddy bear lover she leaned closer to lily lets see if you can handle the pressure sister then i suggest you reload willa bent down for the ammo youre both going to be shooting empty whats the winner get carefully reloading tess hunkered down besides satisfaction we need a prize i do best with clear set goals loser does the laundry for a week willa decided bess could use a break oh lily rose id be happy toþ shut up lily with a shake of her head willa looked at tess agreed everyones laundry including delicates including your fancy french panties by hand no silks in the washing machine satisfied with the deal tess stepped back you go first she told lily twelve shots each in two rounds of six when youre ready lily okay she took a breath replayed everything willa had taught her about stance breathing it had taken her days to stop slamming her eyes shut as she squeezed the trigger and she was proud of her progress she fired slowly steadily and watched four cans fly four out of six not too shabby guns down ladies willa ordered as she walked over to reset the targets i can do that tess straightened her shoulders i can hit all of them theyre all that frecklefaced bastard joey columbo i bet hes on his second divorce by now twotiming koolaid swiller she shocked everyone including herself by knocking three cans from their perch i hit that other one i heard it ping it did lily agreed generously were tied reload enjoying herself willa strolled over to reset when she turned and spotted nate heading their way she lifted an arm in salute hold your fire he stopped short and threw his hands up when lily and tess turned im unarmed want to put an apple on your head fluttering her lashes tess stepped closer and met him with a kiss not even for you dead eye were in the middle of a shootoff willa informed him lily youre up i see a giant pink teddy bear in your future she laughed and set her hands on her hips you had to be here she told nate then whooped when lily hit five out of six sign her up for the wild west show beat that hollywood i can do it but her palms were sweaty she caught a whiff of horses and cologne that was nate and rolled her tensed shoulders she took aim squeezed the trigger and missed all six shots i was distracted she claimed as willa cheered and pulled lilys hand up over her head you distracted me she told nate honey youre a wonder not everybody can hit thin air six times out of six nate cautiously took the gun unloaded or not out of her hand and gave her a hard kiss in consolation willa smirked dont forget to separate the whites laundry girl and pick up your spent shells lily moved close as she and tess gathered up shells ill help you she whispered the hell you will a bets a bet tess cocked her head but next time we armwrestle im heading into ennis for some supplies nate rocked back on his heels and tried too obviously not to stare at the denim straining over tesss butt as she picked up spent shells from the ground thought id stop by and see if you needed anything like hell willa thought noting just where his eyes kept wandering thanks but bess went in a couple days ago and stocked up tess straightened want some company on the ride thatd be good her eyes stayed on his as she dumped her handful of shells into willa s open palm ill just get my purse she tucked her arm through nates and shot a sly look over her shoulder tell bess i wont be back for dinner just be back for wash day willa shouted after her shes got a clamp on his balls all right i think theyre nice together lily said handsome and easy his smile just breaks out whenever he sees her thats because he knows his pants are going to end up around his ankles she laughed at lilys disapproving look good for them i just dont get the sex thing thats all are you afraid of it the question was so unexpected considering the source willa could only gape huh i was before jesse with him after automatically lily walked over to stack the target cans i think its natural before you know when you just cant know how things will be whether youll do something wrong or make a fool of yourself its pretty basic stuff what could you do wrong a lot of things i did a lot of things wrong or thought i did but i wasnt afraid with adam not when i realized he cared for me i wasnt afraid at all with adam who could be a smile played around lilys mouth then she sobered you havent said anything about i know that you know that imþwith him she let out a breath watched it fog in the chilly air then disappear that im sleeping with him really willa tucked her tongue in her cheek i thought he waited for you at the side door every night then walked you back at dawn because you were holding a secret canasta tournament you mean youre having sex im shocked the smile came back adam said we wouldnt fool anyone why would you want to he he asked me to move into his house but i didnt know how youd feel about it hes your brother you make him happy i want to she hesitated then slipped a chain from under her shirt keeping her fingers closed around something that dangled from it he wants he gave me this stepping closer willa looked at what rested in lilys open palm it was a simple ring black hills gold etched with a diamond pattern it was my mothers willa whispered as her throat closed adams father gave it to her when they were married she lifted her eyes to lily adam asked you to marry him yes hed done so beautifully lily remembered with simple words and quiet promises i couldnt give him an answer yet it didnt feel right i made such a mess of things beforeþ she broke off cursed herself i was in such a mess before she corrected and ive only been here a few months i felt i had to speak with you first it has nothing to do with me it doesnt willa insisted when lily began to protest this is between you and adam completely i only have the benefit of being tremendously happy take it off the chain lily put it on and go find him no dont cry she leaned forward and kissed lilys cheek hell think somethings wrong i love him lily slipped the chain over her head slid the ring off with everything i have i love him it fits she managed as she put the ring on her finger he said it would it fits willa agreed beautifully go on and tell him ill finish up here as they bumped along the access road tess stretched luxuriously youre looking awfully smug for someone who just lost a shootout im feeling smug i dont know why lowering her arms she scanned the scenery the snowcovered mountains the long lay of the land lifes a mess theres a mad killer still at large and i havent had a manicure in two months im actually thrilled with the prospect of going into some little bumfuck town and windowshopping god help me you like your sisters nate shrugged at her arch look youve gone ahead and bonded despite yourselves i watched the three of you out there and im telling you tess i saw a unit a common goal thats all were protecting ourselves and our inheritance bull she scowled folded her arms youre going to wreck my fine mood nate i saw the mercy women teamwork affection the mercy women she laughed carelessly then pursed her lips it has a ring doesn t it she mused maybe i dont think wills quite as big a pain in the butt as i did but thats because shes adjusting and youre not why would i have to there was nothing wrong with me she trailed a finger up his thigh was there other than being stuckup ornery and hardheaded not a thing he hissed through his teeth when her fingers streaked up found his weakness and pinched and you love it inspired she struggled out of her coat too warm automatically he reached down to adjust the heater its going to be she promised and tugged her sweater over her head what are you doing shock made him nearly run off the road put that back on uhuh pull over and she flicked the front hook of her bra so that her breasts spilled out like glory its a public road its broad daylight she reached over tugged down his zipper and found him hard and ready and your point is youre out of your mind anybody could come along and christ jesus tess he managed as she slid her head under his arm and clamped her mouth on him ill kill us pull over she repeated but the teasing note had fled now there was hoarse and husky need as she tore open his shirt oh god i want you inside me all the way in hard fast now the rig rocked the wheels spun but he managed to get to the shoulder of the road without flipping them over he jerked on the brake fought himself free of the seat belt in one rough move he had her on her back all but folded on the seat while he struggled with her jeans well be arrested he panted ill risk it hurry weþoh god there was nothing under the denim but her you should have frozen even as he said it he was dragging her hips free why arent you wearing long johns i must be psychic right now she was simply desperate and she arched up her moan was deep and throaty and melded with his as he rammed himself into her then there were only gasps and groans and pants the windows steamed the seat squeaked and they came almost in unison in less than a dozen thrusts good god he would have collapsed on her if thered been room i must be crazy she opened her eyes then started to laugh her ribs were aching before she could control it nate the respected attorney and salt of the earth how the hell are you going to explain my bootprints on the ceiling of your truck he looked up studied them and sighed pretty much the same way im going to explain the fact that i no longer have a single button on this shirt ill buy you a new one she sat up managed to locate her bra and snap it on giving her hair a quick shake she boosted her hips to get her sweater lets go shopping yu got a minute will willa looked up from the papers spread over the desk v pulled herself out of the figures christ grass seed was dear but if they were going to rebroadcast she wanted to start now birth and wean weights circled in her head as she closed a ledger sorry sure ham problem not exactly he held his hat in his hands and eased himself into a chair the winter had been hard on his bones age was hard on the bones he corrected and he was starting to feel the years more with every passing wind i went down to the feedlot like you wanted looks good ran into beau radley from over high springs ranch yes i remember beau she rose to put another log on the fire she knew hams bones as well as he did lord ham he must be eighty eightythree this spring so he tells me when you can get a word in ham set his hat on his lap tapped his fingers on the arms of the chair it was odd sitting there where hed sat so many times seeing willa behind the desk with coffee at her elbow instead of the old man with a glass of whiskey in his hand jumping up jesus that man could drink willa struggled with impatience ham took his time and everyone else s when he had a point to make she often thought conversations with him were like watching a glacier move generations were born and died before you got to the end of it beau radley ham uhhuh you know his youngun moved on down to scottsdale arizona must be twenty twentyfive years ago thatd be beau junior who would be by willas estimation about sixty and well beaus missus thats heddy radley she makes those watermelon pickles that always take first prize at the county fair seems shes got the arthritis pretty bad im sorry to hear that if they got a break in the weather early willa thought as her mind wandered she would see if lily wanted to start a kitchen garden a real one winters been hard ham commented dont seem to be letting up and its coming to calfpulling time i know im thinking about adding another pole barn might be an idea ham said noncommittally then took out his tobacco and began to meticulously roll a cigarette beaus selling out and moving down with his boy to scottsdale is he willas attention snapped back high springs had excellent pastureland done made him a deal with one of those developers ham laid his tongue over the paper spat lightly whether it was a comment on developers or tobacco in his mouth willa couldnt have said going to break it up put in some cussed dude ranch resort and raise frigging buffalo the deals already made said it was paid him three times what the lands wolth for ranching goddamn city jackals well thats that wed never match the price she blew out a breath rubbed her hands over her face then lowered them as another idea came to her what about his equipment his cattle horses im getting to it ham blew out smoke watched it drift to the ceiling willa imagined cities being built leveled new stars being born novas hes got a new baler barely three seasons old wood sure would like to have it dont think much of his string of horses but hes a good cattleman beau is he paused smoked some more oaks grew from acorns told him i thought youd pay twofifty a head for what he had on the feedlot he didnt seem insulted by it how many head about two hundred good hereford beef all right make the deal all right theres more ham tapped his cigarette out settled back the fire was warm the chair soft beaus got two hands ones a college boy he just signed on last year out of bozeman one of those animal husbandry fellas beau says hes got highfalutin ideas but he s smart as a whip knows to beat all about crossbreeding and embryo transplants the others ned tucker known him ten years easy good cowboy steady worker hire them willa said into the next pause at whatever wage they were getting at high springs told beau i figured that he liked the idea feels warm toward ned wants him to be settled at a good spread he started to rise then settled back again i got something else to say her brow raised so say it maybe you think i cant handle my job no more now it was shock plain and simple on her face why would i think that why would you think that seems to me youre doing your work and half of mine besides with a little of everybody elses tossed in if you aint in here going over your papers then youre out riding fence checking pasture looking at the equipment doctoring cows im operator now and you know damn well i couldnt run this place without you maybe i do but it had been an opening and had gotten her full attention and maybe i been asking myself what the hell youre trying to prove to a dead man she opened her mouth closed it swallowed i dont know what youre talking about hell you dont anger hastened his words and brought him out of the chair you think i dont see i dont know you think somebody who tanned your hide when you needed it and bandaged your hurts dont know whats inside your head you listen to me girl cause youre too big and mean for me to turn over my knee like i used to you can beat yourself into the ground from here to the second coming and it dont mean a damn to jack mercy its my ranch now she said evenly or a third of it is he nodded pleased to hear the echo of resentment in her tone yeah and he slapped you with that too just like he slapped you all your life he didnt do what was right for you what was fitting now maybe i think more of those two girls than i did when they first came around but that aint the point he did what he did to you cause he could thats all and he brought in overseers from outside mercy even as her temper simmered to the surface she realized something shed overlooked it should have been you she said quietly im sorry ham it never even occurred to me it should have been you supervising the ranch through this year i should have thought of that before and realized how insulting it was insulting it was but insultsþsome insultsþhe could live with i aint asking you to think of it and i aint particularly insulted it was just like him yeah she sighed once it was just like him i dont have anything against ben and nate theyre good men fair and it would take a brainless moose not to see what jack was up to bringing ben around here around you but i aint talking about that he waved a hand at her as she scowled you got nothing to prove to jack mercy and its time somebody said so to your face he nodded briskly so i am i cant just push it away he was my father we pump sperm out of a bull and stick it in a cow that dont make that bull a father stunned she got to her feet i never heard you talk about him like this i thought you were friends i had respect for him as a cattleman never said i respected the man then why did you stay on all these years he looked at her shook his head slowly from side to side thats a damn fool question for me she thought and felt both foolish and humbled unable to face him she turned stared out the window you taught me to ride somebody had to his voice went rusty so he cleared it before you broke your fool neck climbing on when nobody was looking when i fell and broke my arm when i was eight you and bess took me to the hospital the woman was too flustered to be driving you herself likely have wrecked the rig uneasy he shifted in his chair drummed his stubby fingers if his wife had lived past their first two years of marriage he might have had kids of his own hed stopped thinking of that and the lack because thered been willa to tend to and i aint talking about all that im talking now you gotta back off a little will theres so much going on ham i keep seeing that girl and pickles if i let my mind go clear i see them nothing you can do to change what happened is there and nothing you did to make it happen this bastard hes doing what hes doing cause he can it was too close to what hed said about her fatherþit made her shudder i dont want another death on my hands ham i dont think i could stand it goddamn it why dont you listen the furious shout made her turn stare at him its not on your hands and youre a bigheaded fool if you think so what happened happened and thats that this ranch don t need you to be fussing over every acre of it twenty hours a day either its about time you tried being a female for a while her mouth fell open shouting wasnt his way unless he was riled past patience and never could she recall him referring to her gender just what does that mean whens the last time you put on a dress and went out to kick up your heels he demanded even though it made him flush to say it im not counting new years and whatever that thing was you were almost wearing that had the boys spilling drool out their mouths she laughed at that and intrigued slid a hip onto the corner of the desk is that so if id been your pa id have sent you back upstairs for a proper dress with your ears ringing too embarrassed by his outburst he crushed his hat onto his head but thats done too now im saying why dont you get that mckinnon boy to take you out to a sitdown dinner or a picture show or some such thing instead of you spending every waking hour in a pair of muddy boots thats what im saying and youve certainly had a lot to say this afternoon which meant she reflected that hed been storing it up just what makes you think id be interested in a sitdown dinner with ben mckinnon a blind man could seen the way you two were plastered together pretending to be dancing he decided not to mention the fact that at the poker game at three rocks the week before ben had pumped him dry for information on her conversation over fivecard stud was as sacrosanct as that in a confessional thats all i have to say about it sure she asked sweetly no observations on my diet my hygiene my social skills oh shes a sassy one he thought and bit back a smile you aint eating enough to fill a rabbit but you clean up good enough far as i can see you aint got any social skills he was pleased to have worked a fresh scowl out of her i got work to do he started out then paused i hear stu mckinnon is feeling poorly mr mckinnons ill whats wrong with him just a flu bug but he aint feeling up to snuff bess made a sweet potato pie be nice if you took it over hes got a partiality for sweet potato pie and for you be neighborly and i could work on my lack of social skills she glanced at the desk the papers the work then looked back at the man whod taught her everything worth knowing all right ham ill run over and see him youre a good girl will he said and sauntered out he d given her plenty to think about on the drive over two new men another two hundred head of cattle her own stubborn need to prove herself worthy to a man who had never cared and perhaps her lack of sensitivity to a man who had always cared and had always been there for her had she been infringing on hams territory the last few months probably that at least she could fix but his words on the murder however steady and sensible couldnt wipe out her sense of responsibility or her fear she shivered bumped up the heater in the rig the road was well plowed easily navigated snow was heaped on the sides so that it was like driving through a white tunnel with white peaks spearing up into a hard blue sky thered been an avalanche to the northwest that had buried three skiers and some hunters camped in the high country had gotten caught in a blizzard and had to be brought out by copter and treated for frostbite a neighboring ranch had lost some of its range cattle to wildcat looking for food and two hikers climbing in the bitterroots had been lost and somewhere despite the brutal nature of winter was a killer the big sky ski area was doing record business more fortunate hunters claimed game was so plentiful this year that they hardly needed a weapon foals were already being dropped and cattle were growing fat in feedlots and basin pastures regardless of life and prosperity death was lurking much too close lily was flushed with love and planning a spring wedding tess had nudged nate into a weekend away at one of the tony resorts and ham wanted her to put on her dancing shoes she was terrified and hit the brakes hard to avoid running into an eightpoint buck she swerved skidded ended up sideways across the road as the buck simply lifted his head and watched the show with bored eyes oh youre a beauty arent you laughing at herself she rested her head on the steering wheel while her heart made its way slowly out of her throat and back to her chest it took a fast leap back up when someone tapped on her window she didnt recognize the face it was a good one angelically handsome framed with curly goldenbrown hair under a dungbrown hat as his lips accented with a glossy mustache tipped up in smile she slid a hand under her seat toward the ruger you okay he asked when she rolled down the window an inch i was behind you saw you skid did you hit your head or anything no im fine just startled me i should have been paying more attention big bastard isnt he jesse turned his head to watch as the buck walked regally to the side of the road then leaped over the mound of snow wish i had my thirtythirty a rack like thatd go fine on the bunkhouse wall he looked back at her amused to see fear and suspicion in her eyes sure youre okay miz mercy yes she slid her fingers closer to the gun do i know you dont think so ive seen you around here and there im jc been working at three rocks the past few months she relaxed a little but kept the window up oh the poker ace he flashed a grin and it was as formidable a weapon as the ruger got me a rep do i gotta say its a pure pleasure taking your money indirectly that is through your boys youre a little pale yet he wondered what her skin would feel like she was part indian he remembered and had the look of it hed never had a halfbreed before and wouldnt that just fix lilys butt if he went and fucked her sister you ought to take a minute to get your breath back if you hadnt had good reflexes id be digging you out of the drifts now im fine really he had gorgeous eyes she mused cold but beautiful they shouldnt have made her insides curl up in defense im on my way to three rocks as it happens she continued determined to work on those social skills im told mr mckinnons under the weather flu put him down hard the last couple days but hes feeling some better youve had your own problems over to mercy yes she drew back instinctively youd better get back in your rig its too cold to be standing out there winds got a bite all right like a healthy woman he winked stepped back ill follow you in you be sure to tell old jim im up for a game anytime ill do that thanks for stopping my pleasure chuckling to himself he tipped his hat maam he chuckled out loud when he climbed back into his rig so that was lilys halfbreed half sister hed bet she would give a man a hard ride he might have to find out he hummed all the way into three rocks and when willa took the turn toward the main house tooted his horn cheerfully and waved her on shelly opened the door with the baby on her shoulder will what a surprise pie her eyes went huge and just a little greedy come in grab a fork its for your fatherinlaw willa held it out of reach hows he feeling better driving sarah crazy thats why im here instead of home trying to give her a hand take off your coat come on back to the kitchen she patted the gurgling baby on the back truth is will im spooked staying home alone i know its stupid but i keep thinking someones watching me watching the house looking through the windows ive had zack up three times this week to check locks we never locked up before i know its the same at mercy you havent heard any more from the police no nothing helpful we wont talk about it now shelly lowered her voice as they approached the kitchen no use getting sarah upset look who i found she announced as she swung through the door willa sarah put down the potatoes she was peeling for stew wiped her hands how wonderful to see you sit down theres coffee on pie though she was never quite sure how to respond to the spontaneous affection willa smiled when sarah kissed her cheek for the invalid besss sweet potato maybe thatll keep him busy and out of my hair you tell bess how much i appreciate it you sit down now have some cake with that coffee and talk to us shelly and i have about talked each other out i swear winter gets longer and meaner every year beau radleys selling out and moving to arizona no sarah pounced on the nibble of gossip like a starving mouse on cheese i hadnt heard that sold to developers theyre going to put in a resort dude ranch buffalo oh my sarah whistled through her teeth as she poured coffee into her company cups wont stu have six fits when he hears hears what silver hair flowing bathrobe comfortably ratty stu strolled in we got company and nobody calls me he winked at willa gave her a quick pat on the head and pie we got pie and you leave me up there moldering in bed you wont stay in it long enough to molder well sit then well have pie instead of cake with coffee he pulled up a chair eyed his daughterinlaw going to let me hold my baby yet nope shelly swiveled abby around not until youre germfree look but dont touch im being run into the ground by women he told willa sneeze a couple of times and you find yourself strapped in bed having pills forced down your throat he was running a fever oneohone clucking sarah slid pie under his nose eat that and stop complaining babies are less trouble when theyre ailing than any grown man i know i cant count the number of times ive been up and down those stairs in the past three days even as she said it she was cupping his chin studying his face colors better she murmured letting her hand linger you can have your pie and a visit but then you go back and take a nap see stu gestured with his fork she cant wait until im feeling off to start bossing me around he brightened considerably when the door opened and zack came in now well even the odds a bit come on in boy but dont think youre getting any of my pie what kind hey will zack mckinnon was a slimly built man who stopped just shy of lanky hed inherited his mothers wavy hair and his fathers squaredoff jaw his eyes were green like bens but dreamier he was a man who liked to spend his days in the clouds the minute he was out of coat and hat he kissed his wife and picked up his daughter did you wipe your feet his mother demanded yesm is that sweet potato its mine stu said darkly then nudged the pie closer possessively as the door opened again the piebald mares looking ready toþ ben spotted willa and his smile came slow hey will she brought pie zack said eyeing it avariciously dad wont share what kind ben dropped into a chair beside willa and began to play with her hair your fathers kind she said and brushed his hand away thata girl stu scooped up another forkful then looked crushed when his wife sliced two more pieces i thought i was sick youll be sick if you eat all this yourself give shelly the baby zack and pour the coffee ben stop fussing with will and let the girl eat nag nag nag stu muttered then beamed when willa winked and slid her piece of pie from her plate to his stuart mckinnon shame on you sarah put her hands on her hips as her husband dug in to the second piece she gave it to me didnt she how are those pretty sisters of yours will l j theyre fine ah neither lily nor adam had asked that it be kept secret in any case willa imagined tongues were already starting to wag adam and lily are engaged theyre going to be married in june a wedding shelly bounced as happily as the baby oh thats wonderful adams getting married sarah let out a sigh as her eyes went sentimentally moist why i can remember when he and ben used to tramp off to the stream with fishing poles she sniffed dabbed her eyes well help you with the shower willa shower the bridal shower shelly said gearing up i cant wait theyll live in that adorable little house of his wont they i wonder what kind of dress shes looking for ill have to tell her about this wonderful shop in billings where i found mine and they have gorgeous bridesmaidsdresses too i hope she wants vivid colors for you willa set her cup down before she choked for me im sure you and tess will be her attendants both of you want strong colors rich blue dark pink pink at the desperate look in her eyes ben howled youre scaring her bloodless shelly dont worry will ill look after you im going to be best man he toasted her with his coffee i just talked to adam this morning you beat me to the announcement with his plate scraped clean zack came up for air better let me talk to him ive still got the scars from our wedding as shellys eyes narrowed he grinned remember those monkey suits we had to wear ben thought id strangle before i could say i do he bent to his coffee when shelly smacked the back of his head of course i had a lump in my throat when i looked down the aisle and saw this vision coming toward me the most beautiful sight any man sees in his life good save son stu commented i dont mind weddings myself though your mom and i did it the easy way and eloped that was only because my father wanted to shoot you you tell lily to let us know if theres anything we can do to help will just thinking about a wedding makes spring seem closer i will i know shell appreciate it i have to get back oh dont go yet shelly reached out to grab her hand youve hardly been here at all i can have zack go down to the house and get my stack of brides magazines and the photo album it might give lily some ideas im sure shed like to come over herself and huddle with you now the idea of a wedding was making her shoulder blades itch id stay if i could but the lights already going shes right sarah murmured shooting an uneasy glance out the window its no time for a woman to be out on the road alone at night benþ ill ride over with her ignoring willas protests he rose and fetched his hat and coat one of your men can drive me back or ill borrow a rig id rest easier sarah put in before willa could refuse again its a shameful thing whats happened here wed all rest easier knowing bens with you all right then once the goodbyes were said with the rest of the mckinnons walking them to the door will climbed behind the wheel of the rig youre a lucky man mckinnon why is that she shook her head and stayed silent until theyd left the ranch house behind you cant know you cant possibly understand how lucky you are because it just is for you its just the way it is and always has been baffled he shifted in his seat to study her profile what are you talking about family your family i sat there in that kitchen ive sat there before but i dont know if it all sank in it did today the ease and affection the history the bond you wouldnt know what its like not to have any of that its just yours it was true enough and he didnt know if hed ever thought it through youve got sisters now willa theres a bond there and its easy to see maybe theres the beginnings of something but theres no history no memories ive seen you start a story and zack finish it ive heard your mother laugh over something stupid the two of you did as boys i never heard my mother laugh im not being maudlin she said quickly it just hit me sitting there today watching you and your family thats the way its supposed to be isnt it yeah id say it is he stole that from us im just beginning to realize how much he stole from all three of us not just me im going to make a detour when they came to the boundary of mercy land she shifted into fourwheel drive and swung onto a winterrutted access road he didnt ask where she was heading hed already figured it out snow was mounded over the graves burying the headstones smothering the wild grass and tender flowers she thought it looked like a postcard so perfect so undisturbed with only jack mercys stone higher brighter than all the rest thrusting up out of the snow toward the darkening sky do you want me to go with you no id rather you didnt if you could just wait here i wont be long take your time he murmured as she climbed out she sank kneedeep in snow trudged her way through it it was cold bitterly with the wind slapping the air sending snow swirling from its bed she saw deer a small herd of doe on the rise of a hill like sentinels for the dead there was no sound but the wind and the wind was like the first stars groaning as she made her way to her fathers grave the headstone was carved as hed ordered carved as hed lived his life without a thought to anyone but himself what did it matter she wondered for he was as dead as her mother who was said to have lived kind and gentle she had come from that willa thought from the kind and the cruel what it made her she couldnt say selfish on some levels generous on others she hoped proud and filled with selfdoubt impatient but not without compassion neither kind she decided nor cruel and that wasnt so bad all in all what she did understand standing there in the rough wind in the rougher silence was that she had loved them both the mother she had never known and the father she had never touched i wanted you to be proud of me she said aloud even if you couldnt love me to be satisfied with me but it never happened ham was right today you slapped me all my life not just the physical slapsþthere wasnt much punch behind those because you didnt really give a damn emotionally you hit me emotionally more times than i can count and i just came back my head lowered like a kicked dog so you could do it again i guess im here to tell you im done with that or im going to try to be she was going to try very hard you thought youd pit the three of us against each other i see that now doesnt look like were going to oblige you were keeping the ranch you selfish son of a bitch and i think we may just keep each other too were going to make it work to spite you we may not be much of a family now but were not done yet she walked away the way shed come he hadnt taken his eyes off her and was grateful for the lack of tears still he hadnt expected the smile even the grim one that firmed her lips as she got back into the rig you okay im fine she drew a deep breath pleased that it didnt hitch im just fine beau radleys selling off she said as she maneuvered the rig around im buying some of his equipment a couple hundred head from the feedlot and taking on two of his men the lack of segue left him a little muddled but he nodded slowly okay i didnt tell you that for your approval but so you can note it in your supervisory capacity she swung onto another access road to shortcut it to the ranch quick gusts of wind that would drag the temperature down to unbearable rattled gleefully at the windows ill have the monthly report up to date by tomorrow so you can go over it he scratched his ear wary of the trap thats fine thats business her smile relaxed a bit as she saw the lights of the ranch house peek through the distance on a personal level why havent you ever asked me out for a sitdown dinner or a picture show instead of just trying to get my pants down his mouth fell open so far he nearly had to use his hand to shove his jaw up again excuse me you come sniffing around get your hands on me when i let you ask me to bed often enough but you never once asked me out on a date you want me to take you to dinner hed never thought of it he would have with another woman but this was willa to a movie are you ashamed to be seen in public with me she stopped the rig again left the engine running as she swiveled in the seat to face him his face was in shadows now but it was still light enough for her to read the stunned look in his eyes im all right to go rolling around in the horse barn with but not good enough for you to put on a clean shirt and invest fifty bucks in a meal whered you get a damn fool idea like that in the first place i havent rolled around in the horse barn with you because youre not ready and in the second place i never figured you were interested in sitting down in a restaurant and eating with me like a date he finished lamely maybe feminine power was fiercer than shed imagined willa mused if wielding just a hint of it caused a man like ben mckinnon to flop like a trout on the hook well maybe youre wrong it was a trick he thought as she drove on there was a trap here somewhere and it would snap its teeth on his ankle as soon as he took a wrong step he watched her narrowly ready for signs as she pulled up in front of the main house turned off the engine go on and drive this back she said easily i can send someone over to get it tomorrow thanks for the company damn it he could almost hear the snap of the spring as he stepped a toe into the trap saturday night six oclock dinner and a movie her stomach muscles quivered with laughter but she nodded soberly fine see you then and stepped out shut the door in his face wnter clung like a bur to the back of montana temperatures remained brutal and when they rose to tolerable v v snow tumbled from the sky in frosty sheets twice access roads at mercy were blocked by tenfoot drifts piled into glossy white mountains by the unforgiving wind cows went into labor despite the weather in the pole barn willa sweated through her shirt with the musclestraining effort of pulling calves an expectant mother mooed bitterly as willa reached into the birth canal grabbed hold still in the birth sac the calf was slippery and stubborn willa dug in hissing as the next contraction vised painfully on her hands her arms would carry bruises to the elbow before it was done she waited it out timed her pull and dragged the first half of the cow out coming on the next she called out as blood and amniotic fluid soaked her arms lets go baby lets go like a diver going under she took a quick breath to fill her lungs with air then dragged hard with the next contraction the calf popped out like an oiled cork her boots were slimy her thick cord pants stained her back was screaming billy stand by with the injections she ordered keep an eye on them if things went well mother would clean baby up if not that task would also fall to billy in any case she had trained him carefully over the past few weeks with a hypo and an orange until she was confident that he could inject the newborns with the necessary medication im going on to the next one she told him as she wiped an arm over her sweaty forehead ham coming along he watched eagleeyed as jim pulled another calf it was always a worry that even with human assistance a calf would prove too large or be turned wrong and make the birthing process lethal for both baby and mother willa still remembered the first time shed lost this battle the blood and the pain and the helplessness the vet could be called if they knew in time but for the most part the calfpulling season of february and march was the province of the cattleman steroids and growth hormones she thought as she examined the next laboring cow the price per pound had seduced ranchers into producing bigger calves turning what should have been a natural process into an unnatural one that required human hands and muscle well she would be cutting back on that she thought as she sucked in a breath and plunged her cramping hands into the cow and they would see if her attempt to return to more natural ranching proved a failure in the long run she would have only herself to blame ladies and gentlemen coffee is served tesss entrance was spoiled when she went white and gagged the air in the pole barn was thick with the mingling smells of sweat and blood and soiled straw visions of a slaughterhouse danced in her head as she turned straight around and gulped in the icy air jesus jesus jesus no good deed goes unpunished she thought and waited for the dizziness to pass bess had known certainly bess had known exactly what she would walk in on when shed casually asked tess to take the thermoses of coffee out to the pole barn with a shudder tess made herself turn back around that little deed would require punishment as well she decided later coffee she repeated staring fascinated despite herself as willa wrenched a calf partially out of a cows vagina how can you do that upperbody strength will said easily go ahead and pour some she spared her sister an arch look my hands are full yeah tess wrinkled her nose as the calf squirted out it wasnt a pretty sight she mused at one time she would have said that no birth could be but the horses shed been charmed and humbled by the sight of a foaling mare but this was nasty she thought and messy and almost assemblyline cold pull em out clean em up maybe it was because they were destined to be steaks on a platter she considered then she shook her head and handed a cup of coffee to billy or maybe she just didnt like cows they were in her opinion too big too homely and too desperately uninteresting wouldnt mind a cup of that jim said and his eyes twinkled at her we could switch places a minute its not as hard as it looks ill pass thanks and she smiled back at him giving him a steaming cup so he could take a breather it no longer insulted her to be considered an ignorant greenhorn in fact at the moment tess thought it was a distinct advantage how come they cant just push the calves out themselves she asked him too big grateful he gulped down the coffee even the burning of his tongue was welcome well horses have pretty big foals and when were in the foaling stall we mostly just stand by and watch too big he reiterated with the growth hormones we give them cows cant throw off calves by themselves so we pull em but what if it happens when nobodys around to pull bad luck he handed back an empty cup she didnt want to think about what was smeared on the outside bad luck she repeated because that didnt bear thinking about either she left the thermoses and cups and went outside again your sisters all right will willa shot a half smile at jim and took a moment to pour herself coffee shes not all bad wanted to puke when she walked in he pointed out i figured shed haul ass back to the house but she didnt maybe she could help out in here billy grinned i cant see her sticking her hands in a cows hole but she might could use a needle willa rolled her shoulders i think well leave her to play with the chickens for now anyway and now was what mattered she decided as she watched a newborn calf begin to nurse for the first time and she was up to her elbows inside a cow tess shuddered over her brandy evening had come in cold and clear there was a fire roaring in the grate and nate had come to dinner the combination made her brave enough to recount the experience inside dragging out another cow i thought it was fascinating lily enjoyed her tea and the warmth of adams hand over hers id have stayed longer but i was in the way you could have stayed willa had a combo of coffee laced with brandy wed have put you to work really though tess moaned at lilys simple enthusiasm lily just smiled id love to help tomorrow you havent got enough brawn to pull but you could medicate now you willa continued giving tess a long considering look youre a big strapping woman bet you could pull a calf without losing your breath just her lunch nate put in and earned chuckles from everyone but tess i could handle it gracefully she skimmed back her hair making the rings glitter on her pretty manicured fingers if i wanted to handle it twenty says youd chicken before you were in to the wrists damn it tess realized cornered make it fifty and youre on done tomorrow and mercy ranch adds another ten for every calf you pull ten tess sniffed big deal pull enough and youd be able to pay for your next fancy haircut in billings tess flipped her hair again she was about due for another trim all right then i say youre going to be springing for a facial as well she raised an eyebrow you could use one of those yourself and a paraffin wax on those hands unless of course you like skin that resembles leather i dont have time to waste in some silly salon tess swirled her brandy chicken she hurried on before willa could hiss out a response i say ill pull as many as you and if so mercy ranch treats all three of usþyou me and lilyþto the works a weekend at a spa in big sky youd like that wouldnt you lily torn between loyalties lily fumbled well iþ and we could do some shopping for the wedding check out a couple shops shelly talked about oh the thrill of that had her looking dreamily at adam that would be lovely bitch willa murmured at tess without rancor youre on but if you lose youre back on laundry detail oops nate took the cowards way out and studied his brandy when tess snarled at him meanwhile ive got to finish recording the birth information from today willa rose stretched then froze had that been a shadow at the window or a face slowly she lowered her arms struggled to keep her features composed i wouldnt stay up too late she said to tess as she started out of the room youre going to need your strength tomorrow im really going to love hearing you scream during your bikini wax tess called out and had the satisfaction of seeing willas head jerk around and her face register sheer horror i love having the last word she murmured excuse me a minute adam rose and followed willa he found her in the library loading a rifle what is it so much for the poker face she thought snapping the chamber closed i thought i saw something outside so youre going out alone as he spoke he chose a shotgun loaded it no use spooking everyone it might have been my imagination you dont have a welldeveloped imagination she shook her head at that and decided it was hard to be insulted by the truth well it wont hurt to do a quick walk around well go out the back they bundled into their outdoor gear in the mudroom though it was willas instinct to go out first adam beat her to it gently easing her aside someone watched them it was cold and bitter but jesse stood in the shadows watching while his hand flexed eagerly on the weapon he carried he dreamed of using it on the man taking out the man leaving him bleeding and just taking the woman dragging her away using her until he was done with her then killing her of course what other choice would he have he wondered if he dared risk it here now they were armed and hed seen how many people were in the house hed seen exactly hed seen lily laughing cozying up to that halfbreed maybe it was best to waitþwait and watch for the right moment it could come anytime it could come if they walked over to the pole barn he knew what they would find there hed already been there around by the front windows if she couldn t lead the way at least she could move side by side it was just a flash after i stood up to go i thought it might have been a face someone looking in at us but it was too dark to be sure and it was gone fast adam only nodded he knew willa too well to believe she would jump at shadows there were prints in the snow alongside the walkway but that was to be expected with all the activity in the pole barn over the last couple of days the snow on the lawn would hardly be undisturbed there had been melt and refreezing so the surface was brittle and gave way with a crackle under their boots might have been one of the men willa said while she studied the ground but its unlikely they would just have knocked dont see why theyd have gone through the flower beds to peek in the window either adam gestured toward tracks close to the house between evergreen shrubs where flowers would bloom late in the spring so i did see something i never doubted it from where he stood adam could see clearly through the window into the lights of the front room he watched lily laugh sip her tea then rise to offer nate more brandy someone was watching us or one of us willa shifted her gaze away from the lights in the window toward the dark one of us lilys exhusband jesse cooke hes not in virginia instinctively willa looked back to the window shifted her grip on her rifle how do you know nate did some checking for me he hasnt shown up at his job or paid his rent since october you think hes come after her how would he know where to look i dont know he moved back away from the house just speculating thats why i dont see any point in bringing it up to her i wont say anything to her but i think we should tell tess that way one of us can keep our eye out for him and for lily do we know what he looks like no but ill see what i can find out all right meanwhile wed better look around ill go this way andþ well stick together will he laid a hand on her arm two people are dead maybe this was just a pissedoff exhusband wanting to get back at his wife or maybe it was something else we stick together in silence they moved through the wind circling the house overhead the sky was clear as glass with diamondchip stars wheeling and a threequarter moon casting pale blue light on the snow at their feet cottonwood trees loomed and seemed to shiver under their coating of ice in the frigid quiet willa heard the call of cattle a mournful sound she thought while her breath fumed out in front of her and was whisked away by the wind oddþsuch a sound had always seemed comforting to her before now it was eerie theyre awfully stirred up for this late at night she looked in the direction of the pole barn the corral beyond maybe weve got some cows in labor id better check adam thought uncomfortably of his horses unattended in the stables it wasnt easy to turn his back on them and go with willa to the cattle hear that she stopped ears straining hear that she repeated in a whisper no but he turned so they were guarding each others backs i dont hear anything i dont hear it now either it sounded like someone whistling sweet betsy from pike she shook it off tried to laugh at herself just the wind and the creeps hell it has to be twenty below with the windchill anybody out here whistling tunes would have to be crazy adam finished and fought to see through the shadows yeah willa shivered inside her sheepskin lets go shed intended to go straight into the pole barn but the thick huddle of cattle at the far end of the corral drew her attention thats not right she said half to herself somethings off here she walked to the gate shoved it open at first she didnt believe it thought her eyes were dazzled by moonlight on snow but the smellþshe recognized the smell of death too well by now oh god adam with her free hand she covered her mouth fought back the gorge that rose like a fountain in her throat oh sweet god calves had been slaughtered it was impossible at first to tell how many but she knew shed brought some of them into the world herself only hours before now instead of huddling against their mamas for warmth they lay tossed into the snow throats and bellies slit blood glittered on the ground rich and red in a hideous pool already crusting in the cold it was weak but she turned away from the carnage lowered her rifle and leaned on the fence until her insides settled into place why why in gods name would anyone do something like this i dont know he rubbed her back but he didnt turn away he counted eight infant calves mutilated lets get you back to the house ill deal with this no i can deal with it i can she wiped a gloved hand over her mouth the grounds too hard to bury them well have to burn them well have to get them out of here away from the other calves and the females and burn them nate and i can do that he struggled not to sigh at her set expression all right well all do it but i want to get you back inside for a few minutes will i have to check on the horses ifþ jesus her own misery faded in fear for him and his i didnt even think lets go hurry she didnt head back to the house but half ran toward the horse barn the fear raced giddily in her head that she would fling open the door and be met again with that hideous smell of death they hit the door together wrenched it open she was already prepared to grieve prepared to rage but all that met her was the scents of hay and horse and leather nonetheless by tacit agreement they checked every stall then the corral beyond they left lights burning behind them adam moved to his house next to look in on his dogs hed started locking them in at night right after the incident with the barn cat they greeted him happily tails thumping he suspected with a mixture of amusement and worry that they would have greeted an armed madman with the same friendly enthusiasm we can call the main house from here ask nate to meet us at the pole barn you want ham too willa bent down to scratch an eager beans between the ears everyone i want everyone out there i want them to see what were up against her eyes hardened and i want to know what everyones been doing for the last couple hours the task wasn t physically arduous but it was painful dragging butchered newborns into a pile on the snowcovered ground there were plenty of hands to help and there was no conversation once willa caught billy surreptitiously wiping a hand over his eyes she didnt hold the tears against him she would have wept herself if it would have done any good when it was done she took the can of gasoline from ham ill do it she said grimly its for me to do this willþ he cut off his own protest then nodded before gesturing the men to move back how can she stand it lily murmured shivering with tess beyond the corral fence how can she stand it because she has to tess shuddered as willa sloshed gas on the small heap we all have to she added draping an arm over lilys shoulders do you want to go inside more than anything in the world lily thought but she shook her head fiercely no well stay till its finished until shes finished willa adjusted the bandanna shed tied over her nose and mouth and took the box of matches from ham it took her three attempts to get a flame to hold in her cupped hand and with the teeth of the wind snapping against her she had to crouch low and close to start the fire it burned high and fast spewing heat in only seconds the odor of roasting meat was thick and sickening smoke whipped out toward her making her eyes water and her throat clog she stepped back one step then two before she could hold her ground ill call ben nate shifted to her side she kept her eyes on the flames for what hell want to know youre not alone in this willa but she felt alone and helpless all right i appreciate your help nate ill be staying the night she nodded no sense in me asking bess to make up a guest room is there no ill do a shift on guard and use tesss room take whatever gun you want turning she moved to ham i want a twentyfourhour watch ham two men at a time nates staying so that makes six of us tonight i want wood to stay home with his family they shouldnt be alone billy and ill take the first you and jim relieve us at midnight nate and adam will take over at four ill see to it yomorrow i want you to find out how soon we can sign on the two hands from high springs i need men offer them a cash bonus if you have to but get them here ill see theyre on within the week in a rare show of public affection he squeezed her arm im gonna tell bess to make coffee plenty of it and you be careful will you be careful no ones killing any more of mine her face set willa turned studied the women huddled together at the corral fence you get them inside for me will you ham tell them to stay inside ill do that and tell billy to get a rifle she shifted again and watched the flames shoot into the black winter sky a little madness in the spring þemily dickinson ben looked over the operation at mercy the steady activity in the pole barn so like the activity hed left back at three rocks the piled and tattered snow in the corrals the gray puffs of smoke from chimneys except for the blackened circle well beyond the paddock there were no signs of the recent slaughter unless you looked closely at the men faces were grim eyes were spooked hed seen the same looks in the faces and in the eyes of his own hands and like willa he had ordered a twentyfourhour guard there was little he could do to help her and the frustration of that made his own mouth tight as he gestured her away from the group dont have much time for chatting her voice was brisk he didnt see fear in her eyes but fatigue gone was the woman who had flirted him into a date who had laughed with him over a white tablecloth and wine shared popcorn at the movies he wanted to take her away again just for an evening but knew better you hired on the two men from high springs they came on last night turning she studied matt bodine the younger of the two new hands already dubbed college boy his carrotcolored hair was covered by a light gray stetson he had a baby face which hed tried to age with a straight line of red hair over his top lip it didnt quite do the job willa thought though they were nearly the same age matt seemed outrageously young to her more like billy than herself but he was smart had a strong back and a well of fresh ideas then there was ned tucker a lanky taciturn cowboy of indeterminate age his face was scored with lines from time and sun and wind his eyes were an eerily colorless blue he chewed on the stubs of cigars said little and worked like a mule theyll do she said after a moment i know tucker well enough ben began then wondered if he knew anyone well enough got a hell of a hand with a lasso wins at the festival every year bodine hes new he shifted so that his eyes as well as the tone of his voice indicated his thought too new i need the help if its one of them whos been fucking with me i d just as soon have him close by easier to watch she let out a little breath they should have been talking about the weather the calf pulling not about murder we lost eight calves ben im not losing any more willa he laid a hand on her arm before she could walk away i dont know what i can do to help you nothing sorry for the snap in her voice she slipped her hands into her pockets and softened her tone theres nothing anyone can do weve got to get through it thats all and things have been quiet the last couple days maybe hes finished maybe hes moved on she didnt believe it but it helped to pretend she did howre your sisters handling it better than i could have expected the tightness around her mouth eased as she smiled tess was out here pulling calves after the first couple and a lot of squealing she did okay id have paid money to see that for an instant the smile spread into a grin it was worth the price of a ticket especially when her jeans split no shit you didnt take pictures did you wish id thought of it she cussed a lot and the menþwell i got to say they appreciated the moment we got her a pair of woods cords willa glanced over as tess approached in the cords a borrowed hat and one of adams castoff coats they fit her a sight better than that sprayedon denim she was wearing depends on your viewpoint ben said morning rancher mckinnon morning rancher mercy tess grinned at him adjusted her hat to a rakish angle lilys brewing up a few gallons of coffee she told willa then shell be out to help stick needles into cow butts you gonna pull some more calves tess eyed ben then willa from the expressions on their faces she could see that her reputation had preceded her i figured i could give it another day seeing as im going to be spending the weekend at the spa in big sky willas grin fell off her face what the hell are you talking about our little bet gotcha tess thought and smiled sweetly i pulled two more calves than you the other day ham was doing the counting for me what bet ben wanted to know and was ignored as willa stepped into tesss face thats bull no it was calves of course some of them might have been bulls but youll fix that in a few monthsþand thats something i wont lend a hand with mercy ranch owes us a weekend at the resort ive already made the reservations we leave first thing friday morning the hell with that im not leaving the ranch for two days to go sit in some stupid mud bath welsher willas eyes slitted dangerously causing ben to clear his throat and move subtly he hoped out of range it has nothing to do with welshing after the trouble around here i was hardly thinking about some lame bet i had calls to make the cops came out i didnt pull calves for more than a couple hours all day i did and i won tess shifted forward until the toes of their boots bumped and were going you try to back out ill make sure everyone within a hundred miles knows your word isnt worth diddly my words solid and anybody who says different is a liar ah ladies willas head whipped around and her eyes seared ben where he stood back off mckinnon backing off he murmured spreading his hands as he did so backing way off you want to go when were hipdeep in this mess willa continued and poked tess hard in the shoulder you go ive got a ranch to run youre going tess poked her right back because that was the deal because you lost the bet and because lilys counting on it and because its time you started thinking of the people around here with as much respect as you give the goddamn cows i busted my ass to fix this ive been stuck on this godforsaken ranch for nearly six months because some selfish son of a bitch wanted to play games beyond the grave and in another six months youll be gone why thatþsimply thatþ should infuriate her willa couldnt have said damn straight tess tossed back the minute my sentence is up im gone but meanwhile ive been playing the game sticking to the rules youre by christ going to stick to them too were going if i have to beat you senseless tie you up and toss you in the nearest jeep rig willa angled her chin up as if inviting a fist its a rig hollywood and you couldnt whip a blind threelegged dog fuck your rigs fed up tess gave her a hard shove and fuck you that snapped it the temper was there and fullblown before willa could suck it in her fist was there in full swing before she could pull it it snapped tesss head back left an ugly red mark on the side of her jaw and sent her butt first onto the slushy ground even as ben swore and stepped forward willa was apologizing im sorry i shouldnt have done that iþ then her breath pushed out of her lungs in a whoosh as tess bulleted up and rammed her full body they tumbled to the ground in a flurry of arms and legs and shrieks it took ben about five seconds to decide to keep his own skin whole and stay out of it they wrestled into the piled snow back onto the wet ground grunting and punching he expected hair pulling and he wasnt disappointed tipping his hat back on his head he held up a hand as men came out of the pole barn to see what the excitement was about well goddamn my ass ham said wearily what finally set them off something about a bet a mud bath and a rig ham took out his tobacco while the men formed an informal circle wills outweighed but shes mean he winced when a fist connected with an eye taught her better than that he said with a shake of his head will should seen that coming think theyll start scratching billy wondered jeer i think theyd both turn on anyone who got in the middle ben stuck his hands in his pockets that tess has mighty long nails i dont want them raking over my face i say will takes her jim nipped back as the two women rolled dangerously close to his boots ill put ten on her ben considered shook his head some things youre better off not betting on it was the fury that made tess forget all her selfdefense courses her two years of karate training made her just fight like a girl in a playground brawl the red haze over her eyes darkened every time willa landed a blow here there was no defensive padding no rules no instructor calling time she had her face pushed into wet muddy snow and spat it out of her mouth on an oath willa saw stars explode in glorious color as tess yanked her hair tears of pain and rage burned her eyes as she wriggled around and fought for leverage she heard something rip and had time to pray it was cloth and not her hair coming out at the roots it was only pride that prevented her from using her teeth she regretted the pride when she found herself flipped headlong into the snow tess had remembered her training and decided to combine it with inspirationþshe sat on her sister give it up tess shouted fighting to stay aboard as willa bucked im bigger than you get yourþfatþassþoff with one concentrated effort willa managed to shove tess backward she pushed herself away swiveled and struggled to sit up as the men stayed respectfully silent the two women panted gasped and stared at each other it was some satisfaction to willa as she wiped blood from her chin to see the sleek sophisticated tess covered with dirt her hair mashed and dripping into her eyes and her mouth swollen and bleeding now that she had time to breathe tess began to feel everything him every bone every muscle every cell she gritted her teeth her gaze on willas face i say its a draw however huge her relief willa nodded slowly then flicked a glance at the fascinated grinning men she saw money changing hands and swore under her breath am i paying you worthless cowboys to stand around scratching your butts no maam judging it to be safe jim stepped forward he started to offer a hand before he saw by the glint in willas eyes that it was premature i guess breaks over boys at the jerk of hams head the men wandered back into the pole barn the conversation and laughter came rolling out within seconds you finished now ham demanded shrinking a little at the tone willa scrubbed at the dirt on her knee and nodded thats fine then ham tossed down his cigarette ground it out with his heel next time you want to get into a catfight try to do it where you wont distract the men ben he added with a flip of a finger on the brim of his hat a wise man ben suppressed the grin as ham strode off ladies he said with what he hoped was appropriate sobriety can i help you up i can get up myself willa didnt quite swallow the groan as she struggled to her feet she was wet freezing filthy her shirt was torn and her left eye was throbbing like a bad tooth thinking of teeth she ran her tongue over them and was relieved to find tbem all in place ill take a hand like a princess at a ball tess held out her hand let ben pull her out of the heap of muddy snow she wanted to shudder at what she was going to see in the mirror but managed a cool smile thank you and she added aiming the smile at willa id say that the matter is now settled friday morning and pack a decent dress for dinner too furious to speak recognizing the danger in uttering a single word willa spun on her heel and stiked into the pole barn the laughter inside instantly cut off into silence shell go ben said it quietly took out a bandanna and gently dabbed at the blood at the corner of tesss mouth you got her on pride and honesty she can buck just about anything but those ouch she closed her eyes a moment then gingerly fingered the rising lump on her temple it cost me more than i bargained for thats the first real fight ive been in since ninth grade when annmarie bristol called me wide load i cleaned her clock then i went on a dietandexercise program it worked he bent down and picked up her crushed hat all around yeah tess set the hat on her dirty wet hair im in damn good shape never figured shed be so hard to take down shes lean but shes tough tell me about it tess murmured nursing her swollen lip she needs to get away from here more than i do more than lily does i think youre right about that i dont know when she sleeps shes up before anyone else in the morning spends half the night in the office or out here then she shrugged what the hell do i care i think you know maybe she looked back at him arched a brow i tell you what else she needs a good sweaty mindemptying bout of sex what the hell are you waiting for it wasnt something he cared to discuss but even as propriety urged him to shut up instinct tugged in a different direction he glanced back toward the barn took tesss arm and led her farther away willa you know shes never shes never he repeated and then shut his mouth never what the narrowed impatient look in his eyes tipped her off tess stopped dead shes never had sex good god she blew out a breath readjusted her thoughts well that puts a different light on the matter doesnt it despite her throbbing lip she pressed a light kiss to his cheek youre a patient considerate man ben mckinnon i think thats lovely and very sweet hell he shuffled his feet im thinking maybe she never had anybody to talk to about to explain things to her tess caught the drift instantly and shook her head oh no uhuh no way i just thought maybe you know being sistersþ oh yeah will and i are like this sarcasm dripping tess crossed two fingers just how do you think shed take to me giving her a crash course in sexual relations oneohone yeah youre right and youre a frustrated hungry man tess thought and patted his cheek just keep working on her big guy and maybe ill think of something im going to go soak in the jacuzzi for a day or two with a hand pressed to her sore ass tess limped off to the house oh my it was all lily could say almost all she d managed to say since theyd driven to the mountain king spa and resort shed never seen anything like it the main lodge spread for acres glass and wood and clever pebbled paths through snowdipped evergreens and heated pools where steam curled in dreamy mists shed clutched the strap of her purse tightly as they checked in her head swiveling in wonder around the plush lobby with its double fireplace atrium ceiling and lush plants her heart had begun to thunder as shed thought of the expense for surely any place so beautiful so quietly sumptuous would cost the earth even for an overnight stay but tess had greeted the desk clerk with a friendly smile called him by name and chatted easily about how much she and her companion had enjoyed their stay earlier in the season hed all but simpered over her calling up a bellman to take care of their luggage and guide them to their private cabin nestled on a ridge behind curtaining pines then the cabin itself had simply wiped her mind clean a huge wall of glass opened up the living area to the majesty of the mountains offered a tempting peek at the private hot tub built cleverly into the rocks there was a fire already set and burning in a stone hearth flowers fresh and dewy exploding out of pottery vases a deep curving seating area in buff accented by jeweltoned pillows in front of an entertainment center complete with bigscreen tv vcr and stereo a charming dining room set in dark wood was arranged conveniently near a sleek little kitchenette oh my she said but under her breath this time as the bellman led the way into a bedroom with its own glass doors leading to a stone terrace two double beds were made up neatly with thick pillows and quilts and the bath beyondþshe only managed a quick lookþhad a mile of ivory counter an oversized jet tub and a separate glassedin shower and surely that was a bidet a bidet imagine it she could barely think as tess instructed the bellman these bags in here thank you you can take hers tess sent willa a steely look in the other bedroom you dont mind sharing the room with me do you lily what no no of course not iþ good go ahead and get settled our first treatments in an hour treatment but whatþ dont worry tess said as she sailed out after the bellman i took care of it youll love it all lily could do was sink down on the side of the bed and wonder if shed wandered into someone elses dream what happened to your eye honey the technician therapist consultant whatever the hell she was called made a long sympathetic study of willas shiner willa didnt shrug it was tough shrugging when you were buck naked on a padded table in a small dim room wasnt watching where i was going ummm well well see what one of our skin consultants can do about it just relax she ordered and began to wrap willa in something warm and damp is this your first visit to mountain king spa yeah and her last she promised herself the claustrophobia came quickly unexpectedly as the wrappings snugged her arms close to her body she felt her heart pound her breathing shorten and she began to struggle no no just relax take slow quiet breaths a warm heavy blanket went over the wrappings a lot of clients have that initial reaction to an herbal wrap itll pass if you just clear your mind let yourself go now these cotton balls are soaked in our eyelax solution itll probably help a bit with that swelling as well as the puffiness you havent been sleeping enough swell now she was blind as well as trapped willa wondered if she would be the first client to tear herself free of herbsoaked restraints and run naked and screaming out of the ladiestreatment center since she didnt want the distinction she fought to relax let herself go it was no more than she deserved she supposed for keeping her mouth so stubbornly shut on the drive down music was playing she realized or it wasnt music really but the sounds of water falling into water and birds chirping she took one of those slow quiet breaths and reminded herself she only had just over fortyeight more hours to suffer in less than five minutes she was sound asleep she awoke groggily twenty minutes later with the consultant murmuring to her huh what where were getting all those toxins out of your system efficiently the consultant removed the layers of herbal wrap i want you to be sure to drink plenty of water nothing but water for the next few hours you have a gommage in ten minutes so relax ill help you with your robe and slippers still half asleep willa let herself be bundled into her robe and slid her feet into the plastic slippers the spa provided whats a gommage youll love it the consultant promised so she was naked again on yet another table with yet another woman in a pale pink lab coat fiddling with her at the first rough swipe with a damp loofah over bare skin slicked with a fine sandy cream willa yelped was i too rough im terribly sorry no it just caught me by surprise your skins going to be like silk willa shut her eyes mortified as the woman rubbed her bare butt what the hell is that stuff youre putting on me oh its our special exfoliator skinnu all our products are herbalbased and available in our salon you have fabulous skin the coloring but where did you get all these bruises pulling calves pulling oh you work on a ranch thats exciting isnt it is it a family operation willa gave up let the layers of skin be scraped away it is now t he next time willa saw tess she willa was flat on her back again naked again unless you counted the warm thick brown mud that was being slowly smoothed all over her tess poked a head in the door took one look and burst into deep bubbling laughter youre going to pay for this hollywood christ the woman was painting hot mud on her tits on her tits correction mercys already paying and youve never looked lovelier im sorry maam the new consultant said these are private rooms its okay were sisters tess leaned against the doorjamb looking right at home in her white terrycloth robe and plastic slippers ive got a facial in five just thought id see how you were holding up ive been lying down since i got here you really want to try the steam room if you have time between treatments what have you got on next ihave noidea i believe ms mercy is scheduled for a facial next as well the onehour bio treatment oh thats a honey tess remembered well enjoy lilys getting the fullbody facial in the next room shes whimpering in pleasure right now see you you came with your sisters the consultant said when tess closed the door so to speak the consultant smiled and painted mud on tesss face isnt that nice willa gave up and closed her eyes so to speak willa got back to the suite after six all but crawling as her legs were so limp and loose they didnt seem willing to hold weight she could have whimpered herself and hated to admit that it too would have been from pleasure her body felt so light so pampered so relaxed that her mind simply had no choice but to follow suit maybe the fifteenminute steam bath with a bunch of other naked women after her full hour massage had been a bit of overkill but shed lost her head there you are tess was just popping the cork on a bottle of champagne when willa walked in lily and i had just decided we wouldnt wait for you oh you look wonderful still wrapped in her robe lily got up from the sofa and clasped her hands together youre positively glowing i dont think i can move that guy that massage guy derrick i think he did something to me you had a man eyes wide lily hurried over to lead willa to the couch for a fullbody massage wasnt i supposed to my massage therapist was a woman i just assumed she trailed off as tess handed her a flute i ordered a female for you lily i thought youd be more comfortable she passed another flute to willa and i requested a male for willa because i thought she should start getting used to what it feels like to have a man get his hands on herþeven in perfectly professional surroundings if i wasnt afraid id melt if i tried to stand up again id punch you for that honey you should be thanking me with her own glass tess eased onto the arm of the sofa so was it great or what willa sipped the wine shed downed enough water to sink a battleship and the change to bubbles with a kick was glorious maybe she sipped again let her head fall back he looked like harrison ford and he rubbed my feet god and there was this place just above my shoulder blades she shuddered he used his thumbs he had incredible thumbs you know what they say about thumbs on a man smirking tess lifted her glass toasted when willa bothered to open one eye ive noticed that ben has very large thumbs isnt noticing nate enough for you sleeping with nates enough for me but im a writer writers notice details adam has wonderful thumbs the minute lily heard herself say it she choked and went beetred i mean he has good hands that is i mean theyre very she snickered at herself gave up long could i have some more you bet tess bounced up grabbed the bottle a couple more and maybe youll tell us all about adams wonderful long thumbs oh i couldnt ive got another bottle dont tease her about it willa said but there wasnt any sting in the words not everybody likes to brag about their bedroom activities id like to lily said and flushed again id like to brag and strut and tell everyone because its never been like this for me i never knew it could i never knew i could though she had no head for liquor she knocked back her second glass with abandon and adam is so beautiful i mean his face and his heart but his body oh my god she pressed a hand to her breast and held out her glass which tess obligingly filled its like something carved out of amber its perfect and i get all loose and fluttery inside just looking at him and hes so gentle when he touches me and then hes not and i dont care because i want him and he wants me and everything goes wild and i feel so strong as if i could make love with him for hours for days forever and sometimes i have three or four orgasms before were finished and with jesse i hardly ever had even one and thenþ she broke off blinked swallowed did i just say that tess took a slow labored breath a long drink are you sure you want to stop another few minutes and i might just come myself oh hurriedly lily set her glass down clasped her hands to her hot cheeks ive never said things like that to anyone i didnt mean to embarrass you you didnt willas own stomach was fluttering as she reached over to pat lilys arm i think its wonderful for you and for adam i couldnt say things like that to anyone before lilys voice broke and the tears swam i couldnt to anyone except the two of you now lily dontþ no lily cut off tesss concern with a shake of her head everythings changed for me it started changing when i first met both of you i started changing even with all the horrible things that have happened im so happy i found adam and both of you i love all of you so much i love you so much im sorry she said and sprang up to rush to the bathroom moved flummoxed willa sat where she was and listened to the sound of water rushing into the bathroom sink should one of us go in there no feeling mistyeyed herself tess filled willas glass again then dropped onto the couch beside her well give her a minute thoughtfully she selected a perfect granny smith apple from the complimentary basket on the table shes right you know as bad as things are theres a lot of good stuff trying to balance the scales i guess willa looked down into her glass then lifted her gaze to tesss i guess im glad i got to know you i dont have to like you she added before things got sloppy but im glad we got to know each other tess smiled tapped her glass to willas ill drink to that thats the point willa asked as she frowned down at w w her toenails currently being painted poppy pink by a t s technician nobody sees them but me and i dont pay much attention to my toenails which was quite obvious tess returned pleased with her ravage red polish before maria worked her magic on you your toenails looked like theyd been groomed with a lawn mower so willa hated the fact that she was actually enjoying most of the processþ which had included her new favorite foot massage she turned to the opposite side of the padded pedicure bench where lily was beaming down at her halfpainted toes you really think adams going to go forþwhat is itþwilla cocked her head to read the label on the bottle of polishþcalypso coral it makes me feel pretty smiling lily admired her nails already shaped and slicked with matching lacquer grownup and pretty she looked over at tess i guess thats the point isnt it there as if after a long classroom lecture a student had finally grasped the formula tess clapped careful to guard her nails against smears at last some simple common sense a smart woman doesnt dress up and decorate herself for a man she does it for herself first then for other women who are the only species that really notices the details then coming up in the rear for men who if a womans lucky see the big picture amused at all of them tess wiggled her brows lowered her voice an octave ugh looks good smells good me wanna mate she was rewarded for this insight by a snorting chuckle from willa you dont think much of men do you hollywood au contraire dimwit i think a great deal about men and find them on the whole an interesting diversion from the daytoday routine of life take nate you appear to have already done that yes tesss smile turned smug and feline nathan torrence an enigma at first the slowtalking montana rancher with the law degree from yale who likes keats drum tobacco and the marx brothers a combination like that well it presents both a challenge and an opportunity she lifted her completed foot and preened i like challenges and i never miss an opportunity but im getting my toenails painted because it makes me feel good if he gets a charge out of it thats just a bonus it makes me feel exotic lily put in likeþwhat was the name of that woman in the sarong the one in the old blackandwhite movies dorothy lamour tess told her now take adam a different type of man altogether he is since theyd moved to her favorite topic lily perked up how dont encourage her lily shes playing at expert here i dont have to play at it when it comes to men champ adam tess continued wagging a finger serious solid and yet vaguely mysterious probably the most gorgeous man ive ever seen in my short if illustrious career of male tracking with thisþthe only word i can think of is goodnessþsort of beaming out of those yumyum eyes his eyes lily said with a sigh that made willa roll her own butþ tess made her point with a shake of her finger it doesnt make him boring as goodness sometimes can because theres this simmering controlled passion in there too and as far as youre concerned lily you could shave your head and paint your face calypso coral and hed still adore you he loves me lily said with a foolish grin yes he does he thinks youre the most beautiful woman in the world and if you woke up some morning and some wicked witch had put a spell on you and turned you into a hag hed still think you were the most beautiful woman in the world he sees past the physical appreciates it but sees past it to everything you are inside thats why i think youre the luckiest woman in the world maybe that wasnt such a bad take willa commented for a hollywood writer oh im not done we have to complete our triad delighted with herself tess leaned back ben mckinnon dont start willa commanded obviously youre hot for him well just sit here a minute and dry she told the technicians then reached for her glass of sparkling mineral water a woman would have to be dead two weeks not to have a pulse spike around ben mckinnon how much has your pulse been spiking pleased with the reaction tess moved a lazy shoulder im otherwise involved if i wasnt in any case i havent been dead for two weeks could be arranged no dont get up and stalk around yet youll smear tess put a restraining hand on willas arm back to benþhis sexuality is right out there striding along a foot in front of him raw hot unapologetic sex in a tough male package you watch him ride a horse and you just know hed ride a woman with the same power hes also intelligent loyal honest and looks fabulous in levis as a student of such matters id have to say ben mckinnon has the best buns in denim east or west of the pecos not a bad distraction she finished taking a slow sip of water from the daytoday routine i dont know why youre looking at his butt when youve already got a guy willa muttered because its a fine butt and i have excellent eyesight tess skimmed her tongue over her teeth of course a woman would have to be brave enough strong enough and smart enough to match him in power and style there tess thought as willa sulked beside her challenge issued ben thats the best help i can give you it wasn t until willa was back at mercy and unpacking that she realized that through the last twentyfour hours of her stay at the spa she hadnt thought of the ranch of her troubles her responsibilities at all and now that she did realize it there was a quick wash of guilt that it should have been so easy to leave it all behind to immerse herself in the pampering and pleasure like walking into an alternate reality she supposed and grimaced as she tumbled pretty gold boxes onto her bed which might explain why shed barely put up a struggle when tess and lily had urged her to buy creams lotions scents shampoo christ almighty hundreds of dollarsworth of female foolishness that she was unlikely to remember to use so shed give the lot of them to bess she decided to go with the fancy perfumed soaps and bubble bath shed bought her in any case it was good to be getting back into jeans she thought tugging them on it was better to have adam tell her thered been no whisper of trouble over the weekend the men were starting to relax again though the roundtheclock guard remained in effect calfpulling season was winding down and the calendar insisted that spring was on the way you wouldnt know it she mused trailing her shirt from her fingers as she walked to the window the air swooping down from canada was as bitter as an old woman with gout there was no snow in the sky and for that she was grateful still willa knew the vagaries of marchþand april for that matter the reality of spring remained as distant as the moon and she longed for it that surprised her as well normally she was content in any season winter was work certainly but it also offered even demanded periods of rest for the land for the people on it spring might be a time of rebirth and rejoicing but it was also a time of mud of drought or impossible driving rain of aching muscles fields to be planted cattle to be separated and led to range but she longed for it longed to see even one single bud bloomþthe flower of the bitterroot triumphing out of the mud a laurel springing up miraculously in the thickening forest wild columbine teasing a mountain ridge amazed at herself she shook her head and stepped back from the window since when had she started dreaming of flowers it was tesss doing she imagined all that talk about romance and sex and men just a natural segue into spring flowersþand mating season chuckling she studied the scatter of gold boxes over the simple quilt on her bed and what were those she admitted but expensive mating lures at the sound of footsteps she called out and began to gather the boxes up bess got a minute ive some other things in here you might want i dont know why iþ she broke off as ben not bess stepped into the room what the hell are you doing here dont you knock did bess let me in his brows went up and the eyes under them lit with appreciation well hell willa look at you she was grateful shed pulled on jeans at least and also very aware she was shirtless but for the thin clinging silk of her thermal undershirt her nipples hardened traitorously even as she snatched up the flannel shirt shed tossed aside im not back an hour she complained as she punched her arms through shirtsleeves and youre in my face i dont have time to chat or go over reports ive already lost a whole weekend doesnt appear you lost a thing he was understandably disappointed when she buttoned up the plaid shirt but intrigued by the busy businesslike way her fingers executed the task eventually hed like to see them go in reverse you look fine he came closer rested pretty and lifted a hand to the spiraling curls raining over her shoulders sexy i had a couple of bad moments when nate told me about the place you were going figured you might come back with your face all tarted up and your hair chopped off like one of those new york models trying to look like a teenage boy why do you suppose they want to do that i couldnt say howd they get all that hair of yours into those corkscrews you hand those people enough money theyll do anything she tossed back the curls faintly embarrassed by them what do you want ben to stand here and talk about salon treatments hmm it was the damnedest thing he mused toying with her hair again all those wild curls and it was still as soft as duck down i like it gives me ideas she was getting that picture clearly enough and slipped strategically out of reach its just hair curls i like it curled his grin spread as he maneuvered her toward the wall i like it straight too the way it just swings down your back or when you twist it back in a pigtail she knew the dimensions of her room well enough to judge shed be rapping into the wall in another two steps so she held her ground look what do you think youre doing is your memory that poor he took hold of her pleased that shed stopped retreating i didnt figure a few days away would have you forgetting where we left off hold still willa he said patiently when she lifted her arms to push him off im just going to kiss you what if i dont want you to then say get your hands off me ben mckinnon getþ that was as far as she got before he cut off her opportunity and his lips were hungry not nearly as patient as his voice had been the arms that held her tightened possessively stole her breath had her parting her lips to gasp for air and her mouth was invaded by his quick and clever tongue it was like being swallowed she thought hazily like being eaten alive with a greed that incited greed hearts pounding that was his she realized as well as hers racing wild dangerously fast and she wondered if they continued to ride this course at this speed how soon one or both of them would fly headlong over the saddle and into the air missed you he said it so quietly as his lips trailed down to sample her throat that she thought shed imagined it missed her could he those lips cruised up again along the side of her throat behind her ear doing things to her skin that made her giddy and weak inside you smell good he murmured hed said she looked good she remembered as her knees trembled smelled good did that mean he had the big picture and what came next was she thought of tesss lightly cynical remark and swallowed hard wait stop she couldnt have pushed a mound of feathers away much less an aroused man but at her breathy voice and the flutter of her hands he changed the tone okay he still held her but easy now his hand stroking up her back to soothe she was shaking he realized and cursed himself for it innocent innocent he repeated like a mantra until his breathing began to level hed only meant to indulge in a couple of teasing tastes not a flurry of halfmad gulps but days weeksþhell yearsþof frustration and wanting he admitted were boiling up and threatening to blow and what he wanted to do what hed imagined doing to her in that room on that bed wasnt the way a civilized man should initiate a virgin sorry he eased back to study her face fear and confusion and desire swirled in her eyes he could have done without the fear i didnt mean to spook you will i forgot myself a minute to lighten the mood he flicked a finger at a curl must be the hairdo he was sorry she realized more than a little stunned and something else was in his eyes it couldnt be tenderness not from him but she was certain it was a softer emotion than lust maybe she thoughtþand smiled a littleþ maybe it was affection its okay i guess i forgot myself for a minute too must have been the way you were gulping me down like two quarts of prime whiskey youve got a tendency to be as potent he muttered i do the stunned female response got his blood moving again dont get me started i really came up to let you know that adam and i are riding up into high country to take a look around zack says the north pass is blocked by snow and he thought some hunters might be making use of your cabin why does he think that on one of his flyovers he caught sight of tracks other signs ben shrugged it off wouldnt be the first time but since i want to see how bad the pass is blocked adam and i thought wed swing up and check it out ill go with you ill be ready in fifteen minutes were getting a late start odds are we wont make it back tonight we can radio you from the cabin im going ask adam to saddle moon for me and ill pack my gear it was good to ride willa thought good to be in the saddle out in the air that crisped with the climb moon loped easily through the snow apparently pleased to be out herself her breath plumed ahead and her harness jingled the sun shone bright dazzling light off the untrod snow adding glitter to the draped trees here in high country spring would come late and last hardly more than a precious moment a falcon called a scream in the silence and she saw signs of deer of other game of predators that hunted the hills perhaps she had enjoyed her weekend of pampering but this was her world the higher she climbed the more thrilled she was to be back you look pleased with yourself ben flanked her left and keeping an easy hand on the reins studied her face what did they do to you up there at that fancy spa all sorts of things wonderful things she tilted her head sent him a sly smile they waxed me all over no kidding he felt a pleasant little thrumming in his loins all over yep ive been scraped down oiled up waxed and polished it was pretty good you ever had coconut oil rubbed over your entire body ben the thrumming increased considerably you offering willa im telling you at the end of the day this guy would rubþ guy he shot straight arrow in the saddle the sharp tone of his voice had charlie scampering back from his scouting mission and whining what guy the massage guy you let a guy rub yourþ sure satisfied with his reaction she turned to adam the gleam in his eye assured her that her brother knew just what game she was playing lily had something called aromatherapy it seemed to me to be a lot like our mothers people have been doing for centuries using herbs and scents to relax the mind and the body now theyve slapped on a fancy name and charge you an arm and a leg for it white men adam said with a grin always seeking profit from nature that was my thought in fact i asked lilys massage therapist why she figuredþ she ben interrupted lily had a woman massage lady thats right so i asked her why it was she figured her people had come up with all these treatments when the indians had been using mud and herbs and oils before there were whites within a thousand miles of the rockies how come lily had a woman and you didnt willa glanced over at ben lilys shy anyway some of the treatments seemed very basic and the oils and creams not unlike what our grandmother would have brewed up in her own lodge they put it in fancy bottles and make it theirs adam added ben knew when his chain was being pulled and now he shifted in the saddle they use bear grease on you too willa bit off a smile actually i suggested they look into it you should tell shelly to take a weekend there when the babys weaned tell her to ask for derrick he was amazing adam coughed into his hand then clucked to his horse and took the lead with charlie trotting happily in his wake so you let this guy this derrick guy see you naked hes a professional she flicked back her curling hair no longer embarrassed a bit im thinking of getting regular massages theyre very relaxing i bet reaching over ben put a hand on her arm slowing both their mounts ive just got one question what is it are you trying to drive me crazy maybe he nodded because you figure its safe since were out here and adams just up ahead the smile got away from her maybe think again he moved fast leaning into her dragging her into him and fixing his mouth hard on hers when he let her jerk back control her frisking mount he was smiling im going to buy me some coconut oil and well see how you look in it her heart stuttered settled maybe she said again she started to kick moon into a trot the shot crashed and echoed a highpitched shocking sound too close was all willa had time to think before adams horse reared nearly unseating him idiots she said between her teeth goddamn citified idiots must beþ take cover ben all but shoved her out of the saddle swinging his mount to her other side as a shield he had his rifle out in a lightning move even as he plunged kneedeep into the snow use the trees and stay down but shed seen now the blood that stained the sleeve of adams jacket and seeing it she was running toward her brother in the open ben swore ripely as he tackled her used his body to cover hers as another shot exploded she fought bitterly bucking and clawing in the snow terror was a hot red haze adamþhes shot let me go keep down bens face was close to hers his voice cold and calm as he held her under him charlie barked like thunder quivering for the signal to hunt he subsided only when ben gave him the terse order to stay still covering willa ben shifted his eyes as adam bellied toward them how bad dont know the pain was bright a violent song up his arm to the shoulder i think he got more of the coat than me will youre not hit he rubbed a snowcoated glove over her face will no youre bleeding its okay his aim was off she closed her eyes a moment willing herself to calm it was deliberate it wasnt some stupid hunter had to be a longrange rifle ben murmured lifting his head enough to scan the trees the hills he slid a hand over his dogs vibrating back to calm him i cant see anything from the direction id guess hes holed up in that gulch up there in the rocks with plenty of cover willa forced her breath slowly in slowly out we cant get to him trust her ben thought to think first of attack he slid off willa steadied his rifle were almost to the cabin you and willa make for it keep to the trees i can draw his fire here the hell with that im not leaving you here she started to scramble up but ben pushed her flat again in the seconds that his eyes held adams the men agreed how to handle it adams bleeding ben said quietly he has to be looked after you get him to the cabin will ill be right behind you we can make a stand in the cabin if we have to blocking out the pain adam walked his way through the details ben we can cover you from up ahead when you hear our fire start after us ben nodded once i get to that stand of rocks where we used to have that fort ill fire thatll give you time to make it to the cabin fire again so ill know you made it now she had to choose willa realized between one man and the other the blood staining the snow gave her no choice at all dont do anything stupid she took bens face in her hands kissed him hard i dont like heroes keeping low she grabbed the reins of her horse can you mount she said to adam yeah stay in the trees willa were going to move fast with one last look at ben adam swung into the saddle ride she didnt have time to look back but she would remember she knew she would remember always the way ben knelt alone in the snow the shadows of trees shielding his face and a rifle lifted to his shoulder shed lied she thought when she heard him fire once twice three times she had an open heart for heroes theres no return fire she called out as she and adam pulled up behind a tower of rock maybe hes gone or maybe he was waiting adam thought he said nothing as willa unsheathed her rifle she fired a steady half dozen rounds hell be all right wont he adam if the sniper tries to circle around andþ nobody knows this country better than ben he said it quickly to reassure both of them hed left his brother behind was all he could think because it was all that could be done weve got to keep moving willa we can give ben the best cover from the cabin she couldnt argue not when adams face was so pale not when the cabin warmth and medical supplies were only minutes away but she knew what none of them had said there was no cover for the last fifty yards to get inside they would have to ride in the open the sun was bright the snow dazzling she had no doubt that they stood out against that white like deer in a meadow in the distance she could hear the frigid sound of water forcing its way over ice and rock and closer the rapid sound of her own breathing rocks punched out of snow trees crouched she rode with her rifle in her hand prepared for some faceless gunman to leap out at any moment and take aim overhead an eagle circled and called out in triumph she counted the seconds away by her heartbeats and bit down hard on her lip when she heard the echo of bens rifle he made it to the stand of rocks she could see the cabin now the sturdy wooden structure nestled on rocky ground inside she thought was safety first aid for adam a radio to signal for help shelter somethings wrong she heard herself say it before it became completely clear a picture out of focus a puzzle with pieces missing someones shoveled a path she said slowly and there are tracks she took a deep breath i can still smell smoke nothing puffed from the chimney but she could catch the faint whiff of smoke in the air can you what adam shook his head fought to stay conscious no i the world kept threatening to gray on him he couldnt feel his arm now not even the pain its nothing moving on instinct willa shoved her rifle back in its sheath took adams reins with her free hand in the open or not they would have to move quickly before he lost any more blood nearly there adam hold on hold on to the horn what hold on to the horn look at me she snapped it out so that his eyes cleared for a moment hold on she kicked moon into a gallop shouting to urge adams mount to keep pace if adam fell before they reached safety she was prepared to leap down drag him if necessary and let the horses go they burst into a flash of sunlight blinding snow flew up from racing hooves like water spewing she rode straight in the saddle using her body to defend her brothers and every muscle was braced for that quick insult of steel into flesh rather than taking the cleared path she drove the horses toward the south side of the cabin even when the shadow of the building fell over them she didnt relax the sniper could be anywhere now she dragged her weapon free jumped the saddle then fought the nearly waisthigh snow to reach adam as he swayed dont you pass out on me now her breath burned in her lungs as she struggled to support him his blood was warm on her hands damned if im carrying you sorry hell just give me a second he needed all his concentration to beat back the dizziness his vision was blurred around the edges but he could still see and he could still think well enough to know they wouldnt be safe until they were inside the cabin walls and even then get inside fire off a shot to let ben know ill get the gear the hell with the gear willa steadied him against her side and dragged him toward the door too warm she thought the minute she was inside the door pulling adam toward a cot she glanced at the fireplace nothing but ash and chunks of charred wood but she could smell the memory of a recent fire lie down hold on a minute hurrying back to the door she fired three times to signal ben then closed them in hell be right along she said and prayed it was true we have to get your coat off stop the bleeding get a fire started clean the wound radio the ranch worry for ben i havent been much help adam said as she removed his coat next time im shot you can be the tough one she choked off a gasp at the blood that soaked the sleeve of his shirt from shoulder to wrist pain how bad numb with a tired and objective eye he studied the damage i think it passed through i dont think its so bad wouldve bled more if it hadnt been so cold wouldve bled less willa thought ripping the sleeve aside if they hadnt been forced to ride like maniacs she tore through the thermal shirt as well felt her stomach heave mightily at the sight of torn and scored flesh im going to tie it up first stop the bleeding she pulled out a bandanna as she spoke im going to get some heat in here then well clean it out and see whats what check the windows he laid a hand on hers reload your rifle dont worry she tied the makeshift bandage snugly lie back down before you faint youre beginning to look like a paleface she tossed a blanket over him then rushed to the woodbox nearly empty she noted while her heart thudded with trembling hands she set the kindling arranged logs set them to blaze the first aid kit was in the cupboard over the sink setting it on the counter she flipped the lid to be sure it was fully stocked with that small relief she crouched down to the cabinet below for bandages pushed through containers of cleaning supplies and felt her bowels turn to water the bucket kept below the sink was just where it should have been but it was heaped with rags and stiffened towels and the rusty stain coating all of them was blood old blood she thought as she gingerly reached out and much too much blood to have been the result of some casual kitchen accident too much blood to be anything but death will adam struggled to sit up what is it nothing she closed the cupboard door just a mouse startled me cant find bandages before she turned back she schooled the revulsion out of her face well use your shirt she clattered a basin into the sink filled it with warm water id say this is going to hurt me more than its going to hurt you but it wont she set the basin and first aid kit beside him then went into the bathroom for clean towels she found one only one and indulged herself by pressing her clammy face against the wall when she came back adam was up swaying at the window what the hell are you doing she barked pulling him back to the cot cant let our guard down yet will weve got to call the ranch there were bees buzzing in his ears and he shook his head to scatter them let them know he could head down there everyone at the ranch is fine willa removed the bandanna and began to clean the wound ill call as soon as ive got you settled dont argue with me her voice took on a trembling edge you know i dont do well with blood to begin with and this is my first gunshot give me a break here youre doing fine shit he hissed through his teeth i felt that thats probably good right looks like it went in here just under the shoulder nausea churned was ignored and came out here in the back raw torn flesh with blood still seeping you must have lost a pint but its slowing down i dont think it hit bone i dont think she gnawed her lip as she opened the bottle of alcohol this is going to burn like hellfire indians are stoic in pain remember holy shit he yelped once jerked and his eyes watered as the antiseptic seared yeah i remember she tried to chuckle nearly sobbed go ahead and yell all you want its okay his head spun stomach churned he could feel the clammy sweat pop out in small beads on his skin i got it out just get it done i should have given you pain pills first her face was as white as his now and she spoke quickly words tumbling out to keep them both from screaming tears were falling i dont know if we have anything but aspirin anyway probably like trying to piss out a forest fire it s clean adam it looks clean im just going to smear this stuff on it now and wrap it up thank christ they sweated their way through the last of it then each sighed heavily and studied the other their faces were dead pale and sheened with sweat adam was the first to smile i guess we didnt do half bad considering it was the first gunshot wound for both of us you dont have to tell anybody i cried you dont have to tell anybody i screamed she mopped her damp face then his deal now lie back and ill she trailed off buried her face against his leg oh god adam wheres ben wheres ben he should be here dont worry he stroked her hair but his eyes were trained on the door hell be here well radio the ranch get the police okay she sniffled lifted her head ill do it just sit there youve got to get your strength back she rose and walked to the radio switched it on there was no familiar hum no light its dead she said and her voice reflected her words a cursory look made her stomach drop someones pulled out the wires adam the radios dead tossing down the mike she strode across the room hefted her rifle take this she ordered and laid the gun across his knees ill use yours what the hell are you doing she picked up her hat wound the scarf around her throat again im going after ben the hell you are im going after ben she repeated and youre in no shape to stop me his eyes on hers he rose steadied himself oh yes i am it was a matter for debate but at that moment they both heard the muffled sound of hooves in snow unarmed willa whirled toward the door and dragged it open with adam only steps behind her she raced out her knees didnt buckle until ben slid out of the saddle where the hell have you been you were supposed to be right behind us weve been here nearly thirty minutes i circled around found some tracks butþhey he dodged the fist shed aimed at his face but misjudged the one to his gut jesus will are you crazy youþ he broke off again when she threw her arms around him women he muttered nuzzling her hair how you holding up he asked adam been better me too ill tend to the horses see if theres any whiskey around here would you he gave willa a friendly pat on the back and turned her toward the door i need a drink a campsite a little north of where we got ambushed was cold t signs somebody dressed some game looked like three people on horseback with a dog he patted charlie on the head two days maybe three tidied the place up so id say they knew what they were doing he dug into the canned stew willa had heated anyhow there were fresh tracks one rider heading north my guess is that would be our man you said youd be right behind us willa said again i got here didnt i charlie and i wanted to poke around first he set what was left of the stew on the floor for the grateful dog and resisted rubbing his hand over his stomach where her fist had plunged the way i see it the guy takes a couple of shots then rides off i dont think he waited around to see what wed do he may have been staying here adam put in but that doesnt explain why he sabotaged the radio doesnt explain why he tried to shoot us either ben shrugged his shoulders the man weve been worried about for the past few months uses a knife not a gun there were three of us willa pointed out at charlies thumping tail she managed a small smile four a guns a safer bet you got a point ben reached for the coffeepot topped off all three cups willa stared at hers watched the steam they had food in their bellies the kick of caffeine in their blood it was all the time she could give the three of them to recover hes been here her voice was steady shed been working on that i know the police checked the cabin after that woman was killed and they didnt find anything to indicate shed been held here but i think she was i think she was held right here killed right here and then he cleaned up after himself she got up went to the base cupboard dug out the bucket i think he mopped up her blood with these then stuck it back under the sink let me have that ben took the bucket from her then eased her into a chair wed better take this back with us he set it aside near the woodbox out of her range of vision he killed her here willa was careful to keep her voice from bobbing along with her heart he probably tied her to one of the bunks raped her killed her then he cleaned up the mess so if anybody checked in things would look just as they should hed have had to bring her down on horseback most likely at night i guess he could have hidden the body somewhere for a few hours even a day then he dumped what was left of her at the front door just dumped her there with less care than you would a butchered deer she closed her eyes and every time i begin to think to hope that its over it comes back he comes back and theres no figuring the why maybethereis no why ben crouchedin frontofhertook herhands in his willa weve got two choices here its going to be dark in an hour we can stay until morning or we can use night as a cover and head back either way its a risk either way its going to be hard she kept her hands in bens looked at adam are you up to the ride i can ride then i dont want to stay here she drew a deep breath i say we head out at dusk it was a cold clear night with just a hint of fog crawling low on the ground a hunters moon guided them just willa thought as that same hunters moon spotlighted them for whatever predator stalked them the dog trotted ahead his ears pricked up beneath her moon quivered as her nerves were transmitted to the mare every shadow was a potential enemy every rustle in the brush a whispered warning the hoot of an owl the quick whoosh of wings on a downward flight and the scream of something hunted well and killed quickly were no longer simply sounds of the mountains at night but reminders of mortality the mountains were beautiful with the pale blue cast that moonlight made on snow the dark trees outlined in fluffy ermine the unbowed rock jutting up to challenge the sky and they were deadly he would have come this way she thought riding steadily east with his trophy strapped over his saddle wasnt that what that poor girl had been to him a trophy something to show how skilled he was and how clever how ruthless she shuddered hunched her shoulders against the kick of the wind you okay she glanced at ben his eyes gleamed in the dark like a cats sharp watchful i thought on the day of my fathers funeral when nate read off how things were would be i thought nothing would ever be as hard as hurtful as that i thought id never feel that helpless that out of control that it was the worst that could happen to me she sighed carefully guided her horse down an uneven slope where the shadows were long and the ground began to show through in patches thin fingers of mist parted like water then when i found pickles when i saw what had been done to him i thought that was the worst nothing could be more horrid than that but i was wrong i just keep being wrong about how much worse it can get i wont let anything happen to you you can believe that there in the distance the first glimmer of light that was mercy you were a damn fool today ben going out tracking on your own i told you i didnt like heroes and i think less of fools she nudged her horse forward toward the lights guess she told me ben murmured to adam she was right adam tilted his head at bens quick frown i wasnt any good to you and she was too busy making sure i didnt bleed to death to do anything else going looking on your own didnt help things youd have done the same in my place true enough were not talking about me she cried uncomfortable now ben shifted shot a look toward willa as she rode a few paces ahead oh hell promised i wouldnt tell and i wouldnt have if all the tears had been for me but there were plenty for you she was about to go out after you well thats justþ foolish adams lips curved id have tried to stop her but i doubt id have managed it maybe youd better think of that next time he tried to ease his stiffening shoulder theres going to be a next time ben he isnt finished no he isnt finished and ben quietly closed the distance to willa the damn sight on the rifle had been off stinking expensive biathlon sight and it had been defective thats what jesse told himself as he relived every moment of the ambush it had been the rifle the sight the wind it hadnt been him hadnt been his aim hadnt been his fault just bad fucking luck that was all he could still see the way the halfbreed wifestealing bastards horse had reared hed thought oh for one sweet moment hed thought he nailed the target but the sight had been off it had been impulse too he hadnt planned it out if hed planned it out instead of having it all just happen wolfchild would be cold and deadþ and maybe mckinnon would be dead too and maybe hed have taken a taste of lilys half sister for good measure jesse blew out smoke stared into the dark and cursed hed get another chance sooner or later hed get another chance hed make sure of it and wouldnt lily be sorry then every night for a week willa woke in the grip of a nightmare drenched in sweat with screams locked in her throat always the same she was naked wrists bound night after night she struggled to free herself felt the cord bite into her flesh as she whimpered and writhed smelled her own blood as it trickled down her bare arms always just before she pulled herself awake there was the glint of a knife that shimmering arc as the blade swept down to work on her every morning she shoved it away knowing that like a rat it would gnaw free in the night the signs of spring those early hesitant signs should have thrilled her the brave glint of crocus her mother had planted scattered such hopeful color there was the growing spread of earth where the snow melted back to thinning patches the sounds of young cattle the dance of foals in pasture the time to turn the earth was coming to plant it and watch it grow and the time when the cottonwoods and aspens and larches would take on a lovely haze of green the lupine would bloom and even the high meadows would be bright with it with the neon signs of indian paintbrush with the sunny faces of buttercups the mountains would show more silver than white and the days would be long again and full of light it was inevitable that winter would whisk back at least once more but spring snows were different they lacked the brutal harshness of february s now that the sun was smiling bumping the temperature up to the balmy sixties it was easy to forget how quickly it could change again and easy to cherish every hour of every bright day from the window of her office willa could see lily she was never far from adam these days had rarely left his side since the night they had come back from high country willa watched lily touch adams shoulder as she often did fussing with the sling he wore he was healing no she thought they were healing each other how would it be to have someone that devoted that much in love that blind to everything but you how would it be to feel exactly that same way about someone scary she thought but maybe it would be worth those jiggles of fear and doubt to experience that kind of unfettered emotion it would be an exhilarating trip that wild ride on pure feeling pure need and more she realized beyond the moment the promise and permanence that was so easily read on the faces of lily and adam when they looked at each other the little secret smiles the signals that were so personal so theirs what a thrill she mused and what security to know there was someone who would be there for you always to have someone who thought of you first and last silly she told herself and turned away from the window daydreaming this way with so much to be done so much at stake and she would never be the kind of woman a man thought of first even her own father hadnt thought of her first she could admit that now here in his office that still held so much of him trapped in the air like a scent ground into the fibers of carpet he had never thought of her first and he had certainly not thought of her last and what was she deliberately willa sat in the chair that was still his laid her hand on the smooth leather arms where his had rested countless times what had she ever been to him a substitute a poor one at that she thought certainly by jack mercys standards no not even a substitute she thought as her hands curled into fists a trophy one of three that he hadnt even bothered to keep a memento of something easily discarded and forgotten not even worth the space of a snapshot on his desk not worth as much as the heads of the game kills mounted on the walls the fury the insult of it was rising up in her so quick so huge she didnt fully realize what she was doing until shed done it until she was up and yanking the first glassyeyed head from the wall the left antler of the sixpoint buck cracked as it hit the floor and the sound almost like a gunshot mobilized her the hell with it the hell with him im not a fucking trophy she scrambled onto the sofa tugged at the bighorn sheep that stared at her with canny eyes its my office now grunting she heaved the head aside and attacked the next its my ranch now later she might admit she went a little insane pulling pushing dragging at the mountings a macabre task stripping the walls of those disembodied heads breaking nails as she pried them loose her lips were peeled back in a snarl matching that of the mountain cat she wrestled from its perch for a moment tess just watched from the doorway she was too stunned to do much more as she saw the grisly heap growing on the floor and her sister muttering oaths as she muscled the towering grizzly out of its corner if she hadnt known better tess would have said willa was locked in a lifeanddeath battle with the bear in the lead since she did know better she wasnt certain whether she should laugh or run away instead of either she pushed the hair back from her face cleared her throat wow who opened the zoo willa whirled her face contorted in rage her eyes alive with it the bear lost the edge of gravity and toppled like a tree no more trophies willa said and panted to get her breath no more trophies in this house sanity seemed called for hoping to instill it tess leaned negligently against the doorjamb i cant say that ive ever cared for the decor in here or elsewhere field and stream isnt my style but what brought on this sudden urge to redecorate no more trophies willa repeated desperation had cemented into conviction not them not us help me get them out she took a step held out a hand help me get them the hell out of our house when realization came it was sweet stepping forward tess rolled up her sleeves and there was a gleam in her eyes now my pleasure let s evict smokey here first together they heaved and dragged the stuffed and snarling bear to the doorway then through it theyd made it to the top of the steps before lily came running up them what in the worldþfor a minute i thoughtþ she pressed a hand to her speeding heart i thought you were about to be eaten alive this one had his last meal some time ago willa managed to say and tried for a better grip what are you doing redecorating tess announced give us a hand with this bastard he s heavy no screw it willa blew out a breath back off she warned and when the stairs were clear she began to shove come on help me push okay tess made a show of spitting on her hands then put her back into it push lily lets dump this big guy together when he went he went with a flourish tumbling down the staircase with the noise of a thunderclap dust puffing claws clattering at the din bess came rushing out from the kitchen her face red with the effort and her hand on the baretta shed taken to keeping in her apron pocket name of god almighty huffing for air bess slapped her hands on her hips what are you girls up to youve got a bear in the foyer he was just leaving tess called out and began to whoop with laughter id like to know whos going to clean up this mess bess nudged the trophy with her toe considering it every bit as nasty dead as alive we are willa swiped her palms over her jeans just consider it spring cleaning she turned on her heel and marched back into the office now with the first thrust of fury deadened she could see clearly what shed done heads and bodies were strewn all over the room like bomb victims after a blast wooden mountings were cracked or chipped where shed thrown them eerily a loosened glass eye stared up at her from the beautiful pattern of the carpet oh my god she let out one long breath then another oh my god she said again you sure showed them pal tess gave her a light thump on the back they didnt have a chance against you itsþ lily pressed her lips together its horrible isnt it really horrible she hiccuped turned away pressed her lips tighter im sorry its not funny i dont mean to laugh she struggled to hold it back by crossing her arms hard over her stomach its just so awful like a wildlife garage sale or something its hideous tess lost her slippery hold on composure and began to giggle hideous and morbid and obscene andþoh jesus will if youd seen yourself when i first walked in you looked like a madwoman doing the tango with a stuffed bear i hate them ive always hated them her own laughter bubbled up until she simply sat on the floor and let it go then the three of them were sprawled on the floor howling like loons amid the decapitated heads theyre all going willa managed and pressed a hand to her aching side as soon as i can stand up theyre all going cant say ill miss them tess wiped her streaming eyes but what the hell are we going to do with them burn them bury them give them away willa moved her shoulders whatever she took a cleansing breath and pushed herself to her feet clean sweep she announced and hauled up a mounted elks head they carted them outþelk moose deer sheep bear there were stuffed birds mounted fish lonely antlers as the pile in front of the porch began to build the men wandered over to make a fascinated and baffled audience mind if we ask what you ladies are doing as unofficial liaison jim stepped forward spring cleaning willa told him you think wood can fire up the backhoe and dig a hole big enough to dump these in give them a decent burial youre just going to dump them in a hole shocked jim turned back as the men began to mumble it took only a few minutes in a huddle to come to an agreement this time jim cleared his throat maybe we could have a few for down to the bunkhouse and thereabouts its a shame just to bury em that buck thered look fine over the fireplace and mr mercy he put store by that bear take what you want willa said can i have the cat will billy hunkered down to admire it i sure would appreciate it hes a beauty take what you want she repeated and shook her head as the men began to argue debate and lay claim now youve done it ham moseyed over while four of the men muscled the bear into the back of a rig im going to have that damn ugly bastard staring at me every morning and every night theyll be storing what dont fit on the walls in one of the outbuildings too mark my words better there than in my house willa cocked her head i thought you liked that bear ham you were with him when he took it down yeah i was with him dont mean i harbor an affection for it jesus billy youre going to break that rack you keep that up have a care for gods sake be hanging their hats from it he muttered as he stalked over to supervise damn idiot cowboys now everybodys happy tess observed yep librarys next i can give you an hour tess glanced at her watch then ive got to get ready ive got a hot date she had some new lingerie delivered just that afternoon from victoria s secret she wondered how long it would take nate to get her out of it not long she speculated not long at all she let her thoughts circle back to will and isnt this the night for you and ben to take in your weekly picture show she said with her tongue in her cheek i guess it is lilys fixing a fancy dinner for adam tonight distracted willa glanced back oh well its sort of the anniversary of when we first first lily finished and blushed shed gotten a delivery from victorias secret too and its besss night off casually tess studied her nails evicting wildlife had been tough on her manicure i heard she was going down to ennis to spend the night with her gossipmate maude wiggins since im planning on staying at nates youll have the house all to yourself oh you shouldnt be alone lily jumped in i canþ lily tess rolled her eyes she wont be alone unless shes incredibly slow or incredibly stupid or just plain stubborn a quick woman a smart one a flexible one would get herself all polished and perfumed and suggest a quiet evening in ben would think id lost my mind if i got all dressed up then said i wanted to stay in wanna bet at tesss slow smile willa felt her own lips curving things are too complicated now ive got too much on my mind to be thinking of wrestling with ben when arent things complicated tess took willas arms turned her facetoface do you want him or not yes or no willa thought of the flutter that had been in her stomach all day because hed been on her mind yes tess nodded now yeah willa let out a breath she hadnt been aware of holding now then leave the rest of the spring cleaning for tomorrow itll take lily and me at least an hour to find something halfway sexy in that closet of yours i didnt say i wanted you to dress me again its our pleasure mind on her mission tess pulled willa back inside isnt it lily hey where are you going candles lily called out as she dashed across the road willa doesnt have nearly enough candles in her room ill be right there candles willa dragged her feet fancy clothes pretending i dont want to see a movie candles in my bedroom it feels like im setting a trap of course it does because thats exactly what youre doing at the doorway of willas room tess stopped put her hands on her hips there was work to be done here she determined if the scene was to be properly set and i guarantee hes not only going to love being caught hes going to be grateful feel like an idiot you dont look like an idiot tess tilted her head and studied vwilla from top to toe yes the hair swept up was a good touchþlilys with only a few pins anchoring all that mass it would tumble down satisfactorily at a mans impatient handling then there was the long dressþsimple fullskirted nipped just a bit at the waist too bad it wasnt white tess mused but willas limited wardrobe hadnt run to long white dresses and the pale gray was quiet almost demure except that tess had left the long line of front buttons undone to the thigh the tiny silver hoops at willas ears were lilys contribution again the makeup was tesss and she knew willa had been relieved that shed used a light hand but she didnt think willa understood the power of innocence on the verge you look tess finally decided like a virgin eager to be sacrificed willa rolled her eyes oh god thats a good thing woman to woman she patted willas cheek youll destroy him then the guilt hit had she pushed this moment tess wondered had she finagled it before willa was ready it was easy to forget that willa was six years younger than she and untouched listen tess caught herself wringing her hands and dropped them to her sides are you sure youre ready for this its a natural step but its still a big one if youre not absolutely sure nate and i can stay we can make it a double date keep things simple becauseþ youre more nervous than i am since that was such a surprise and oddly sweet willa grinned of course not im justþhell it wasnt just lily who had left half an hour before blinking back tears who was sentimental tess discovered while willas eyes widened in shock tess leaned forward and kissed her gently on both cheeks absurdly touched willa felt her stomach flutter and her color rise what was that for i feel like a mommy and she was going to start bawling in a minute so she turned quickly for the door i put condoms in your nightstand drawer use them for heavens sake hell think imþ prepared smart selfaware damn it even as she heard the sound of the rig pull up outside tess gave up turning back she rushed up to willa and hugged her hard see you tomorrow she managed and raced out grinning hugely willa stayed where she was she heard tesss voice rise and nate whod been waiting downstairs answered then the door and bens easy greeting her stomach jumped again so she sat on the edge of the bed and pressed her hand to it the conversation trailed off then the door opened and closed again an engine roared to life she was alone with ben she could always change her mind she reminded herself there was no obligation here she would play it by ear she made herself rise starting now he was in the great room studying the newly blank stone above the fireplace i took it down she said and he turned and he studied her we took it down today she corrected lily tess and i we havent decided what we want to put up in place of his portrait so were living with nothing for a while shes taken down jack mercys portrait ben thought by the tone in her voice he knew she understood just what a step shed taken it changes the room the focus of it yes that was the idea he stepped forward stopped you look great will different i feel different she smiled great and how are you l it hed been feeling easy before he turned and saw her in that long mistcolored dress the flowing skirt with the teasing hint of leg that slim neck revealed by the pinnedup hair she looked too soft too touchable too everything fine the same seems like i should take you to something fancier than a movie the way you look lily and tess get a charge out of going through my closet and criticizing my wardrobe im told this is about the only decent thing i own she plucked at the skirt and his blood pressure spiked as the unbuttoned material gave way to more leg theyve threatened to take me shopping stop babbling she ordered herself and moved behind the bar want a arinkts im driving actually i was thinking we could just stay in there now shed done in yeah i dont get the house to myself often anymore bess is staying with a friend tonight and tess and lily are well nobodys here something lodged in his throat something hot and not easily swallowed nobodys here she opened the cold box behind the bar found the champagne tess had directed her to serve so i thought we could just stay in relax the bottle clinked hard on wood when she set it down tess has a suitcase full of videos if we want a movie and there s food since he made no move to do so willa tore off the foil twisted the wire free unless youd rather go out no he focused on the bottle when she popped the cork champagne are we celebrating yeah if she could just manage to get a grip on the glasses spring i saw wildflowers today and the bulbs are sprouting birds are building a nest in the pole barn again she passed him his glass well start inseminating cows soon his lips twitched as he took the glass yeah its that time of year oh the hell with this she muttered it then downed the bubbly wine in her glass in two long gulps im no good at games this is tess and lilys idea anyway debating another she set her empty glass down looked him dead in the eye look the point is ben im ready okay baffled he took a sip of champagne you want to go out after all no no she pressed her fingers against her eyes took a breath im ready to have sex with you he choked managed to wheeze in air sputter it out excuse me why dance around all this she came out from behind the bar you want me to go to bed with you and im ready to so lets go to bed he took another drinkþa mistake as each individual bubble took on an edge and ripped its way down his throat just like that the horror in his voice had her fumbling what if hed just been stringing her along teasing her the way he had since childhood why then she thought hed have to die its what you said you wanted she snapped at him so so shed always done him in with angry eyes and impatience made him want to bite herþin all sorts of interesting places but she was changing the game he thought and the rules just im ready now so yippee whats wrong with that she jerked a shoulder unless youve changed your mind no i havent changed my mind its not a matter of changing my mind its jesus will he set the glass on the bar before he could bobble it and make a fool of himself youve thrown me off stride oh the confusion faded from her eyes and her mouth curved into a smile is that all what do you expect his voice shot out filled with male frustration you stand there all prettied up shove champagne at me and tell me you want to have sex how am i supposed to keep my rhythm maybe he had a point though she couldnt quite see it but he looked sort of cute all flustered and embarrassed so shed humor him okay she closed the distance wound her arms around his neck lets see if we can get your rhythm back pressed her mouth hard to his his reaction was quick and satisfying the way his arms came up banded her the way his mouth angled and fed the quick intake and release of his breath then when his lips gentled the way he murmured her name your gait seems steady enough to me now her voice was shaky the muscles in her thighs were vibrating like harp strings i want you ben i really want you she proved it by locking her mouth to his again then tearing it away to rain kisses over his face we dont have to go upstairs the couch hold on slow down before i rip your clothes off and ruin it slow down he repeated holding her close before the last of the blood could drain out of his head ive got to get my feet back under me and you ve got to be sure its going to be really tough to back off if you change your mind with a laugh she boosted herself up wrapped her legs around his waist do i look like im going to change my mind no guess not but if she did it was on him to hold himself back he thought such an eventuality might kill him i want you willa he brushed his lips over hers i really want you her heart did a neat somersault sounds like a deal upstairs he managed to walk even as she tightened her grip and started nibbling at his jaw the first time should be in a bed was yours no actually he got to the stairs wondered why hed never noticed how long they were it was in a rig in the middle of winter and i nearly froze my never mind she chuckled nuzzled at his throat thisll be better wont it yeah for him without a doubt for her he was going to do his best he stopped in the doorway of her room he wasnt sure how many more shocks he could survive in one night candles burned everywhere and the fire glowed low the bed was turned down inviting with dozens of pillows tess and lily willa explained they really got into this oh nothing like being showcased ben thought as his nerves jumped did they has anyone talked to you about things mckinnon she eased back to grin at him i run a ranch its not exactly the same he set her on her feet backed off a step listen willa this is kind of a first for me too ive neverþthe others werentþ he had to shut his eyes a minute gather his scattered wits i dont want to hurt you and i well i havent had anyone in a while i set my sights on you damn near a year ago and i havent had anyone else since really that was interesting why he sighed sat on the edge of the bed i have to get my boots off ill give you a hand she obligingly turned her back to him hefted one booted foot between her legs he nearly groaned a year she glanced over her shoulder as she tugged maybe more if it comes down to it struggling to be amused he planted a foot on her butt and pushed you were never particularly nice to me she took his other foot pulled at the boot you scared the hell out of me she stumbled forward as the boot came off then turned still holding it i did yeah irritated with himself he pushed a hand through his hair and thats all im going to say about it it was enough to think about she supposed oh i forgot she hurried to the table by the window and fiddled with tesss cd player music she explained tess claims its mandatory he couldnt hear anything over the knocking of his own heart her hair was falling down just a little and the firelight streamed through that long thin skirt every time she moved that should do it unless we should have the champagne up here thats all right his throat was closing again snapping like a bear trap later okay she lifted her hands began to undo the buttons of the dress while his mouth fell open her busy fingers flipped open six before he could get his tongue off his toes hold it slow down if youre going to strip for a man you should pace yourself is that so intrigued she stopped watched his gaze dip to her fingers then began again im not wearing a stitch under here she said conversationally tess said something about contrast and impact oh good jesus he wasnt sure how he got to his feet when he couldnt feel them but he stepped to her dont take it off his voice had thickened and the sound of it had her eager fingers pausing trembling let me finish it all right odd her arms were so heavy now she let them fall to her sides as he slipped the rest of the buttons free it was a lovely sensation she thought the skim of his knuckles over her skin shouldnt you be groping me or something a laugh even a weak one soothed some of the nerves ill get to it the dress was open now with light and shadow playing over that lovely line of bare flesh just stand there he said quietly and touched his mouth to hers can you do that yeah but my knees are going to start knocking just stand there he repeated touching only mouth to mouth as he undid his shirt let me taste you awhile here his lips cruised over her jaw here up to her ear you can trust me i know now her eyes were heavy she felt the lids drooping as his mouth toyed with hers whenever you chew on my lip that way i cant get my breath want me to stop no i like it she said it dreamily i can breathe later he tossed his shirt aside i want to see you willa let me look at you slowly he slid the dress from her shoulders let it drift to the floor she was long and slim subtle curves and strong angles her skin glowing gold in the dancing light youre beautiful it was an effort not to lift her hands to cover herself no one had ever said that to her not once in her life you always said skinny beautiful he cupped a hand to the back of her neck drew her slowly i toward him his fingers combed up her hair tumbled down he experimented with the weight of it lifting it letting it fall while his mouth rubbed over hers i always wanted to play with your hair even when you were a kid you used to pull it thats what boys do when they want girls to pay attention to them he gathered it gave it a tug and had her head jerking back mmm he sampled the exposed line of her throat nibbled lazily where the pulse was rabbiting paying attention yeah she shuddered couldnt stop or im trying to but i keep losing my focus all this stuff s happening inside me i want to be inside you her eyes opened at that and in them he saw nerves gloriously mixed with needs but theres more first i have to touch you he skimmed a hand down to her breast circled with a fingertip forced a moan through her lips as his thumb scraped over her nipple she felt an answering tug deep inside an echo of shock and pleasure then his hand slid down over her hip his fingers trailing lightly toward her center brushing awakening then retreating her eyes were huge focused on his her hands came to his shoulders for balance and found smooth skin taut muscles an old scar her fingers dug in once as she tried to absorb and analyze the sensation of those callused hands stroking her flesh she hadnt expected this shed thought it would be fast a grappling match full of grunts and howls how could she have known there would be tenderness mixed with the heat and the heat was huge ben hmm i dont think i can stand up anymore his lips curved against her shoulder just another minute i havent quite finished so this was what it was like to awaken a woman to know that your hands were the first hands to know you were the first to bring that flush to the skin that weakness to the limbs that quiver to the muscles he could be careful with her would be careful with her no matter how that very innocence made his blood surge when her eyes drooped this time he lifted her into his arms laid her on the bed you still have your pants on he covered her letting her grow accustomed to his weight itll be better for both of us if i keep them on awhile yet okay his hands were roaming again and she was beginning to float tessþin the drawer thereþcondoms ill take care of it let go for me will he trailed a line of kisses down her throat just let it all go and with a shudder of his own he took her breast in his mouth she arched the breath exploding through her lips sensation careened through her system flashing with heat urging her hips to grind with the rhythm he set he bit lightly but the sensation was no kin to pain her hands were fisted in his hair urging him to feed he heard her sigh and gasp and murmur her response to every touch was as free and open as any man could wish beneath his her body was agile limber one moment taut the next as she flowed with him the flavor of her filled him threatened to drive him mad if he didnt stop if he didnt take more her scentþsoap and skinþaroused him more than any perfume he took her mouth again needed it like he needed breath her tongue tangled with his in an avid dance somewhere in the back of his mind he could hear the quiet thrum of music he stroked a hand up that long length of leg stopping just short of the heat retreating her breath came quickly now fast and shallow while her nails bit into him look at me he brushed her lightly found her erotically hot wet but even as she arched he retreated again look at me i want to see your eyes the first time i want to see what it does to you i cant but her eyes were open wide and blind her body was on the edge of something like a high cliff where the wind both pulled and pushed i needþ i know god that voice of hersþstraight sex and now even throatier rustier and quivering with little gasps but look at me he cupped her watched her eyes go dark with fear and passion the first time he thought let go what choice did she have his fingers stroked her to flash point and everything happened at once her body tightened like a fist lights whirled in front of her eyes spinning to the roar of sound in her head that was her own frantic heartbeat and this pleasure was kin to pain an eruption that had her helplessly crying out while her body bucked shuddered then went slack her skin was dewed with sweat now her lips soft with surrender when he sought them again weakness warred then gave way to fresh energy as he patiently ruthlessly worked her back into a frenzy her system overcharged reeled imploded she rocked against him wildly greedy for more and he gave more until she was pliant again body still quivering in reaction breath coming slow and thick when he rolled off her she couldnt even manage a protest but lay sprawled in the hot tangled sheets he had to pray he wouldnt fumble now though his hands shook when he tugged at the snap of his jeans hed wanted her sated and satisfied before he took her wanted her to remember the pleasure if he was unable to prevent the pain i feel like im drunk she murmured i feel like im drowning he knew the feeling his blood was singing a sirens song in his head and his loins were screaming for release stripping away his jeans he tossed them aside before he remembered what he carried in his wallet snugged into the back pocket blessing tess he dug into willas nightstand drawer don t fall asleep he begged as he heard her sigh for gods sake dont fall asleep uhuh but this state of floaty relaxation was the next best thing she stretched and the firelight danced over her rippling golds and reds and ambers ben tore his gaze away and finished the business at hand are you going to touch me again yeah he had to get the nerves under control the hunger was one thing he could keep it chained but the nerves fluttered through his stomach as he ranged himself over her i need you it wasnt an easy admission not the same as want and he gave it to her as his mouth closed over hers let me have you willa hold on to me and let me have you and her arms came around him as he slid into her oh god so tight so hot he had to use every ounce of control not to plunge mindlessly into her like a stallion covering a ready mare battling to go slowly he fisted his hands on either side of her head watched her face watched it so intently so closely that he saw those first flickers of shock of acceptance and finally that lovely glaze of dark pleasure oh its wonderful she breathed the words out as he moved inside her really wonderful she gave up her innocence without regret with a smile bowing her lips as she matched him stroke for slow stroke in his eyes she saw the need he had spoken of the need focused only and fully on her when she looked deeper she saw herself reflected back in them lost in them and this she thought when he finally buried his face in her hair and emptied himself into her was beauty didn t know it would be like that still pinned beneath him still joined willa lazily played with his hair i might have been ready sooner id say the timing worked just fine he had fantasies already working pouring champagne over that lovely golden body and licking it off drop by drop i always thought people set too much store by sex i guess ive changed my mind it wasnt sex he turned his head nibbled at her temple well have sex some other time this was making love and you cant set too much store by either she stretched her arms up then lowered them so that her hands could knead his bottom whats the difference he was still half aroused and well aware it wouldnt take much to finish the job you want me to show you lifting his head he grinned down at her right now she chuckled and feeling sentimental stroked his cheek even a bull needs recovery time i aint no bull just stay right there where are you going my oh my she thought she hadnt taken nearly enough time to look at that body of his it was an education ill be right back he told her and strode out without bothering with his jeans well well she stretched again then shifted so that she was cradled by pillows it seemed the night wasnt over experimentally she laid a hand on her breast her heart was bumping along at a normal rate now rather than with that snare drum riff it had reached when hed nuzzled just there it was an odd feeling she thought to have a man suckling you to have him pull you inside him and to experience those mirror tugs in the womb everything hed done had made her body feel differentþtighter then looser lighter then heavier she wondered if she looked differentþto herself to him there was no denying that she felt different with all the pain all the grief and fear in her life over the past months she had found an oasis for tonight if only for tonight there was only this room nothing outside of this room mattered no not even murder she wouldnt let reality in tomorrow was soon enough for worries for the fear of what was haunting her ranch her mountains her land just for tonight she would be only a woman a woman she decided who this once would be content to let a man hold the reins so she was smiling when he walked back in and for a moment just looked shed seen him shirtless before countless times and knew those broad shoulders that strong back one memorable day shed caught him and adam and zack skinnydipping in the river so shed seen him naked but shed been twelve then and she wasnt thinking like a twelveyearold now and she wasnt looking at a teenager but a man a powerful one one that had her stomach flopping around in delighted reaction you look good naked she said conversationally he stopped pouring the glass hed brought in with him turned to stare at her you dont look so bad yourself the fact was she looked stunning sprawled over the rumpled sheets without a hint of modesty her hair was tumbled her eyes glowed in the candlelight and she had one hand low on her belly idly tapping along with the music you sure as hell dont look like a novice he told her i learn fast now his smile came slow dangerous im counting on that yeah she loved a challenge so what have you got there mckinnon your champagne he set the bottle on her dresser where candles flickered have a glass the one he brought her was full to the rim you may want to be a little drunk for this really the smile widened into a grin but with a shrug she sipped arent you having any after she chuckled sipped again after what after i take you thats what im going to do this time he trailed a finger from her throat down to her quivering belly im going to take you and youre going to let me the breath backed up in her lungs and it took an effort to push it out he didnt look tender now or flustered now with those eyes so dark so green so focused he looked ruthless exciting am i yeah he could see that pulse in her throat begin to beat and flutter its not going to be slow but its going to take a long time drink the champagne down willa ill taste it on you are you trying to make me nervous he climbed onto the bed straddled her watched her blink in surprise darling im going to make you crazy he took the glass dipped a finger in the wine then traced it over her nipple im going to make you scream yeah he nodded slowly repeating the process on her other breast you should be afraid in fact i like you being just a little afraid this time he trickled the last few drops over her belly then set the glass aside im going to do things to you that you cant even imagine things ive been waiting to do she swallowed hard as a new and fascinating chill ran over her skin i think i am afraid she shuddered out a breath but do them anyway it wasnt easy to track willa down once april hit its stride and with i it the spring breeding season as far as tess could see everything was focused on mating people as well as animals if she hadnt known better she would have sworn shed caught ham flirting with bess but she imagined he had been trying to wrangle a pie young billy was eyedeep in love with some pretty little thing who worked a lunch counter in ennis his former liaison with mary anne had hit the skids left him brokenhearted for about fifteen minutes the way he strutted around tess could see he thought of himself as a man of the world now jim had some slap and tickle going with a cocktail waitress and even the longtimemarried wood and nell were exchanging winks and sly grins with nothing disturbing the peace and pastoral quality of the air everyone seemed ready to fall into a routine of work flirtations and giggling sex there was lily of course with wedding preparations in full swing and willa when she stood still long enough had a dopey grin on her face it seemed to tess that the cows were trying to keep pace with the humans though she couldnt see anything particularly romantic about a man shooting bull sperm into a cow she sincerely doubted the bull was thrilled with the arrangement either but he was allowed to cover a few just to keep him happy and the first time tess witnessed the coupling was enough of a shock to make her wish it her last she refused to believe that the bulls chosen innamorata had been mooing in sexual delight shed watched nate and his handler breed his stallion too she had to admit there had been something powerful elemental and a little frightening in that process as well the way the stallion had trumpeted reared and plunged the way the mares eyes had rolled in either pleasure or terror she wouldnt have called the process romantic and it certainly hadnt been anything to giggle about the smells of sweat and sex and animal had been impetus enough for tess to drag nate off at the first decent opportunity and jump him he hadnt seemed to mind now it was another glorious afternoon with the temperature warm enough for shirtsleeves the sky was so big so blue so clear it seemed that montana had stolen every inch of it for itself if she looked toward the mountainsþas she often caught herself doingþ she would see spots of color bleeding through the white the blues and grays of rock the deep dark green of pine and if the sun angled just so a flash that was a river tumbling down fueled with snowmelt she could hear the tiller running behind adams house she knew lily was planning a garden and had cajoled adam into turning the earth for the seedlings shed started though hed warned lily it was too early to plant he was indulging her as tess mused he always would it was a rare thing she decided that kind of love devotion understanding with adam and lily it was as solid as the mountains as often as she wrote about people watched them so that she could do just that shed never grasped the simple and quiet power of love she could write about it make her characters fall in or out of it but she didnt understand it she thought perhaps it was like this land that shed lived on lived with for so many months now she had learned to value and appreciate it but understand it not a bit cattle and horses dotted the hills where grass was still dingy from winter and men worked in the mud brought on by warming weather to repair fencing dig posts and drive cattle to range they would do it over and over again year after year season after season that too she supposed was love if she felt a stir herself she blocked it off reminded herself of palm trees and busy streets she had tess thought with a sigh survived her firstþand she hoped lastþmontana winter there you are tess started forward but willa rode straight past her toward the near pasture damn it refusing to give up tess broke into a trot and followed she was only slightly out of breath by the time she caught up listen weve got to get into town tomorrow lilys fitting our attendant dresses cant willa uncinched moon hauled off the saddle busy you cant keep avoiding this she winced as willa thoughtlessly tramped on the infant wildflowers perking up around the fence posts im not avoiding it after dropping the saddle over the fence willa removed the saddle blanket and bit ive resigned myself to the fact that im going to be wearing some lame dress probably have posies in my hair i just cant take off for the day right now pulling a pick out of her pocket she leaned into moon lifted the mares near hind leg and went to work on her hoof if you dont go lily and i will have to choose the dress for you willa snorted skirted moons tail and lifted the next hoof youre going to pick it out anyway so it doesnt matter if im there or not true enough tess thought and with an ease she wouldnt have believed possible even a few months before she stroked and patted moon it would mean a lot to lily this time willa sighed and moved to the foreleg id like to oblige her really im swamped right now theres a lot to get done while the weather holds holds what holds off what do you mean holds off tess frowned up at the clear perfect blue of the sky its the middle of april hollywood we can get snow here in june we aint done with it yet willa studied the western sky the pretty puffy clouds that clung to the peaks she didnt trust them a spring snows a fine thing gives us moisture when we need it and melts off quick enough but a spring blizzard she shrugged pocketed the pick you never know blizzard my butt the flowers are blooming tess looked down at the trampled blooms or were we grow them hardy hereþthose that we grow i wouldnt put that long underwear away just yet hold moon with that order she hefted the saddle again and carried it toward the stable theres other things determined to finish tess dogged her heels i havent had a chance to talk to you alone in days ive been busy in the dim stable willa stored her tack and took up a grooming brush with this and that which means look so youre making up for lost time with ben thats fine glad youre happy and youre busy impregnating unsuspecting cows all day or ruining your hands with barbed wire but i need to know whats going on about you know very well cursing under her breath tess walked back outside where willa began brushing moon its been quiet will i like it quiet but its also making me edgy youre the one who talks to the cops to the men and you havent been passing things along i figured you were too busy playing with one of your stories and talking to your agent all day to worry about it of course im worried about it all nate says is theres nothing new but you still have guards on willa blew out a breath i cant take any chances and i dont want you to to soothe herself tess stroked moons cheek though i admit ive had a few bad moments waking up at night hearing people walking around outside or you pacing around in willa kept her eyes on moons smooth coat i have nightmares more surprised by the admission than the fact tess moved closer i m sorry she hadnt been able to talk about it and wondered now if that was a mistake so she would see theyve gotten worse since going up to the cabin realizing that girl was killed there no doubt of that now that theyve matched her blood to the towels and rags i found under the sink why the hell didnt the cops find them willa shrugged her shoulders and continued to groom her horse its not the only cabin the only shelter in the hins they looked around saw nothing out of place everything as it should be they didnt see any point in poking into dark corners and overturning buckets i guess they sure as hell have gone over the place now every inch hasnt helped anyway i think about that and the time up in the hills with adam shot and bleeding and not knowing she gave moon a slap on the flank to send him into the pasture just not knowing maybe it is over tess put in maybe hes gone off sharks do that you know cruise one area for a while then go off to another feeding ground im scared all the time it wasnt hard to admit it not when she watched lily walk around the side of the house laughing up at adam fear and love shed discovered went hand in hand work helps keeps the fear in the back of the mind ben helps you cant think at all when a mans inside you yes you can tess mused unless its the right man its that three oclock in the morning thing willa continued when theres nobody there and nothing to hold it off thats when the fear creeps up and snaps at my throat thats when i start wondering if im doing the right thing about the ranch it spread out around her her life having you and lily stay on when we cant be sure if its safe you dont have any choice tess hooked a boot in the fence leaned back into it she couldnt see the land through willas eyes doubted she ever would but shed come to admire the pull of it and the power we have minds of our own agendas of our own maybe ill tell you what mine is when my times up here im going back to la im going shopping on rodeo drive and im having lunch at whatever the current hot spot is which she knew would certainly not be the hot spot shed lunched in that past autumn and im taking my share of the profits from mercy and putting it toward a place in malibu near the ocean so i can hear the waves day and night never seen the ocean willa murmured no it was hard to imagine well maybe youll come visit sometime i show you what civilized people do with their days might just add a chapter to my book willa in hollywood grinning willa rubbed her chin what book i thought you were writing another movie i am flustered tess dipped her hands in her pockets im just playing with a book just for fun and im in it pieces of you its set here in montana on mercy where else am i going to set it tess muttered im stuck here for a year its nothing her fingers began to drum against the rail i havent even told ira its just something im fooling around with when im bored if that was true willa thought she wouldnt be so embarrassed can i read it no im going to go tell lily youre dodging the shopping trip tomorrow and dont complain if you have to wear organdy the hell i will willa turned around and studied the mountains again her mood had lifted considerably but as she watched more clouds roll in gather and cling she knew it wasnt over not winter not anything the dinner party was lily s idea just a small intimate casual dinner shed promised just the three sisters and adam ben and nate her family as she thought of them now small intimate and casual perhaps but exciting for her she would be hostess a position shed never held in her life at a party in her own home her mother had always planned and managed social events when lily was growing up and so efficiently so cleverly that lilys input or assistance simply hadnt been necessary during the brief time shed lived on her own she hadnt had the funds or the means to host dinners and her marriage certainly hadnt been conducive to social occasions but now things had changed she had changed she spent all day preparing for it cleaning the house was hardly a chore she loved every inch of it and adam wasnt a man to toss clothes everywhere or leave beer bottles cluttering the tables he didnt mind the touches shed addedþthe little brass frog shed ordered from a catalogue the pretty glass ball of melting blues shed fallen in love with at first sight in a shop in billings in fact he seemed to appreciate them he often said the house had been too simple too empty before shed come to him shed pored over recipes with bess and settled on a rib roast which she was just sliding into the oven when bess poked her head in the kitchen doorway everything under control in here absolutely i prepared it just as you told me and look proud as a mother with twins lily opened the refrigerator to show off her pies didnt the meringue turn out nice all those pretty sugar beads most men got a fondness for lemon meringue bess approved them with a nod you did just fine there oh i wish youd change your mind and come bess waved a hand youre a sweet girl lily but when i got a choice between putting my feet up and watching my movies and sitting around with a roomful of young people im putting my feet up now you want a hand ill give you one no i want to do it myself i know that sounds silly butþ doesnt bess wandered over to the window where lily had herb pots started from seed coming along well she thought just like lily a womans got a right to lord it over her own kitchen but you call me if you run into any problem she winked nobody has to know you had a little help bess turned as the back door opened again wipe your feet she ordered willa dont you be tracking mud in here on this clean floor im wiping them but under those eagle eyes willa gave them a few extra swipes on the mat oh arent those lovely lily pounced on the wildflowers willa was clutching that was so sweet of you to think of it to pick them for me adam did willa passed them over and considered her mission complete one of the horses pulled up with a strain so hes busy treating it he didnt want them to wilt oh adam did lily sighed and her heart melted as she buried her nose in the tiny blooms is the horse all right does he need help he can handle it ive got to get back couldnt you come in for a minute have coffee theres fresh before willa could refuse bess jabbed an elbow in her ribs sit down and have coffee with your sister and take off your hat in the house ive got laundry to do bossy old thing willa complained when bess shut the door behind her but she already had her hat off i guess ive got time for a cup if its already hot it is please sit down i just want to put these in water willa sat at the round maple table drummed her fingers on the wood the dozens of chores still on her list raced through her head smells good in here its the herbs and this potpourri i made made it willa drummed a little faster youre a regular little homemaker arent you lily kept her eyes on the stems she carefully slid into an old glass bottle its all im good at no its not and i didnt mean it to sound that way annoyed with herself willa squirmed in her chair youve made adam so happy he looks like he could float and its so neat and pretty in here she scratched the back of her neck and felt like an awkward rube i mean like that big white bowl there with the shiny red and green apples i d never think of something like that or putting stuff in those bottles youve got on the counter what is that stuff ravored vinegars lily glanced toward the longnecked bottles where sprigs of basil and rosemary and marjoram floated you use them for cooking for salad i like the way they look shelly does stuff like that too i could never figure it thats because you have to look at the big picture the foundation and not the fancywork i admire you so much willa stopped frowning at the bottles and gaped huh youre so smart and strong and capable lily set a pretty blue cup and saucer on the table you scared me to death when i first came here i did well everything did but especially you lily took her own cup added a hefty measure of cream to make it palatable to her taste then she sat deciding it was time to confess all i watched you the day of the funeral youd lost your father and you were hurting but you were also coping and later when nate read the will and everything that was yours that should have been yours was taken out of your control you dealt with it willa remembered too remembered she hadnt been kind i didnt have much choice theres always a choice lily said quietly mine was usually running away id have run that day if thered been any place left to go and i dont think i would have had the courage to stay when the horrible things started to happen if not for you i didnt have anything to do with it you stayed for adam adam lverything about lily softenedþvoice eyes mouth yes but i wouldnt have had the courage to go to him to let myself feel for him i looked at you at everything you were doing had done and thought shes my sister and shes never run from anything there must be something inside me that matches whats in her so i dug for it its the first time in my life ive stuck when things got rough willa pushed her coffee aside and leaned forward look i grew up the way i wanted to did what i wanted to i never found myself trapped in a relationship where someone used me for a punching bag didnt you lily gathered her courage again when willa said nothing bess told me how hard our father was on you bess talked too damn much was all willa could think an occasional backhand from a parent isnt the same as a fist in the face from a husband running from that wasnt cowardly lily it was right and it was smart yes but i never fought back not once neither did i willa murmured i may not have run from my father but i never fought back either you fought back every time you got on a horse pulled a calf rode a fence lily kept her eyes steady when willas flicked over her face you made mercy yours thats how you fought back you dug your roots i didnt know him and he never chose to know me but willa i dont think he knew you either no her voice was soft and slow with the realization i dont suppose he did lily drew a deep breath id fight back now and thats in very large part because of you because of tess because of the chance ive had here jack mercy didnt give me that chance will you did you should have hated us you had every right to hate us but you dont shed wanted to willa remembered it just hadnt been possible maybe hate just takes too much energy it does but not everyone understands that lily paused toyed with her cup when tess and i were shopping the other day i thoughtþfor a minute i thought i saw jesse just a flash just a glimpse you saw him in ennis willa bolted straight up in her chair fists curled no dazzled by her lily smiled a little see thats your first reaction fight back mine was to run i used to think i saw him everywhere i could imagine him everywhere it hasnt happened in a while but the other day some face in the crowd the tilt of a head but i didnt run i didnt panic and i think if i ever had to really had to id fight back i owe that to you i dont know lily sometimes runnings a fine choice it went so well lily could hardly believe it was her liee her new life people she had grown to love were sitting in the cozy dining room taking second helpings of food shed prepared laughing with each other like friends arguing with each other like family it was tess who had started that quite deliberately lily realized by telling willa the dress theyd picked out for her was a fuchsia organdy with a sixflounce skirt and puffed sleeves with a bustle youre out of your mind if you think youll get me into something like that what the hell is fuchsia anyway isnt that pink no way im wearing pink flounces youll look so sweet in it tess purred especially with the hat what hat oh its adorable matching color enormous floppy brim decked in a garden of spring flowers english primroses and the crowns cut out so we can dress your hair up high then theres the gloves elbow length very chic because willa had gone dead pale lily took pity on her shes just teasing you the dress is lovely pale blue silk with pearl buttons at the back and just a touch of lace on the bodice its very simple very classic and theres no hat or gloves spoilsport tess muttered then grinned at willa gotcha at this rate wills going to have a dress on more times this year than ive seen in her whole life ben toasted her i used to figure she slept in levis like to see you drive cattle in a dress willa tossed back so would i with a chuckle nate nudged his plate aside lily that was a fine meal adams going to have to start buying bigger belts with you cooking for him you have to have room for pie beaming with pleasure lily rose why dont we have it in the living room that girl can cook ben commented as he settled into a wing chair in the living room adams a lucky son of a bitch is that how you gauge a mans fortune in a wife mckinnon willa chose the floor in front of the fire and folded her legs by how she cooks couldnt hurt a clever woman hires a cook tess groaned a little as she sat with nate on the sofa and only eats this way once a year im going to have to do fifty extra laps in the pool tomorrow willa thought of several snide comments but let them pass she shot a quick look toward the kitchen where adam and lily were busy readying dessert before they come in did lily say anything to you about seeing her ex while you were shopping the other day no tess sat up quickly not a word in ennis nates eyes narrowed and he stopped playing with tesss fingers she said she was mistaken said it was an old habit to imagine him wherever she went but it worried me she got quiet for a while pursing her lips tess thought back we were windowshopping at a lingerie store and i thought she was dreaming of her wedding night she seemed nervous for a couple minutes but she never said a thing you ever get that picture of him ben asked nate just a couple of days ago there was some sort of holdup back east he too sent a cautious look toward the kitchen looks like a frigging altar boy pretty face and a jarhead haircut i havent seen him around i should have brought it over with me got it to adam i want to see it willa said well talk about it later she added when she heard adams voice i dont want to spoil this for her to cover the gap ben rose and strolled over as lily carried in a tray now thats pie he leaned over sniffed like a man who had nothing more on his mind than his next bite so what have you got for everybody else they kept the evening light and when nate gave tess a subtle signal by a quick squeeze of her hand he rose id better head on before you have to roll me out the door lily he bent to kiss her you set one fine table im so glad you came ill walk out with you tess feigned a yawn all that food im going to sleep like a log by tacit agreement ben and willa gave them five minutes after hugs and goodbyes before they made their own exit when they were alone adam turned lily into his arms who do they think theyre fooling what do you mean finding her incredibly sweet he pressed a kiss to her brow did you hear a rig start up we she blinked understood and laughed no i dont suppose i did i think theyve got the right idea he swept lily up headed for the steps adam all the dishes theyll still be here in the morning he kissed her again and so will in her bed in the dark willa let out a long throaty moan the sound of that always aroused him spurred him to quicken the pace he loved to watch her when she rode him the way her hair rained down off her shoulders so lush and dark he could see those flashes those flickers of pleasure on her face as she lost herself and when he took her breasts in his hands when he reared up to replace his hands with his hungry mouth she wrapped herself around him like a silky vine all clinging arms and legs so he could feast on her no matter how much she gave he wanted more go over he panted out the demand pressed his hand where they joined and found her drove her her moan came again a rusty sound of delight that pumped through his blood like good whiskey he felt her give and flood then sob again before her teeth closed over his shoulder so he let her set the pace now let her shudder back into control now she leaned over him her hair curtaining his face her hands braced on either side of it i want to make you crazy she lowered her head until her lips were a breath from his i want to make you beg her pace was slow torturous and her mouth took his in quick nipping kisses that gradually deepened and heated when his hands were fisted in her hair his breath heaving she released his mouth eased back quickened the rhythm skimmed her hands over him watched his eyes she saw what she wanted they were wild and blind and desperate mirroring the emotions raging inside her his hands had moved gripped her hips now gripped them hard shed have bruises branding she thought in triumph her body bowed back shuddered while bens fingers dug into her pumping hips she knew what to expect now that explosion of pleasure ramming into pleasure the assault on the system that could come like lightning or linger like dew yet still it was always a shock this violent intimacy and the need that always always bloomed she felt him erupt the final hard drive of him into her and the glorious burst of heat the orgasm struck like an arrow winging through her system and pinned to him filled with him she welcomed it willa ben drew her down so they could tremble slick flesh to slick flesh when he could speak more than her name he turned his lips to her throat ive wanted to hold you like this all night a little foolishness like that always warmed her and tied her tongue you were too busy eating to think about this im never to busy to think about this or you i do think about you he lost his hands in her hair as he turned her mouth to his more all the time and i worry about you worry beautifully relaxed she braced herself on her elbows and looked down at him she loved to find his face in the dark pick out feature by feature about what i dont like not being right on hand with all this going on i can take care of myself she brushed the hair back from his face funny she thought how the tips of it always looked as if theyd been dipped in wet gold dust funnier still how her fingers always itched to touch it these days and i can take care of the ranch yeah almost too well he thought but i worry anyway i could stay tonight weve been through that bess likes to pretend she doesnt know whats going on up here i like to let her and she kissed him before she rolled lazily to her back youve got your own ranch to run she stretched saddle up mckinnon im done with you think so he rolled atop her to prove her wrong when a man tiptoes out of a darkened house he mostly feels like a fool or very lucky nate was debating which course to take when he opened the front door and came facetoface with ben they stared at each other cleared throats nice night nate said one of my best ben gave up flashed a grin so whered you park your rig back of the pole barn you same dont know why we bother theres not a man on this spread who doesnt know what were up to with those women they stepped off the porch headed toward the barn i keep wondering if im going to get shot at adam and ham have this shift nate pointed out i try to time it that way theyre not so triggerhappy he glanced back toward the main house tesss window and it might be worth dodging a couple bullets i worry about a man who says that im thinking ill marry her ben stopped dead somethings buzzing in my ear i dont think i heard you right you heard me right enough shes banking on going back to california in the fall nate shrugged im banking she wont you tell her that tell tess amused at the thought nate let out a muffled hoot of laughter hell no you have to be cagey with a woman like that used to running the show so you make her think everythings her idea she doesnt know shes in love with me but itll come to her talk of love and marriage was making bens gut churn what if it doesnt come to her what if she packs up and goes you just going to let her cant lock her up can i nate took out his keys jiggled them in his palm but im betting she stays and ive got some time yet to work on it ben thought of willa and how hed react if she suddenly got it in her head to pull up stakes hed have her hogtied in record time dont think i could be as reasonable well push hasnt come to shove yet ive got court the next day or two he added when he climbed into his rig soon as im able ill swing by with that picture you do that ben paused by his own rig looked back toward the main house no he didnt think he could be reasonable if he was in love on the drive home he told himself several times that it was a good thing he wasnt t esse had it all worked out oh hed been willing to wait be patient be reasonable after all if he held out till fall he could sweep up a lot of money along with his wife but now the little bitch thought she could go off and marry that indian bastard hed studied on it and knew that if he let that happen legally hed get zilch so he couldnt let it happen if his aim had been a little more true hed have taken care of adam wolfchild already the opportunity had been there but the son of a bitch had gotten lucky and since wolfchild hadnt been alone jesse hadnt risked waiting around for another chance at him he was sure thered be another opportunity just a little window of luck was all hed need but spring work and that damn slave driver ben mckinnon kept him tied at three rocks while his adulterous wife was out buying wedding finery so if he couldnt get to wolfchild he would damn well get to lily hed have to make her sorry shed messed with him and ruined his plans for cashing in on her inheritance but that would be a pleasure hed hoped to cash in on a lot of things he thought as he drew another queen to go with his other two ladies but it was time to move on and he was taking lily with him isee your five jesse said smiling easily at jim across the poker table and bump it five too rich for me ned tucker tossed in his cards belched and got up to get a fresh beer he was comfortable at mercy he found willa a fair boss and enjoyed the company of the men he gave the bear the men had wrestled into the corner a rub on the head for luck not ned thought that it had done him a damn bit of good at the table that night he shook his head as jesse pulled in another pot sumbitch cant seem to lose he said to ham got enough luck to shit gold nuggets but ham decided to try his own deal me in this hand ive gotta take over for billy outside in an hour might as well lose some money first an hour jesse thought as he took his turn at deal billy and that knowitall college boy were on shift now neither one of them would be much challenge to him he would give the game another ten minutes then make his move he lost one hand folded on another then pushed back from the table deal me out gonna get some air make sure billy dont shoot you jim called out that boys minds on town pussy and he spooks easy oh i can handle billy jesse said and shrugging into his jacket he strolled out he checked the time hed studied the workings of mercy carefully enough to know that adam would be giving his horses a final look for the night the main house would be settled down and lily would be alone he took the colt out from under the seat of his rig you could never be too careful tucked it into his belt and moved through the shadows toward the pretty white house it would go like clockwork he mused lily would cry and plead but shed come easily enough she always did what she was told if not quick enough after the first smack he was looking forward to that first smack it had been much too long he tapped his belt moved quietly toward the rear of the house that you jc cheered by the prospect of company on his shift billy came forward rifle lowered and on safety you skinning the guys back at the bunkhouse again what are you doing out here jesse smiled at him slid the gun from his belt taking whats mine he said and smashed the butt of the colt down no reason to shoot you jesse said as he dragged billy into the bushes and it makes too much noise you just stay out of my way now or i might change my mind he crept to the back door quiet as a snake and looked through the glass and there she was sweet little lily he thought sitting at the table drinking tea and reading a magazine waiting for her indian lover to come stick it to her faithless bitch the rumble of thunder threw him off a moment made him look up at the starless sky even the weather was on his side he thought with a grin a nice rain would be fine cover on the trip south he turned the knob slowly stepped in adam theres an article in here about wedding cakes i wonder she trailed off her gaze still glued to the page but her heart thudding beans was growling under the table and she knew even before she gathered the courage to turn she knew keep that dog quiet lily or ill kill him she didnt doubt it he looked the sameþeven with the darker hair the length of it the mustache he looked exactly the same to her those beautiful eyes slitted mean his mouth frozen in a dangerous smile she managed to get to her feet put herself between jesse and the dog beans hush now its all right when he continued to growl she watched in horror as jesse took a gun from his belt dont please jesse hes just an old dog and theyll hear you theyll hear if you shoot people will come he wanted to kill something felt the urge bubbling up but he wanted it quiet more then shut him up now iþill put him in the other room you move slow lily and dont try to run he liked the feel of the gun in his hand the way the butt curled neatly into his palm ill hurt you bad if you do then ill sit right here and wait for that indian youve been spreading your legs for and ill kill him when he walks in i wont run she took beans by the collar and though his pudgy body was tense and he strained against her she dragged him to the door and through it please put the gun away jesse you know you dont need it guess i dont still smiling he slid it back in his belt come here this is no good jesse she struggled hard to remember everything shed learned in therapy to stay calm to think clearly were divorced if you hurt me again theyll put you in jail he laid a hand on the butt of the gun again i said come here closer to the door she thought there might be a way to get through she had to get through to warn adam everyone im trying to start over she said as she walked toward him we can both start fresh i never did anything but disappoint you andþ she cried out not in shock but in pain when he slapped her backhanded across the face ive been waiting to do that for more than six months and since it felt so good he did it again hard enough to send her to her knees ive been right here lily he gripped her hair yanked her to her feet by it watch mg you here the pain was too sickeningly familiar made it too hard to think but she did think of murder of madness youve been here oh god now the fear was paralyzing he used his fists she told herself just his fists he wouldnt rip people apart but all she saw when she looked in his eyes was blind rage now youre coming with me and youre going to be quiet and do just what i say in case she didnt understand his meaning he gave her hair another vicious yank you mess with me lily ill hurt you and anybody else that gets in the way he continued to talk his face close to hers in the other room the dog was barking wildly but neither paid attention were going to take a nice long trip mexico im not going with you she took the next blow reeled from it then shocked them both by leaping forward attacking with nails teeth fists the force of her headlong rush rammed him back against the counter and pain bloomed in his hip where it struck the edge he howled when she drew blood from his cheek too stunned to strike back until shed raked his face a second time fucking cunt he knocked her back into the table sent her pretty teacup flying the dogs howled like wolves and scratched madly at the door ill kill you for that ill fucking kill you and he nearly did the gun was in his hand his finger on the trigger vibrating but she was staring up at him not with fear not with pleading in her eyes but with hate is that what you want he dragged her up again held the barrel to her temple you want me to kill you there had been a time she might out of sheer weariness have said yes but she thought of her life here with adam with her sisters her home and family no ill go with you and wait she promised herself for the first chance to escape or to fight damn right you will he closed a hand over her throat shook her as blood stung his eyes i havent got time to make you pay now but you wait you just wait he was trembling as he pulled her to the door the shock of her hurting him actually hurting him until the blood ran down his face had rocked him badly the time hed wasted dealing with her when she could have come along docile as a cow left him jittery he barely noticed that it wasnt rain falling from that dark sky but snow while the thunder still raged thick heavy flakes danced in front of his eyes so that he didnt see adam until they were nearly facetoface and he was looking at a rifle let go of her adams voice was calm as a lake without any of the fury or fear rippling the surface lily step away from him jesse shifted his grip to her throat his arm over her windpipe the gun still in his hand was at her head there was no calm in him he was screaming shes my goddamn fucking wife get the hell out of my way ill kill her ill put a bullet in her brain he heard a gun cock and saw willa step forward coatless snow covering her hair take your hands off my sister you son of a bitch it was wrong everything was wrong and the panic made jesses finger tremble ill do it her brainsll be splattered on your shoes if you take one step you tell them lily tell them ill kill you here and now she could feel the steel pressed into her temple imagine the flash of explosion she could barely breathe through the grip on her throat to stay alive she kept her eyes on adam yes he will hes been here all the time hes been here jesses eyes fired he looked like a monster with the blood oozing down his face and his lips peeled back in a wide challenging grin thats right ive been here right along you want me to do to her what was done to the others you just stay in my way his lips curved in a dazzling smile he was in charge again he was in control maybe i wont gut her i wont lift her hair but shell still be dead so will you adam said and sighted i can snap her neck like a twig jesses voice rolled and pitched or put a bullet in her ear and maybe ill get lucky he increased the pressure on lilys throat so that her hands came up in defense to drag at the obstruction maybe ill get off one more shot right into your sisters gut hes bluffing adam willas finger twitched on the trigger she d put a bullet in his brain she thought grimly if lily would just move her head another inch just shift over an inch she could risk it but the damn snow was blowing like a curtain he doesnt want to die im a fucking marine jesse shouted i can take two of you out before i go down and lilys first yes lily was first you wont get away but adam lowered his rifle rage pride werent worth lilys life and youll pay for every minute shes afraid back off bitch he ordered willa and tightened his grip so lily s eyes rolled up white i can break her neck as easy as blinking helpless every instinct raging against it willa stepped back but she didnt lower the gun one clear shot she promised herself if she had one clear shot shed take it you get in the rig he pulled lily with him moving backward his eyes jumping from side to side get in the fucking rig behind the wheel he pushed her in shoved her across the seat keeping the gun high and in plain sight you come after us he shouted i kill her slow as i can start the goddamn thing and drive lily had one last look at adams face as she turned the key and she drove with hands that trembled willa lowered the rifle she hadnt taken the shot thered been a moment just an instant and shed been afraid to risk it god dear god theyre heading west think she ordered herself think the cops can put up a roadblock stop them if he tries for the main road if hes smart hell figure that and go into the hills we can be after them inside twenty minutes adam i let her go i let him take her willa gave him a hard shake hed have killed her right in front of us he was panicked and crazy hed have done it yes adam drew in a breath let it out now ill find them and ill kill him willa nodded once yes you call the police ill get the men those of us going into the hills will need horses and gear hurry she started off in a

scooted by her i dont know how bad hes hurt jesse cooke alarmed tess raced down the stairs what are you talking about hes got lily hes got her willa repeated overriding tesss babbled questions my guess is hes taking her into high country weve got a thunder blizzard in the works and she didnt even have a coat the first bubble of hysteria was her last as willa clamped down hard on emotion hes panicked and hes got to be half crazy more you call ben nate anyone else you can think of tell them we need a search party and fast were riding after them ill get warmer gear together tesss fingers stayed white on the newel post and for lily shell need it when we find her make it fast within ten minutes willa was organizing the men they were armed prepared to set out in rigs or on horseback with supplies to last two days he doesnt know the area like most of us she continued hes only had a few months and lily will throw him off slow him down as much as she can well spread out theres a chance hell take her up to the cabin so adam and i will head there the weathers going to make it rough on him but it isnt going to help us either well get the son of a bitch jim slapped his rifle into its sheath and well get him before morning there wont be any tracking in this so she trailed off as she saw bens rig drive recklessly into the ranch yard she wanted to buckle then needed to so she stiffened her spine so we spread out over a wide area you all have your targets the cops are covering the main roads and theyre sending more men search and rescue will be out at first light i want her back by then as for cookeþ she drew a breath whatever it takes let s move which are you taking it was the only question ben asked im going with adam up the west face toward the cabin he nodded im with you i need a horse weve got one im going too eyes ready to brim over with tears tess stepped next to adam i can ride youll slow us down goddamn you tess gripped willas arm and spun her around shes my sister too im going she can ride was all adam said he swung into the saddle and with his young hound beside him galloped off wait for nate willa ordered he knows the way she mounted quickly hell need someone to fill him in on the rest of it knowing she had to be satisfied with that tess nodded all right well catch up with you well bring her home tess ben murmured as he hoisted into the saddle whistled for charlie bring them both home tess said as she watched them ride away adam said nothing uniil they found the abandoned rig his mind was too dark for words his heart too cold they stopped long enough to look carefully for signs the rig was plunged to the wheel wells in snow leaning drunkenly against a tree the thick wet snow covered everything and the dogs scouted through it noses buried hed hit her adam wrenched open the driversside door terrified that hed find blood or worse there were bruises already on her face where hed hit her the rig was empty with a few drops of blood near the far door not lilys he thought cookes there was blood running down his face willa reminded him shed given it back in spades when adam turned his eyes were blank as a dolls i told her i promised her no one would ever hurt her again there was nothing you could do he wont hurt her now adam shes his only way out of this he wont do to her whatþ what he did to the others adam bit the words off buried the thought without another word he mounted and rode ahead let him have some distance ben laid a hand over willas he needs it i was standing right there too i had a gun on him im a better shot than adam better than anyone on mercy but it didnt do any good i was afraid to riskþ her voice broke and she shook her head what if youd risked it and shed moved jerked you might have hit her instead or she might be safe now if i had it to do over again id shoot the son of a bitch right between the eyes she made herself shake it off doubling back on it doesnt help either it could be hes heading toward the cabin the directions right enough hed think he could make a stand there willa swung onto her horse she tried to fight him this time maybe running would have been better lily would have run if she could have she was freezing her shirt soaked through but she would have taken her chances with the storm and the hills if running had been an option hed put the gun away but after she ran the rig into the tree he changed strategies shed aimed for the tree hoping the impact on his side would jar him enough to buy her a lead it had only earned her a headlong toss into the snow and then he tied her hands and looped the slack around his waist so that she was tethered to him she stumbled a lot deliberately at first to slow him down but he only jerked her upright again the snow was monstrous the higher they climbed the more vicious it became with bellowing bursts of thunder following the eerie skycracking lightning and the wind was so fierce she could barely hear him cursing her the world was whiteþswirling howling white he had a knapsack over his shoulders she wondered if there was a knife in it and what he might do to her in the end the cold had sapped her strength leached into her bones so that they felt like brittle sticks ready to snap fighting him was no more than a fantasy now running a fading hope where could she run when there was nothing but a blinding wall of snow all she could do was survive thought they had me didnt they he jerked the rope so she fell against him he had the collar of his sheepskin jacket turned up but still the wet snow snuck in and down his neck and irritated him your horseshit shoveler and halfbreed bitch of a sister thought they had the upper hand i got what i wanted he squeezed her breast hard through her shirt always did always will you dont want me jesse youre my fucking wife arent you took vows didnt you love honor and obey till death he pushed her into the snow for the hell of it and rode on the power of that theyll come after us but they dont know what theyre up against do they lily im a goddamn marine he could plow through this snow just like hed plowed through basic training he thought he could plow through anything and still kick ass ive been planning this for a long time he took out a cigarette flicked on the zippo hed turned up to maximum flame ive been taking the lay of the land ive been working at three rocks since i got here practically right on your skinny ass at three rocks for ben ben bigshot mckinnon he let smoke pour out between his teeth the same whos been bouncing on your sister lately ive given some thought to that myself he studied lily shivering in the snow shed be a hell of a lot more interesting in bed than you a fucking tree would be but youre my wife right she pushed herself up it would be too easy to just lie there and give up no im not no lousy piece of papers going to tell me different you think you can run out on me go to some freaking lawyer call out the cops they put me in a cell because of you i got a lot of payback coming he studied her again pale beaten his taking one last drag he flicked his cigarette into the snow you look cold lily maybe ill just take a minute or two to warm you up we got time he continued pulling the rope to drag her to him the way theyre going to be tripping over themselves trying to track me couldnt track an elephant in this he pushed his hand between her legs when all he saw in her eyes was revulsion he pushed harder until the first flicker of pain bloomed you like to pretend you dont like it rough but youre a whore like all the rest you used to tell me it was just fine didnt you thats just fine jesse i like what you do to me didnt you used to say that lily she stared into his eyes fought to ignore the humiliation of his hand on her i lied she said coolly she didnt wince from the pain as he dug into her wouldnt let herself castrating bitch i cant even get a hardon with you shed never used to backtalk him not after the first couple licks unsettled he shoved her back then shifted his pack no time for this anyway when we get to mexico itll be different changing directions he took her south she lost track of time and distance and direction the snow had slowed though the occasional boom of thunder still rolled over the peaks she put one foot in front of the other mechanically each step a survival she was certain now that he wasnt going to the cabin wondered where adam was where he was looking what he was feeling shed seen murder in his eyes at that last glimpse of his face he would find her she knew he would find her all she had to do was live until he did i need to rest youll rest when i say worried that hed lost his way in the storm jesse took out his compass who could tell where the hell they were going in this mess it wasnt his fault not much farther anyway he pocketed the compass and headed due east now just like a womanþbitch moan and complain never known you not to whine about something shed have laughed if shed had the strength left perhaps she had whined once upon a time about the paychecks that had gone missing the whiskey bottles the forgotten promises but it seemed a far cry from whining about dying of exposure in the rockies itll be harder for you if i collapse from exhaustion jesse i need a coat something hot to drink shut up just shut the hell up he stared through the dark and the lightly falling snow shielding his flashlight with his hand ive got to think he had his direction he had that all right but the distance was another matter none of the landmarks hed been careful to memorize seemed to materialize everything looked different in the dark everything looked the same it wasnt his fault are we lost she had to smile wasnt that just like him bigtalk jesse cooke exmarine lost in the mountains of montana which way is mexico and she did laugh weakly even when he whirled on her fists raised he would have used them just to relieve his frustration but he saw what he was looking for you want to rest fine this is as far as we go for now he pulled her again through a snowdrift that reached the top of her thighs and toward the mouth of a small cave this was plan b always have a plan b lily i scouted this place out more than a month ago and hed meant to lay in extra supplies just in case but hadnt had the chance hard to spot your indian isnt going to find you here it was still cold but at least it was out of the wind lily sank to her knees in relief delighted now that hed reached the next stage of his plan jesse shrugged off his pack got us some jerky in here bottle of whiskey he took that out first drank deeply here you go sweetheart she took it hoping that even false heat would slow the shivering i need a blanket so happens i got one you know im always prepared dont you he was pleased with the survival gear hed packedþthe food and the flashlight the knife the matches he tossed her a blanket amused when she gathered it awkwardly with her bound hands and struggled to wrap it around herself he crouched on the floor of the cave well get a little sleep cant risk a fire though i imagine those boys are way north of here he took out another cigarette god knew a man deserved a drink and a smoke after putting in a long day in the morning well head out i figure we get to one of these bumfuck towns and i can hotwire a car then were on our way to sunny mexico in celebration he blew smoke rings cant be soon enough for me he bit off a piece of jerky chewed thoughtfully montana sucks he stretched out his legs rested his back on the wall of the cave while she let herself drowse in the stingy warmth of the blanket im going to make me a pile of money down there i wouldnt have had to worry about that if youd behaved yourself your share of mercy that was big bucks for me lily and you had to fuck it up by thinking you could go off and get married were going to talk about that later a lot he took the bottle back and drank deeply again but a smart man like me one whos got luck at cards he can do just fine down there with those greasers she needed to sleep had to sleep to pull her strength back until adam found her until she could get away she curled against the side wall as far away as the tether would allow and wrapped the blanket tight around her he would drink now she knew the pattern he would drink until he was drunk and then shed have a better chance of getting away from him but she had to sleep it was closing in on her like a fog and the chills were racking her so hard she thought her bones would crack she listened to the whiskey slosh in the bottle as he lifted it felt herself drift why did you kill those people jesse why did you do all those things the bottle clinked sloshed he chuckled a little as if at a small private joke a man does what hes got to it was the last thing she heard him say on a cold windy ridge adam stood staring into the dark trying to see into it as he might a mirror the only relief from that dark was the strong beam of the flashlight in his hand and the beams behind him hes veered offfrom the cabin ben studied the sky measured the hours until dawn he wanted the sun damn it the morning might bring signs other than the scent the dogs were pursuing morning would bring the planes and his own brother would be up scanning every tree and rock hes got someplace else hes taking her adam kept his face to the wind as if it might tell him something anything he knows someplace else hed have to be past crazy to take the mountain on foot at night without a shelter the man who had ripped two people to pieces was past crazy ben thought grimly but it wasnt what adam needed to hear hes gone to ground somewhere well find him snows let up some storms moved east she wasnt dressed for a night in the cold adam stared straight ahead had to stare into the dark and make himself breathe no matter how his insides shook she gets cold at night bird bones lilys got little bird bones he cant be that far ahead of us because it was all he could do ben l laid a hand on adams shoulder left it there theyre on foot they have to stop and rest i want you to leave me alone with him when we find them i want you to take lily and will and leave him to me adam turned now and the eyes that were always so gentle so quiet were hard and cold as the rock on which he stood you leave him to me there was civilized ben thought and there was justice ill leave him to you from her post by the horses willa watched them she had lived and worked and survived in a mans world her entire life perhaps she understood better than most that there were times a woman couldnt cross the line whatever they spoke of wasnt for her and she accepted that what was between them on that ridge wasnt just between men but between brothers her sisters fate was in their hands and hers when they started back toward her she took lilys blouse and gave both dogs the scent fresh shuddering with excitement they whined and headed due south skys clearing she said as they mounted and adam rode ahead she could see stars just a sprinkle of them glinting through if the clouds move off well have a halfmoon and some light itll help ben gave her a quick study she rode straight as an arrow with no sign of flagging but he couldnt see her eyes not clearly enough you holding up sure ben he slowed a bit thinking she might be close to breaking need him to comfort you need a minute we can hang back no no damn it its been working at my mind for hours there was something familiar about the bastard something like id seen him somewhere before but it was dark and there was blood all over his face where lily must have scratched him she pushed her hat back suddenly irritated by the weight of it i dumped billy on bess so fast i didnt take time to ask him any questions i should have maybe wed have a better idea of his moves you had other things on your mind yeah but it nagged at her that memory that circled then dipped just out of reach doesnt matter now she settled her hat back on her head nudged moon into a quick trot finding lilys what matters finding her alive she thought but couldnt say it the cave was dark she was burning up then freezing then burning again tossed in fever and dreams and terrors her hands were cold sore to i l numbness at the wrists where the rope abraded her skin she curled tight into herself dreamed of curling tight into adam having his arm drape over her as it did during the night to pull her close and warm and safe she whimpered a little as the rocks scattered across the floor of the cave bit into her shoulder her back her hip every time she shifted she hurt but it was a distant pain a dream pain no matter how she struggled she couldnt quite bring herself to the surface of it when the light burned over the back of her eyelids she turned away from it she so wanted to sleep to drop away from everything she murmured a little as the fever began to brew inside her footsteps she thought dimly adams home hed crawl into bed beside her now his body would be a bit chilled but would warm quickly if she could just turn just wake enough to turn to him his mouth would be soft on hers and he would make love to her slow and sweet as he often did when he came in late from his shift they wouldnt even have to speak just sigh perhaps they wouldnt need words just touch and taste and that steady rhythm of bodies finding each other then sleep again as she started to drift again she thought she heard a scream cut quickly off like a mouse caught in a trap adam would take it away before she saw it he understood things like that sinking into unconsciousness she never felt the knife slip between her wrists to cut the rope or the heavy warmth of jesses coat spread over her but she said adams name as the man who stood over her blood dripping from his hands sheathed his knife it had been quick work and he regretted that he hadnt had time for finesse hed gotten lucky finding them before any of the others did luckier still to find the bastard drunk and stupid hed died easier than he deserved like a pig slaughtered with only one surprised squeal but hed taken the hair nonetheless it was traditional now and hed even thought to bring a plastic bag to hold it in case he got lucky hed have to leave the woman as she was for others to find or circle around stumble across the cave a second time when there was someone with him to make it seem all nice and proper he scanned the light around the cave again then smiled when it shone on a small stack of twigs well he could take time for that couldnt he a little fire close to the opening smoke to bring one of the search party along quicker what a picture theyd find he thought chuckling he simply couldnt help but laugh as he built the fire quickly set it to flame couldnt help but laugh as the flames danced over the body slumped against the wall of the cave and the blood pooling like a red river when he rode off he rode east zigzagging through the trees and picking his way down and up rock until he caught the flash of another searchers light all he had to do then was turn his mount and melt in among the men who fanned out over the hills looking to be heroes he was the only one who knew a heros work was already done see moke willa was the first to catch the scent her saddle creaked as she rose in it concentrated theres smoke and with it the first true tug of hope pulled at her heart adam up ahead i cant see it but its there he built a fire ben murmured stupid bastard though they hadnt discussed it they moved into a trot and now rode three abreast and the first thin light broke in the east i know this place adam we did some rock climbing in the ravine near here bens jaw tightened caves lots of little caves decent shelter i remember only the memory of the gun against lilys temple kept adam from breaking into a gallop his eyes had grown accustomed to the dark and they narrowed now against the gently growing dawn and they were sharp there he pointed ahead at the thin gray column of smoke just as charlies high frantic barking echoed found them before willa could speak ben blocked her mount with his stay here the hell i will do what youre told for once goddamn it he knew that bark it wasnt the excitement of a find it was the signal for a kill he could already tell from the set of her chin that she wasnt going to obey any order but she might listen to a plan hes armed ben reminded her maybe we can flush him if we do we need you back here with your rifle youre a better shot than adam damn near as good as me odds are hes not expecting we brought a woman so hell be focused on us because it made sense she nodded all right we try it that way first she looked over at adam as she pulled out her gun ill cover you he dismounted met bens eyes remember was all he said they parted there one to the left one to the right to flank the opening of the cave where the small fire was down to fading smoke willa steadied moon with her knees and waited watched them they moved in sync men who had hunted together since childhood and knew each others thoughts a hand signal a nod and the pace changed quick but not rushed her heart began to knock against her ribs as they neared the cave her breath caught in her lungs clogged there as she braced for the shattering sound of gunfire of screams or of the horrific sight of blood splattering over snow she prayed the words repeating over and over in her head in english in her mothers tongue then in a desperate mixture of both as she pleaded with any god who would listen to help then she drew a breath forced it out steadying herself she lifted her rifle and drew a bead on the mouth of the cave it was lily who stumbled out into the crosshairs my god she forgot her duty her post and kicked moon forward in a gallop lily was already in adams arms being rocked in the trampled snow when willa slid off her horse is she hurt is she all right shes burning up fever desperate adam pressed his face to hers as if to cool it even thoughts of vengeance vanished as she shuddered against him weve got to get her back quickly inside lily managed and burrowed into adam inside jesse oh god inside willas head whipped up and all the fear came roaring back ben she said his name the first time then shouted it as she ran toward the cave he was quick but not quite quick enough to stop her from getting in from seeing what was spread out on the floor of the cave get out he blocked her view with his body took her hard by the shoulders go out now but how blood a sea of it the gaping throat the split belly the brutal lifting of the trophy of hair who get out he turned her roughly shoved her stay out she made it as far as the opening then had to lean on the rock sweat had popped cold to her skin and her stomach heaved viciously she sucked in air each breath a rasping sob until she was sure she wouldnt faint or be sick her vision cleared and she watched adam bundling lily into his coat i have a thermos of coffee in my saddlebags it should still be warm willa straightened ordered her legs to hold her weight lets try to get some into her then well take her home adam rose lifting lily into his arms when his eyes met willas the sun flashed into them as it would on the edge of a sword hes already dead isnt he yes hes already dead i wanted it on my hands not like that you didnt willa turned and went to her horse willa paced the living room of adam s house she was useless in a sickroom and knew it but she felt worse than useless out of it theyd barely been back an hour and shed already been dismissed bess and adam were upstairs doing whatever needed to be done for lily ben and nate were dealing with the police and her men were taking the rest of the morning to recover after the long night even tess had been given an assignment and was in the kitchen heating up pots of coffee or tea or soup something hot and liquid anyway willa thought as she paced past the window again at least shed had something to do before streaking down from the high country to alert the police to call off search and rescue to tell bess to ready a sickbed now there was nothing but useless waiting so when bess came down the stairs willa pounced how is she how bad is it what are you doing for her im doing what needs to be done worry and lack of sleep made her voice sharp and testy now go on home and go to bed your own self you can see her later she should be in a hospital tess replied as she came in with a tray the bowl of soup shed been ordered to heat steaming in the center i can tend her well enough here fever doesnt break before long well have zack fly her into billings for now shes better off in her own bed with her man beside her bess snatched the tray away from tess she wanted both of these girls out of her hair where she wouldnt have to worry about them as well as the one upstairs in bed go about your business i know what im doing here she always knows what shes doing tess scowled after bess who flounced back up the stairs for all we know lily might have frostbite or hypothermia wasnt cold enough for either willa said wearily and we checked for frostbite anyway its exposure shes caught a bad chill and she s banged up some if bess thinks its worse shell be the first to send her to the hospital tess firmed her lips and said what shed been harboring in her heart for hours he might have raped her willa turned away it had been one more fear a womans fear that shed lived with during the long night if he had she would have told adam it isnt always easy for a woman to talk about it it is when its adam willa rubbed her gritty eyes dropped her hands her clothes werent torn tess and i think there was more on his mind than rape thered have been signs of it bess would have seen them when she undressed her shed have said all right that was one hideous little terror she could put aside are you going to tell me what happened up there i dont know what happened up there she could see it perfectly it was imprinted on her mind like all the others but she didnt understand it when we found them lily was delirious and he was dead dead she repeated and met tesss eyes like the others were pickles and that girl butþ tess had been sure that adam had killed him that they would put a spin on it for the police but that adam had done it that doesnt make any sense if jesse cooke killed the others i dont have any answers she picked up her hat her coat i need air willa tess laid a hand on her arm if jesse cooke didnt kill the others i still dont have any answers she shook her arm free go to bed hollywood you look like hell it was a weak parting shot but she wasnt feeling clever it felt as though her legs were filled with water as she trudged across the road she would have to talk to the police she thought she would have to bear that one more time and she would have to think to get her mind in order and think of what to do next too many rigs in the yard she thought and paused to study the official seals on the sides of the cars flanking bens truck if there had ever been a police rig on the ranch when her father had been alive she couldnt recall it she didnt care to count how many times one had been there since his death gathering her forces she climbed the steps to the porch and went inside by the time shed removed her hat hung it on the hall rack ben was coming down the stairs hed seen her from the office window watched her almost staggering progress toward the house her deliberate squaring of shoulders as she saw the police cars and hed had enough hows lily bess wont let anyone but adam near her willa took her coat off slowly certain that any sudden move would bang her aching bones together but shes resting good you can follow suit the police will want to talk to me they can talk to you later after youve gotten some sleep he took her arm and towed her firmly up the stairs ive got responsibilities here ben yeah you do when they reached the top of the stairs and she turned in the direction of the office he simply picked her up bodily and carried her toward her room the first is not to end up in a sickbed yourself let go of me i dont appreciate the cavernan routine neither do i he kicked her door shut behind him strode to the bed and dumped her especially when youre playing the cavernan she bounced up he shoved her down again you know ive got you outmuscled will im not letting you out of here until youve had some sleep maybe she couldnt outwrestle him but she thought she could outshout him ive got cops in my office a sister too sick to say two words to me a bunkhouse full of men who are speculating on just what the hell happened up in high country and a ranch nobodys running what the hell do you expect me to do let it all go to hell while i take a nap iexpectyoutobend shedbeen wronghecouldoutshouthertoothe explosion might have knocked her back if she hadnt already been down just once in your damn life bend before you break the cops can wait your sisters being taken care of and your men are too damn tired to speculate on anything but whos snoring the loudest and the ranch isnt going to fall apart if you turn off for a couple hours hegrabbedherbootwrencheditoffthenheaveditacrosstheroomshe reached for the second gripped the top in what would have been a comic struggle if his eyes hadnt been so raw with temper what the hell crawled up your butt she demanded just cut it out ben the second boot slid out of her fingers and went flying you think i didnt see your face when you walked into that cave that i dont know what it did to you or how you were holding yourself together by your fingernails all the way back down he grabbed her shirtfront and for a moment she was certain he intended to haul her off the bed and toss her after her boots im not having it she was stunned enough that she didnt react until hed unbuttoned her shirt and yanked it off her shoulders just take your hands off me i can undress myself when im ready youre an overseer around here mckinnon but you dont run my life and if you dontþ maybe you need somebody to run it he lifted her off the bedþclean off she thought in wonder as her feet dangled inches above the polished wood floor and she realized he was as furious as shed ever seen him and shed seen him redeyed furious plenty shed never seen him like this he added a quick teethrattling shake maybe you need to listen to somebody besides yourself now and again it was the shake that snapped it the humiliation of it if i do it wont be you and the only place youre going to be running is for cover if you dont turn me looseþ her hand was fisted and ready when he dropped her onto her feet take a swing at me he ground out the dare go ahead but youre going to bed if i have to tie you to the headboard she grabbed the hands that grabbed at her shirt im warning youþ he worked for me that stopped her stopped them both as they struggled with her thermal shirt what now her hands covered his dug in jesse cooke and her hands went limp as she remembered that day on the road to three rocks that pretty smiling face at the window of her rig theyd been that close as close as ben and she were now with only that thin shield of glass between them what would he have done she wondered if her door hadnt been locked her window up thats where i saw him she shuddered when she thought of how hed flashed that grin at her called her by name i couldnt put it together he was right there all along hes been here playing poker with the men right down in the bunkhouse playing cards she shook herself looked at ben and saw the weight he was carrying not anger so much as guilt she thought and she knew the sharp edge of it too well its not your fault she touched his face and her words were as gentle as fingertips you couldnt know no i couldnt know hed chewed over that until it had made him as ill as spoiled beef but it doesnt change it i had him work on shellys rig she had him in for coffeeþher and the baby alone with him he fixed my mothers bathroom sink he was in the house with my mother stop she did bend enough to put her arms around him to draw him down until he sat beside her hes done now hes done but its not he took her by the shoulders turning her so they faced each other on the edge of the bed whoever killed him willa works for you or for me i know that shed thought of it thought of it constantly on the racing ride back from the cave during her helpless pacing of adams living room maybe it was payback ben for the others maybe jesse killed the others and whoever found him did it for them lily wasnt hurt she was alone and sick but he didnt touch her and maybe one at a times enough for him will the chances that we ve got two men who do that with a knife are slim cooke carried a small boot knife a fourinch blade hardly bigger than a toy you dont do that kind of damage with an undersized blade no it all played back in her head no you dont then theres that first steer we found up toward the cabin no way he did that id barely signed him on he didnt know his way around high country then she had to moisten her lips theyd become so dry youve told all this to the police yeah i told them okay she rubbed her fingers dead center of her brow there wasnt a headache there yet just intense concentration we go on the way we have keep the guards the men working in teams and shifts i know my men she rapped a fist on her knee i know them the two new ones i just hired onþchrist i shouldnt have taken on any new hands until this was done you have to stop riding out alone i cant take a damn bodyguard every time ive got cattle to check you stop riding out alone he said evenly or ill use the old mans will to block you ill put down that i consider you incompetent as operator i can convince nate to go along with me what little color she had left drained out of her face as she got to her feet you son of a bitch you know goddamn well im as competent as any rancher in the state more he rose as well faced her ill say what i need to say and ill do what i have to do you butt against me on this you risk losing mercy get the hell out of here she whirled away balled fists at her sides just get the hell out of my house you want to keep it your house you dont ride out without adam or ham you want me out you get into bed and get some sleep he could have forced her down again it would have been easier than saying what he had to say i care about you willa ive got feelings for you and they go pretty deep it was harder yet when she turned and stared at him maybe i dont know what the hell to do with them but theyre there her heart hurt all over again but in a way she didnt expect threatening me is sure a damn fool way of showing them maybe but if i asked you nice you wouldnt listen how do you know you never ask nice he dragged a hand through his hair regrouped ive got to get through my day too worrying about yous putting a hitch in my stride if youd do this one thing for me itd make it easier this was interesting she thought when her mind was clear again shed have to ponder it do you ride out alone ben were not talking about me maybe ive got feelings too that was unexpectedþand something worth considering so he considered it sticking his hands in his pockets and rocking back on his heels do you maybe i dont want to punch you every time i see you these days so maybe i do his mouth curved up willa you do have a way of flushing a mans ego and then shooting it down lets take it forward a step he came toward her tilted her face up with his finger under her chin and brushed his lips against hers you matter to me some you matter to me too some she was softening he knew she wasnt aware of it but he was under different circumstances it would have been time to make gentle love to her perhaps say more perhaps say nothing because he knew that was just what shed expect he kissed her again let it deepen let himself sink into her into that sensation of intimate isolation her arms came up circled his neck her body went pliant as he gathered her closer the muscles he stroked kneaded began to relax under his hands this time when he lifted her onto the bed she sighed youd better lock that door she murmured we could have the cops in here get ourselves arrested he kissed her eyes closed as he unfastened her jeans he kissed her curved lips as he drew the jeans down her legs then he threw a blanket over her got up and lowered the shades her eyes were heavy smiling lazily as she watched him move back to her bend down touch that warm mouth to hers again get some sleep he ordered then straightened and strode to the door she popped up like a string you son of a bitch i love it when you call me that with a chuckle he closed the door steaming she plopped back on the pillows how was it he always seemed to outmaneuver her hed wanted her flat on her back in bed and by god thats just where she was it was mortifying not that she was staying in just a minute she would get up take a bracing shower then shed get back to work in just a minute she wasnt closing her eyes wasnt going to sleep if she did she was certain shed be back in that cave back in the horror but that wasnt the reason she assured herself as she struggled to force her eyelids open again it wasnt fear that was pushing her along it was duty and as soon as she got her second wind she was getting up to fulfill that duty she wasnt going to sleep just because ben mckinnon told her to especially since hed told her to she fell like a rock and slept like a stone rough winds do shake the darling hude nf mat þ þj j and summers lease harh all too short a date þshakespeare here wasnt a dish in the sink not a crumb on the counter or a scuff mark on the floor lily stared at the spotless kitchen adam had beaten her to it again she stepped to the back door through it the gardens shed planned were tilled with the hardier vegetables and flowers already planted adam and tess lily hadnt even gotten soil on her garden gloves and oh how shed wanted to she struggled not to resent it to remember that they were thinking of her shed been ill for two weeks and for another too weak to handle her regular chores without periodic rests but she was recovered now fully and growing weary of being worried over and pampered she knew the freezer was stuffed to overflowing with dishes that bess or nell had prepared lily hadnt cooked a meal since the night jesse had come through the door where she now stood looking out at the tender green buds on the trees feeling the gentle warmth of the may air on her face it seemed like years since that cold and bitter night and there were blank spots still areas of gray she didnt care to explore but she was to be married in three short weeks and her life was more out of her control than it had ever been before she hadnt even been permitted to address her own wedding invitations it had been discovered to everyones surprise that willa possessed the neatest handwriting among them so tess had assigned the job to willa with lily playing only a minor role theyd let her lick the stamps the flowers were ordered the photographer and music settled on and shed let them all of them lovingly step over and around her to handle the details it had to stop it was going to stop closing the door firmly at her back she marched toward the stables or she began in a march and ended up with dragging feet every time she ventured toward stables or pasture adam found a way of whisking her home again never touching her she thought or touching her so dispassionately it was more like doctor to patient than lover to lover he stepped out of the stables as she approached which made her think not for the first time that he had some sort of radar where she was concerned he smiled but she saw that his eyes remained sober and searching hi id hoped youd sleep longer its after ten i thought id work with a couple of the yearlings today on the lunge line theres plenty of time for that as usual he guided her away from the stables his hand barely touching her elbow did you have breakfast yes adam i had breakfast good he resisted picking her up and carrying her back to the house tucking her away where shed be safe and close did you finish that new book i brought you its a pretty morning maybe you could sit on the porch and read get a little sun i nearly finished it had barely started it it made her guilty knowing hed made a special trip into town to buy her books magazines the little candied almonds she was so fond of and she hated the book the magazines the almonds even the flowers he was constantly bringing home to cheer her ill bring the radio out for you and a blanket it can get cool when youre just sitting he was terrified shed catch a chill lie shivering in bed again with her hand limp in his ill make you some tea thenþ stop it the explosive shout stunned them both in the time he stared at her she realized shed never really shouted at anyone before it was a powerful and thrilling experience stop it adam im tired of this i dont want to sit i dont want to read i dont want you bringing me tea and flowers and candy and treating me like a piece of cracked glass lily theres no need to get upset youll make yourself sick again and youre barely out of bed for the first time in her life she understood the wisdom of counting to ten before speaking another time she decided she might even try it i am out of bed i would have been out of bed days before i was if you hadnt been hovering around me and i am sick im sick of not being allowed to wash my own dishes or plant my own garden or run my own life im sick to death of it lets go inside he treated her as he would a fractious mare with great patience and compassion you just need to rest with the wedding only weeks away youve got a lot on your mind that tore it she whirled on him i do not need to rest and i do not need to be placated like a cranky child and there isnt going to be any wedding not until i say differently she stalked off leaving him stunned speechless and staggered she rode on the temper the unfamiliar and exciting kick of it all the way to the main house up the stairs and into the office where willa was arguing with tess if you dont like the way im setting things up why the hell did you dump the job on me ive got enough to do without fussing with this reception im dealing with the flowers tess shot back im dealing with the catererþif you can call some bucktoothed jerk whose specialty is pigs in a blanket a caterer she threw up her hands then fisted them on her hips all you have to do is arrange for tables and chairs for the alfresco buffet and if i want striped umbrellas then the least you can do is find me striped umbrellas now willas fists rode her hips as well and she went nose to nose with tess and where in gods name am i supposed to come up with fifty blue andwhitestriped umbrellasþmuch less this canopy thing youre so hot for if youd just lily arent you supposed to be resting no no i am not supposed to be resting she was surprised sparks didnt fly from her fingertips as she marched to the desk and swept all the lists and folders and invoices onto the floor in an avalanche of paper you can toss every bit of paper that has to do with the wedding in the trash because theres not going to be any wedding honey tess broke out of her shock slid an arm around lilys shoulder and tried to nudge her into a chair if youre having second thoughtsþ dont honeyme lily wrenched away fuming and dont pretend you give me credit for having second thoughts when no one gives me credit for having the first ones its my wedding damn it mine and youve all just taken it over if you want to plan a wedding so badly then you get married ill get bess tess murmured and sent lily into a fresh tantrum dont you dare get bess and have her up here clucking over me the next person the very next person who clucks over me im slapping them i mean it you she jabbed a finger at tess you planted my garden and you she spun on willa you addressed my wedding invitations between the two of you youve taken everything and what slips through your fingers adam snaps up so quickly i cant even grab for it well fine willa threw up her hands excuse us for trying to help you through a difficult time i cant tell you how much i enjoyed getting writers cramp with this one here breathing down my neck i was not breathing down your neck tess said between her teeth i was supervising supervising my butt youve got your nose in everything and sooner or later someones going to pop you in it oh and that would be you i suppose shut up both of you just shut the hell up they did though their mouths hung open when lily lifted a vase and sent it flying the two of you can argue till your tongues fall out but not over my business not over me do you understand im not going to be used anymore im not going to be controlled im not going to be brushed aside i want everyone to stop looking at me as if im going to fall to pieces at any moment because im not im not lily adam stepped into the doorway he wasnt sure how to approach her now so he stood back and hoped a soothing tone would work i didnt mean to upset you if you need time toþ oh dont you start on me vibrating with fury she kicked at the papers scattered at her feet thats just what im talking about dont anyone upset lily dont anyone treat lily like a normal woman poor thing poor lily she might shatter she spun around so she could fire a stream of frustrated rage at all of them well im the one jesse abused he held a gun to my head im the one he dragged into the hills and kicked into the snow and pulled along on a rope like a dog and i got through it i survived it its about time you did too it was adam who shattered at the image that flashed into his brain what do you want me to do forget it pretend it never happened live with it i am you havent asked any questions her voice hitched but she steadied it no she promised herself she wasnt going to shatter and she wasnt going to cry maybe you dont want the answers maybe you dont want me the way things are how can you say that now she drew herself up made her voice as cool and reasonable as she could with her heart pounding so hard it hurt her ribs you havent touched me adam not once since it happened have you touched me she shook her head as willa and tess started to leave the room no stay this isnt just between adam and me thats only part of it you haven t talked about it either so lets talk about it now right now she wiped a tear from her cheek damn it that would be the last one that fell why havent you touched me adam is it because you think he did and you dont want me now i dont know how he stepped forward stopped his hands felt clumsy outsized as they had for weeks i didnt stop him i didnt protect you i didnt do what i promised you and i dont know how to touch you or why youd want me to she closed her eyes a moment why hadnt she seen that before he was the fragile one now he was the lost one you came for me she said it softly hoping he could understand just how much that mattered yours was the first face i saw when i stumbled out of that cave away from away from it you were the first thing i saw and thats one of the reasons i can live with it she took one unsteady breath tried again and found that the next one came more easily and all the time he had me i knew youd come that s one of the reasons i got through it and i fought back she looked at her sisters they too had to know how much it mattered i fought back and i held on just as you would have done he had the gun and he was stronger but he didnt have control not really because i didnt give up i drove into that tree to slow him down to make it harder for him oh lily undone tess sat down and began to weep oh god and when he tied my hands i kept falling down a calm settled over her now a calm that came from surviving the worst because that would slow him down too i knew he wouldnt kill me hed hurt me but he wouldnt kill me but then it was so cold and i couldnt fight back anymore but i held on saying nothing willa walked over poured a glass of water and brought it to tess lily took a deep breath she would finish now say it all everything that hadnt been said i thought he might rape me and i could survive that hed done it before but he wasnt in control this time and he was afraid every bit as much as i was maybe more when we got to the cave i was so tired and i knew i was sick nothing he did to me then would have mattered because all i had to do was get through it and get back here she walked to the window looked out and gathering her strength because she had gotten back she had made it through she turned around once l more he had whiskey and i took some because i thought it might help he drank a lot i fell asleep or passed out listening to him drinking and boasting just like he used to i listened to the whiskey sloshing in the bottle and in part of my mind i thought he might get drunk enough just drunk enough and i might be strong enough just strong enough to get away then someone came she crossed her arms over her chest hugged her elbows its not clear if any part of the ordeal still frightened her it was this the nebulous feversoaked memories i must have had a fever by then and i suppose i was delirious i thought it was you she told adam i thought i was home in bed and you were coming in sliding in next to me i could almost feel it and feeling it i fell asleep again and slept while whoever was there killed jesse and cut the rope on my hands i was only a few feet away butþ that quick highpitched scream that had snapped off she could still hear it if she let herself when i woke up she continued steadily jesses coat was over me there was blood on it all over it so much blood i saw him the light was just coming in through the opening of the cave and i could see him seeing jesse like that was worse somehow than when hed held the gun to my head the need to get away from him was worse every time i took a breath i breathed in the smell of him and what had been done to him while id been a few feet away sleeping and i was more frightened in those few moments than id been through all the rest of it she stepped forward just one step toward adam but then i crawled out into the sunlight and you were there you were there when i needed you most and i knew you would be purged she walked over poured a glass of water for herself im sorry i shouted at all of you i know everything youve done was out of concern but i need to take my life back now i need to go on you shouldve yelled sooner composed again tess rose youre right lily youre absolutely right about all of it i got carried away planning things for you im sorry id have hated being shoved to the background this way its all right its been a bad habit of mine to let myself be shoved and i might ask for help planting the rest of the garden maybe i should plant my own i didnt know id like it so much ill be downstairs she started out shot a telling glance at willa if you want to start taking things back willa said nudging the papers with her foot you can start by picking these up and getting them out of here she smiled i dont like hunting up printed cocktail napkins taking a chance she grasped lilys shoulders leaned in close so that her whisper could be heard hed have crawled through hell if thats what it took to get you back dont punish him for loving you too much easing back she glanced at adam youve got a couple hours off she told him to get your life straightened out walking out she closed the door behind her i must seem ungrateful lily began but he only shook his head so she crouched down and began to gather the papers i threw a vase ive never done anything like that before i didnt know id want to it was difficult to go back to feeling unnecessary im sorry i made you feel that way he crossed to her gathered papers himself he picked up the list of acceptances for the wedding then lifted his eyes to hers nothing in my life is more necessary than you or more precious if you want to call off the wedding no he couldnt be patient or reasonable about this all he could say was dont and nothing he could have said lily realized could have been more perfect after tess and will have gone to all this trouble that would be rude she started to smile nearly did but he covered his face with his hands covered it but not before shed seen the stricken look in his eyes and the hurt shed put there i let him take you no i thought he would kill you adam i thought if i touched you it would make you think of it of him no no adam never so it was she who held him never never im sorry im sorry i didnt mean to hurt you i was just so angry so frustrated i love you i love you i love you oh hold me adam i wont break but he might even as his arms came around her his grip tightened convulsively he thought he might shatter like thin glass i wanted to kill him his voice was muffled against her throat i would have and living with the wanting isnt nearly as hard as living with the fact that i didnt and worse is living with the thought that i nearly lost you im here and its over when his mouth found hers she poured herself into it her hands soothing him as he had always soothed her i need you so much and i need you to need me back he framed her face i do i always will i want to plant gardens with you adam and raise horses paint porches cupping his face in turn she drew his head back and said what was trembling in her heart i want to make children i want to make a child with you adam today staggered he lowered his brow to hers lily its the right time she lifted his hand pressed it to her lips take me home adam to our bed make a child with me today from the side wtndow tess watched lily and adam walk toward the white house it made her think of the first time shed seen them walk together on the day of the funeral check it out she called to willa what a little impatient willa joined her at the window then smiled thats a relief moments later the shades on the bedroom windows of the white house came down and she grinned looks like weve still got a wedding going i still want those striped umbrellas youre such a bitch ah thats what they all say will in a surprising move she laid a hand on willas shoulder are you still driving cattle up to high country tomorrow thats right i want to come very funny no i mean it i can ride and i think it might be an interesting experience one i can use in my work and since adams going lily should too its important that we stick together its safer that way i was going to have adam stay behind tess shook her head you need people you can trust adam wont stay behind even if you ask him so lily and i go too just what i need a couple of greenhorns but shed already thought of it herself and had weighed the pros and cons the mckinnons will be moving their herd up as well well take one man with us leave ham in charge of the rest better get your beauty sleep tonight hollywood we ride out at dawn the only thing missing tess thoucht as she yawned in the saddle at daybreak was the theme from rawhide so she hummed it to herself struggled to remember the words that were vaguely familiar only because of the bar scene in the blues brothers was it cut em in or head em out head em out was the obvious winner as that was exactly what willa called into the misty morning air it was rather magnificent tess mused the sea of cattle swarming forward the riders skimming the edges of the herd on horses fresh and eager all of them surged through the curtain of mists the lowlying river of fog tearing it into delicate fingers while the sun glinted off dewy grass and westward the mountains rose like gods all silver and white then willa turned in the saddle shouted out for tess to move her ass why tess thought with a grin that just completed a perfect picture belatedly she kicked her horse forward to catch up as the drive began no something was still missing she realized as the noise of hooves on hardpacked dirt of braying moos of riders clucking and calling filled the air nate for once she wished he had cattle as well as horses then maybe shed be riding along with him dont just ride willa called out as she trolled up alongside keep em in line you lose one you go after it like i could lose a big fat cow tess muttered but she tried to mimic willas herding whistle and the way her sister slapped her looped rope on the saddle not that tess had been given a rope or would know what to do with one but she used her hand then as the hundreds of marching hooves kicked up dust her bandanna oh for christs sake rolling her eyes willa circled back not like that you idiot you may need that hand she took the bandanna from tess who was holding it over her nose and after a few quick trips leaned over to tie it on thats an improvement she decided when it was secured and hung down over half of her sisters face never seen you look better just go play trail boss i am trail boss with that willa kicked moon into a gallop and rode to the rear of the herd to check for stragglers it was an experience tess decided maybe not quite like driving longhorns north from texas or whatever cowboys had once done but there was a kind of majesty in it she supposed a handful of riders controlling so many animals driving them along past pastures where other cattle watched the procession with bored eyes nipping potential strays back in with a quick movement of horse season after season she mused year after year and decade after decade in a manner that changed little the horse was the tool here as it had always been a fourwheeler couldnt travel the forests over the rivers up and down the rocky ravines the pastures of the high country were rich and so the cattle were taken up to graze on thick meadow grass to laze through the summer and into the early fall under the wide sky with eagle and mountain sheep and each other for company and summer was coming like a gift the trees gtew greener the pines lusher and she could hear the cheerful bubble of water moving quick and cool wildflowers dotted a near meadow a surprising shower of color teased out by the strong sun birds darted through the trees like arrows over the hills like kites and the mountains rose creamy white at the peaks with the deep green belt of trees darkening and the ridges and folds that were valleys and canyons shimmering shadowlike how you holding up jim paced his horse beside her and made her grin he looked as cocky and raw as anything that had ridden out of the wild west holding actually its fun he winked be sure to tell that to your back end at the end of the day oh i stopped feeling that an hour ago but she stretched up just to check no her butt was as dead as a numbed tooth ive never been up this high before its gorgeous theres a spot just up ahead you look out thatawayþhe gesturedþ ssit s a picture how long have you been doing this jim taking the herd up in the spring for mercy shit about fifteen years give or take he winked again saw willa riding up and knew shed give him the look that meant he was lollygagging keeps me outta pool halls and away from wild women he trotted back to point leaving tess chuckling dont fun with a cowboy on a drive willa told her we were having a short civilized conversation when i fun iþoh oh my god tess reined in her horse looked out in the direction jim had just indicated understanding willa stopped behind her nice view its like a painting tess whispered it doesnt seem real it couldnt be real the way the colors and shapes the size and scope all swept together the peaks shot up against the sky tumbled down to a wide silvery canyon where a river ran blue and trees grew thick and green somewhere along the way it seemed miles to tess the river took a curve and vanished into rock but before it vanished it spewed white crashed over rock then settled to serene a hawk circled in the distance arching around and around that curving river amid rugged rocks under spearing silver peaks above green trees good fishing there willa leaned on her saddle horn people come from all over hell and back to flyfish in this river me im not big on it but its a sight to see the way the lines dance and whip through the air and land with barely a sound or a ripple farther down around the curve theres some wild white water people plunk themselves in rubber rafts and have a high old time riding it ill stick with horses yeah but tess wondered what it would be like it surprised her that she wondered not in cool writers fashion but in hot thrilling anticipation of what it would feel like to chase that river to fly down it itll be here when we come back willa turned her horse montanas funny that way it mostly stays put come on were falling behind l l all right tess carried that view with her along with countless others as they drove the herd on the air cooled to a snap and patches of snow appeared under the trees around rocks and still there were flowers the sprawl of mountain clematis the sassy purple of wild delphinium a meadowlark sang a spring song when they stopped to rest the horses and grab a quick lunch jackets came out of saddlebags for christs sake dont tie your horse with another roll of the eyes for the greenhorn willa took the reins from tess gave her mount an easy slap that sent it trotting away what the hell did you do tess took two running steps before she realized the horse would outdistance her now what am i supposed to do walk eat willa shoved a sandwich in her face oh fine just fine ill have a little roast beef while my horse goes trotting back home hes not going far you cant go tying your horse up around here then wandering off to sit under a tree and have your lunch then she grinned as she spotted ben riding up hey mckinnon havent you got enough to do without looking for handouts thought there might be an extra sandwich he slid off his horse gave it the same absent pat as willa had given tesss speechless tess watched his mount mosey off what are you all crazy there wont be a horse left to ride at this rate ben took the sandwich tess held bit into it and winked at willa she try to tie hers up yep tenderfoot you dont tie horses up in high country he said between bites cats bears what are youþcats eyes popping tess spun around in a circle trying to look everywhere at once you mean mountain lions bears predators willa took what was left of the sandwich from ben finished it off a horse hasnt got a chance if its tethered how far backs your herd ben about a quarter mile butþ tess thought of her rifle that was still in her saddle holster what chance have we got oh fair to middling ben drawled and willa roared with laughter lilys probably got that coffee hot by now he tugged willas hat over her eyes how do you think i found you kid i followed the scent tess stood frozen to the spot as they wandered toward the little campeire where lily heated the pot at a faint rustle in the brush behind her she sprinted forward like a runner off the mark wait wait for me your sisters got a powerful love for coffee ben commented as tess barreled by you should have seen her face when i set her horse loose it was worth bringing her along just for that everything all right otherwise quiet she slowed her pace normal or as quiet and normal as youd expect with wedding plans gearing up i wouldnt like to see anything spoil that nothings going to she stopped completely now turned her back on the group by the fire so that she faced only ben i talked to the police again she said quietly theyre investigating my men every one of them mine too its necessary willa i know it i left ham back and it worries me not knowing he and bess woods two boys as far as it goes ben theyre alone ham can handle himself so can bess if it comes to that and nobodys going to him those kids will i wouldnt have thought so before now i just dont know i wanted nell to take them go stay with her sister for a while she wont leave wood of course if it is wood then she and the boys are probably safe playing back her own words in her head willa blew out a breath i cant believe what i think sometimes ben if its wood if its jim if its billy or one of your men ive known most of them my whole life and then i think maybe jesse cooke was the last of it maybe itll stop with him and we wont have to deal with it anymore thinking that ways like shoving pickles and that girl aside thinking that ways human he touched her cheek ive wondered if it might stop with cooke but you dont believe it no i dont believe it is that why youre here is that why youre driving your herd up the same day im driving mine hed been afraid it hadnt been a very subtle move and now he rubbed a hand over the scar on his chin you could say ive got an investment in you i look after whats mine her brows rose im not yours ben he bent down gave her a quick casual kiss look again he suggested and went after his coffee from tesss journal v driving cattle is in no way similar to driving a mercedes sswhich is a little something i believe ill treat myself to when i get back to the bright lights and big city driving cattle is an adventure perhaps akin to whizzing along the high way in a spiffy sports car you go places you see things and the wind is in your hair but it is also a painful business my butt is so sore ive got to sit on a pillow to write i suppose all in all it was worth it the rockies are a grabber absolutely evenfinding snow underfoot this late in the year couldnt spoil it the airs different in high country purer is the closest i can come to describing it its like the clearest of spring waters in fine crystal glass we stopped on a rocky plateau and i swear i thought i could see all the way to nates ranch it made me miss him a littleþwell more than a little an oddfeeling i cant recall ever missing a man before sex sure but thats a different matter in any case the cattle seem to drive themselvesfor the mostpart trudging along with only the occasional complaint adam says its because many of them have made the trip before and know the drill and the others just tag along still they make quite a noise with all that clopping and mooing and the occasional maverick has to be rounded up i watched will rope a cow and i was impressed the woman looks more natural on horseback than she does on her own two feet id have to say regal though id never say it to her her head s quite big enough as it is shes a natural boss and id have to admit thats a necessary attribute in her position she works like a stevedore again admirable but i dont appreciate her cracking the whip in my direction i suspect we meandered a bit on our way up i have to give her credit for that as well i have no doubt she lengthened the route for my and lily s benefit it was quite a trip we saw elk and mule deer moose bighorn sheep and huge gorgeous birds i did not see a bear i am in no way disappointed by this lily took rolls of pictures shes recovered so completely you could almostforget all the horror that happened to her almost i think of scales when i think of lily with her balancing tragedy and happiness on either end she s found a way to weight down that happiness end i admire that too butforgetting all the way just isnt possible beneath the tough focused exterior will is a bundle of nerves weve all homed in on the wedding all seem determined to have nothing spoil it but there s worry here its in the air on anotherfront im whipping through the rewrites on my script iras very pleased with the deal and the progress i expect to be inundated with meetings when i get back to la in the fall and lfinally decided to tell him about the book he was pretty jazzed which surprised me so i shot off the first couple chapters to him to give him a taste well see at the moment im squeezing in writing time between wedding preparations the showers coming up and we re all pretending lily doesn t know were planning one should be a hoot s o what are you men planning for the bachelor party tess sat on the corral fence at nates and watched him take a yearling through his paces something dignified of course how many strippers three any more isnt dignified he reined in backed the yearling up then squeezed gently with his knees the yearling broke into an easy trot thats the way smart boy look at him tess thought all lanky and lean with his hat pulled low and those long narrow hands as sexy as a concert pianists he quite literally made her mouth water i ever tell you how good you look on a horse lawyer torrence a time or two it still made heat crawl up his neck but you can tell me again you look good when am i going to see you in court surprised he circled the horse didnt know you wanted to neither had she well i do i like looking at you in your lawyer suit all sober and serious i like looking at you he slid off looped the reins around the rail and began to uncinch the saddle hasnt been much time for looking or anything else just lately has there busy time only ten days until the wedding and lilys parents are coming in tomorrow after things settle maybe you can take me into town let me watch you ride the court then we could stay in a hotel for the night and play she ran her tongue around her teeth wanna play with me nate your rules or mine no rules at all with a laugh she hopped off the fence and grabbed him into a hot lengthy kiss ive missed you have you that was progress he hadnt expected quite so soon that s nice she glanced toward the house thought of bed i dont suppose we could i dont think maria could stand the shock of that middle of the day and all maybe you could stay the night mmm wish i could but im already awol and i dont like to stay away long after what happened his eyes went cold as he turned to lift the saddle off the yearling i wish id been there sooner that night to back adam up it wouldnt have mattered there was nothing adam or will could do to stop it nothing you couldve done if youd been there maybe not but hed had some bad moments thinking of it imagining it wondering what he would have done if it had been tess with a gun at her head because the light had gone out of her eyes as well he moved on impulse and swung up on the horses bare back come on take a ride with me without a saddle she blinked then laughed and stepped back i dont think so i like having the horn to grab onto tenderfoot he held out a hand come on you can grab me intrigued but wary tess eyed the horse hes awfully big for a yearling just a baby and anxious to please nate cocked his head and waited for her to take the offered hand all right but i really hate falling off she let him grip her hand and with little grace clambered on behind him different she decided but found a definite advantage in being able to snuggle close behind nate her arms circling his waist sexy adam rides bareback quite a lot he looks like a god nate chuckled clucked the horse into a walk puts you more in tune with your mount it also tess realized when they slid into a trot put her more in tune with her lust and when they smoothed out into a gallop she was grinning like a fool this is great more thats what you always say he circled the corral again enjoying the sensation of those firm generous breasts pressed into his back his eyes crossed when she slid her hands down below his belt figured as much she said when she found him hard ever do it on horseback nope the idea provided a fascinating visualþtess laid back in front of him on the horses neck her legs wrapped tight around his waist as they mated to the rhythm of the horse wed break our necks when he caught the scent of sex and bucked us off im ready to risk it i really want you nate he stopped steadied the horse then turning hauled her in front of him with a great deal of gasping and groping no he could barely get the word out of his busy mouth as her fingers zoomed in on his belt buckle thisll have to hold us for now just hold on to me tess just hold on and let me kiss you awhile she would have been reckless but he held her close pinning her arms to her sides as he assaulted her mouth her hat fell off landed in the dirt and her heart went wild the echoes of it pounding everywhere at once then it changed everything changed and became gentle sweet pure as the air in high country from desperation to tenderness he eased her until her pulse slowed and went thick until her throat ached from it and her eyes stung i love you he hadnt meant to say it but it was too much too huge to keep trapped inside his lips formed the words against hers slowly what dazed dreaming she stared into his eyes what did you say im in love with you she dropped out of her floaty state and hit reality with a thud shed heard the words before they were easy for some to toss off just another line but not from him she realized not from a man like nate thats getting a little carried away she wanted to smile keep it light couldnt nate were just lovers he added and didnt bother to curse himself for finishing her sentence convenient bed partners no were not tess she took a steadying breath and spoke firmly i think wed better get down instead he took her chin in his hand so that her eyes stayed level with his im in love with you have been for a while now ill make what adjustments i have to to make it work for you but it comes down to this i want you to stay with me marry me raise a family with me here the first shock paled beside the rest of it you know i cant possiblyþ you got a while to get used to the idea with this he dismounted theres not much ive wanted in life he said studying her stunned face my law degree this place a good string of horses i got them now i want you it helped she thought the unmitigated insult and arrogance of that helped shift shock into temper you may want to take notes lawyer torrence im not a law degree a ranch or a brood mare no youre not a smile flirted around his mouth as he plucked her off the horse youre a woman a toughminded ambitious and frustrating woman and youre going to be mine would you care to hear what i think of this sudden cowboy mentality of yours ive got a pretty good picture he slid the bridle off the yearling slapped its flank to send it trotting away youd better get home take some time to think it through i dont need time to think it through ill give it to you anyway he looked up at the sky the sun was just beginning to drop toward the western peaks blushing red against blue going to rain tonight he said it casually as he leaped over the fence and left tess gaping after him don tknow whatbursupyourbutt willa muttered butyank it out lilys going to be back here with her folks any minute youre not the only one whos allowed to have things on her mind tess crammed a petit four in her mouth the house was full of chattering women gaily wrapped gifts and white streamers it had been tesss idea to serve champagne punch for the wedding shower and though bess had clucked her tongue over it for the sake of form she was enjoying a cup herself while she gossiped with neighbors everybodys happy as clowns tess thought and snagged another petit four celebrating the ridiculous idea of two people chaining themselves together for the rest of their lives she pouted debated another cake then went for a cigarette instead no way was nate torrence going to make her split another pair of jeans she grabbed a cup of punch and decided to get drunk instead by the time the bridetobe came in tess had gulped down three cups and was feeling more celebratory she got a kick out of the way lily feigned surprise the shower hadnt been a secret since the first invitation had been sent now there were gifts to be oohed and aahed over everything from whisk brooms to peignoirs tess watched lilys mother blink back tears and slip outside an interesting woman tess decided pouring herself another cup attractive well presented well spoken what the hell had she ever seen in a son of a bitch like jack mercy when bess poured two cups and slipped out too tess shrugged and tried to work up the proper enthusiasm for a set of embroidered napkins here you go adele bess settled herself on the glider handed adele a cup while the woman dabbed at her eyes been some time since we sat here i didnt know how i would feel coming back its hardly changed oh here and there you havent changed much yourself vanity was a small weakness and adele automatically touched a hand to her carefully groomed hair it was cut sleek and short kept a subtle shade of deep blond lines she said with a weak laugh i never know where they come from but there are new ones in my mirror every morning just life bess took stock adele still had a pretty almost delicate face the features small and well proportioned shed kept in shape too bess mused trim easing toward lanky and her eye for color and line hadnt changed either she looked good in the rosetoned slacks and ivory blouse youve got a fine daughter adele you did a good job with her i couldve done better i should have seeing her now i look back to when she was a little girl the hours i should have spent with her that i didnt you had work and your own life too i did to soothe herself adele sipped her drink and a lot of pain the first few years anyway i hated jack mercy more than i ever loved him bess thats natural he didnt do right by you or the girl but id say you found the better man rob hes a good man set in his ways he always has been but theyre good ways her lips softened theyd had a good life she thought robs not well overtly affectionate but he loves lily i wonder now if we didnt expect too much from her if we both didnt but we love her it shows she rocked awhile in silence god the view ive never forgotten it i missed this place ive been happy back eastþthe green the gentleness of the land but i have missed this place youll come back now that lilys living here yes well come back robs enchanted he loves to travel weve avoided this part of the country but now hes down with adam looking at the horses she sighed smiled hes a good man too isnt he bess lilys adam one of the finest i know and hed walk through fire for her shes been through so much when i think about itþ dont bess covered adeles hand with hers its behind her now just like jack mercys behind you shes going to be a beautiful bride and a happy wife oh it brought the tears again they were falling down her cheeks when willa stepped out excuse me automatically she started back inside no dont sniffling adele rose reached out a hand im just being sentimental i havent had a chance to really talk to you every letter lily wrote me was full of you and tess a womans tears always disarmed her willa shifted tried to smile im surprised there was room with adam in there you have the same eyes you and your brother dark and wise adele thought and steady i knew your mother a little she was a beautiful woman thank you ive been frightened adele cleared her throat i realize this isnt a good time to bring it up but ive been so worried i know lily toned down a great deal of whats happened here in her letters and calls to me but when jesseþwhen those things happened with jesse there were reports back east i wanted to say that im still worried but i feel easier now that ive met you and adam shes stronger than you think than any of us thought you may be right adele agreed then braced herself and i want to thank you for your hospitality for inviting rob and me to stay here in your home i know it must be awkward for you i thought it would be its not my sisters parents are always welcome at mercy not much of jack in you adele paled appalled at herself im sorry dont be willas eyes shifted as she spotted the gleam of sun on chrome and her lips curved slowly and here comes the next surprise she flicked a glance at adele i hope this ones not awkward for you what have you done girl bess asked willa only continued to smile and poked her head back inside hey hollywood come on out here a minute what carrying a cup in one hand tess wandered to the door were playing parlor games how many words can you make out of honeymoon i think im ahead theres a basket of bath stuff riding on it ive got a better prize for you tess looked over cleared her fuzzy eyes enough to recognize nates rig as it pulled up dont wanna talk to him now arrogant cowboy lawyer just tell him im oh jesus bleeding christ dont you blaspheme at a wedding shower bess ordered then popped up with a milewide grin as the side door of the rig opened and a vision burst out louella mercy as i live and breathe youre a sight for sore eyes im a sight period with a braying laugh louella raced forward on red stiletto heels and embraced her staggered daughter surprise baby she kissed tess smudged away the smear of lipstick from her cheek then whirled to catch bess in a bear hug still kicking butt around here as best i can and this must be jacks youngest she twirled to willa squeezed hard enough to crack her ribs lord you look just like your mama never saw anyone to match mary wolfchild for straight good looks iþthanks dazzled willa only stared why the woman looked like a glamour queen and smelled like a perfume counter im so glad you could come she added and meant it im so glad to meet you that goes double for me honey couldve knocked me over with a feather when i got your letter inviting me out keeping an arm tight around willas shoulders she turned and beamed at adele im louella wife number one a little stunned adele stared was the woman actually wearing a gold lame blouse in the middle of the afternoon im lilys mother wife number two with another earsplitting laugh louella embraced adele like a sister well the bastard had good taste in women didnt he wheres your girl must take more after you than jack as tess tells me shes pretty as a picture and sweet as they come ive got presents should i take them in for you louella at the base of the steps nate stood grinning louellas wriggling pocket dogs in his arms focusing on him fully for the first time tess all but writhed in horror oh god mom you didnt bring mimi and maurice of course i did couldnt leave my precious babies at home all alone she took them from nate and made kissy noises is this a prime hunk ladies she gave nate a proprietary kiss on the cheek and left a clear imprint of her lips behind i swear my hearts been going pittypat ever since i laid eyes on him you just take everything right on inside sweetie yes maam he shot tess a quick amused look before he turned back to unload the rig so what are we all doing out here louella demanded i hear theres a party going on and i could sure use a drink you dont mind if i take a look around the place do you willa not at all id love to show you around myself nate louellas things go in the room next to tesss the pink room wait until mary sue sees you bess began as she led louella inside you remember mary sue rafferty dont you is she the one with the buck teeth or the one with the lazy eye carefully tess set her empty cup on the porch rail your idea mine and lilys willa beamed we wanted to surprise you you did you definitely did and well have a nice tik about it later tess grabbed willa by the shirtfront a nice long talk about it okay im going to make sure she gets that drink your ma sure packs for the duration nate hauled the last of five suitcases out of the back of the rig each one of them weighed like a yard of wet concrete she packs nearly that for a weekend in vegas she sure makes a statement mortification aside tess squared her shoulders and prepared to defend her mother meaning meaning shes right there no pretenses its all louella after five minutes i was crazy about her curious he angled his head what did you think i meant she moved her tense shoulders but couldnt quite relax them people have varying reactions when it comes to my mother he nodded slowly apparently you do you ought to be ashamed of yourself and while she was gaping he carried two of the suitcases past her with a snarl tess hauled one up herself and followed him just what was that supposed to mean she huffed her way up the stairs louella didnt believe in packing light i mean youve got one in a million there he set the cases on the bed turned and walked out tess dumped the third case on the bed flexed her arms and waited i know what ive got she said the minute he walked back in with the rest of the luggage shes my mother who else would come to a wedding shower in montana wearing capri pants and gold lame oh wipe that lipstick off your cheek you look like an idiot she struggled with the straps of a suitcase flipped the top back and rolled her eyes at the contents who else would pack twenty pairs of high heels to spend a couple weeks on a cattle ranch and this she pulled out a sheer lavender robe trimmed in purple feathers who wears things like this he eyed the robe as he tucked his bandanna back in his pocket suits her youre too concerned with appearances tess thats your biggest problem with appearances for gods sake she paints her dogstoenails she has concrete swans in her front yard she sleeps with men younger than i am and i imagine they consider themselves lucky he leaned against one of the beds four posts zack flew her to my spread and nearly wrecked his plane he was laughing so hard he told me she kept him howling since they took off from billings she asked me if she could come back and see my horses later she wanted to see them but she couldnt wait to get here and see you first thirty seconds after she hugged the life out of me we were friends she talked about you most all the way here made me tell her half a dozen times that you were all right safe happy i guess it took her about ten miles to figure out i was in love with you then i had to stop so she could fix her makeup because it made her cry i know she loves me and she was ashamed i love her its justþ im not finished nate said coolly she told me she didnt hold anything against jack mercy because hed given her something special and having you changed her life it made her a mother and turned her into a businesswoman she was glad to be coming back to take another look to meet your sisters to see you here and know you were getting what you had a right to he straightened kept his eyes on hers so ill tell you what my reaction is to louella mercy tess pure admirationþfor a woman who took a kick in the face and stood right back up again who raised a daughter on her own made a home for her ran a business to see that her child never went without who gave that daughter backbone and pride and a heart i dont care if she wears cellophane to church and neither should you he walked out on her tess sat on the edge of the bed feeling a little drunk and very weepy carefully she laid the robe over the bed then rose and began to unpack for her mother when louella bounced in fifteen minutes later the chore was nearly half done what in the world are you fooling with this for were having a party you never finish unpacking i thought id give you a head start dont fuss with it now louella grabbed her hands im working on getting bess plowed shell sing when shes plowed really tess set aside a sundress in eyepopping cerise i wouldnt want to miss that then she turned and laid her head on louellas shoulder a shoulder she thought that had always been there without question without qualification im glad to see you mom im glad you came her voice hitched really glad whats all this i dont know tess sniffed and stood back stuff things i dont know its been a scary time for you louella took out a lacetrimmed hanky and dried her daughters face yeah in a lot of ways i guess im shakier than i realized ill get through it of course you will now come on down and join the party with her arm around tesss waist louella started out later well pop open a bottle of french bubbly and catch up id like that tesss arm slid around louellas waist in turn id like that a lot then you can fill me in on that long cool drink of water youve got your eye on nate doesnt like me very much right now it was going to make her weepy again to think of it im not sure i like me very much either well that can be fixed louella paused on the stairs listened to the sounds of women i like both of you i should have asked you to come tess murmured i should have asked you to visit months ago it shouldnt have been willa inviting you partly i didnt because i thought youd be uncomfortable and partly i didnt because i thought i would be im sorry sweetie you and me were as different as budweiser and moet doesnt mean they dont both have their points god knows ive scratched my head over you as often as youve scratched yours over me louella gave tess a quick squeeze listen to that hen chatter reminds me of my chorus girl days ive always had a fondness for women carrying on cant be uncomfortable with that or with a wedding in the works and i sure do like your sisters honey so do i tess firmed her chin nothings going to spoil the wedding for us he was thinking the same thing he could hear the sound of womens laughter of womens voices pretty as music it made him smile he liked to think of lily inside in the center of it soft and sweet shed be dead if not for him and hed been hugging his secret heroics to his heart for weeks hed saved her life and he wanted to see her married when those pretty images paled he could always bring the picture of what hed done to jesse cooke to the front of his mind sometimes he liked to fall asleep with that replaying through his head a fine colorful dream scented with blood hed been very careful since then and when the lust for killing became overpowering he cooled it in the hills and buried his prey it was odd how much stronger that lust was now more than the need for food for sex soon he knew soon it wouldnt be satisfied by rabbit or deer or a calf from pasture it would have to be human but he would hold it back he would control it until after lily was safely married he was bound to her now and where he was bound he was loyal he feared she was worried that something would happen but he had fixed that as well hed printed the note with great care pondered the words like an exercise now that he had written it now that he had slipped it under her kitchen door he was lighter of heart she wouldnt worry now she would know someone was looking out for her now he could relax and enjoy the sounds of the female ritual now he could dream of wedding bells that would herald the breaking of his fast for blood as the sky washed with red over the western peaks and the party broke up some of the women who drove past waved he lifted a hand in return and he wondered whom he would choose to hunt when the time was right l i think you should see this her brow arched willa took the sheet of notepaper from lilys hand shed been ready to turn in after a long day of socializing when lily had come to her room it took only the first glance to wash the fatigue away i dont want you to worry i won t let anything happen to you or adam or your sisters it i had known what jc was up to i would have killed him soonerbefore hescared you you can resteasy now and have a nice wedding ill be there looking out for you and yours best wishes a friend christ the chill sent a shudder through her how did you get this it was under the door in the kitchen you showed it to adam yes right away i dont know how to feel about this will the person who sent this killed jesse and the others she took the paper back from willa folded it yet he seems to be trying to reassure me there s no threat here and yet i feel threatened of course you do he was practically in your house she began to pace her stockinged feet soundless goddamn it goddamn it were back to the center again this was put there today dozens of people coming and going it could have been anyone no matter what i do i cant narrow it down he doesnt mean to hurt me or you or tess lily drew a calming breath or adam im holding on to that but will hell be at the wedding hell be there youre to let me worry about this i mean it she continued putting her hands firmly on lilys shoulders give me the note ill deal with it see that it gets to the police youre getting married in a few days thats all you have to think about im not going to tell my parents i thought about it talked it over with adam and decided not to tell anyone but you whoever you think should know is fine with me but i dont want to upset my mother and father this wont touch them willa took the note set it on her dresser lilly the wedding means almost as much to me as it does to you ive got i guess you could say a double interest she tried to smile but it wouldnt quite gel not everyone can say their brother and sister are getting married at least not in montana just concentrate on being a bride itd mean a lot to me im not afraid i dont seem to be afraid of much anymore she pressed her cheek to willas i love you yeah same goes she closed the door behind lily then stared at the folded note what the hell was she going to do now the answer wasnt going to bed for a good nights sleep instead she picked up her boots and walked to the phone ben yeah yeah we saved you some cake listen i need a favor you want to call that cop whos working this case and ask him to meet me at your place i have something i need to show him and i dont want to do it here no she cradled the phone between her ear and shoulder tugged on a boot ill explain when i get there im on my way i dont have time for that she said when he started to argue ill lock the doors of the rig and carry a loaded rifle on the seat but im leaving now she hung up before he could shout at her sdamn stubborn pigheaded woman willa had stopped counting the number of times ben had called her that or a similar name over the past two hours it had to be dealt with and its done she appreciated the wine hed poured her though it had been a surprise she hadnt thought ben went in for wine or that he would be playing host after the session with the police id have come for you you damn near did she reminded him you were nearly halfway to mercy when i ran into you i told you id be all right you read the note yourself it wasnt a threat the fact that it was written at all is threat enough lily must be frantic no actually she was very calm more concerned that her parents not be upset by it were not telling them about it i guess ill have to tell tess shell tell nate but thats as far as well take it she sipped again while he paced she supposed his quarters suited a muscleflexing type of man the walls were paneled in honeytoned wood the floors matching and uncluttered by carpet or rug the furniture was big heavy and deeply cushioned in unadorned navy there wasnt a single fussy pillow or feminine knickknack in sight there were though framed photos of his family crowding the pine mantel over the fireplace a set of antique spurs and a pretty hunk of turquoise on a shelf where books leaned against each other drunkenly there was a hoof pick tossed on a table along with a bonehandled pocketknife and some loose change simple basic ben she decided then decided further that she had let him pace and complain long enough i appreciate you helping me handle this right away we could get lucky and the cops could do cop things with the note and figure out who wrote it sure if this was a paramount production well its the best i can do for now she set the halffull glass aside and rose ive got a wedding in less than a week and a houseful of company soþ where do you think youre going home like i said ive got a houseful of company and morning comes early she took out her keys he snatched them out of her hand look mckinnonþ no you look he tossed her keys over his shoulder and they rattled into a corner youre not going anywhere tonight youre staying right here where i can keep an eye on you ive got the midnight shift he merely picked up the phone punched in numbers tess yeah its ben willas here shes staying call adam and tell him to adjust guard duty accordingly shell be back in the morning he hung up without waiting for an assent done you dont run mercy ben or me i do she took a step toward her keys and found the room revolving as she was slung over his shoulder what the hells gotten into you im taking you to bed i handle you better there she swore at him kicked and when that failed wiggled into position to take a bite out of his back he hissed through his teeth but kept going girls bite he said when he dumped her on his bed i expected better from you if you think im going to have sex with you when you treat me like a maverick calf youre dead wrong his back throbbed where her teeth had dug in just enough to make him mean lets see about that he shoved her back pinned her and handcuffed her hands over her head fight me it was a pure dare delivered in steel tones we never tried that before i might like it you son of a bitch she bucked twisted and when he lowered his mouth to hers bit again he rolled with her careful to keep her handsþand nailsþaway from his exposed flesh her aim with her knee was off just enough to make him grateful close enough to make him sweat he used his free hand to rip her shirt then the thin cotton beneath but didnt touch her it was the grapple the excuse for violence he thought they both needed to scare away the fears and when she lay still beneath him panting her eyes closed he thought he knew what they both needed next turn me loose you coward ill tie you to the headboard if i have to willa but youre staying and when were done youll sleep really sleep he touched his lips to her temple then her cheek her jaw in a sudden shift to tender let me go he lifted his head her hair was tumbled over the dark green corduroy spread of his bed there were flags of angry color riding high across her cheekbones her eyes burned so hot he was surprised his skin didnt blister i cant he lowered his forehead to hers wondering if either of them would be able to accept it i just cant his mouth found hers again quietly slowly deeply until she felt something inside of her quake to the point of shivering apart dont she turned her face away tired to struggle back to level dont kiss me that way its rough on both of us he turned her face back saw her eyes were damp and dark now the heat burned out of them it may get rougher yet his mouth met hers again lingered so that the shock swept through him god i need you will how the hell did this happen he dragged her where he was bound to go making her head reel and her heart break open to pour out secrets shed kept even from herself she sobbed out his name then simply lost her grip on the slippery ledge shed clung to for longer than shed known when he lifted his head again she stared into his face one shed known her whole life and saw fresh and new let go of my hands ben she didnt struggle didnt shout but only said again let go of my hands so he did gentling his grip then releasing it when he started to lever himself away those hands came to his face framed it and brought him back kiss me again she murmured the way i told you not to so he did deepening the moment then drowning in it he pushed aside her tattered shirt to find her claim her his hands sure and slow she surrendered to it the sensation of those hands gliding scraping stroking gave in to it the taste of that mouth drawing and drinking from hers yielded against it the heat of that body the hard angles pressed into the curves of hers whatever he wanted tonight she would give whatever he seemed to need shed find the quiet unspoken desperation seeped from him into her and the pleasure of knowing she possessed whatever it was he searched for the violence was spent now there were only sighs and murmurs the whisper of flesh sliding over flesh the quick moans of surprised delight the moon rose unnoticed and the night birds sang to the light wind gentle with full spring teased the curtains and wafted like water over their heated skin there was the long long groan of that first lazy climax one that shimmered through her as silver as the moonlight and left her glowing he drew her up so they were torso to torso so that he could lose his hands in her hair sweep the weight of it back from her face when her lips curved so did his he held her like that just held her with their hearts pounding together her head on his shoulder his hands in her hair and still holding her he laid her back and slipped inside her slow and deep so that each thrust was like a velvet slap he watched her come watched it happen the darkening eyes the trembling lips the sudden racking shudder the silky movements quickened driving them both toward the brink this time when she fell he let her drag him with her it was a perfect day for a wedding laced with warm breezes that teased the scent of pine down to the valley stirred the perfume of the potted flowers tess had ordered arranged in banks around the porches and terraces of the main house adam and lilys house even the outbuildings there wasnt a hint of rain or the hail that had come so fiercely fortyeight hours before and sent tess and lily into a tailspin of worry the willow tree by the pond that jack mercy had ordered built stocked with japanese carp then forgotten was delicately green there were tables with striped umbrellas a snowy white canopy to shade the wedding feast and a wooden platform that the men had cheerfully constructed to stand as a dance floor it was a perfect day willa mused if she ignored the fact that cops would be sprinkled among the guests gosh look at you mistyeyed willa reached up to adjust the tie of adams tux you look like a picture out of a magazine unable to keep her hands off him she brushed at his shirt ont big day huh the biggest he caught a tear off her lashes pretended to put it in his pocket ill save it you hardly ever let them fall the way they keep backing up on me i have a feeling plenty are going to fall today she took the tiny lily of the valley boutonniereþhis own requestþand carefully pinned it on for him i know im supposed to let your best man do all this but bens got those big hands yours are shaking i know she laughed a little youd think i was getting married this whole thing didnt make me nervous until this morning when i had to put this getup on you look beautiful he took her hand laid it on his cheek youve been in my heart willa since before you were born youll always be there oh god her eyes welled again she gave him a hasty kiss then whirled ive got to go in her blind rush out the door she barreled into ben move just hold on let me look ignoring the teary eyes he turned her in a circle admiring the flow and fit of the slim blue gown well well well pretty as a bluebell in a meadow he brushed a tear from her cheek with dew still on it oh save your fancy talk and go do what youre supposed to do with adam make man noises and tell bad jokes or something thats what im here for he kissed her before she could wriggle free the first dance is mine and the last he added as she dashed away it wasnt fair willa told herself as she hurried toward the main house it wasnt fair that he had her stirred up this way she had too much on her mind too much to do she damn well didnt want to be in love with ben mckinnon probably wasnt she thought and swiped a hand under her nose it was just so embarrassingly female this reaction of hers imagining herself in love with him just because they went to bed together because he said those fancy words now and again or looked at her in a certain way shed have to get over it that was all get herself back in gear before she made herself the biggest joke in the county or crowded her mind with it so she started doing something stupid like pining away or dogging his heels or picturing herself in a wedding dress she stopped outside the door pressed a hand to her fluttering stomach as composed as possible she strode inside and was met by the sight of adele weeping and leaning on louellas arm as they came down the steps whats wrong did something happen willa was braced to rush to the gun rack when louella smiled nothings wrong adeles just having a motherofthebride moment she looked so beautiful didnt she louella like an angel my baby the most beautiful bride ive ever seen you and me honey were going to open a bottle of that bubbly early and drink to her she patted adele as they walked will you go on up lily asked if you would when you came back i should find rob men just dont get moments like this addy louella steered her toward the kitchen well hunt him up after weve toasted the bride a time or two get upstairs will lilys waiting for you ax right but she had to shake her head a moment baffled and amused by the bond that these two very different wives of jack mercy had forged she was still shaking it when she opened the door to lilys temporary bedroom and was struck dumb isnt it great tess bubbled over as she fussed with the veil isnt she fabulous oh myþoh lily you look like a fairy tale like a princess i wanted the white gown dazzled by herself lily turned in front of the cheval glass the woman who beamed back at her was beautiful draped in billowing skirts of white satin nipped into a bodice romantic with lace and tiny gleaming pearls i know its my second marriage butþ no its not tess brushed a hand down the long snug sleeves of the bridal gown its the only one that matters so its your first my first lily smiled touched her fingers to the veil that drifted over her shoulders im not even nervous i was sure i would be but im not ive got something nervous enough for all of them willa brought out the small velvet box shed held behind her back you dont have to use them youve probably already got the old and new and all of that stuff taken care of but when tess told me there were pearls on your dress i remembered these they were my grandmothers our grandmothers she corrected and held the box out lily could only sigh as she opened the lid the pearls were fashioned into fragile eardrops with oldfashioned and lovely filigree settings without hesitation she removed the earrings shed bought to match the dress and replaced them with the gift theyre so beautiful theyre so perfect they look good made for the delicate like lily she thought with a tangle of pride and envy not the sturdy like herself i figured shed like you to have them i didnt know her or anything but hell im going to start leaking again we all are but i can fix that tess stuffed a tissue into willas hand i stole a bottle of champagne and hid it in the bathroom so bess wouldnt know id say we deserve a glass willa chuckled as tess hurried into the adjoining bath takes after her ma thank you willa lily touched the drops at her ears not just for these for everything dont start on me lily im running out of fingers to plug the dam ive got a reputation around here and its not as a sniveler she heard the pop of the cork echo off the bathroom tile with great relief the men figure out im a soft touch therell be no living with them here we go tess brought in three flutes and a bottle foaming at the lip whatll we drink to she poured generously passed out glasses to true love and connubial bliss no first lily lifted her glass to the ladies of mercy she touched her glass to willas tesss weve come a long way in a short time that i can drink to tess lifted a brow will so can i willa bumped the rim of her flute against tesss grinned at the celebratory ring of crystal leave it to hollywood to pick the best glasses smiling lily touched the glass to her lips but i can only take a sip alcohol isnt good for the baby baby tess and will choked in unison savoring the moment lily wet just the tip of her tongue with the champagne im pregnant later willa would think she d never seen anything more magical than lily gliding across the dusty ranch road in her fairytale dress on the arm of the man who had become her father toward the man who became her husband and as the vows were said and the promises made she let herself forget there was anything in the air but beauty and as the first kiss was exchanged between husband and wife and the cheers rose up she cheered along she thought of the child and the future how fard you travel this time ben murmured in her ear startled she looked up and nearly stumbled over his feet what you keep going away oh you know i have to concentrate when im dancing i lose the count wouldnt if youd let a man do the leading and just go along anyway thats not it he eased her closer you worried about him being here l of course i am i keep looking at faces that i know people i think i know and wondering if it wasnt for this damn will adam and lily could go off for a couple weeks on a real honeymoon id have two less to worry about ifit wasnt for the damn will they might not have gotten as far as postponing a honeymoon he reminded her put it aside will nothings going to happen here today i mostly have they look so happy she turned her head so that she could see the bride and groom again circling in each others arms funny a year ago theyd never met and now theyre married and starting a family this time she did trip how do you know adam told me he grinned and since he was tired of having his feet trounced on led her over to the buffet table i think if he was any happier hed have to split in two parts to hold it i want them to stay that way she resisted reaching down to pat the derringer she had strapped to her thigh it was a pitiful girlish weapon but she felt better knowing it was there youd better start spreading yourself out ben dancing with some of the ladies here people are going to talk otherwise he chuckled lifted her chin for someone as cleareyed as willa she was dead blind when it came to herself darling people already are he enjoyed the way she scowled at that scanning the crowd as if she would catch someone whispering behind a hand doesnt bother me any i dont like people gossiping over their fences about me she jerked her chin toward tess and nate what are they saying about that that nates caught himself a slippery one and hell have to be surehanded to hold on now theres a woman who can dance he snagged two glasses from a passing waiter gestured with one toward louella she was poured into a hotpink dress and kicking up her skyscraper heels with bens father at least a dozen cowboys pounded their feet and waited their turn thats your father yep look at him go hell be sore for a week but hell be happy laughing willa grabbed bens hand and hustled over for a better view as they watched a cowboy from a neighboring ranch cut in and spun louella into a spirited twostep stu mckinnon took out his bandanna and mopped his flushed face shell outlast all of them tess predicted nate winked at ben and watched stu hobble off for a beer she teach you how to dance like that i havent had enough to drink yet to dance like that taking willas glass tess drank deep handed back the empty give me time oh im a patient man best wedding ive been to in my life will you and the ladies have done yourselves proud then he grunted when louella slammed into him your turn handsome louella i couldnt keep up with you if i had four feet you must keep everything hopping at that restaurant of yours restaurant hell she howled and grabbed his hands i run a strip joint honey now let me show you some moves a strip joint willa arched an eyebrow as nate was dragged onto the dance floor oh shit tess sighed long and hard get me another drink ben i need it coming up a strip joint willa repeated so what its a living whats it like i mean do they take everything off and dance around buck naked her eyes popped wide not in shock but fascination does louellaþ no tess grabbed the glass from ben drank again at least not since she bought her own place ive never been to one and wouldnt it be interesting willa mused does she have men too naked dancing men oh good god tess passed the drink to willa only on ladiesnight im going to rescue nate before she puts him in traction ladiesnight the very idea was marvelous to will i guess id pay to see a man dance naked speculating she turned her head shot ben a look no not for any amount of money she thought she could come up with another kind of payment and laughing slid an arm around his waist and watched the show he watched too and was happy the bride was beautiful glowing just as a bride should be in her white gown and veil the music was loud and food and drink were plentiful it made him feel sentimental heart strong and proud all at once the day had happened because of him and he hugged that knowledge and the giddy pleasure of it to himself there had been so much out of his control all of his life just beyond his reach but hed accomplished this perhaps no one could ever know he might have to keep the secret all of his life like a hero in a bookþa kind of robin hood who took no personal credit theyd see about that saving lily had changed his direction his purpose but not his means it amused him that the police were wandering through the crowds of guests looking for him thinking they could spot him they never would he imagined himself going on for years forever killing for pleasure strictly for pleasure now revenge even harbored resentments seemed very pale and weak beside pleasure someone bumped into him a pretty woman flirting he flirted back making her laugh and blush leading her into a dance and thinking all the while wondering if she might be the next one her pretty red hair would make a nice trophy he got a redheaded whore because she reminded him of the pretty redheaded girl hed danced with at lilys wedding v va whore wasnt much of a challenge and he was disappointed in that but hed waited so long hed waited considerately until lilys parents and tesss mother had gone on home it hadnt seemed right to him to cause all that excitement with company around lilys folks had stayed on a week after the wedding and louella ten days everybody agreed they were going to miss louella particularly with her big wide laugh her kneeslapping jokes and those tight skirts she liked to wear the woman was a caution and he hoped she came back to visit real soon he felt a tie to her now to all of them the inlaws and the outlaws as his ma used to say that had always made him laugh the inlaws and the outlaws but now the company had cleared out and the ranch was back to routine the weather was holding fine and he was pleased by it the crops were coming along well though they could use some rain but god knew and so did he that rain in montana was usually feast or famine thered been some thunder headed to the west a time or two but june had stayed bonedry thus far the streams were running well and the snowmelt was plentiful so he wasnt worried the cattle were fattening in pasture with the spring calves coming along just as they should thered been some elk nosing around which was always a worry damn varmints tore up the fences and could carry disease into the herd but willa stayed on top of those matters hed studied on her new ideas the reseeding of natural grass the gradual cutting back of chemicals and growth hormones and found that he approved hed decided that most anything she did that the old man hadnt he approved of it had taken him some time and some hard soulsearching but he now believed it had been right and just that shed been given the reins of mercy it still burned that mckinnon and torrence had a say in things at least for a few more months but willa handled them well enough too hed come to care for lily and tess but blood was thicker than water hed always said he now visualized both of them settled on mercy all the family rooted on the ranch family stuck by family hed been taught that from the cradle had done his best to live by it it had only been grief and rage that had caused him to want to bring them pain as he had pain but now hed put that solidly at the old mans door where it belonged hed left a sign there too one that had made him weep and laugh all at once now it was time for bigger game so he hunted the redheaded whore he picked her up in bozeman a twentydollar street hooker he didnt figure would be missed she was bonethin and dumb as a post but she had a mouth like a suction cup and knew how to use it when they were in the cab of his rig and her face was buried in his lap she worked off the first twenty and he ran his fingers through her long red hair it was probably dyed but that didnt matter it was a fine bright color and it was clean dreaming of what was to come he laid his head back closed his eyes and let her earn her keep youre hung like a bull cowboy she said when it was done i should charged you by the inch it was her standard line after a blow job and usually earned a quick grin if not a modest tip she wasnt disappointed when he flashed his teeth and bumped his hips up to reach for his wallet i got another fifty here sweetheart lets take a little ride she was cautious a woman in her profession had to be but her gaze latched greedily on the dead president he held between forefinger and thumb where to im a country boy towns crowd me lets find us a nice quiet spot and well set the springs in this old rig creaking when she hesitated he reached out twirled her hair around his finger you sure are pretty whatd you say your name was mostly johns didnt care about names and she liked him better for asking its suzy how about it suzy q want to take a ride with me he seemed harmless and she did have the loaded twentyfivecaliber pistol in her bag she smiled her thin face going sly you gotta wear a slicker cowboy sure hed no more have dipped his wick into a street whore without protection than slit his own wrists cant be too careful these days with a wink he watched his fifty disappear into her shiny vinyl handbag he started the engine and drove out of bozeman it was a pretty night and the road was clear tempting him to push the gas pedal to the floor but he drove moderately humming along with billy ray cyrus on the radio and as the dark became country dark he was a happy man this is far enough for fifty it made her nervous the quiet the lack of light and people not far enough he thought and smiled at her i know a little place just a couple miles up steering with one hand he reached under the seat amused at the way she shrank back and reached for her bag he pulled out a bottle of the cheap wine hed doctored drink suzy well maybe her johns didnt usually offer her wine or call her pretty or use her name just a couple more miles cowboy she said and tipped back the bottle then well ride me and my pal here are more than ready he patted his crotch turned up the radio know this one she drank again giggled and sang along with him and clint black she was a little thing barely a hundred pounds it took less than ten minutes for the drug to work he nipped the bottle neatly from her limp fingers before it could spill whistling now he pulled to the side of the road she was slumped in the corner but he lifted an eyelid to be certain then nodded climbing out he dumped the rest of the drugged wine out then heaved the bottle sending it in a long flying arc into the dark he heard it shatter as he walked to the bed of the rig and got out the rope you don t have to do this will adam studied his sister as they walked their horses through a narrow stream i want to for you she paused let moon drink for her i know i havent come to her grave very often i let other things get in the way you dont have to go to our mothers grave to remember her thats the problem isnt it i can t remember her except through you she tipped back her head it was a gorgeous afternoon and she was pleasantly tired her shoulders just a little achy from unrolling wire and hammering fence i didnt come very often because it always seemed morbid standing there looking down at a piece of earth and a carved stone having no memories of her to pull out and hold on to she watched a bird flit by chasing the breeze ive started thinking of it differently it was seeing lily with her mother and tess with hers its thinking of the baby lilys carrying the continuity she turned to him and her face was relaxed it was always the land that was continuity to me the seasons the work that had to be done in each one of them when i thought of yesterday or of tomorrow it was always the ranch its your heart willa your home its you yeah thatll always be true but im thinking of the people now i never really did beforeþexcept for you she reached out closed a hand over his you were always there my memories are of you picking me up me riding your hip your voice talking to me and telling me stories you were and always will be a joy to me youre going to be such an amazing father she gave his hand a last squeeze began to walk moon again ive been thinking its not just the land that continues not just the land we owe i owe her my life and i owe her you and i owe her the child ill be aunt to he was silent a moment its not just her you owe no its not adam would understand she thought he always did i owe jack mercy too the angers gone now and so is the grief i owe him my life and the lives of my sisters and so the child ill be aunt to i can be grateful for that and maybe in some way i owe him what i am if hed been different so would i and what about the tomorrows will what about your tomorrows she could only see the seasons and the work that had to be done in each one of them and the land waiting endlessly i dont know why dont you tell ben how you feel about him she sighed and wished for once there could be some corner of her heart secret from adam i havent made up my mind how i feel your mind has nothing to do with it his lips curved as he kicked his horse into a trot neither does his and what the hell was that supposed to mean she wondered her brow knit she clicked to moon and galloped after him dont start that cryptic business with me im only half blackfoot remember if you have something to sayþ she broke off as he held up a hand without question she pulled up and followed his gaze toward the tilting stones of the cemetery she smelled it too death but that was to be expected here it was another of the reasons she so rarely came but then she knew even before she saw she knew because old death had a quiet and dusty murmur and new death screamed they walked the horses slowly again dismounted in silence with only the wind in the high grass and the haunting song of birds it was her fathers grave that had been desecrated what rose up in her was disgust chased by superstition to mock and insult the dead was a dangerous matter she shuddered found herself murmuring a chant in her mothers tongue to calm restless spirits then to calm her own she turned away and stared over the land that rolled and waved to forever not a very subtle message she thought as the healing rage took over the mutilated skunk had been spread over the grave its blood staining the mound of new grass the head had been removed then placed carefully just under the headstone the stone itself had been smeared with blood going brown now in the sun and words had been printed over the deep carving dead but notforgotten she jerked when adam laid a hand on her shoulder go back to the stream willa ill take care of this her weak legs urged her to do as he asked to crawl back onto her horse and ride but the rage was still here and beneath that the debt she had come to acknowledge no he was my father my blood ill do it turning she fumbled with the clasps on her saddlebags i can do it adam i need to do it she took out an old blanket spent some of her temper ripping it after digging for her gloves she tugged them on her eyes were bright and hard whatever he was whatever hed done he didnt deserve this she took a piece of the blanket and kneeling beside her fathers grave began the filthy task of removing the corpse from it her stomach revolted but her hands stayed steady her gloves were stained with gore when she finished so she stripped them off tossed them into the heap tying the blanket securely she set it aside ill bury it adam murmured she nodded rose using her canteen she soaked another piece of the blanket then knelt again to wash the stone she couldnt get it clean no matter how she scrubbed she would have to come back with something more than water and a makeshift rag but she did her best and sat back on her heels her hands raw and cold i thought i loved you she murmured then i thought i hated you but nothing i ever felt for you was as deep or as deadly as this she closed her eyes and tried to clear her lungs of the stench its been you all along i think not me but you its been aimed at dear god what did you do and who did you do it to here adam reached down to lift her to her feet drink a little he said and offered her his canteen she drank gulping deep to wash the nasty taste from her throat there were flowers blooming on her mothers grave she realized and blood staining her fathers who hated him this much adam and why who did he hurt more than me and you more than lily and tess who did he hurt more than the children he ignored i dont know he worried only about willa now and gently led her back to her horse youve done all you can do here well go home yes her legs felt brittle like ice ready to crack well go home they rode west toward mercy and a sky stained red as the grave the fourth of july meant more than fireworks it meant roping and riding bronco busting and bull riding for more than a decade mercy and three rocks had held a competition for cowboys on their ranches and any of the neighboring spreads who didnt choose to go farther afield for holiday entertainment it was mercys turn to host willa had listened to bens request that they move the competition to three rocks that year to nates advice that they cancel it altogether shed considered then ignored she was mercy and mercy continued so people crowded corral fences cheering on their picks cowboys brushed off their butts as they were tossed out of the saddle into the air and onto the ground in a near pasture the barrelracing competition entered its second phase near the pole barn hooves thundered and ropes flew through the air a bandstand was set up draped with bunting of red white and blue music was interrupted periodically as names and places were announced gallons of potato salad truckloads of fried chicken and barrels of beer and iced tea were consumed hearts were broken along with a few bones i see were up against each other in the target shooting ben commented slipping an arm around willas waist ptepare to lose side bet she angled her head what do you have in mind well he tucked his tongue in his cheek leaned down close so their hats bumped and whispered something that made her eyes round youre making that up she decided no one could live through that not chicken are you she straightened her hat you want to risk it mckinnon ill take you on youre in this round of bronc busting arent you im on my way over ill go with you she smiled sweetly ive got twenty on jim you bet against me he wobbled between insult and shock hell willa ive been watching jim practice hams been coaching him she sauntered away no point in telling him shed bet fifty on ben mckinnon it would just go to his head hey will a little blood drying on his chin his arm around a blonde in girdledon jeans billy beamed at her jims in the chute thats what im here for she propped a boot on the rail beside his howd you do aw shit he rolled a sore shoulder that good huh with a laugh she squeezed over to make room for ben well youre young yet kid youll still be breaking bronc when geezers like mckinnon here are riding their rocking chairs you get ham to work with you she looked up saw her foreman was standing on the outside wall of the chute snapping lastminute instructions to jim i was thinking maybe you could you ride bettern anybody on mercy except for adam and he wont bust broncs adams got a different way of taming them well see she added then let out a whoop as the chute opened and horse and rider shot out ride that devil jim he careened by in a cloud of dust one hand thrown high when the eightsecond bell clanged he jumped clear rolled then gained his feet to the wild cheers of the onlookers not bad ben said im coming up with manhood and pride at stake he cupped his hands under willas elbows lifted her up and kissed her for luck he said then swaggered off think hell take our jim will billy wanted to know she thought ben mckinnon could take damn near anything hell have to ride like a hellhound though the blonde shifted under his arm in a bid for attention billy tugged willas sleeve youre up against him in the target shooting arent you thats right youll take him will we all put money on you all the boys well i wouldnt want you to lose it she watched ben climb over the chute he tipped his hat to her a cocky move that made her grin back at him when his horse leaped out of the door her heart did a foolish little roll in her chest he looked magnificent she decided riding straight on that furious horse one hand grabbing for the sky the other locked to the saddle she caught a glimpse of his eyes the deadfocused concentration in them they look like that when hes inside me she realized and her heart did another roll quicker she didnt even hear the bell clang but watched him jump down the horse still kicking furiously he stayed on his feet boots planted and though the crowd cheered he looked straight at her and winked cocky bastard she muttered and im hipdeep in love with him why do they do that tess asked from behind her for the hell of it grateful for the excuse to think of something else willa turned tess had turned herself out for the day tight jeans fancy boots a bright blue shirt with silver trim that matched the band on her snowywhite hat well aint you a picture hey nate ready for the race its a tight field this year but im hopeful nates helping out with the pieeating contest tess chuckled and tucked an arm through his we were hunting up lily she wanted to watch since she helped make the pies i saw her willa narrowed her eyes and searched the crowds i think she and adam were helping out with the kidsgames egg toss maybe or the threelegged races well find her want to tag along no thanks willa shrugged off tesss invitation i may catch up later i need a beer youre worried about her nate murmured as they zigzagged through the crowd i cant help it you didnt see her the day she came back from the cemetery she wouldnt talk about it usually i can goad her into talking about anything but not this its been over two months since jesse cooke was murdered thats something to hang on to im trying tess shook herself there was music people laughter its a hell of a party you do throw amazing parties out here we can start throwing our own anytime you say nate weve been there im going back to la in october theres lily desperate for the distraction tess waved wildly i swear she glows all the time now pregnancy certainly agrees with her nate thought it might agree with tess as well that was something else they could startþonce hed finished pecking away at this stubborn idea of leaving the first fireworks exploded at twenty minutes past dusk color leaped over the sky shadowed the stars then bled down like tears willa let herself be cuddled back against ben to watch the show i think your daddy likes sending those bombs off more than the kids like to watch he and ham argue over the presentation and order every blessed year ben grinned as a gold starburst bloomed overhead with a crackling boom then they cackle like hens taking turns lighting fuses never would let zack or me have a hand in it its not your time she murmured that too would come that too was continuity it was a good day yeah he covered her hands with his real good not miffed cause i beat you shooting it still stung a little but he shrugged his shoulders the two of them had whittled away the rest of the competitors until theyd gone head to head in the final round then head to head in two tiebreaking rounds and there shed squeaked past him by a lousy half an inch tops doesnt matter by how much she looked over up at him and grinned matters who won youre a good shot she wiggled her brows im better today you were better anyway i cost you twenty when i beat out jim serves you right laughing she turned in his arms i made back the fifty i put on you when his brow lowered she laughed again do i look like a fool no he tipped her face up you look like a smart woman who knows how to hedge her bets speaking of bets despite the crowd that gasped and cheered at every burst of light she wrapped herself around him pressed her mouth warm and firm to his lets go inside and see if we live till morning you going to let me stay till morning why not its a holiday later when the fireworks were done the crowds gone and the night quiet they turned to each other again her dreams hadnt been full of blood and death and fear this time finding him there warm solid ready to hold her she knew thered be no shaking dreams that night someone else dreamed of a redheaded whore and shivered thrilled with the memory it had been so easy so smooth and every detail played back so clearly hed watched her come back to consciousness the glassy eyes the muffled whimper hed driven her far from bozeman into the sheltering dark of trees not on mercy land not this time and never again he was done with punishing mercy but he couldnt be done with killing hed tied her hands behind her back and hed gagged her he wouldnt have minded hearing her scream but he didnt want her to be able to use her teeth on him hed cut her clothes away but had been careful very careful not to cut her flesh he was very very good with a knife while shed slept he had taken his money back and the rest of hers which had been pathetically little hed bided his time toying with her little pistol her tube of red lipstick now that she was awake now that her eyes were wide and she was struggling in the dirt making noises like a trapped animal he took the tube back out of her cheap purse a whore should be painted up proper he told her and aroused himself by stroking the lipstick over her nipples until they were bright blood red i like that yes indeed since her cheeks were pale he colored them as well in round circles like a dolls happy blush were you going to shoot me with this toy of yours sweetheart he pointed the pistol playfully at her heart and watched her eyes roll white guess a woman in your line a works gotta protect herself in more ways than one told you id wear a rubber he set the pistol aside then tore open the foil package love to have you suck me off again suzy q i do believe that was the finest blow job i ever paid for but you might bite this time he pinched her red nipples painfully we cant have that can we he was already hard throbbing hard but made himself slide the condom on slowly im going to fuck you now you cant rape a whore but since i aint going to pay for it i guess technically we could call it that so well say im going to rape you now he levered himself over her smiling as she tried to draw her legs up to protect herself now honey dont be shy youre going to like it in two rough jerks he pulled her legs straight spread them locked them youre damn well going to like it and youre going to tell me how much you love it you cant say much with that rag stuffed in your whoresucking mouth but youre going to moan and groan for me i want you to groan now like you cant wait for it now when she didnt respond he released one of her legs and slapped her not hard he thought just enough to let her know who was boss now he repeated she managed a sob and he settled for it you make noise for me plenty of noise i like plenty of noise with my sex he rammed himself into her she was dry as dust and as unwelcoming as a tomb but he pumped furiously working up a sheen of sweat that gleamed on his back under the scatter of stars her eyes rolled in pain and fear the way a horses did when you dug in spurs and drew blood when he was finished he rolled off her panting that was good that was good yeah im going to do that again in just a minute or two she was curled into a ball and weeping tried to crawl lazily he picked up the gun fired a shot at the sky it stopped her cold you just rest there suzy q im going to see if i can work up the gumption for another round he sodomized her this time but it wasnt as good it took him too long to get hard and the orgasm was small and unsatisfying guess thats it for me he gave her a friendly slap on the rump and for you he thought it was a shame he couldnt keep her a couple days like he had little traci with an but that kind of game was too risky now and there would always be another whore he opened his pack and there it was waiting lovingly he slipped the knife from its oiledleather sheath admired the way the starlight caught the metal and glimmered my daddy gave me this only thing he ever gave me pretty aint it after shoving her onto her back he held it in front of her face so that she could see it he wanted her to see it and smiling he straddled her and smiling he went to work on her now there was a trophy of red hair in his box of secrets he doubted anyone would find her where hed left her or if they did if they would be able to identify what was left of her once the predators had done with what hed left behind for them he didnt need the fear and the fame any longer it was enough that he knew chapter summers in montana were short and fierce and august could be cruel sun baked the dirt and dried the trees to kindling and made men pray for rain a match flicked the wrong way or a wellaimed bolt of lightning would turn pasture into fire crops into tears willa sweated through her shirt as she surveyed a field of barley hottest summer i remember wood merely grunted he spent most of his time scowling at the sky or worrying over his grain his boys should have been there worrying with him but hed gotten tired of their spatting and sent them off to bother their mother irrigations helping some he spat as if that drop of moisture would make a difference mercy was both joy and worry to him and had been for too many years to count water tables dead low couple more weeks of this well be in trouble dont sugarcoat it for me she said wearily and remounted well get through it he grunted again shook his head at her as she rode off the ground bounced heat back at her relentlessly the cattle she passed stood slacklegged with barely enough energy to swish tails not even the stingiest breeze stirred the grass she saw a rig well out along a fence line and the two men unrolling wire changing directions she galloped out ham billy she dismounted walked over to the twogallon jug in the bed of the rig and poured herself a cup of icy water ham says this aint hot will sweating cheerfully billy strung wire he says he recollects when it was so hot it fried eggs still in their shells she smiled at that i expect he does you get as old as ham here you ve seen everything twice she took off her hat wiped an arm over her brow she didnt like hams color the red flush that stained his face looked hot enough to explode but she knew to tread carefully pouring two cups she walked over held them out hot work take a break be done soon ham said but his breath was puffing you got to keep the fluid in you told me that often enough that i have to take it as truth she all but shoved the cup into his hand you boys take your salt tablets sure we did billy gulped the water down his adams apple bobbing ham im going to finish here with billy you take moon back for me what the hell for his eyes were running from squinting into the sun under his soaked shirt his heart pounded like a hammer on an anvil but he finished any job he started i said were about done here thats fine then i need you to take moon back and get me those stock reports im falling behind and i want to catch up on them tonight you know where the damn reports are and i need them casually she took her gloves out of her saddlebags and see if you can sweettalk bess into making some peach ice cream shell do it for you and ive got a yen for some he wasnt a fool knew just what she was doing im stringing wire here girl no she hefted the roll as billy watched wideeyed and fascinated im stringing wire here youre going to take moon back in get those stock reports in my office and see about peach ice cream he tossed his cup on the ground planted his feet the hell with that take her back yourself she set the roll down i run mercy ham and im telling you what i want you to do you got a problem with that well take it up later but now you ride back and do what im telling you his face was redder now making her pulse skittish but she kept her eyes cool and level with his after ten humming seconds with the heat crippling both of them he turned stiffly away and mounted you think i cant do the job this halfassed boy can do then you get my paycheck ready he kicked the horse sent moon into a surprised rear then galloped off jeer was all billy could think of damn it i should have handled that better she rubbed her hands over her face hell be all right will he doesnt mean it hamd never leave you or mercy thats not what im worried about she blew out a breath lets get this damn wire strung she waited until nightfall canceled a date with ben and sat out on the front porch she heard the thunder watched lightning flash but the sky was too clear for rain despite the heat she had no taste for the ice cream bess had churned even when tess came out with a bowl heaped full of it willa shook her head youve been sulking since you came in today tess leaned against the porch rail and tried to imagine cool ocean breezes want to talk about it no its a personal problem theyre the most interesting philosophically tess spooned up some ice cream and sampled it ben no willa gave an irritated shrug why is it people think every personal thought in my head revolves around ben mckinnon because women usually do their best sulking over a man you didnt have a fight with him im always fighting with him i mean a real fight no then why did you cancel your date jesus christ cant i choose to stay home on my own porch one night without answering a bunch of questions guess not tess dug out another spoonful this is great stuff licked the spoon clean come on try it if itll get you off my back with little grace willa grabbed the bowl and scooped some up it was sheer heaven bess makes the best peach ice cream in the civilized world i tend to agree with you want to eat ice cream get drunk and take a swim sounds like a great way to cool off willas eyes slitted with suspicion why are you so friendly you look really hummed i guess im feeling sorry for you it should have annoyed her instead it touched her i had words with ham today he was out stringing wire and i got spooked he looked so old all of a sudden and it was so blasted hot i thought hed have a stroke or some thing a heart attack i made him come back in and that slapped his pride flat i just cant lose anybody else she said quietly not right now not yet his pride will bounce back maybe you dented it a little but hes too devoted to you to stay mad for long im counting on it soothed she handed the bowl back to tess maybe ill come in shortly and take that swim all right tess opened the screen shot back a grin but im not wearing a suit chuckling willa eased back in the rocker let it creak thunder rumbled a little closer now and she heard the crunch of boots on stone she sat up one hand going under the chair where her rifle rested she brought it back up laid it in her lap when ham stepped into the light evening she said evening you got my check stubborn old goat she thought and gestured to the chair beside her would you sit down a minute i got packing to do please bandy legs stiff as a weekold wishbone he climbed the steps lowered himself into the next rocker you took me down in front of that boy today im sorry she folded her hands in her lap stared down at him it was the sound of his voice raw with hurt and wounded pride that scraped at her i tried to make it simple make what simple you think i need some girl i used to paddle coming out and telling me im too old to do my job i never saidþ hell you didnt plain as day to me why do you have to be so stubborn she kicked at the porch rail out of sheer frustration why do you have to be so hardheaded me never in my life did i see a more rockheaded female than the one im sitting beside right now you think you know it all girl you think you got all the answers that every blessed thing you do is right no she exploded with it leaped up no i dont i dont know half the time if its right but i have to do it anyway and i did what i had to do today and it was right goddamn you ham you were going to have heatstroke in another ten minutes and then where the hell would i be how the hell could i run this place without you youre already doing just that you took me off the job today i took you off the fences i dont want you riding fence in this heat im telling you im not having it youre not having it he rose too went nose to nose with her who the hell do you think you are telling me youre not having it ive been riding fence in every kind of weather since before you were born and you nor nobodys telling me i cant do it until i say im done im telling you then cut me my last check fine she swung to the door pushed by temper her hand fisted on the edge then whipped it back in a slam that shook the wood under her feet i was scared why cant i be allowed to be scared what in hell are you scared of losing you you muleheaded son of a bitch you were all redfaced and sweaty and your breath was puffing like a bad engine i couldnt stand it i just couldnt and if youd just gone in like i asked you it wouldve been fine it was hot he said but his voice was weak now and a little ashamed i know it was hot goddamn it ham thats the point whyd you make me push you that way i didnt want to embarrass you in front of billy i just wanted you to get out of the sun i know who my father was she said furiously and made his head come up his eyes meet hers again and i havent buried him yet not the one who really counted when i needed him to count i dont want to bury him for a long time i couldve finished he bumped his toe on the rail stared at it hell will i was making the boy do most of the work i know my limits i need you here she waited for her system to calm again i need you ham im asking you to stay he moved his shoulders kept his eyes on his feet i guess i got no place better to be i shouldnta bucked you i guess i knew you were thinking of me he shifted his feet cleared his throat youre doing a fine job around here all in all im ah im proud of you and thats why he was the one who counted she thought the father of her blood had never said those words to her i cant do it alone you want to come in she opened the door again have some of that peach ice cream you can tell me all the things im doing wrong he scratched his beard maybe i guess theres a few things i could straighten you out on when he left his belly was full and his heart considerably lighter he strolled toward the bunkhouse light of step he heard the sounds the disturbed braying of cattle the click of boot heels who the hell was on guard duty he couldnt quite place it jim or billy he thought and decided to wander over to check things out that you jim billy what are you playing with the penned head for this time of night he saw the calf first bleeding eyes rolling in fear and pain hed taken two running steps before he saw the man rise up out of the shadows what the devils this what the hell have you done and he knew before he saw the knife arch up but there was no time to scream the panic came first with the knife dripping in his hand he stared down at ham the blood wiped a hand over his mouth hed just needed a quick fix that was all one calf hed meant to drag it away from the ranch yard but the knife had just leaped into his hand and now ham hed never meant to hurt ham ham had trained him worked with him paid attention when attention needed to be paid hed always felt ham had known the truth about where hed come from and who he was and ham was loyal but now there was no choice it had to be finished he crouched down prepared just as willa rushed out of the night ham is that you i forgot to tell you about theþ her boots skidded lightning flashed bursting light onto the men all but at her feet oh sweet god what happened to him what happened she was already on her knees turning him over into her arms did heþ and there was blood on her hands im sorry will im sorry he turned the knife on her held it to her throat dont call out i dont want to hurt you i swear i dont want to hurt you he took a deep shuddering breath im your brother and bringing his fist up he knocked her cold ham woke to pain fiery blinding pain he couldn t pinpoint it couldnt find the source but he tasted blood in his mouth groaning he tried to sit up but couldnt move his legs he turned his head saw that the calf had bled out its eyes were dead soon he thought hed bleed out too there was something else on the ground that caught his eye he stared at it a long time watched it come and go as his vision cleared and blurred then hissing he crawled toward it brushed the tip with his fingers willas hat he had to carry her he should have gone for a rig knew he should have but hed been so shaken he hadnt been able to think clearly now he laid her as gently as he could on the ground near the pasture and with a trembling hand rattled a bucket of oats theyd go on horseback it was probably best he wanted to get her away into the hills a ways so that he could explain everything to her shed understand once he had blood was thicker than water he saddled the paint pony that nosed into the bucket then the roan that tried to nuzzle through oh he hated to do it even temporarily but he tied willas hands tied her feet then strapped her across the saddle shed come to shortly he thought and shed try to get away before he could explain she had to understand he prayed shed understand as he vaulted into the saddle took both pairs of reins if she didnt hed have to kill her thunder stalked closer as he rode into the hills ham clutched the hat in his hand staggered to his feet he managed two drunken steps before he went to his knees he called out and though his voice boomed in his ears it was barely a whisper he thought of willa hardly more than a baby with a milky mouth grinning at him as he plopped her into the saddle in front of him a little girl all braids and eyes begging him to let her ride out to pasture with him an adolescent gawky as a colt running wire with him and chattering his ears off and the woman who had looked at him tonight her heart in her eyes when shed told him he was the one who counted so he bit back the pain that was eating through him like cancer and fought his way to his feet again he could see the main house the lights in the windows circling in front of his eyes blood dripped through his fingers and onto her hat he didnt feel the ground when it jumped up to meet him she came to slowly her jaw throbbing her eyes focused on the ground bumping and falling beneath her she tried to shift found herself snugly secured lying across the saddle with her head dangling she must have moaned or made some sound for the horses stopped quickly its okay will youre okay he loosed the straps the restraints on her legs but kept her hands secured need to ride a little further can you handle it what still groggy she felt herself lifted then she was sitting in the saddle shaking her head to clear it while her hands were strapped tight to the horn you just catch your breath ill lead your horse what are you doing it leaped back into her mind but refused to root there ham couldnt help it just couldnt help it well talk this through you justþ he broke off dragging her down by the hair when she sucked in her breath dont you scream nobodys going to hear you but i dont want you screaming mumbling to himself he tugged out his bandanna tied it quickly over her mouth im sorry i have to do it this way but you just dont understand yet trying not to be angry with her he strode back to his horse swung on and rode into the trees well willa had missed her swim tess thought as she tied the belt of a short terry robe she ran her fingers through her hair to smooth it back and wandered out of the pool house toward the kitchen probably still sulking she decided willa took everything in and worried over it it might be a good idea to try to teach her a few relaxation techniquesþthough tess couldnt quite visualize willa meditating or experimenting with imaging rain would make her happy tess supposed lord everyone around here lived their life by the weather too wet too dry too cold too hot well in two months she would say farewell scenic montana and hello la lunch alfresco she mused cartiers god knew she deserved to treat herself to some ridiculously expensive bauble after this yearlong banishment from the real world the theater palm trees trafficchoked highways and the familiar haze of smog god bless hollywood then she pouted a little because it didnt sound quite as wonderful as it had a month before or a month before that no shed be glad to get back thrilled she was just feeling broody that was all maybe shed buy a place up in the hills rather than on the beach though she could have a horse up there and the trees the grass that would be the best of both worlds after all a brisk exciting drive from the excitement and crowds of the city home to the pleasure shed come to enjoy of the country well not exactly country by montana standards but the hollywood hills would do just fine she could probably persuade nate to come out and visit offand on their relationship would fade after a while she expected and damn it accepted that so would he this wild idea of his to have her settle down here get married and start breeding was ridiculous she had a life in la a career she had plans big juicy plans she would be thirtyone years old in a matter of weeks and she wasnt tossing those plans aside at this stage of her life to be a ranch wife any kind of a wife she wished she had brought down a cigarette but she swung into the kitchen in search of other stimulation youve had your share of ice cream tess wrinkled her nose at besss back i didnt come in for ice cream though she would have enjoyed one or two spoonfuls she went to the refrigerator took out a pitcher of lemonade you been skinnydipping again yep you ought to try it besss mouth twitched at the idea you put that glass in the dishwasher when youre finished this kitchens clean fine tess plopped down at the table eyed the catalogue bess was thumbing through shopping im thinking lily might like this here bassinet the one we used for you girls wasnt kept after willa he got rid of it oh it was an interesting thought the idea of her and lily and willa sharing something as sweet as a baby bed oh its adorable delighted tess scraped her chair closer look at the ribbons in the skirt bess slanted her eyes over im buying the bassinet all right all right oh look a cradle shed love a cradle wouldnt she one to sit by your chair and rock i expect she would lets make a list besss eyes softened considerably and she pulled out a pad shed stuck under the catalogue got one started already they made cooing noises over mobiles and stuffed bears argued briefly over the right kind of stroller tess rose to get them both more lemonade then glanced at the kitchen door when she heard footsteps i wasnt expecting anyone she whispered her nervous hand going to her throat me either calm as ice bess pulled her pistol out of her apron pocket and standing faced the door whos out there when the face pressed against the screen she laughed at herself god almighty ham you nearly took a bullet you shouldnt be sneaking around this time of night he fell through the door right at her feet the pistol clattered as it hit the table tess was on the floor with her before bess could lift hams head in her lap hes bleeding bad here get some towels press them down hard bess quiet now lets see whats what here tess ripped the shirt aside and pressed down hard on the wound call for an ambulance a helicopter he needs help quickly wait ham grabbed for besss hand hes got he squeezed until he could find the breath to speak again hes got her bessie hes got our will what straining to hear tess pushed her face close who has will but he was unconscious when her eyes lifted latched onto besss they were ripe with fear call the police hurry he was ready to stop now he d circled backtracked followed a stream down its center then moved onto rock he had no choice but to tether the horses but he kept them close willa watched his every move she knew the hills and he wouldnt find the hunt easy even if she had to go on foot once she got loose he hauled her down first retied her ankles after getting his rifle he sat across from her laid it across his lap im going to take the gag off now im sorry i had to use it you know it wont do any good to scream they may come after us but not for a while and i covered the trail he reached over put his hand on the cotton were just going to talk once you hear me out well get back to the way things were he tugged the gag down you murdering bastard you dont mean that youre upset upset fury carried her had her pulling furiously to try to break her bonds you killed ham you killed all the others you slaughtered my cattle ill kill you with my own hands if i get the chance ham was an accident im as fond of him as i can be but he saw me like a boy caught with the shards of a cookie jar at his feet he lowered his head the cattle was a mistake i shouldnt have done that to you im sorry youreþ she shut her eyes balled her helpless hands into fists why why have you done these things i thought i could trust you you can i swear you can were blood willa you can trust your own blood youre no blood of mine yes i am he knuckled a tear away such was his joy in being able to tell her im your brother youre a liar and a murderer and a coward his head snapped up his hand flew out the sting of flesh striking flesh sang up his arm and he regretted it immediately dont say things like that i got my pride he rose paced worked himself back under control things didnt go well when you lost control he knew but stay in charge stay on top and you could handle anything that came along im as much your brother as lily and tess are your sisters he said it calmly as the sky split and fractured with swords of electric light i want to explain things to you i want to make you see why i did what i did fine the side of her face burned like hellfire hed pay for that too she promised herself he would pay for everything okay jim explain it to me b en slammed his rifle into its sheath snagged his gunbelt strapped it on the carbine he shot into the holster was a brute of a revolver and he wanted a mean gun he wouldnt allow himself to feel or he might sink shaking to his knees he could only allow himself to move men were saddling up fast with adam shouting orders ben wasnt giving any orders not this time nor was he taking them he took willas hat gave it to charlie to scent you find her he murmured you find willa stuffing the hat in his saddlebag he swung into the saddle ben tess grabbed the bridle wait for the others im not waiting move aside tess we cant be sure whereþor who though there was only one man missing ill find the where i dont have to know who he jerked his horses head out of her grip i just have to kill him tess raced over to adam put both arms around lily and held tight ben rode off i couldnt stop him adam merely nodded gave the signal to ride he knows what hes doing dont worry turning he embraced them both go inside he told lily and laid his hand on her gently rounded belly wait and dont worry i wont worry she kissed him you found me youll find her bring her back safe it was a plea as much as a statement but she stepped back to let him mount take lily inside tess nate reined in steadied his eager mount stay inside i will she laid a hand on his leg squeezed hurry was all she could say the horses drove west and she and lily turned started back toward the house to begin the painful process of waiting my mother served drinks in a bar down in bozeman jim sat crosslegged as he told his tale like a true storyteller þl v v should well maybe she served more than drinks i expect she did though she never said but she was a goodlooking woman and she was alone and thats the kind of thing that happens i thought your mother came from missoula did original went back there too after i was born lots of women go home after something like that but it never worked out for her or me anyhow she served drinks and maybe more for the cowboys who passed through jack mercy he passed through plenty back in those days looking to kick ass get pissfaced drunk find a woman you ask anybody theyll tell you he picked up a stick ran it over the rock behind her back willa twisted her wrists working them against the rope ive heard stories she said calmly i know what kind of man he was i know you do you used to turn a blind eye to it i saw that too but you knew he took a shine to my mother back then like i said she was a goodlooking woman you see the ones he married they all had something looks sure louella she had flash and adele seemed to me seeing her shed have been classy and smart and your ma well she was something quietlike and special too seemed she could hear things other people couldnt i was taken with your ma it made her blood chill to hear it to think of him anywhere near her mother how did you know her we paid some visits never stayed long in the area never at mercy either i was just a kid but i got a clear memory of your ma big and pregnant with you walking with adam in the pasture holding his hand its a nice picture he mused on it for a while i was a bit younger than adam and i skirmed my knee or some such and your ma she came up and got me to my feet my mother and jack mercy were arguing and your ma took me into the kitchen and put something cool on my knee and talked real nice to me why were you at the ranch my ma wanted me to stay here she couldnt take care of me proper she was broke and she got sick a lot her familyd kicked her out it was drugs she had a weakness for them its because she was alone so much but he wouldnt have me even though i was his own blood she moistened her lips ignored the pain as the rope bit in your mother told you that she told me what was he pushed back his hat and his eyes were clear jack mercy knocked her up one of the times he was down in bozeman and looking for action she told him as soon as she knew but he called her a whore and left her flat his eyes changed went glassy with rage my mother wasnt a whore she did what she had to do thats all whores are no damn good worthless they spread their legs for anybody ma only went on her back for money when she had to and she didnt do it regular until after hed planted me and left her without a choice hadnt she told him that tearfully time and time again throughout his life what the hell was she supposed to do you tell me will what the hell was she supposed to do alone and pregnant with that son of a bitch calling her a filthy lying whore i dont know her hands were trembling now from the effort from the fear because his eyes werent clear any longer nor were they glassy they were mad it was difficult for her damn near impossible she told me time and time again how she begged and pleaded with him how he turned his back on her on me his own son she couldve gotten rid of me you know that she couldve had an abortion and been done with it but she didnt she told me she didnt because i was jack mercys kid and she was going to make him do right by both of us he had money he had plenty but all he did was toss a few lousy dollars at her and walk out she began to see too well the bitterness of the woman planting the bitter seeds in the child im sorry jim maybe he didnt believe her he shouldve he slammed his fist on the rock hed done it with her hed come to her regular promised her hed take care of her she told me how he promised her and she believed him and even when she had me took me to him to show him i had his eyes and his hair he turned her away so she had to go back to missoula and beg her family to help her out its because he was married to louella then snazzy louella and hed just got her pregnant with tess so he didnt want me he figured he had a son coming but he was wrong i was the only son he was going to get you had a chance to hurt lily in the cave when cooke had her he was too good with a rope she thought she couldnt budge the knots you didnt i wouldnt hurt her i thought about it sure early on when i first found out what hed done in his will i thought about it but theyre kin he drew a deep breath rubbed the side of his hand where hed bruised it on the rock i promised my ma id come back to mercy id get what was mine by right of birth she was sickly having me made her sickly thats why she needed the drugs to help her get through the day but she done her best for me she told me all about my father all about mercy shed sit for hours and tell me about all of it and what id do when i was old enough to go right up to his face and tell him i wanted what was mine wheres your mother now jim she died they said the drugs killed her or she used them to kill herself but it was jack mercy who killed her will when he turned her away she was dead from then on when i found her lying there cold i promised her again id come to mercy and do what she wanted you found her there was sweat pouring down her face now the heat had eased from the air but sweat ran and dribbled into the raw skin of her wrists to sting im sorry so sorry and she was desperately i was sixteen we were in billings then and i did some work at the feedlots when i could she was stone dead when i came home and found her lying there in piss and vomit she shouldnt have died that way he killed her will what did you do then i figured on killing him that was my first thought id had a lot of practice killing stray cats and dogs mostly i used to pretend they had his face when i carved them up only had a pocketknife to work with back then her stomach rolled rose up to her throat and was swallowed down your family your mothers family i wasnt going to go begging there after theyd pushed her aside hell with them he picked up the stick stabbed it at the rock hell with them she couldnt hold off the shudders as he stabbed the rock over and over repeating that phrase while his face twisted then he stopped his face cleared and he tapped the stick musically like a man keeping time and id made a promise he continued i went to mercy and i faced him down he laughed at me called me the bastard son of a whore i took a swing at him and he knocked me flat he said i wasnt no son of his but hed give me a job if i lasted a month hed give me a paycheck he turned me over to ham a fist squeezed her heart ham had someone found him was anyone helping him did ham know i always figured he did he never spoke of it but i figured it i look like the old man dont you think there was such hope such pathetic pride in the question willa nodded i suppose you do i worked for him i worked hard i learned and i worked harder he gave me a knife when i turned twentyone he slid it out of its sheath turned it under the moonlight a crocodile bowie with an eightinch blade the sawtooth top glittered like fangs that means something willa a man gives his son a fine knife like this and the sweat on her skin turned to ice he gave you the knife i loved him id have worked the skin off my hands for him and the bastard knew it i never asked him for a thing more because in my heart i knew when the time came hed give me what was mine by right i was his son his only son but he gave me nothing but this knife when the time came he gave it all to you to lily and to tess and he gave me nothing he inched forward closer to her the knife gleaming in his hand his eyes gleaming in the dark it wasnt right it wasnt fair she closed her eyes and waited for the pain charlie raced through the hills nose to the ground ears at alert ben rode alone grateful for the moonlight praying that the clouds that gathered thick in the west would hold off he couldnt afford to lose the light he could almost swear he smelled her himself that scent of hers soap and leather and something more that was only willa he wouldnt picture her hurt it would cloud his mind and he needed all his senses sharp this time his quarry knew the land as well as he his quarry was mounted and knew all the tricks he couldnt depend on willa slowing him down or leaving signs because he couldnt be sure she was no he wouldnt think of that he would only think of finding her and what he would do to the man when he did charlie splashed into a stream and whined as he lost the scent ben wlked his horse into the water stood for a moment listening plotting praying theyd follow the water for a while he decided thats what he would have done they walked through the stream the water level stingy from the lack of rain thunder rumbled and a bird screamed ben clamped down on the urge to hurry to kick his horse into a run he couldnt afford to rush until theyd picked up the trail again he saw something glint on the bank forced himself to dismount water ran cold over his boots as he walked through the stream bent picked it up an earring plain gold hoop the breath whooshed out of his lungs explosively as his fist clutched it shed taken to wearing baubles lately he remembered hed found it charming and sweet that little touch of female added to her denim and leather hed enjoyed telling himself it was for his benefit he tucked it into his front pocket swung back on his horse if she was clearheaded enough to leave him signs he was clearheaded enough to follow them he took his horse up the bank and let charlie pick up the trail ne shouldn t have done what he did voice shaking jim sawed at the rope tying her ankles he did it just to show me he didnt give a rats ass about me about you either no the tears that sprang to her eyes werent pity but sheer relief with her bound hands she reached forward to massage her legs they were horribly cramped he didnt care about either of us it made me crazy at first me and pickles were up at the cabin when i heard and i just went crazy thats why i killed the steer that way i had to kill something then i started thinking i had to get back at him will make him pay i wanted you to pay too at first you and tess and lily i didnt figure they had any right to what was mine what he shouldve left to me i thought id scare them off nobodyd get anything if i scared them off i left the cat on the porch i liked seeing lily scream and cry over it im sorry about that now but i wasnt thinking of her as kin then i just wanted her to go away back where shed come from and for mercy to go to hell can you cut my hands loose jim please my arms are cramped i cant not yet you just dont understand it all i think i do the feeling was back in her legs they were stinging as the blood surged back but she could run if she saw an opening he hurt you you wanted to hurt him back i had to what kind of man would i be if i took that from him but the thing is will i like killing things i figure thats from him too he smiled and a flash of lightning haloed him like a fallen saint nothing much you can do about what comes down through the blood he liked killing too remember that time he had you raise that calf right from pulling it clear of its mother you raised it up like a pet even named it blossom she murmured stupid name for a cow you loved that dumb cow won blue ribbons with it i remember how he took you out that day you were twelve maybe thirteen and he made you watch while he killed it for beef teaching you ranch life he said and you cried and you went off and got sick ham damn near came to blows with the old man over it you never had a pet since he took out a cigarette struck a match you had an old dog then died about a year after all that you never got another no i never did she brought her knees to her chest pressed her face to them as the memory washed over her im just telling you so youll see so youll understand whats in the blood he liked being the boss making people dance to his tune you like being the boss too its in the blood she could only shake her head will herself not to break stop it here now he rose got the canteen hed filled at the stream and brought it to her drink a little i didnt mean to get you so worked up im just trying to make you understand he stroked her hair his baby sisters pretty hair were in this together charlie surged forward clamoring over rocks he didn t bark or howl though his body vibrated often ben listened for the sounds of men of horses more dogs if he was on track then so was adam he could be sure of that but he heard nothing but the night he found the second earring lying on rock where wildflowers struggled through cracks he retrieved it touched it to his lips before tucking it away good girl he whispered just hang on a little longer he looked toward the sky the clouds were sneaking toward the moon and half the stars were gone rain so long prayed for was coming too soon s he drank watched his eyes there was affection in them terrifying you could have killed me months ago before anyone else i never wanted to hurt you youd gotten the shaft just like me i always figured that one day wed run mercy you and me i didnt even mind you being in charge youve got a real knack for it i do better when someone else points the way he sat back again took a drink himself capped the canteen hed lost track of time it was soothing sitting here with her under the wide sky reminiscing i didnt plan on killing pickles didnt have a thing against him really oh he could be a pain in the butt with his complaining and argumentative ways but he didnt bother me any he just happened along i never figured hed come rolling up there just then thought i had more time id just planned on doing another steer leaving it out where one of the boys would come across it and get things heated up then i had to do it and will to tell the truth and shame the devil i got a taste for it you butchered him meats meat when it all comes down to it damn i could go for a beer right now wouldnt a beer go down smooth he sighed took off his hat to fan his face cooled off some but goddamn its close maybe were in for that rain weve been waiting for she looked up at the sky felt a jolt of alarm they were going to lose the moon if anyone was coming after her theyd be coming blind as bats she tested her legs again and thought they would do and he tapped the knife on the toe of her boot i dont know why i scalped him just came to me kind of a trophy i guess like hanging a rack on the wall of the den ive got a whole box of trophies buried east of here you know where those three cottonwood trees stand across from the far pasture yeah i know she fought to keep her eyes on his and off the knife i did all those calves that night seemed to me that would send those city girls running off and that would be that but they stuck had to admire that started me thinking a little but i just couldnt get past the mad of it he shook his head at his own stubbornness so when i picked up that kid hitchhiking i used her i wanted to do a woman he moistened his lips part of him knew it wasnt proper to talk of it with his little sister but he couldnt stop himself id never done a woman before i had a yen to do shelly you know zacks wife oh my god shes a pretty thing pretty hair couple times i went over to three rocks to play poker with the boys there i studied on it but i did that girl and i left her there right at the front door just to show jack mercy who was boss that was before the calves he said dreamily i remember now that was before they get all mixed up in my head until lily they do it was lily that changed things shes my sister i got that into my head when jc treated her like that hurt her like that she mightve died if i hadnt taken care of her isnt that right yes she wouldnt be sick refused to be you didnt hurt her i wouldnt have harmed a hair on her head he caught the joke slapped the rock and howled a hair on her head get it thats a good one he sobered the change abrupt and frightening i love her will i love her and you and tess just like a brother should and ill look out for you and you have to look out for me bloods thicker than water how do you want me to look out for you jim we got to have a plan get our stories together here i figure ill take you back and well tell everybody that somebody dragged you off you didnt see but i went off after you didnt have time to send out the alarm well say i chased him off scared him off ill fire a couple of shots he patted the rifle he ran offinto high country and i got you away safe thatll work wont it it could ill tell them i never saw his face he hit me ive probably got a bruise anyway im sorry about that but it works out real good well go back to the way things were all right couple months more and the ranch is free and clear i can be foreman now he saw her eyes flicker her instinctive cringe you dont mean it youre lying no im just thinking it over her heart began to thud at the rapid change of his moods we have to make sure it sounds right or elseþ youre lying he screamed it so that the rocks echoed you think i cant see it you think im too stupid to see whats going on in your head i take you back youll tell them everything youll turn me over your own brother because of ham wild with fury he sprang to his feet the knife in one hand the rifle in the other it was an accident there wasnt anything i could do but youll turn me over you care more about that old man than your own family hed never let her go and hed kill her before she got two yards so she pushed herself to her feet teetered once until she could brace them apart and faced him he was my family he tossed the rifle down grabbed her by the shirtfront with his free hand and shook her im your blood im the one who matters im a mercy same as you out of the corner of her eye she saw the knife wave and the clouds smothered the moon and killed the glint youll have to kill me jim and once you do you wont be able to run fast enough or hide deep enough theyll hunt you if ben or adam finds you first god help you why wont you listen his shout boomed over rock and hill and hung in the heavy air its mercy that counts i just want my share of mercy she closed her aching hands into fists stared into his desperate eyes i havent got any mercy to give you rearing back she thrust her stiffened hands into his stomach and whirled to run he caught her by the hair yanking back until stars erupted in front of her eyes sobbing in pain she rammed back with her elbow caught him hard but his grip stayed firm her feet slid out from under her and she would have gone down but for the hold on her hair ill make it quick he promised i know how ben stepped out of the shadows drop the knife his pistol was cocked aimed ready you so much as break the skin on her ill blow you to hell ill do more than break skin jim angled the knife under her chin his voice was dead calm again he felt the control seep back into him the command he was in charge the woman pressed against him was no longer his sister but just a shield all i do is jerk my wrist and shes dead before she hits the ground so are you jims eyes flickered over his rifle was just out of reach cautious he moved back a step keeping the knife edge at willas throat you give me five minutesstart and when im clear ill let her go no he wont she hissed as the knife bit in and the first trickle of blood oozed down her throat hell kill me she said calmly kept her eyes on bens its just a matter of when shut up will jim flicked the knife under her chin let the men handle this you want her mckinnon you can have her but you put down the gun and you step back until were mounted otherwise i do her here and you watch her die those are your choices ben skimmed his gaze from jims face to willas lightning shot overhead like lances illuminated the three of them standing on silvered rock he held the look until he saw her nod slowly in acknowledgment and he hoped in understanding are they he pulled the trigger the bullet hit just where hed aimed it dead between the eyes god bless her he thought as his hand finally shook she didnt flinch even when the knife clattered to the ground she didnt flinch she felt herself sway and rock now that no one was holding her up she saw the sky reel just as rain started to fall and she saw ben rushing toward her good shot she managed and to her mortification and relief she fainted she came to in his arms with her face wet and his mouth rushing over it just lost my balance yeah he was kneeling in the dirt rocking her like a baby as rain flooded down on them i know her ears were ringing like church bells though she knew it was cowardly she turned her face into his shoulder rather than turn it toward the body that must be sprawled beside them he said he was my brother he did it because of mercy because of my father because ofþ i heard him clear enough he pressed his lips to her hair then took off his hat and put it on her in a fruitless attempt to keep her dry damn idiot woman you were begging him to kill you i lost three lives listening to you goading him while i was climbing up i didnt know what else to do fear shed battled back opened wide and devoured her ham i dont know she was shaking now and he gathered her closer i dont know darling he was alive when i rode out okay then there was hope my hands oh jesus ben my hands he began to curse then hard and fast as he pulled out his knife and cut the rope away from the raw flesh oh baby it broke his heart and left him shattered willa he was still rocking her kneeling in the pouring rain when adam found them you re going to eat when i tell you to eat and eat what i tell you to eat bess stood over the bed and scowled v cant you leave me be for five damn minutes huddled in the bed as miserable as a scalded cat ham shoved at the tray she set over his lap i do and youre climbing out of bed next time you do im stripping you naked so you cant get past the door i spend six weeks flat on my back in the hospital and ive been out of that cursed hospital for over a week im alive for christs sake dont you use the lords name to me hamilton the doctor said two full weeks of bed rest with one hour twice a day of walking her chin jutted her head angled and she looked down her pug nose at him need i remind you you had a knife stick in your thick hide and you bled all over my clean kitchen floor you remind me every time you walk in here well then she looked over in approval as willa stepped in good you can try dealing with him ive got work to do giving her grief again ham he glowered as bess flounced out of the room the woman doesnt stop fussing over me im tying these sheets together and climbing out the window she needs to fuss just a little while longer we all do she sat on the edge of the bed gave him a thorough study he had good color again and some of the weight hed lost in the hospital was coming back on you look pretty good though i feel fine no reason i couldnt be up in the saddle his hands fumbled when she laid her head on his chest and cuddled awkward he patted her hair come on now will i aint no teddy bear grizzly bears more like it she grinned and kissed his whiskered cheek despite his embarrassed wriggles women always after a man when hes down its the only time youre going to let me pet you she sat back took his hand has tess been in she was in a while back came to say goodbye shed been blubbering over him too he remembered hugging and kissing hed nearly blubbered himself

my brother he could have said no and just let it die it wouldve been easier for her or it might have been but shed always been a tough one i dont know will the gods truth is i just dont know she nodded and told herself she would live with that too the never knowing when she got outside she saw lily already in tears and holding on to tess for dear life hey youd think i was going to africa to become a missionary tess sgueezed back her own tears its only california ill be back for a visit in a few months she patted lilys growing belly i want to be here when junior comes ill miss you so much

wished desperately for her usual excitement at the prospect of getting into the air and flying i dont want you to wait she made herself look up at him into those patient eyes weve already said goodbye

what she was doing exactly what she was doing she rushed past gate after gate telling herself that how was she supposed to live on a horse ranch in montana she had her career to think of her laptop bumped against her hip she had a new screenplay to start a novel to work on she belonged in la swearing she spun around and ran back pushing through other people who rushed in the opposite direction nate she saw his hat on the downward glide of the escalator and doubled her pace nate wait a minute he was already at the bottom when she clambered her way down out of breath she stood in front of him a hand pressed to her speeding heart she looked into his eyes im not in love with you she said without a blink watched his eyes narrow see that smart guy i can look right at you and lie and with a laugh she jumped into his arms oh what the hell i can work anywhere he kissed her set her on her feet again okay lets go home my bags yheyll come back she looked over her shoulder and said a spiritual goodbye to la aansf qvnm w prxl ewnea you vvs rv im not he scooped her out the door then up into his arms and into a wild circle im patient s en found willa running wire along the fence line that separated lree rocks from mercy it made him realize he should have been doing e same still he dismounted strolled over to her need a hand no ive got it i was wondering how ham was getting on hes cranky as a constipated bear id say hes coming along fine good let me do that for you i know how to run fence just let me do it for you he yanked the wire from her stepping back she set her hands on her hips youve been coming around here a lot wanting to do things for me its got to stop why youve got your own land to worry about i can run mercy run every damn thing he muttered the term of the wills done ben you dont have to check things over around here anymore his eyes werent friendly when they flickered under the brim of his hat you think thats all there is to it i dont know you havent been interested in much else lately whats that supposed to mean what it says you havent exactly been a regular visitor in my bed the st few weeks ive been occupied well now im occupied so go run your own wire he braced his legs apart much as shed braced her own and faced her be aeen the fence posts this lines as much mine as yours yhen you shouldve been checking it same as me he tossed the wire down between them like a boundary between them ween their land okay you want to know whats going on with me ill you he tugged two thin gold hoops out of his pocket and shoved them nto her hand oh she frowned down at them id forgotten about them i havent hed kept themþagod knew why when every time he looked it them he relived the night the dark the fear and each time he looked at them he wondered if hed have found her in time if she hadnt been smart enough strong enough to leave a trail so you found my earrings she tucked them in her own pocket yeah i found them and i climbed up that ridge listening to him screamng at you saw him holding a knife to your throat watched a line of blood un down your skin where he nicked you instinctively she pressed her hand to her throat there were times when she could still feel it there the keen point of the knife her father had put in a killers hand its done she told him i dont much like going back there i go back there plenty i can see that flash of lightning your eyes in that flash of lightning when you knew what i was going to do when you trusted me to do it she hadnt closed her eyes he remembered shed kept them open level watching as he squeezed the trigger i put a bullet in a man about six inches from your face its given me some bad moments im sorry she reached for his hand but dropped her own when he pulled back stayed on his own land you killed someone for me i can see how that would change your feelings thats not it well maybe it is maybe thats what did it he turned away paced looked up at the sky maybe it was always there anyway all right then she was grateful his back was to her so he couldnt see the way she had to squeeze her eyes tight bite down on her lip to keep from weeping i understand and im grateful theres no need to make this hard on either of us hard hell that doesnt come close he tucked his hands in his back pockets and contemplated the long line of fence it was all that separated them he mused those thin lines of barbedged wire youve been underfoot and causing me frustration most all of my life youre on my land she shot back wounded whos under whose feet i guess i know you better than most i know your flaws well enough youve got a bundle of them ornery meantempered exasperating youve got brains but your guts get in the way of them half the time but knowing the flaws is half the battle she kicked him hard enough to make him stumble into his own horse he picked up the hat shed knocked off his head brushed it over the leg of his jeans as he turned now i could wrestle you down for that and itd probably turn into something else just try it you see thats the damnedest thing he shook a finger at her that look right there the one youre wearing on your face right now when i think it through thats the one that did it to me did what had me falling in love with you she dropped the hammer shed picked up to hit him with in what i figure you heard me the first time you got ears like a damn alley cat he scratched his chin settled his hat back into place i think youre going to have to marry me willa i dont see a way around it and i tell you ive been looking is that so she bent down picked up the hammer again and tapped it against her palm have you yeah he eyed the hammer grinned he didnt think shed use it or if she tried he figured hed be quick enough to avoid a concussion id have found one if thered been a way you knowþhe started toward her circlingþi used to think i wanted you to distraction because you were so contrary then when i had you i decided i still wanted you because i didnt know how long id keep you keep coming on she said coolly and youll have a dent in your big head he kept coming on then it kept creeping up on me why no one ever pulled at me the way you do ever made me miss them five minutes after i walked out the door the way you do when you werent safe i was crazy now that you are i figure the only way to handle things is to marry you thats your idea of a proposal youve never had better and with your prickly attitude you wont get better he timed it grabbed the hammer out of her hand and tossed it over the fence no point in saying no will ive got my mind set on it thats what im saying she crossed her arms until i get better he sighed heavily hed been afraid it would come to this all right then i love you i want you to marry me i dont want to live my life without you will that do its some better her heart was so full she was surprised it wasnt spilling over wheres the ring ring for gods sake will i dont carry a ring around with me riding fence perplexed he pushed back his hat you never wear rings anyway ill wear the one you give me he opened his mouth to complain shut it again and grinned is that a fact thats a fact damn ben what took you so long she stepped over the wire and into his arms the end
