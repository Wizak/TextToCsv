 chapter one many months have passed much has happened and much has slipped from my memory insignificant details have stuck with me while important things have gotten away some things i know only from third parties and more i can only guess how often have my witnesses perjured themselves it did not occur to me till this time of enforced inactivity befell me that an important tradition was being overlooked that no one was recording the deeds of the company i dithered then it seemed a presumption for me to take up the pen i have no training i am no historian nor even much of a writer certainly i dont have croakers eye or ear or wit so i shall confine myself to reporting facts as i recall them i hope the tale is not too much colored by my own presence within it nor by what it has done to me with that apologia herewith this addition to the annals of the black company in the tradition of annalists before me the book of lady lady annalist captain chapter two the elevation was not good the distance was extreme but willow swan knew what he was seeing theyre getting their butts kicked armies contended before the city dejagore at the center of a circular hillencompassed plain swan and three companions watched blade grunted agreement cordy mather swans oldest friend said nothing he just tried to kick the stuffing out of a rock the army they favored was losing swan and mather were whites blond and brunette hailing from roses a city seven thousand miles north of the killing ground blade was a black giant of uncertain origins a dangerous man with little to say swan and mather had rescued him from crocodiles a few years earlier he had stuck the three were a team swan cursed softly steadily as the battle situation worsened the fourth man did not belong the team would not have had him if he volunteered people called him smoke officially he was the fire marshall of taglios the citynation whose army was losing in reality he was the taglian court wizard he was a nutbrown little man whose very existence annoyed swan thats your army out there smoke willow growled it goes down you go down bet the shadowmasters would love to lay hands on you sorceries yowled and barked on the battlefield maybe make marmalade out of you unless youve cut a deal already ease up willow mather said hes doing something swan looked at the butternutcolored runt sure enough but what smoke had his eyes closed he mumbled and muttered sometimes his voice crackled and sizzled like bacon in an overheated pan he aint doing nothing to help the black company you quit talking to yourself you old buzzard we got a problem our guys are getting whipped you want to try to turn that around before i turn you over my knee the old man opened his eyes he stared across the plain his expression was not pleasant swan doubted that the little geeks eyes were good enough to make out details but you never knew with smoke with him everything was mask and pretense dont be a moron swan im one man too little and too old there are shadowmasters down there they can stomp me like a roach swan fussed and grumbled people he knew were dying smoke snapped all i can doall any of us can dois attract attention do you really want the shadowmasters to notice you theyre just the black company eh they took their pay they take their chances even if forty thousand taglians go down with them smokes lips shrank into a mean little prune on the plain a human tide washed around a mound where the black company standard had been planted for a last stand the tide swept on toward the hills you wouldnt be happy about the way things are going would you swans voice was dangerous no longer carping smoke was a political animal worse than a crocodile crocs might eat their young but their treacheries were predictable though irked smoke replied in a voice almost tender they have accomplished more than we dreamed the plain was dense with the dead and dying man and beast mad war elephants careened around respecting no allegiance only one taglian legion had maintained its integrity it had fought its way to a city gate and was covering the flight of other taglians flames rose beyond the city from a military encampment the company had scored that much success against the apparent victors smoke said theyve lost a battle but they saved taglios they slew one of the shadowmasters theyve made it impossible for the others to attack taglios those will spend their remaining troops recapturing dejagore swan sneered just pardon me if i dont dance for joy i liked those guys i didnt like the way you planned to shaft them smokes temper was strained they werent fighting for taglios swan they wanted to use us to hammer through the shadowlands to khatovar which could be worse than a shadowmasters conquest swan knew rationalization when he stepped in it and because they wouldnt lick your boots even if they were willing to save your asses from the shadowmasters you figure its handy them getting caught here a pity say i wouldve been some swell show watching your footwork if theyd come up winners and you had to deliver your end of the bargain ease up willow mather said swan ignored him call me a cynic smoke but id bet about anything you and the radisha had it scoped out to screw them from the start eh wouldnt do to have them slice through the shadowlands but why the hell not i never did get that part it aint over yet swan blade said wait smoke going to get his turn to cry the others gawked at blade he spoke so seldom that when he did they knew it meant something what did he know swan asked you see something i missed cordy snapped damn it will you calm down why the hell should i the whole damned world is swamped by conniving old farts like smoke they been screwing the rest of us since the gods started keeping time look at this little poof keeps whining about how hes got to lay low and not let the shadowmasters find out about him i think that means hes got no balls that lady you know who she used to be she had balls enough to face them you give that half a think youll realize how she laid more on the line than this old freak ever could calm down willow calm down hell it aint right somebodys got to tell old farts like this to go suck rocks blade grunted agreement but blade didnt like anyone in authority swan not as upset as he put on noted that blade was in position to whack the wizard if he got obnoxious smoke smiled swan once upon a time all us old farts were young loudmouths like you mather stepped between them enough instead of squabbling how about we get out of here before that mess catches up with us remnants of the battle swirled around the toes of the foothills we can gather the garrisons from the towns north of here and collect everybody at ghoja swan agreed sourly yeah maybe some of the company made it he glowered at smoke the old man shrugged if some get out they can train a real army theyd have time enough now yeah and if the prahbrindrah drah and the radisha was to get off their butts they might even line up a few real allies maybe come up with a wizard with a hair on his ass one who wouldnt spend his whole life hiding out in the weeds mather started down the back of the hill come on blade let them bicker after several seconds smoke confessed hes right swan lets get on with it willow tossed his long golden hair looked at blade blade jerked his head toward the horses below the hill all right swan took a last look at the city and plain where the black company had died but whats right is right and whats wrong is wrong and whats practical is practical and whats needful is necessary lets go swan walked he would remember that remark he was determined to have the last word bullshit smoke thats bullshit i seen a new side of you today i dont like it and i dont trust it im going to watch you like your conscience they mounted up and headed north chapter three in those days the company was in service to the prahbrindrah drah of taglios that prince was too easygoing to master a numerous factious people like the taglians but his natural optimism and forgiving nature were offset by his sister the radisha drah a small dark hard woman the radisha had a will of sword steel and the conscience of a hurtling stone while the black company and the shadowmasters contested possession of dejagore or stormgard the prahbrindrah drah held an audience three hundred miles to the north the prince stood five and a half feet tall though dark his features were caucasic he glowered at the priests and engineers before him he wanted to throw them out but in godridden taglios no one offended the priesthoods he spied his sister signalling from the shadowed rear of the chamber excuse me he walked out bad manners they would tolerate he joined the radisha what is it not here bad news not now the radisha strode off majarindi looked unhappy he got his hand caught in a monkey trap he insisted we build a wall because shaza has been having holy visions but once the others demanded a share he sang a different song i asked if shaza had begun having unvisions he wasnt amused good the radisha led her brother through tortuous passages the palace was ancient additions were cobbled on during every reign no one knew the labyrinth whole except smoke the radisha went to one of the wizards secret places a room sheltered from eavesdroppers by the old mans finest spells the prahbrindrah drah shut the door well a pigeon brought a message from smoke bad news our mercenaries have been defeated at stormgard the shadowmasters called dejagore stormgard badly is there any other yes before the appearance of the shadowmasters taglios had been a pacifist state but when that danger first beckoned the prahbrindrah had exhumed the ancient strategikons were they annihilated routed how badly did they hurt the shadowmasters is taglios in danger they shouldnt have crossed the main they had to harry the survivors from ghoja ford theyre the professionals sis we said we wouldnt secondguess or interfere we didnt believe they could win at ghoja so were way ahead give me details a pigeon isnt a condor the radisha made a face they marched down with a mob of liberated slaves took dejagore by stealth destroyed stormshadow and wounded shadowspinner but today moonshadow appeared with a fresh army casualties were heavy on both sides moonshadow may have been killed but we lost some of the troops retreated into the city the rest scattered most of the mercenaries including the captain and his woman were killed lady is dead thats a pity she was exquisite youre a lustful ape i am arent i but she did stop hearts wherever she went and never noticed the only man she saw was her captain that croaker character are you miffed because he only had eyes for her she gave him a savage look whats smoke doing fleeing north blade swan and mather will try to rally the survivors at ghoja i dont like that smoke shouldve stayed down there rallied them there to support the men in the city you dont give away ground youve gained smoke is scared the shadowmasters will find out about him they dont know that would surprise me the prahbrindrah shrugged whats he saving himself for im going down there she laughed what you cant those idiot priests would steal everything but your eyes stay keep them occupied with their idiot wall ill go and ill kick smokes butt till he gets off it and does something the prince sighed youre right but go quietly they behave better when they think youre watching they didnt miss me last time dont leave me twisting in the wind theyre hard to deal with when they know more than i do ill keep them off balance she patted his arm go shock them with your turnaround work them into a wall building frenzy get benevolent toward whichever cult shows the most productivity get them cutting each others throats the prahbrindrah grinned boyishly that was the game he loved that was the way to accumulate power get the priests to disarm themselves chapter four it was a bizarre little parade at its head was a black thing that could not decide if it was a tree stump or someone weirdly built carrying a box under one arm behind that a man floated a yard off the ground feet foremost inelegantly sprawled an arrow had pierced his chest it still protruded from his back he was alive but barely behind the floating man was another with a lance through him he drifted a dozen feet up alive and in pain sometimes writhing like an animal with a broken spine two riderless horses followed him both black stallions bigger than any war charger crows by the hundred circled above coming and going like scouts the parade climbed the hills east of stormgard moving in twilight once it paused remained motionless twenty minutes while a scatter of taglian fugitives passed they saw nothing there was magic at work there the column continued moving by night the crows continued flying formed a rearguard watched for something several times they cawed at shifting shadows but settled down quickly false alarms the party halted ten miles from the beleaguered city the thing leading spent hours collecting brush and deadwood piled it in a deep crack in a granitic hillside then it seized the floating lance dragged its victim off stripped him down a bitter remote whispering voice exclaimed this isnt one of the taken when the mans mask came off the crows became raucous discussing arguing the leader asked who are you what are you where did you come from the injured man did not respond maybe he was beyond communication maybe he did not speak that language maybe he was stubborn torture produced no answers the inquisitor tossed the man into the woodpile waved a hand the pile burst into flame the stump thing used the lance to keep its victim from escaping the burning man had a bottomless well of energy there was sorcery at work here the burning man was the shadowmaster moonshadow his army had triumphed outside stormgard but his own fortune had been inglorious the party did not move on till the shadowmaster was consumed the fire burned to ashes and the ashes cooled the stump thing gathered the ashes as it travelled it disposed of those pinch by pinch the man with the arrow in him bobbed in the stump things wake the stallions brought up the rear the crows maintained their patrols once a large catlike thing came too near and they went into paroxysms the stump did something mystical the black leopard wandered away absent of mind chapter five a slight figure in ornate black armor strained savagely a corpse toppled off the heap of corpses piled upon the figure the shift in weight made it possible to wriggle out of the heap free the figure lay motionless for several minutes panting inside a grotesque helmet then it pulled itself into a sitting position after another minute the figure struggled out of its gauntlets revealed delicate hands slim fingers plucked at the fastenings holding its helmet that came away too long black hair fell free around a face to stun a man inside all that ugly black steel was a woman i have to report those moments that way because i dont recall them at all i remember a dark dream a nightmare featuring a black woman with fangs like a vampire nothing else my first clear recollection is of sitting beside the heap of corpses with my helmet in my lap i was panting only vaguely aware that i had gotten out of the pile somehow the stench of a thousand cruel gut wounds filled the air like the stink of the largest rawest sewer in the world it was the smell of battlefields how many times had i smelled it a thousand and still i wasnt used to it i gagged nothing came up i had emptied my stomach into my helmet while i was under the pile i had a vague recollection of being terrified that i would drown in my own vomit i started shaking tears rolled stinging hot tears of relief i had survived i had lived ages beyond the measure of most mortals but i had lost none of my desire for life as i caught my breath i tried to put together where i was what i was doing there besides surviving my last clear memories werent pleasant i remembered knowing that i was about to die i couldnt see much in the dark but i didnt need to see to know we had lost had the company turned the tide croaker would have found me long ago why hadnt the victors there were men moving on the battlefield i heard low voices arguing moving my way slowly i had to get out of there i got up managed to stumble four steps before i fell on my face too weak to move another inch thirst was a demon devouring me from the inside out my throat was so dry i couldnt whine id made noise the looters were quiet now they were sneaking toward me after one more victim where was my sword i was going to die now no weapon and no strength to use one if i found one before they found me i could see them now three men backlighted by a faint glow from dejagore small men like most of the shadowmasters soldiers neither strong nor particularly skilled but in my case they needed neither strength nor skill could i play dead no they wouldnt be deceived corpses would be cool now damn them before they killed me they would do more than just rob me they wouldnt kill me they would recognize the armor the shadowmasters werent fools they knew who id been they knew what i carried inside my head treasures they dreamed about getting out there would be rewards for my capture maybe there are gods a racket broke out behind the looters sounded like a sally from dejagore some kind of spoiling raid mogaba wasnt sitting on his hands waiting for the shadowmasters to come to him one of the looters said something in a normal voice someone told him to shut up the third man entered his opinion an argument ensued the first man didnt want to investigate the uproar hed had enough fighting the others overruled him the fates were kind two responsible soldiers handed me a life i lay where id fallen resting for several minutes before i got onto hands and knees and crawled back to the mound of bodies i found my sword an ancient and consecrated blade created by carqui in the younger days of the domination a storied blade but no one not even croaker had heard its tale i crawled toward the hummock where when id seen him last my love had been making his final stand just him and murgen and the company standard trying to stem the rout it seemed an all night trek i found a dead soldier with water in his canteen i drained it and went on my strength grew as i crept by the time i reached the hummock i could totter along upright i found nothing there just dead men croaker was not among them the company standard was gone i felt hollow had the shadowmasters taken him they would want him badly for crushing their army at ghoja for taking dejagore for killing stormshadow i could not believe they had him it had taken me too long to find him no god no fate could be so cruel i cried the night grew quiet the sortie had withdrawn the looters would return now i started moving stumbled into a dead elephant and almost shrieked thinking i had walked right into a monster the elephants had carried all kinds of clutter some might be useful i scrounged a few pounds of dried food a skin of water a small jar of poison for arrowheads a few coins whatever caught my fancy then i walked northward determined to reach the hills before sunrise i discarded half my plunder before i got there i hurried enemy patrols would be out looking for important bodies come first light what could i do now besides survive i was the last of the black company there was nothing left something came into me like a lost memory resurfacing i could turn back time i could become what i had been trying not to think did not help i remembered and the more i remembered the more angry i became anger shaped me till all my thoughts were of revenge as i started into the hills i surrendered those monsters who had raped my dreams had written their own decrees of doom i would do whatever it took to requite them chapter six longshadow paced a room ablaze with light so brilliant he seemed a dark spirit trapped in the mouth of the sun he clung to that one crystal walled mirrored chamber where no shadow ever formed unless called forth by dire exigency his fear of shadows was pathological the chamber was the highest in the tallest tower of the fortress overlook south of shadowcatch a city on the southern edge of the world south of overlook lay a plateau of glittering stone where isolated pillars stood like forgotten supports for the sky though construction had been underway for seventeen years overlook was incomplete if longshadow did finish it no force material or supernatural would be able to penetrate it strange deadly terrifying things hungered for him lusted for freedom from the plain of glittering stone they were shadow things that could catch up with a man as suddenly as death if he didnt cling to the light longshadows sorcery had shown him the battle at stormgard four hundred miles north of shadowcatch he was pleased his rivals moonshadow and stormshadow had perished shadowspinner had been injured a touch here a touch there subtly would keep shadowspinner weak but he couldnt be killed oh no not yet dangerous forces were at work shadowspinner would have to be the breakwater against which the storm spent its energies those mercenaries in stormgard should be given every chance to sap spinners troop strength he was far too strong now that he had possession of all three northern shadow armies subtlety subtlety each move had to be made with care spinner wasnt stupid he knew who his most dangerous enemy was if he rid himself of the taglians and their free company leaders hed turn on overlook immediately and she was out there somewhere shuffling counters in her own game not in the ripeness of her power but deadly as a krite even so and there was the woman whose knowledge could be invaluable alone a treasure to be harvested by any adventurer he needed a catspaw he couldnt leave overlook the shadows were out there waiting infinitely patient he caught a flicker of darkness from the corner of his eye he squealed and flung himself away it was a crow just a damned curious crow fluttering around outside a catspaw there was a power in the swamps north of that miserable taglios it festered with grievances real and imagined it could be seduced it was time he lured that power into the game but how without leaving overlook something stirred on the plain of glittering stone the shadows were watching waiting they sensed the rising intensity of the game chapter seven i slept in a tangle of brush in a hollow id fled through olive groves and precariously perched hillside paddies running out of hope till id stumbled onto that pocket wilderness in a ravine i was so far gone id just crawled in hoping fate would be kind a crows call wakened me from another terrible dream i opened my eyes the sun reached in through the brush it dappled me with spots of light id hoped nobody could see me in there but that proved a false hope someone was moving around the edge of the bushes i glimpsed one then another damn the shadowmasters men they moved back a little and whispered i saw them for just a moment but they seemed troubled less like hunters than the hunted curious theyd spotted me i knew otherwise they wouldnt be back there behind me murmuring too low for me to catch what they said i couldnt turn toward them without showing them i knew they were there i didnt want to startle them they might do something id regret the crow called again i started turning my head slowly i froze there was another player here a dirty little brown man in a filthy loincloth and tattered turban he squatted behind the brush he looked like one of the slaves croaker had freed after our victory at ghoja did the soldiers know he was there did it matter he wasnt likely to be any help i was lying on my right side on my arm my fingers tingled my arm was asleep but the sensation reminded me that my talent had shown signs of freshening since wed come down past the waist of the world i hadnt had a chance to test it for weeks i had to do something or they would my sword lay inches from my hand golden hammer it was a childs spell an exercise not a weapon at all just as a butcher knife isnt once it would have been no more work than dropping a rock now it was as hard as plain speech for a stroke victim i tried shaping the spell in my mind the frustration the screaming frustration of knowing what to do and being unable to do it but it clicked almost the way it had back when amazed pleased i whispered the words of power moved my fingers the muscles remembered the golden hammer formed in my left hand i jumped up flipped it raised my sword the glowing hammer flew true the soldier made a stabbedpig sound and tried to fend it off it branded its shape on his chest it was an ecstatic moment success with that silly childs spell was a major triumph over my handicap my body wouldnt respond to my will too stiff too battered and bruised for flight i tried to charge the second soldier mostly i stumbled toward him he gaped then he ran i was astonished i heard a sound like the cough of a tiger behind me a man came out of nowhere down the ravine he threw something the fleeing soldier pitched onto his face and didnt move i got out of the brush and placed myself so i could watch the killer and the dirty slave who had made the tiger cough the killer was a huge man he wore tatters of taglian legionnaires garb the little man came around the brush slowly considered my victim he was impressed he said something apologetic in taglian then something excited rapidly in dialect i found unfamiliar to the big man who had begun searching his victim i caught a phrase here and there all with a cultish sound but uncertain in this context i couldnt tell if he was talking about me or praising one of his gods i heard the foretold and daughter of night and the bride and year of the skulls id heard a daughter of shadow and a year of the skulls before somewhere in the religious chatter of godridden taglians but i didnt know their significance the big man grunted he wasnt impressed he just cursed the dead soldier kicked him nothing the little man fawned your pardon lady weve been killing these dogs all morning trying to raise a stake but theyre poorer than i was as a slave you know me oh yes mistress the captains lady he emphasized those last two words separately and heavily he bowed three times each time his right thumb and forefinger brushed a triangle of black cloth that peeped over the top of his loincloth we stood guard while you slept we should have realized you would need no protection forgive us our presumption gods did he smell have you seen anyone else yes mistress a few from afar running most of them and the shadowmasters soldiers they search but with no enthusiasm their masters didnt send many a thousand like these pigs he indicated the man i had dropped his partner was searching the body and a few hundred horsemen they must be busy with the city mogaba will give them hell if he can buying time for others to get clear the big man said nothing on this toad either jamadar the little man grunted jamadar its the taglian word for captain the little man had used it earlier with a different intonation when hed called me the captains lady i asked have you seen the captain the pair exchanged looks the little man stared at the ground the captain is dead mistress he died trying to rally the men to the standard ram saw it an arrow through the heart i sat down on the ground there was nothing to say id known it id seen it happen too but i hadnt wanted to believe it till that instant i realized id been carrying some small hope that id been wrong impossible that i could feel such loss and pain damn him croaker was just a man how did i get so involved i never meant it to get complicated this wasnt accomplishing anything i got up we lost a battle but the war goes on the shadowmasters will rue the day they decided to bully taglios what are your names the little man said im narayan lady he grinned id get thoroughly sick of that grin a joke on me its a shadar name he was gunni obviously do i look it he jerked his head at the other man who was shadar shadar men tend to be tall and massive and hairy this one had a head like a ball of kinky wire with eyes peering out i was a vegetable peddler till the shadowmasters came to gondowar and enslaved everyone who survived the fight for the town that would have been before wed come to taglios last year when swan and mather had been doing their inept best to stem the first invasion my friend is ram ram was a carter in taglios before he joined the legions why did he call you jamadar narayan glanced at ram flashed a grin filled with bad teeth leaned close to me whispered ram isnt very bright strong as an ox he is and tireless but slow i nodded but wasnt satisfied they were two odd birds shadar and gunni didnt run together shadar consider themselves superior to everyone hanging around with a gunni would constitute a defilement of spirit and narayan was lowcaste gunni yet ram showed him deference neither harbored any obviously wicked designs toward me at the moment any companion was an improvement on travelling alone i told them we ought to get moving more of them could show up what is he doing ram had a tenpound rock he was smashing the leg bones of the man hed killed narayan said ram thats enough were leaving ram looked puzzled he thought then he shrugged and discarded the rock narayan didnt explain his actions he told me we saw one fairsized group this morning maybe twenty men maybe we can catch up that would be a start i realized i was starving i hadnt eaten since before the battle i shared out what id taken off the dead elephant it didnt help much ram went at it like it was a feast now completely indifferent to the dead narayan grinned you see an ox come ram carry her armor two hours later we found twentythree fugitives on a hilltop they were beaten men apathetic so down they didnt care if they got away few still had their weapons i didnt recognize any of them not surprising wed gone into battle with forty thousand they knew me their manners and attitude improved instantly it pleased me to see hope blossom among them they rose and lowered their heads respectfully i could see the city and plain from that hilltop the shadowmasters troops were leaving the hills evidently recalled good wed have a little time before they picked it up again i looked at the men more closely they had accepted me already good again narayan had begun speaking to them individually some seemed frightened of him why what was it something was odd about that little man ram build us a fire i want a lot of smoke he grunted drafted four men headed downhill to collect firewood narayan trotted over grinning that grin followed by a man of amazing width most taglians are lean to the point of emaciation this one had no fat on him he was built like a bear this is sindhu mistress that i know by reputation sindhu bowed slightly he looked a humorless sort narayan added hell be a good man to help out i noted a red cloth triangle at sindhus waist he was gunni your help will be appreciated sindhu you two get this bunch sorted out see what resources we have narayan grinned made a small bow hustled off with his new friend i settled crosslegged separate from the rest faced the city closed out the world the golden hammer had come easily id try again i opened to what little talent i retained a peppercorn of fire formed in the bowl of my hands it was coming back there is no way to express my pleasure i concentrated on horses half an hour later a giant black stallion appeared trotted straight to me the men were impressed i was impressed i hadnt expected success and that beast was only the first of four to respond by the time the fourth arrived so had another hundred men the hilltop was crowded i assembled them weve lost a battle men some of you have lost heart too thats understandable you werent raised in a warrior tradition but this war hasnt been lost and it wont end while one shadowmaster lives if you dont have the stomach to stick it out stay away from me youd better go now i wont let you go later they exchanged worried glances but nobody volunteered to travel alone were going to head north well gather food weapons and men well train were coming back someday when we do the shadowmasters will think the gates of hell have opened still nobody deserted we march at first light tomorrow if youre with me then youre with me forever i tried to project a certainty that we could terrify the world when i settled for the night ram posted himself nearby my bodyguard whether or not i wanted one i drifted off wondering what had become of four black stallions that had not responded we had brought eight south they had been specially bred in the early days of the empire i had abandoned one could be more valuable than a hundred men i listened to whispers heard repeats of the terms narayan had used they troubled most of the men i noticed that ram had his bit of folded cloth too his was saffron he didnt keep it as fastidiously as did narayan or sindhu three men from two religions each with a colored cloth what was the significance narayan kept the fire burning he posted sentries he imposed a modest discipline he seemed altogether too organized for a vegetable dealer and former slave the dark dream the same as those before was particularly vivid though when day came i retained only an impression of a voice calling my name unsettling but i thought it just a trick of my mind somewhere somehow the night rewarded narayan with bounty enough to provide everyone a meager breakfast i led the mob out at first light as promised amidst reports that enemy cavalry were approaching the hills discipline was a pleasant surprise considering chapter eight dejagore is surrounded by a ring of hills the plain is lower than the land beyond the hills only a dry climate keeps that basin from becoming a lake portions of two rivers have been diverted to supply irrigation to the hill farms and water for the city i kept the band near one of the canals the shadowmasters were preoccupied with dejagore while they werent pressing me i wasnt interested in covering a lot of ground the future id chosen would be no easy conquest the chance that the enemy might appear encouraged discipline i hoped to keep that possibility alive till i instilled a few positive habits narayan i need your advice mistress well have trouble holding them together once they feel safe i always talked as though he ram and sindhu were extensions of myself they never protested i know mistress they want to go home the adventure is over he grinned his grin i was sick of it already were trying to convince them theyre part of something fated but they have a lot to unlearn that they did taglian culture was a religious confusion i hadnt begun to fathom tangled in caste systems which made no sense i asked questions but no one understood things were as they were it was the way theyd always been i was tempted to declare the mess obsolete but i didnt have the power i hadnt had that much power in the north some things cant be swept away by dictate i continued asking questions if i understood iteven a little i could manipulate the system i need a reliable cadre narayan men i can count on no matter what i want you to find those men as you say mistress so shall it be he grinned that might have been a defensive reflex learned as a slave still the more i saw of narayan the more sinister he seemed yet why he was essentially taglian low caste a vegetable vendor with a wife and children and a couple of grandchildren already last he had heard one of those backbone of the nation sorts quiet who just kept plugging away at life half the time he acted like i was his favorite daughter what was sinister in that ram had more to recommend him as strange he was twentythree and a widower his marriage had been a love match rare in taglios where marriages are always arranged his wife had died in childbirth bearing a stillborn infant that had left him bitter and depressed i suspect he joined the legions looking for death i didnt find out anything about sindhu he wouldnt talk until you forced him and he was creepier than narayan still he did what he was told did it well and asked no questions ive spent my entire life in the company of sinister characters for centuries i was wed to the dominator the most sinister ever i could cope with these small men none of the three were particularly religious which was curious religion pervades taglios every minute of every day of every life is a part of the religious experience is ruled by religion and its obligations i was troubled till i noted a generally reduced level of religious fervor i picked a man and quizzed him his answer was elementary there aint no priests here that made sense no society consists entirely of committed true believers and what these men had seen had been enough to displace the foundations of faith theyd been pulled out of their safe familiar ruts and had been thrown hard against facts the traditional answers didnt explain theyd never be the same once they took their experiences home taglios wouldnt be the same the band trebled in size i had better than six hundred followers hailing from all three major religions and a few splinter cults i had more than a hundred former slaves who werent taglian at all they could make good soldiers once they gained some confidence they had no homes to run to the band would be their home the problem with the mix was that every day was a holy day for somebody if wed had priests along there would have been trouble they began to feel safe that left them free to indulge old prejudices to grow lax in discipline to forget the war and most irritating to remember that i was a woman in law and custom taglian women are less favored than cattle cattle are less easily replaced women who gain status or power do so in the shadows through men they can influence or manipulate one more hurdle id have to leap maybe the biggest i summoned narayan one morning were a hundred miles from dejagore i wasnt in a good mood id had the dream again it had left my nerves raw were safe for the moment the confidence of the men in their safety showed as they started their day im going to make some major changes how many men are reliable he preened smug little rat a third maybe more if put to the test that many really i was surprised it wasnt evident to me you see only the other sort some men learned discipline and tolerance in the legions the slaves came out of bondage filled with hatred they want revenge they know no taglian can lead them against the shadowmasters some even sincerely believe in you for yourself thank you for that little man but most will have trouble following me maybe that fawning grin hint of cunning we taglians dont deal well with upheavals in the natural order the natural order is that the strong rule and the rest follow im strong narayan im like nothing taglios has ever seen i havent yet shown myself to taglios i hope taglios never sees me angry id rather spend my wrath on the shadowmasters he bowed several times suddenly frightened our ultimate destination remains ghoja you may pass that word well collect survivors there winnow them and rebuild but i dont intend to get there till we have this force whipped into shape yes mistress collect whatever weapons are available take no arguments redistribute them to the men you think reliable assign those men to march in the lefthand file the men to their right are to be religiously mixed they are to be separated from those they knew before dejagore that may cause trouble good i want to pinpoint its sources ill give it back with interest go on get them disarmed before they understand whats happening ram give him a hand but i can look out for myself ram his protection was a nuisance narayan did move fast only a few men had to be separated from their weapons by force organized according to my orders we marched all day till they were too exhausted to complain i halted them in the evening and had narayan form them for review with the reliables in the rear i donned my armor mounted one of the black stallions rode out to review them with little witchfires prancing about me there wasnt much to those i hadnt made large strides recapturing my talent the armor horse and fires formed the visible aspect of a character called lifetaker whom i had created before the company moved to the main to face the shadowmasters at ghoja in concert with croakers widowmaker she was supposed to intimidate the enemy by being something larger than life archetypally deadly my own men could use a little intimidation now in a land where sorcery was little more than a rumor the witchfires could be enough i passed the formation slowly studying the soldiers they understood the situation i was looking for that which i would not tolerate the man disinclined to do things my way i rode past again after centuries of watching people it wasnt difficult to spot potential troublemakers ram i pointed out six men send them away with the nothing they had when they joined us i spoke so my voice carried next winnowing those chosen will taste the lash and the third winnowing will be a celebration of death a stir passed through the ranks they heard the message the chosen six went sullenly i shouted at the others soldiers look at the man to your right now look at the man to your left look at me you see soldiers not gunni not shadar not vehdna soldiers were fighting a war against an implacable and united enemy in the line of battle it wont be your gods at your left and your right it will be men like those standing there now serve your gods in your heart if you must but in this world in the camp on the march on the field of battle you wont set your gods before me youll own no higher master till the last shadowmaster falls no reward or retribution of god or prince will find you more swiftly or surely than mine i suspected that was maybe pushing too hard too soon but there wasnt much time to create my cadre i rode off while they digested it i dismounted told ram dismiss them make camp send me narayan i unsaddled my mount settled on the saddle a crow landed nearby cocked its head several more circled above those black devils were everywhere you couldnt get away croaker had been paranoid about them hed believed they were following him spying on him even talking to him i thought it was the pressure but their omnipresence did get irritating no time for croaker he was gone i was walking a swords edge neither tears nor selfpity would bring him back during the journey north id realized that id done more than lose my talent at the barrowland id given up so id lost my edge during the yearplus since croakers fault his weakness hed been too understanding too tolerant too willing to give second chances hed been too optimistic about people he couldnt believe there is an essential darkness shadowing the human soul for all his cynicism about motives hed believed that in every evil person there was good trying to surface i owe my life to his belief but that doesnt validate it narayan came sneaky as a cat he gave me his grin weve gained ground narayan they took that well enough but we have a long way to go the religion problem mistress some but thats not the worst hurdle ive overcome such before i smiled at his surprise i see doubts but you dont know me you know only what youve heard a woman who abandoned a throne to follow the captain eh but i wasnt the spoiled heartless child you imagine not a brat with a pinch of talent who fell heir to some petty crown she didnt want not a dunce who ran off with the first adventurer whod have her little is known except that you were the captains lady he admitted some think as you suggest your companions scarcely hinted at your antecedents i think youre much more but how much more i dare not guess ill give you a hint i was amused for all narayan seemed to want me to be something untraditional he was startled whenever i didnt behave like a taglian woman sit narayan its time you understood where youre placing your bets he looked me askance but settled the crow watched him his fingers teased at that fold of black cloth narayan the throne i gave up was the seat of an empire so broad you couldnt have walked it east to west in a year it spanned two thousand miles from north to south i built it from a beginning as humble as this i started before your grandfathers grandfather was born and it wasnt the first empire i created he grinned uneasily he thought i was lying narayan the shadowmasters were my slaves powerful as they are they disappeared during a great battle twenty years ago i believed them dead till we unmasked the one we killed in dejagore im weakened now two years ago there was a great battle in the northernmost region of my empire the captain and i put down a wakening evil left over from the first empire i created to succeed to prevent that evil from breaking loose i had to allow my powers to be neutralized now im winning them back slowly and painfully narayan couldnt believe he was the son of his culture i was a woman but he wanted to believe he said but youre so young in some ways i never loved before the captain this shell is a mask narayan i entered this world before the black company passed this way the first time im old narayan old and wicked ive done things no one would believe i know evil intrigue and war like theyre my children i nurtured them for centuries even as the captains lover i was more than a paramour i was the lieutenant his chief of staff im the captain now narayan while i survive the company survives and goes on and finds new life im going to rebuild narayan it may wear another name for a while but behind the domino it will be the black company and it will be the instrument of my will narayan grinned that grin you may be her indeed i may be who soon mistress soon its not yet time suffice it to say that not everyone greeted the return of the black company with despair his eyes went shifty say that then i decided not to press him i needed him pliable for the moment were building an army were woefully beggared of an armys most precious resource veteran sergeants we have no one who can teach tonight before they eat sort the men by religion organize them in squads of ten three from each cult plus one nontaglian assign each squad a permanent place in the camp and the order of march i want no intercourse between squads till each can elect a leader and his second theyd better work out how to get along theyll be stuck in those squads another risk the men were not in the best temper but they were isolated from the priesthoods and culture which reinforced their prejudices their priests had done their thinking for them all their lives out here they had nobody but me to tell them what to do i wont approach ghoja before the squads pick leaders fighting amongst squad members should be punished set up whipping posts before you make the assignments send the squads to supper as you form them learning to cook together will help i waved him away he rose if they can eat together they can do anything together mistress i know each cult sustained an absurd tangle of dietary laws thus this approach it should undermine prejudice at its most basic level these men would not rid themselves of ingrained hatred but would set it aside around those with whom they served its easier to hate those you dont know than those you do when you march with someone and have to trust him with your life its hard to keep hating irrationally i tried to keep the band preoccupied with training those who had been through it with the hastily raised legions helped mainly by getting the others to march in straight lines sometimes i despaired there was just so much i could do there was only one of me i needed a firm power base before i dared the political lists fugitives joined us some went away again some didnt survive the disciplinary demands the rest strove to become soldiers i was free with punishments and freer with rewards i tried to nurture pride and subtly the conviction that they were better men than any who didnt belong to the band the conviction that they could trust no one who wasnt of the band i didnt spare myself i slept so little i had no time to dream or didnt remember that id dreamed every free moment i spent nagging my talent id need it soon it was coming back slowly too slowly it was like having to learn to walk again after a prolonged illness chapter nine though i wasnt trying to move quickly i outdistanced most of the survivors for loners and small groups foraging outweighed speed once i slowed to avoid reaching ghoja though more and more caught up not many decided to enlist already the band was recognizably alien it scared outsiders i guessed maybe ten thousand men had escaped the debacle how many would survive to reach ghoja if taglios was fortunate maybe half the land had turned hostile forty miles from ghoja and the main just inside territory historically taglian i ordered a real camp built with a surrounding ditch i chose a meadow on the north bank of a clean brook the south bank was forested the site was pleasant i planned to stay rest train till my foragers exhausted the countryside for days incoming fugitives had reported enemy light cavalry hunting behind them an hour after we began making camp i got a report of smoke south of the wood i walked the mile to the far side saw a cloud rising from a village six miles down the road they were that close trouble it had to be considered an opportunity unlikely at this stage narayan came running through the dusk mistress the shadowmasters men theyre making camp on the south side of the woods theyll catch us tomorrow his optimism had deserted him i thought about it do the men know the news is spreading damn all right station reliable men along the ditch kill anybody who tries to leave put ram in charge then come back yes mistress narayan scampered off at times he seemed a mouse he returned theyre grumbling let them as long as they dont run do the shadowmasters men know were this close narayan shrugged i want to know put out a picket line a quarter mile into the wood twenty good men theyre not to interfere with scouts coming north but theyre to ambush them headed back they wouldnt be expecting trouble going away use men who arent good for anything else to raise an embankment along the creek drive stakes into its face sharpen them find vines sink them in the water theres no room to maneuver on the south bank theyll have to come straight at us hard once youve got that started come back best get everybody busy and distract them from their fears i snapped narayan wait find out if any of the men can handle horses other than my mounts there were just a half dozen animals with the band all strays wed captured id had to teach ram to care for mine riding amongst taglians was restricted to highcaste gunni and rich shadar bullock and buffalo were the native work animals it was the tenth hour when narayan returned in the interim i prowled i was pleased i saw no panic no outright terror just a healthy ration of fear tempered by the certainty that chances of surviving were better here than on the run they feared my displeasure more than they feared an enemy not yet seen perfect i made a suggestion about the angle of the stakes on the face or the embankment then went to talk with narayan i told him well scout their camp now just us his grin was forced you and me yes mistress though id feel more comfortable if sindhu accompanied us can he move quietly i couldnt picture that bulk sneaking anywhere like a mouse mistress get him dont waste time well need all the darkness weve got narayan gave me an odd look took off we left a password crossed the creek narayan and sindhu stole through the woods as though to stealth born quieter than mice they took our pickets by surprise those had seen nothing of the enemy awfully sure of themselves sindhu grumbled the first id heard him volunteer an opinion maybe theyre plain stupid the shadowmasters soldiers hadnt impressed me with anything but their numbers we spied their campfires before i expected them theyd camped among the trees i hadnt foreseen that possibility damned inconsiderate of them narayan touched my arm diffidently mouth to ear he breathed sentries wait here he stole forward like a ghost returned like one two of them sound asleep walk carefully so we just strolled in to where i could see what i wanted i studied the layout for several minutes satisfied i said lets go one of the sentries had wakened he started up as sindhu drifted past firelight glistening off his broad naked back narayans hand darted to his waist his arm whipped his wrist snapped a serpent of black cloth looped around the sentrys neck narayan strangled him so efficiently his companion didnt waken sindhu took the other with a strip of scarlet cloth now i knew what peeked from their loincloths their weapons they rearranged their victims so they looked like they were sleeping with their tongues out all the while whispering cant that sounded ritualistic i said sindhu stay and keep watch warn us if they discover the bodies narayan come with me i hurried as much as darkness allowed once we reached camp i told narayan that was neatly done i want to learn that trick with the cloth the notion surprised him he didnt say anything collect the ten best squads arm them also the twenty men you think best able to handle horses ram ram arrived as i began readying my armor he grew troubled whats the matter now then i saw what hed done to my helmet what the hell is this i told you clean it not destroy it he was like a shy boy as he said this apes one aspect of the goddess kina mistress one of her names is lifetaker you see in that avatar her aspect is very like this armor next time ask help me into this ten minutes later i stood at the center of the group id had narayan assemble were going to attack them the point isnt glory or victory we just want to discourage them from attacking us were going in were doing a little damage then were getting out i described the encampment gave assignments drawing in the dirt beside a fire in and out dont waste time trying to kill them just hurt somebody a dead man can be left where he falls but a wounded man becomes a burden to his comrades whatever happens dont go beyond the far edge of their camp well retreat when they start getting organized grab any weapon you can ram capture every horse you can everybody if you cant grab weapons grab food or tools nobody risk anybodys life trying to grab just one more thing and lastly be quiet were all dead if they hear us coming narayan reported the dead sentries still undiscovered i sent him forward to eliminate as many more as he and sindhu could manage i had the main party cover the last two hundred yards in driblets a hundred twenty men moving at once no matter how they try make noise i looked into the camp men were stirring looked like it was near time to change the guard rams bunch joined us i donned my helmet turned my back on my men walked toward the only shelter in the camp it would belong to the commander i set the witchfires playing over me unsheathed my sword fires ran out its blade it was coming back the few southerners awake gawked the men poured into the camp stabbed the sleeping overwhelmed those who were awake i struck a man down reached the tent hacked it apart as the man within reacted to the uproar i wound up twohanded and struck off his head grabbed it by the hair held it high turned to check the progress of the raid the southerners were making no effort to defend themselves two hundred must have died already the rest were trying to get away could i have routed them so easily sindhu and narayan came running prostrated themselves banged their heads on the ground and gobbled at me in that cant they used crows fluttered through the trees raucous my men hurtled around hacking and slashing spending the wealth of fear theyd carried through the night narayan see what the survivors are doing quickly before they mount a counterattack sindhu help me control these men narayan ran off he came back in a few minutes theyve started gathering a quarter mile down the road they think a demon attacked them they dont want to come back their officers are telling them they cant survive if they dont recover their camp and animals that was true maybe another glimpse of the demon would encourage them to stay away i got the men into a ragged line advanced to the edge of the wood narayan and sindhu sneaked ahead i wanted warning if the southerners were inclined to fight id back off they fled again narayan said they killed those officers who tried to rally them fortune smiles i recall murmuring id have to take a closer look at this demon kina she must have some reputation i wondered why id never heard of her i withdrew to the captured encampment wed come into a lot of useful material ram get the rest of the band have them bring the stakes from the embankment narayan think about which men are least deserving of receiving arms there would be enough to go around now almost arms would be a trust and honor to be earned the change was dramatic youd have thought it was another ghoja triumph even those who hadnt participated gained confidence i saw it everywhere these men had a new feeling of selfworth they were proud to be part of a desperate enterprise and they gave me my due place in it i walked through the camp dropping hints that soon they would be part of something with power that had to be nurtured and continually fertilized with suspicion and distrust of everyone outside the band it takes time to forge a hammer more time than i would get probably it takes years even decades to create a force like the black company which had been carried forward on the crest of a wave of tradition here i was trying to magic up a golden hammer something gaudy but with no real substance deadly only to the ignorant and unprepared it was time for a ceremony alienating them from the rest of the world time for a blood rite that would bind them to one another and me i had the stakes from the embankment planted along the road south of the wood then i had all the dead southerners decapitated and their heads placed atop the stakes facing southward ostensibly warning travellers who shared their ambitions narayan and sindhu were delighted they hacked off heads with great enthusiasm no horror touched them none touched me either id seen everything in my time chapter ten swan lay in the shade on the bank of the main lazily watching his bobber float on a still deep pool the air was warm the shade was cool the bugs were too lazy to bother him he was half asleep what more could a man ask blade sat down catch anything nope dont know what id do if i did whats up the woman wants us he meant the radisha whom they had found waiting when theyd reached ghojamuch to smokes dismay shes got a job for us dont she always you tell her to stick it in her ear thought id save you that pleasure id rather youd saved me the walk im comfortable she wants us to drag smoke somewhere he dont want to go why didnt you say so swan pulled his line out of the water there was no bait on his hook and i thought there werent any fish in that crick he left his pole against a tree a statement of sorts wheres cordy probably there waiting he was watching jah i told him already swan looked across the river id kill for a pint of beer theyd been in the brewery business in taglios before the excitement swept them up blade snorted headed for the fortress overlooking ghoja ford the fort stood on the south bank of the main it had been built by the shadowmasters after their invasion of taglios had been repulsed to defend their conquests south of the river the fortress had been overwhelmed by the black company after the victory north of the river taglian artisans were reinforcing it and beginning a companion fortress on the north bank swan scanned the scabrous encampment west of the fortress eight hundred men lived there some were construction workers most were fugitives from the south one large group particularly irked him think jah has figured out that the woman is here jahamaraj jah was a powerhungry shadar priest he had commanded the mounted auxiliaries during the southern expedition his flight north had been so precipitous hed beaten swans party to the ford by several days i think hes guessed he tried to sneak a messenger across last night the radisha through swan ad forbidden anyone to cross the river she didnt want news of the disaster reaching taglios before its dimensions were known uhm messenger drowned cordy says jah thinks he made it blade chuckled wickedly he hated priests baiting them was his favorite sport all priests of whatever faith good thatll keep him out of our hair till we figure out what to do with him i know what to do political consequences swam cautioned that your solution to everything cut somebodys throat always slows them down the guards at the fortress gate saluted they were favorites of the radisha and though neither blade nor swan nor mather wanted it they commanded taglios defenses now swan said i got to learn to think in the long term blade never thought wed be back at this after the black company showed you got a lot to learn willow cordy and smoke waited outside the room where the radisha holed up smoke looked like he had a bad stomach like hed make a run for it if he got a chance swan said youre looking grim cordy just tired mostly of playing with the runt swan raised an eyebrow cordy was the calm one the patient guy the one who poured oil on the waters smoke must have provoked him good she ready whenever lets do it i got a river full of fish waiting better figure on them getting grey hair before you get back mather knocked pushed the wizard ahead of him the radisha entered the room from the side as swan closed the door here in private with men not from her own culture she didnt pretend to a traditional sex role did you tell them cordy willow exchanged glances with blade their old buddy on a nickname basis with the woman interesting what did he call her she didnt look like a cuddles not yet whats up swan asked the radisha said ive had my men mixing with the soldiers theyve heard rumors that the woman who was the lieutenant of the black company survived shes trying to pull the survivors together south of here best news ive heard in a while swan said he winked at blade is it i thought it was a crying shame to lose such a resource ill bet you have a low mind swan guilty hard not to once youve had a gander at her so she made it great gets us three off the hook gives you a professional to carry on that remains to be seen therell be difficulties cordy tell them twentysome men from the second just came in theyd stayed off the road to avoid the shadowmasters patrols about seventy miles south of here they took a couple prisoners the night before our guys grabbed them kina and a ghost army supposedly attacked their camp and killed most of them swan looked at blade at the radisha at cordy again i missed something whos kina and whats got into smoke the wizard was shaking like somebody had dunked him in icewater mather and blade shrugged they didnt know the radisha sat down get comfortable she chewed her lip this will be difficult to tell then just go straight at it swan said yes i suppose the radisha collected herself kina is the fourth side of the taglian religious triangle she belongs to none of the pantheons but terrifies everybody she isnt named lest naming invoke her shes very unpleasant fortunately her cult is small and proscribed membership is punishable by death the penalty is deserved the cults rites always involve torture and murder even so it persists its members awaiting someone called the foretold and the year of the skulls its an old dark religion that knows no national or ethnic bounds its members hide behind masks of respectability they sometimes call themselves the deceivers they live normal lives among the rest of the community anyone could belong few of the common people know they exist anymore swan didnt get it and said so dont sound much different from the shadar hada or khadi avatars the radisha smiled grimly those are ghosts of the reality hada and khadi were two aspects of the shadar death god jah could show you a thousand ways khadi is a kitten compared to kina jahamaraj jah was a devotee of khadi swan shrugged doubting he could tell the difference if they drew pictures hed given up trying to understand the welter of taglian gods each with his or her ten or twenty different aspects and avatars he indicated smoke whats with him he shakes any more well have to change his diaper smoke predicted a year of skullsa time of chaos and bloodshedif we employed the black company he didnt believe it would come he just wanted to scare my brother out of doing something that scared him but hes on record as having predicted it now theres a chance it might come sure come on swan frowned still lost let me get this straight theres a death cult around that makes jah and his khadi freaks look like a bunch of nancy boys that scares the guano out of anybody who knows who they are yes and they worship a goddess named kina that is the most common of many names why arent i surprised is there any god down here without more aliases than a twohundredyearold con man kina is the name given her by the gunni she has been called patwa kompara bhomahna and other names the gunni the shadar the vehdna all find ways to accept her into their belief systems many shadar who become her followers for example take her to be the true form of hada or khadi who is just one of her deceits gah all right ill bite theres a badass in the weeds called kina so how come me and cordy and blade never heard of her before the radisha appeared mildly embarrassed you were shielded youre outsiders from the north maybe so what did the north have to do with it but why the panic one garbled thing about this kina from a prisoner whos got no reason to tell the truth and smoke goes to wetting his pants and you start foaming at the mouth i got a little trouble taking you serious point taken you shouldnt have been shielded im sending you to check out the story swan grinned he had a lever not without you stop jacking us around tell us the whole story bad enough you messed with the black company you think youre going to mess us around because we werent born in taglios enough swan the radisha wasnt pleased smoke made a whining noise he shook his head whats with him willow demanded much more of that weirdness and he was going to strangle the old guy smoke sees a ghost in every shadow in your case hes afraid youre spies sent ahead by the black company sure moron thats another thing how come everybody is so damned twitchy about those guys they maybe kicked ass around here heading north but that was back at the dawn of time practically four hundred years ago the radisha ignored that kinas antecedents are uncertain shes a foreign goddess the legends say a prince of shadow tricked the most handsome of the lords of light out of his physical aspect for a year while he wore that he seduced mahi goddess of love and sired kina on her kina grew up more beautiful than her mother but empty without a soul without love or compassion but hungry to possess them her hunger couldnt be satisfied she preyed upon men and gods alike shadow and light among her names are eater of souls and vampire goddess she so weakened the lords of light that the shadows thought to conquer them and sent a horde of demons against them the lords of light were so pressed they begged kina for help she did help though why she did isnt explained she met the demons in battle overthrew them and devoured them and all their wickedness the radisha paused a moment then kina became much worse than she had been gaining the names devourer destroyer destructor she became a force beyond the gods outside the balance of light and shadow enemy of all she became a terror so great light and shadow joined forces against her her father himself tricked her into falling into an enchanted sleep blade muttered makes as much sense as the story of any other god meaning it dont squeaking smoke said kina is a personification of that force some call entropy to the radisha correct me if im wrong the radisha ignored him before kina fell asleep she realized shed been tricked she took a huge breath exhaled a minute fraction of her soulessence no more than a ghost of a ghost that specter wanders the world in search of living vessels it can possess and use to bring on the year of the skulls if that avatar can free enough souls and cause enough pain kina can be wakened swan chuckled like an old woman scolding you believe any of that stuff what i believe doesnt matter swan the deceivers believe if the rumor spreads that kina has been seen and theres any evidence to support it theyll preach a crusade of murder and torture wait she raised a hand the taglian people are ripe for an outburst of violence by damming the normal discharge for generations theyve created a reservoir of potential violence the deceivers would like that to explode to bring on the year of the skulls my brother and i would prefer to harness and direct that ferocity blade grumbled about the absurdities of the theological imagination and why didnt people have sense enough to smother wouldbe priests in their cradles the radisha said we dont think the deceivers have a formal hierarchical priesthood they seem to form loose bands or companies under an elected captain the captain appoints a priest an omen reader and so forth his authority is limited he has little influence outside his band unless hes done something to gain a reputation blade said they dont sound so bad to me the radisha scowled the main qualification of a priest seems to be education and probity toward his own kind the bands indulge in crimes of all sorts once a year they share out their spoils according to the priests estimation of the members contributions toward the glory of kina to support his decisions in the event of dispute the priest keeps a detailed chronicle of the bands activities fine and dandy swan said but how about we get to what you want us to do we supposed to drag smoke around to see if we can sniff out what really happened to the shadowmasters soldiers yes why bother i thought i just explained the radisha controlled herself if that was a true apparition of kina we have bigger troubles than we thought the shadowmasters may be the lesser half i warned you smoke squealed i warned you a hundred times but you wouldnt listen you had to bargain with devils shut up the radisha glared im as tired of you as swan is go find out what happened and learn what you can about the woman lady too i can handle that swan said grinning come on old buddy he grabbed smokes shoulder he asked the radisha think you can manage jahamaraj jah without us i can manage him mounted ready to ride waiting for blade and smoke swan asked cordy you get the feeling youre out in the woods in the middle of the night and everybodys doing their damnedest to hide the light uhm mather was more the thinker than willow or blade theyre afraid if we know the whole story well desert theyre desperate theyve lost the black company were all thats left like the old days uhm the old days before the coming of the professionals when their adopted homeland had made them reluctant captains because the feuding cults couldnt tolerate taking orders from native nonbelievers a year in the field playing blind lead the blind overcoming political shenanigans daily had convinced swan that blade had a point that it wouldnt hurt the world a bit if you rid it of a few hundred thousand selected priests you buy that kina stuff i dont think she told any lies she just forgot to tell the whole truth maybe when we get smoke out there forty miles from nowhere we can squeeze it out of him maybe as long as we dont forget what he is we scare him too much and hes liable to show us what kind of wizard he is button it theyre coming smoke looked like he was headed for the gallows blade looked as unhappy as ever but swan knew he was pleased blade figured he was going to get a chance to kick some deserving asses chapter eleven the wounded man thought he was trapped in a drug dream hed been a physician he knew drugs did strange things to the mind dreams were strange enough he couldnt wake up some fractured shard of rationality lodged in a corner of his brain watched sensed wondered vaguely as he drifted eternally a few feet above a landscape he seldom saw sometimes branches passed overhead sometimes there were hills in the corners of his eyes once he wakened while drifting through tall grass once he felt he was passing over a broad expanse of water occasionally a huge black horse looked down at him he thought he knew the beast but couldnt assemble the pieces in his mind sometimes a figure in shapeless robing bestrode the beast stared down out of an empty cowl these things were all real he suspected but they fell into no meaningful pattern only the horse seemed familiar hell he couldnt recall who he was his thoughts wouldnt sequence probable pasts kept intruding on the apparent now often as real those intrusions were shards of battle uncertain on the jagged edges bright as blood in the center great slaughters all sometimes names attached themselves lords charm beryl roses horse dejagore juniper the barrowland queens bridge dejagore again dejagore often infrequently he recalled a face the woman had marvellous blue eyes long black hair and always wore black she must have been important to him yes the only woman whenever she appeared she vanished again in moments replaced by the faces of men unlike the bloodlettings he could put no names to them yet he had known them he felt they were ghosts waiting to welcome him among them occasionally pain consumed his chest he was his most alert when it was most intense the world almost made sense then but the creature in black would come and he would tumble back amongst the dreams was the black companion death was this his passage to the nether realm his mind wouldnt function well enough to examine the proposition he hadnt been religious hed believed that death was it when you died you were dead like a squished bug or drowned rat and your immortality was in the minds of those you left behind he slept far more than he was awake thus time eluded him he experienced a moment of profound deja vu as he passed beneath a solitary halfdead tree shortly before entering a dark wood that tree had been important somehow sometime he drifted through the wood out across a clearing in through the entrance of a building it was dark inside a lamp found life at the edge of his vision he descended a flat surface pressed against his back the figure in black came bent over him a hand concealed in a black glove touched him consciousness fled he awakened ravenous a lance of agony bored through his chest throbbed he was drenched in his own sweat his head ached felt as though it was stuffed with sodden cotton he was running a fever his mind worked well enough to catalog symptoms and conclude that he had been wounded and was suffering from a severe cold that could be a lethal combination memories came tumbling back like a rowdy litter of kittens all over one another not making much sense hed led forty thousand men into battle outside dejagore it hadnt gone well hed been trying to rally the troops an arrow out of nowhere had driven through his breastplate and chest miraculously finding nothing vital hed fallen his standardbearer had donned his armor trying to turn the tide with a valiant fiction obviously murgen had failed he made a strangling sound through a desert throat the figure in black appeared now he remembered it had dogged the black company down the length of the world accompanied by a horde of crows he tried to sit up the pain was too much for him he was too weak he knew this dread thing it came out of nowhere a lightning bolt but it was conviction soulcatcher the impossible the dead walking soulcatcher onetime mentor onetime mistress of the black company more recently a deadly enemy but still long ago supposedly dead for a decade and a half hed been there hed seen her slain hed helped hunt her down he tried to rise again some vague force driving him to fight the unfightable a gloved hand stayed him a gentle voice told him dont strain yourself you arent healing well you havent been eating or taking enough fluids are you awake are you sensible he managed a feeble nod good im going to prop you up in a slightly elevated position im going to feed you broth dont waste energy let your strength come back she propped him had him sip through a reed he downed a pint of broth and kept it down soon a glimmer of strength trickled through his flesh thats enough for now now well get you cleaned up he was a disgusting mess how long he croaked she placed a pot of water in his hands inserted another reed sip dont talk she started cutting his clothing off him its been seven days since you were hit croaker her voice had become another voice entirely it changed every time she paused this voice was masculine mocking though he wasnt the mockerys object your comrades still control dejagore to the embarrassment of the shadowmasters your mogaba is in command hes stubborn but he could be embarrassed himself and however stubborn he is he cant hold out forever the powers ranged against him are too great he tried to ask a question she forestalled him the mocking voice asked her wicked chuckle yes she survived thered be no point to this if she hadnt a new voice female but as hard as a diamond arrowpoint snarled she tried to kill me haha yes you were there my love you helped but i dont hold a grudge you were under her spell you didnt know what you were doing youll redeem yourself by helping me take my revenge the man didnt respond she bathed him she was free with the water hed been diminished by his wound but he was still a big man four inches over six feet tall he was about fortyfive years old his hair was an average unnoteworthy brown hed begun to go bald in front his eyes were hard humorless icy blue narrow and deeply set he had a ragged greying beard surrounding a thinlipped mouth that seldom smiled his face bore scattered reminders of a childhood pox and more than a few memories of acne he might have been moderately goodlooking once time had been unkind even in repose his face looked hard and a little off center he didnt look like what he had been all his adult life the black companys historian and physician his appearance was more suited to the role he had inherited that of captain hed described himself as looking like a child molester waiting for a chance to strike he wasnt comfortable with his appearance soulcatcher scrubbed him with a vigor that recalled his mothers dont take the skin off your wound is healing slowly youll have to tell me what i did wrong shed never been a healer she was a destroyer croaker was puzzled by her interest he wasnt valuable what was he just a dingedup old mercenary alive well beyond the expectations of his kind he squeaked a question she laughed voice filled with childlike delight vengeance dear a simple gentle guileful vengeance and i wont lay a hand on her ill let her do it to herself she patted his cheek drew a finger along the line of his jaw it took a while but i knew the moment was inevitable fated the consummation the exchange of the magic deadly three words fated i sensed it before you met again the childlike laughter she was an age finding something so precious my vengeance will be to take it away croaker closed his eyes he could not yet reason closely he understood only that he was in no immediate danger the plot was easily voided he would become a tool of no value broken he put it out of mind first he had to heal time enough later to do what had to be done more laughter this from a woman adult and knowing remember when we campaigned together croaker the trick we played on raker the fun we had tormenting limper he grunted he remembered everything but the fun remember how you always thought i could read your mind he remembered that and the terror it had inspired that old fear crept back you do remember she laughed again im so glad were going to have such fun the whole world thinks were dead you can get away with anything when youre dead her laugh gained an edge of madness well haunt them croaker thats what well do hed regained enough strength to walk with help his captor made him walk forced him to gain strength but still he slept most of the time and dreamed terrible dreams when he did the place anchored the dreams he didnt know that his dreams told him it wasnt a good place that the very trees and earth and stone remembered evils done there he felt they were true dreams but found no supporting evidence while he was awake unless he counted the ominous crows always there were the crows tens and hundreds and thousands of crows standing in the doorway to their sheltera halfruined stone structure buried in vegetation in the heart of a dark woodhe asked what is this place the wood where i chased you a few months ago yes its the holy grove of those who worship kina if we cleared the creepers you could see carved representations once it was important to the black company who took it from the shadar the ground is filled with bones he turned slowly looked into her empty cowl he wouldnt look at the box she carried he knew what must be in it the black company they made sacrifices here one hundred thousand prisoners of war croaker blanched that wasnt something he wanted to hear he had a long romance with the history of the company there was no place in that for a wicked past truth truth my love ive seen the books the wizard smoke concealed from you in taglios they include the missing volumes of your annals your forebears were cruel men their mission required the sacrifice of a million souls his stomach knotted to what to whom why she hesitated he knew she wasnt being honest when she said that wasnt clear your lieutenant mogaba might know though it wasnt what she said but the way she said it the voice she used he shuddered and he believed mogaba had been strange and secretive throughout his association with the company what was he doing to the companys traditions now kinas disciples come here twice a year their festival of lights comes in a month we have to finish before then troubled croaker asked why are we here were recovering our health she laughed where we wont be bothered everyone shuns this place once ive nursed you back youre going to help me still amused she pushed back her cowl she had no head she lifted that box she always carried a battered thing a foot to a side opened a little door a face looked out it was a beautiful face like the face of his lover though less careworn and lacking lifes animation impossible his stomach knotted again he recalled the day that head had been struck from its body to lie in the dust staring up at him and lady her sister it had been a blow wellearned soulcatcher had betrayed the lady soulcatcher had meant to supplant her sister as ruler of the empire i cant do anything like that of course you can and you will because it will keep both of you alive we all want to live dont we i want her to live because i want her to hurt i want to live because i want to watch her hurt you want to live because of her because you revere the company because gentle laughter because where theres life theres hope chapter twelve thunder stampeded silver lightning lashed the winedark clouds cracked the umber sky a moldgrey horde howled across a basalt plain toward the golden chariots of the gods a figure stepped from the line ten feet tall polished ebony naked lifting each foot kneehigh to the side then swinging the leg forward and stamping down the earth shook the figure was female perfection but hairless wore a girdle of childrens skulls her face was protean one moment radiant dark beauty the next a nightmare of burning eyes and vampire fangs the figure seized a demon and devoured him rending tearing flinging entrails demon blood spurted and sprayed it burned holes in the face of the plain the figures jaws distended she swallowed the demons head whole a lump ran down her neck like a mouse bulging a snakes throat the horde beset her and could do her no harm she devoured another screaming devil then another and another with each she grew and waxed more terrible i am here daughter open to me i am your dream i am power the voice floated like gossamer in golden caverns where old men sat beside the way frozen in time immortal unable to move an eyelid mad some covered by fairy webs of ice as though a thousand spiders had spun with threads of frozen water above an enchanted forest of icicles hung from the cavern roof come i am what you seek you are my child but the footing was treacherous making it impossible to advance or retreat the voice called summoned with infinite patience this time i remembered both dreams when i wakened i still shivered with the chill of those caverns the dream was different every time i thought and yet was the same a summoning im not stupid ive seen enough incredibilities to know the dreams were more than nightmares something had singled me out something was trying to recruit me to what cause i couldnt yet guess the method was ancient ive used it a thousand times offer power wealth whatever the desire is dangling the lure till the fish bites never revealing the cost did this thing know me unlikely i was receptive so it was trying to pull me i wouldnt accept it as a god though it might want to be thought one ive met only one god old father tree master of the plain of fear and hes no god in the accepted sense only a being of immense longevity and power this world has shown me just two beings stronger than i my husband the dominator whom i cast into oblivion in a thousand years he may be remembered as a dark god and father tree greater than ever i could have been who has roots anchoring him he can project his power outside the plain of fear only through his servants croaker told me about a third power that lies buried under father tree imprisoned while the tree survives the tree is immortal by human standards where there are three great powers there could be more the world is old yesterday is shrouded those who become great in one age often do so by mining the secrets of ages past who knows how many great evils lie beneath this haunted earth who knows but what the gods of all men in all ages are but echoes of those who followed a path like mine and have nevertheless fallen victim to implacable time not a thought to soothe the soul time is the enemy whose patience cant be exhausted mistress are you troubled narayans grin was absent he showed genuine concern oh hed come up quietly no a bad dream that lingered nightmares are the coin we pay for doing what we have to do he looked at me oddly do you have nightmares narayan id begun to press him quietly to weigh his answers to questions probing his flanks never mistress i sleep like a baby he turned slowly surveyed the camp the countryside was shrouded in mist whats the agenda today do we have practice weapons enough for a mock combat one battalion against the other i had enough men to field two battalions of four hundred men with a few hundred left to carry out camp duties and provide one inept cavalry troop barely you want that id like to but how can we reward the victors training involved competitions now with rewards for winning and for effort superior effort even in losing deserves recognition recognition encourages soldiers to give their best theres relief from fatigues foraging and sentry duty thats a possibility i was also considering letting individuals send for their wives after we moved to ghoja ram brought me a breakfast bowl we werent eating well but we were getting bulk enough so far narayan asked how much longer can you stall here not long time was turning against us the existence of the band had to be known up north potential political enemies would be digging in instead of mock combat well have a review spread a rumor that im thinking of moving out if what i see pleases me that ought to motivate them yes mistress narayan retreated he gathered his cronies a dozen men who showed snips of colored cloth at their waists an interesting group they sprang from all three major religions two minor cults and from among the liberated foreign slaves they pretty much ran the camp though only narayan and ram had official standing they kept the peace the men werent quite sure how to take them but responded seriously because of that aura of the sinister that id noted myself narayan admitted nothing he handled my probes deftly there was no doubt he directed the dozen though several sprang from higher castes i kept an eye on him time would betray himif he didnt open up as he hinted he might for the moment he was too useful to press i nodded approval they almost look like soldiers wed have to get them uniform dress narayan nodded he seemed smug as though his genius had produced our triumph and sparked a renascent spirit howre the riding lessons coming just making talk i knew abysmally none of these clowns belonged to a caste that got closer to a horse than to trail along behind cleaning up but damn it would be a sin to waste those mounts poorly though a few men show promise not including myself or ram we were born to walk show promise had become his favorite expression in reference to everything as he taught me to use the stranglers kerchief or rumel at my insistence he said i showed promise i suspected he was surprised at how easily i picked it up its manipulation came as naturally as breathing as though it was a skill id had all along maybe it came of centuries of practice at the quick subtle gestures needed to manipulate sorceries you were saying you were going to move narayan asked mistress the honorific was becoming an afterthought narayan remained taglian he was beginning to take me for granted our foragers are having to range pretty far narayan didnt reply but seemed reluctant to go i had a feeling i was being watched at first i credited it to the crows they kept me uncomfortable now i understood croakers reaction better they didnt behave the way crows ought id mentioned them to narayan hed grinned and called them a good omen meaning they were a bad omen for someone else i scanned our surroundings the crows were there in their scores but narayan collect the dozen best horsemen im taking a patrol out but do you think how could i get through im no garden rose im taking a patrol out as you command mistress so shall it be it had better narayan it had better chapter thirteen swan glanced at blade the black mans attitude toward smoke had grown from disdain into contempt the wizard had no more spine than a worm he shook like a leaf cordy said thats her swan nodded he grinned but kept his thoughts to himself shes putting something together that gang is more organized than any ive seen down here they backed off the knoll from which theyd been watching the camp blade said we going to drop in he had hold of the wizards sleeve like he expected the runt to run not yet i want to circle around check it out down south shouldnt be that far to where they hit the shadowmasters men i want to see the place if we can find it cordy asked think they know were here what the idea startled swan you said theyre organized nobody ever accused the lady of not being efficient she should have pickets out swan thought no one had entered or left the camp but mather had a point if they wanted to remain unnoticed theyd better move on youre right lets go blade you were down here before know how to cross that creek somewhere thats not too far out of the way blade nodded in those desperate days before the black company picked up the reins hed led guerrillas behind the shadowmasters main forces lead on smoke old buddy i wish i could get a peek inside your head i never seen anybody so ready to drizzle down his leg the wizard said nothing blade found a game ford three miles east of the south road led the way through woods narrower than swan expected when they reached the southern side blade said roads two miles that way i figured the sky was dark with buzzards thats where well find our dead men that was the place the air was still the stench hung like a poisonous miasma neither swan nor mather had a stomach strong enough to let them take a close look blade though seemed to have no sense of smell he returned swan said you look green around the gills not much but bones left been a while two hundred three hundred men hard to tell now animals been at them one thing no heads eh no heads somebody cut them off smoke moaned then chucked his breakfast his mount shied no heads swan asked i dont get it mather said ive got an idea come on he rode south toward where crows circled dipped and squabbled they found the heads blade asked want to get a count he chuckled no lets drop in on our friends smoke made protesting noises cordy asked you still hot to trot with your proud beauty swan couldnt think of a flip answer maybe im starting to see smokes viewpoint dont let me get on her bad side blade said only a mile to their camp straight up the road swan snorted well go around thank you after they crossed the game ford mather suggested suppose we go up the road a ways and come down like we dont know nothing about back there see what they say if they think we just rode in stop whining smoke swan said go with it you got no choice youre right cordy itll give us a clue if shes going to play games they rode north till they were behind a rise turned west to the road then turned south they were almost back to the crest when mather in the lead yelled yo lookout chapter fourteen we crossed the creek into the wood walking our mounts behind sindhu who had scouted till he knew every leaf and twig of the surrounding terrain he led us along a meandering game trail which paralleled the creek going westward i wondered what had become of the game we hadnt seen anything bigger than a squirrel a few native deer might have eased the food problem though neither gunni nor shadar touch meat it was a long walk my companions grumbled and bickered the watching presence centered on a grove on a knoll whence it would be possible to observe events in our camp id lapsed id been thinking too far ahead if id had the sense of a goose id have had a squad posted there the outlying pickets were too scattered to spot everything moving in the area even if people werent sneaking around fugitives slipped through all the time they left their traces i had a good idea what id find on that knoll somebody from up north whod heard rumors and had gotten worried that i might be trouble i meant to be a lot for the shadowmasters and anybody who got between us we crossed the creek a few miles downstream out of sight of the knoll moved back to the east and discovered that there was no way to approach the grove unseen the last third of a mile i told the men all we can do is ride straight at it lets do it without getting in a hurry maybe they wont run till were so close they cant get away i didnt know if they could control themselves the excitement had them again they were pumped up scared and eager lets go wed covered half the open ground when the watchers flushed like quail shadar somebody noted yes mounted shadar in uniform cavalry equipped jahamaraj jahs men i snapped the men cursed even those who were shadar jah was the leading shadar priest in taglios croakers doing jahs concession to his debt hadnt lasted through the fighting at dejagore he and his cavalry had abandoned the field while the outcome was in question most of the men had seen them run or had heard id been pushing the idea that the battle wouldve been ours had jah stood his ground it could be true jah had contributed nothing when a feathers weight might have tilted the balance i thought hed run because hed suffered an opportunistic flash hed intuited that the battle would go poorly and had decided to beat everybody home hed play a strong hand there because hed be the only man with a military forcehowever ineptto back him up he deserved some special thought now i didnt have to order a chase there were five shadar their flight was proof they were blackhearts the men rode with blood in their eyes unfortunately the shadar were better riders i did want to talk to them i urged my stallion to his best pace and closed up fast no everyday mount stood a chance against him the shadar hit the north road as i nosed up on the most laggardly the leaders swept over the crest and collided with riders headed south horses shied men yelled riders came unhorsed i circled a shadar who regained his feet and tried to run hed lost his helmet i grabbed him by the hair ran him fifty yards before turning to examine the victims of the collision well swan mather and blade and that sneaking twit of a hedge wizard smoke what now mather smoke and blade had kept their seats swan was on the ground groaning and swearing he got up swore some more kicked a fallen shadar looked around for his horse smoke was rattled right down to his ankles he had no color left was whispering some sort of prayer mather and blade ignored swans histrionics i presumed that meant he wasnt hurt my captive tried to get away i ran him a few yards let him loose when the horse was moving faster than he could keep up he flung forward slid on his face stopped at swans feet swan sat down on him i asked mather what are you doing here he was the only one of the bunch who made straight sense the radisha sent us wants to know whats happening down here there have been rumors some say youre alive some say dead im not yet not quite my men arrived ghopal hakim take these two somewhere and ask them why they were snooping they were narayans cronies the only two who could ride hed probably sent them along to keep an eye on things swan got up and leaned against mathers leg you dont have to twist no arms to find that out been some wild rumors lately youve got jah jumpy as a cat in a kennel oh things were going his way he got back from dejagore before anybody else only bad luck put the radisha at ghoja before him she closed the ford he still figured he had the world by the oysters then here comes word somebodys kicked the feathers off a gang of the shadowmasters boys right behind comes a rumor that it was you you not being dead dont look so good for jahs ambitions the company picked up a lot of respect putting it together so fast made all those priests look like conniving selfish jerks blade chuckled mather said you collected some of that respect being a woman and having everybody know how much you had to do with it falling together he looked me in the eye but being a woman is going to be a handicap now ive been on my own before mather and i hadnt been happy a moment but happiness is a fleeting creature its no birthright not anything i expect but something i accept when i stumble into it meantime power will do nicely and jah has liabilities hes vulnerable i have a thousand men over there every one will tell you jah ran out on us at dejagore we wouldve won if it wasnt for him swan surprised me we watched the battle we saw so did a lot of men whove come in even some of jahs own men admit it a liability mather said but its not going to undo him ghopal reminded me that three shadar had escaped true and they would fly straight to their master who was sure to make a move but i doubted hed do it right away he was a vacillator hed worry a while before committing himself back to camp swan come ghopal bring the prisoners i rode ahead as hard as the stallion could carry me sound the alarm and the recall i told the soldiers at the north gate narayan ram they came running narayan gasped what is it mistress were pulling out right now forced march get the men ready let the horses carry most of the load make sure each man carries food we wont stop for meals move they scooted it was midafternoon ghoja was forty miles away a tenhour jaunt if everyone kept the pace if the night wasnt too dark it shouldnt be if the sky stayed clear thered be a quarter moon rising an hour after sunset not a lot of light but maybe enough the horns that wed taken from the shadowmasters cavalry kept sounding recall the pickets came running the gang id left up the road arrived swan and mather were impressed by the chaos mather said youve taught well i think so whatre you fixing to do swan asked take charge at ghoja before jah can react he groaned you have a problem with that only that we just got finished riding down here forty more miles and i wont have a spine left so walk sindhu come here i took the wide man aside gave him instructions he left smiling gathered two dozen men with strong stomachs mostly his cronies and crossed the creek i sent another man to round up the poles we used for practice pikes and spears swan asked you mind if we get something to eat help yourself then find me i want to talk to you idiot he gave me a big nervous smile i didnt need to be a mindreader to get what was going on in the back of his head the troops got it together faster than i expected they had the word ghoja straight through i still had a serious problem lack of a command structure i had solid squads and the squad leaders by tens had picked company commanders but none of those had had more than a few days practice and neither of my formally organized battalions had anyone in charge mather he set his food aside maam you strike me as a responsible man also you have field experience and a reputation i have two battalions of four hundred men but no commanders my man narayan can muddle through with one if i keep him out of trouble i need somebody to handle the other a known hero would be perfectif i thought he wouldnt work against me mather looked me in the eye for several seconds i work for the radisha i couldnt i could i turned that was blade smoke had a squeaking fit blade grinned the first id seen him do so i dont owe you anything little man he turned to swan what did i say aint over yet something flickered across swans face he wasnt happy youre putting us in a bad spot blade you putting yourself there swan you said it what kind of people they are soon as they got what they want they going to stick it in you that right wizard like you done the black company smoke staggered he wouldve been dead if hed had a bad heart he looked like he expected me to roast him i smiled id let him stew a little first ill accept your offer blade come meet your hundredleaders once we were out of earshot of the others i asked what did you mean by that remark less than it sounded the wizard the radisha the prahbrindrah they hurt you more by deceit than treachery they withheld information i cant tell you what i dont know they thought we were spies you sent ahead but i can tell you they never meant to keep their agreement for some reason they dont want you to get to khatovar khatovar croakers mystery destination the place the black company had originated for four hundred years the company moved northward slowly in the service of various princes till it came into mine then of my enemies and was reduced to a handful of men after the battle in the barrowland croaker turned back south with fewer followers than my squad leaders had today wed gathered a man here a man there and when wed reached taglios wed discovered we couldnt cross the last four hundred miles because the principalities of the shadowmasters lay between us and khatovar there was only one way to cover those final miles take taglios already pressed by the shadowmasters with its pacifist history and win an impossible war the agreement with the prahbrindrah had been that the company would train and lead a taglian army once the war had been won that army would support the companys quest for khatovar interesting i told blade but not a surprise sindhu he was back hed moved fast whatever he was he could do a job i told him i want you to stick to our guests i indicated swan mather and smoke show the little one your rumel if they abuse our hospitality he nodded theyre to walk like everyone else he nodded again went back to mounting skulls on poles blade watched for a moment but said nothing though im sure he had thoughts we marched out an hour after i decided to move i was pleased chapter fifteen we didnt reach ghoja in ten hours but i hadnt expected to make four miles an hour in the dark we did get in before dawn and with blades connivance we chose a campsite which both shouldered the road and almost nudged jahamaraj jahs encampment we were there an hour before anyone noticed sloppy deadly sloppy if wed been the shadowmasters cavalry we could have cleaned the area we used the skulls and poles to mark the bounds of the camp i had the interior laid out in a checkerboard cross with the center square for the headquarters group the four squares on its points for four battalions with the squares between as drill grounds the men grumbled about having to set up for twice their numberespecially since certain favored individuals who had been performing well only had to stand around holding poles with skulls atop them croaker had been fond of showmanship hed said you should adjust the minds of observers to think what you wanted them to think that was never my style but in the past id had brute force to waste here let everyone think i believed id soon have men enough for four battalions and the battalions would expand tired as they were the men were content to work and grumble i saw no shirking no one deserted people came out of the fortress and other camps to watch the men narayan sent to gather firewood and timber and stone ignored their undisciplined cousins skulls looking down moved the curious to keep their distance sindhu babysat swan mather and smoke blade took his appointment seriously the men in his battalion accepted him he was one of the heroes of the desperate hours before the coming of the company it was almost too sweet but nothing crept up i watched the watchers the camp was threequarters complete including a ditch and embankment and the rudiments of a palisade faced with locust thorns and wild rose canes jahamaraj jah rode out of his camp watched for fifteen minutes he didnt look pleased by our industry i summoned narayan you see jah he was hard to miss he was as gaudy as a prince hed carried all that with him on campaign yes mistress ill be on the other side of camp for a while if some of your menespecially shadarsuffered a lapse of discipline and called him coward and deserter i doubt their punishments would be onerous he grinned started to dart away hold it mistress you seen to have friends everywhere i wouldnt be averse to knowing whats going on around here if you found contacts maybe ghopal and hakim and a few others could desert when you werent looking or otherwise get out and poke around consider it done i do i trust you that far i know youll do what needs to be done his grin faded he caught the warning edge from narayan i went to swan how are you doing dying of boredom are we prisoners no guests with limited mobility now free to go or stay i could use your cachet smoke shook his head vigorously as though he feared swan would desert the radisha i told him youre awfully anxious to hang onto a black company spy he looked at me and went through some internal change as though hed decided to abandon ineffectual tactics it wasnt a dramatic shift though the role hed been in couldnt have been that far from the real smoke he never said a word swan grinned and winked im gone but i got a feeling ill be back the racket started up in narayans sector as i watched swan go i wondered how jah was taking it swan was back within the hour she wants to see you why am i not surprised ram get narayan and blade sindhu too i took narayan and blade with me sindhu i left in charge hinting that id be pleased if the camp was finished when i got back i paused at the gate of the ghoja fortress glanced back it was an hour short of noon we had been here six hours already my camp was the most complete best protected most military professionalism and preparedness are relative i suppose chapter sixteen croaker hobbled to the temple door looked out soulcatcher was nowhere around he hadnt seen her for days he wondered if hed been abandoned he doubted it shed just waited till he was able to care for himself then had hurried off on some arcane business he thought of making a run for it he knew the surrounding country there was a village he could reach in a few hours even at the pace he could make but that escape would be no escape soulcatcher was away but the crows had stayed to watch they would stay with him they would lead her to him she had the horses those beasts could run forever without tiring she could spot him a weeks lead and catch him still this place was like an island outside the world it was dark and depressing he started walking going nowhere moving for the sake of movement the crows nagged at him he ignored them ignored the ache thumping in his chest he strolled through the woods to the countryside beyond emerging near the halfdead tree he recalled it now before dejagore and ghoja he had come south to scout the terrain had spied soulcatcher watching had chased her into these woods hed stood by that tree trying to decide what to do nextand an arrow had hit it nearly taking off his nose it had carried a message telling him it wasnt time for him to catch whomever he was chasing then the shadowmasters men had come after him and hed been too busy running to give the place any more thought he walked up to the tree crows burdened its branches he fingered the hole where the arrow had hit shed been watching over him then hadnt she not interfering but there just in case maybe laying on a nudge or two to make sure he was around for her revenge a long lazy hill lay before he decided to ignore the crows he kept walking the pain in his chest became insistent he wasnt ready for so much exercise he couldnt have gone far even without the crows keeping track as he paused to rest he wondered how much soulcatcher had intruded on his affairs could she have had some hand in the outcome at dejagore destroying stormbringer who had worn the alias stormshadow had been easier than hed expected and getting shapeshifter had been a breeze too though thered been a little treachery to that since shifter had been helping lady which reminded him that girl shifters apprentice shed gotten away she could be thinking of evening scores did soulcatcher know about her better mention her next chance he got his heartbeat had fallen off toward normal the pain had waned he resumed walking he reached the ridgeline and stood leaning against a gnarly grey piece of exposed rock panting while crows circled and nattered oh shut up im not going anywhere another outcrop nearby vaguely suggested a chair he shuffled over and sat surveyed his kingdom all taglios could have been his if hed won at dejagore had that been his ambition a flight of three crows arrowed in from the north coming like racing pigeons swirled into the flock cawed some the whole mob scattered odd he leaned back thought about the battles aftermath mogaba was alive and holding the city against besieging shadowmasters according to soulcatcher maybe a third of the army had managed to get inside the walls fine a stubborn defense would keep them away from taglios but he didnt care that much about taglios nice people but anybody who was anybody was thoroughly treacherous he was concerned about the few friends hed left down south had any survived had they salvaged the annals those precious histories that were the time link cementing the company what had become of murgen and the standard and his widowmaker armor legend said the standard had been with the company since the day it had marched from khatovar what were those damned crows up to moments ago there had been a thousand of them now he couldnt see a dozen those all glided at high altitude drifting back and forth over something up the valley had khatovar become a hopeless dream had the last page of the annals been written just four hundred miles from home sudden memory from the first hours of their journey away from dejagore just an image of a man floating writhing upon a lance moonshadow yes and moonshadow had been skewered upon that lance during the fighting skewered on the lance that supported the standard it wasnt lost that heirloom more important than the annals themselves was down there in the temple somewhere he hadnt seen it she must have hidden it he glanced at a sky where cumulus marched across a turquoise field the crows were closer those few still aloft he jerked startled one was headed his way like a winged missile it flapped fluttered very nearly suicided making a landing on a rock pinnacle inches from his left hand the bird said dont move in a perfectly intelligible voice he didnt move though instantly he had a dozen questions it took no genius to understand that something significant was happening the birds didnt speak to him otherwise in fact they had only once before bringing the warning that had allowed him to move in time to whip the shadowmasters at ghoja ford the crow hunkered down and became part of the rock croaker eased down a little himself so hed present no obviously human form against the skyline then froze moments later he spied movement in the shallow valley before him it darted from cover to cover then there was more movement and more his heart hammered as he remembered the shadows the minions of the shadowmasters had brought north these were no shadows they were small brown men but not of the race of the small brown men who had managed the shadows those had been cousins of the taglians something familiar about these but they were so far away it didnt occur to them to look up where he was seated or if they did they couldnt see him they moved on down the valley then there were more of them maybe twentyfive not sneaking like the others who must have been scouts he saw this bunch well enough to recall where hed seen their kind before on the great river that ran from the heart of the continent down past taglios to the sea he had fought them a year ago two thousand miles north of here they had blockaded the river against all commerce the company had opened the way crushing them in a wild nighttime battle where sorceries flashed and howled the howler the main party was in sight eight men carried a ninth on a sedan of sorts the ninth was a small figure so covered with clothing it looked like a pile of rags as it came abreast of croaker it let out a prolonged moan the howler one of the ten who were taken who had been servants of the lady in her northern empire a terrible wizard thought slain in battle till that night on the river when hed tried to even old scores against his former empress only the intercession of shifter had driven him off another moan escaped the sorcerer it was a feeble shadow of the howlers usual wails probably trying to control his cries to avoid attracting attention croaker sat so still his heart almost stopped there was little in the world he wanted less than to attract attention now his concentration was so intense he felt no discomfort from rock or chill breeze the party passed on with more small brown men trailing behind in rearguard it was an hour before croaker was confident that he had seen the last of them he had counted one hundred twentyeight swamp warriors plus the sorcerer the warriors wouldnt be much use so far out of their element this terrain was alien to them but the howler terrain and climate and whatnot meant nothing to him where was he headed didnt take much to guess down to the shadowlands why was more of a mystery but probably not so great a one the howler had been one of the taken some of the shadowmasters had been fugitive taken too it seemed likely the survivors had made contact with their former comrade and had negotiated some compact whereby he would replace the shadowmasters who had fallen lady was alive and at ghoja if soulcatcher hadnt lied not forty miles away he wished he could make that journey he wished there was some way he could get a message to her she needed to know about this crow i dont know if you know what we just saw but youd better get word to your boss we got trouble he got up and walked back to the temple where he amused himself by trying to find the hidden company standard chapter seventeen the everyday business of sorcery is as much stage magic as it is witchcraft its misdirection deceit whathaveyou i kept an eye on smoke expecting him to pass information to the radisha in some subtle fashion but if he did he was too crafty for me which i doubt when you encounter the radisha you know youre in the presence of a powerful will it was a shame she was trapped in her culture and had to pretend to be her brothers creature she might have done interesting things good afternoon she said were pleased that you survived was she maybe because there were still shadowmasters to be conquered so am i she noted that blade stood with me instead of his friends she noted narayan of obvious low caste and no cleaner than the day wed metthough i had no room to criticize a shadow crossed her brow my battalion commanders i said blade you know narayan who has been helpful pulling the men together she looked at narayan intently maybe because of his unusual name and the fact that id added no other i didnt know any other name for him narayan was a patronym we had six more narayans among the shadar troops every one of them carried the personal name singh which means lion she caught something with that closer look started slightly glanced at smoke the wizard replied with a tiny nod she looked at blade you choose to leave me im going with somebody who can get something done besides talk that was a long speech for blade and one that won him no sympathy the radisha glared hes got a point swan said you and your brother just keep fiddling were more exposed people in positions like theirs do have to act within constraints or get pulled down but try to explain that to men who have never been anything but momentary captains and didnt want that power when they had it the radisha rose come she told us as we walked she told me i am pleased that you survived though you may find it difficult to continue doing so that didnt sound like a threat exactly what youre in a difficult position because your captain didnt survive she led us up a spiral stair to the parapet of the fortresss tallest tower my companions were as puzzled as i the radisha pointed beyond the trees and construction across the river there was a large ragtag encampment the radisha said some fugitives crossed elsewhere and carried word north people started arriving the day after swan rode south there are about two thousand already therell be thousands more who are they swan asked families of legionnaires families of men the shadowmasters enslaved theyve come to find out what happened to their menfolk she pointed upstream scores of women were stacking wood i asked what are they doing building ghats narayan sounded nonplussed i should have considered that what are ghats funeral pyres mather said the gunni burn their dead instead of burying them he looked a little green i didnt follow there arent any dead here unless somebody makes some a symbolic gesture funerals in absentia the practice is called suttee smoke said i looked at him he stood straight up and wore a slimy grin when a man dies his wife joins him on his ghat if he dies away from home she joins him in death when she learns of it oh those women are building pyres where they can commit suicide if their husbands have been killed yes a damnfool thing to do smokes smile grew its a custom as old as taglios with the force of law i didnt like the way he was getting happy he thought he had a tool to use against me a waste who takes care of the children never mind i dont care the concept was so alien i discounted it im not sure i even believed him the radisha said the custom is revered by everyone even those who arent gunni there are crazies everywhere its a hideous practice it should be abolished but im not here to change any social sillinesses were at war weve suffered a setback a lot of our men are trapped in dejagore its not likely we can save them more are in flight we can save some of those and we have to raise new levies so we can cling to what weve gained swan said sweetie youre missing the point i got the point swan its irrelevant the radisha said youre a woman you have no friends every man of any substance in every priesthood is going to make a point of your relationship with your captain a large point of your failure to commit suttee that will weigh heavily with a large portion of the population it may be the custom its an idiot custom and ill bet its not universal i shant dignify the suggestionunless i decide that for bringing it up the suggester will be delivered to his suggestion smokes grin faded his eyes narrowed and clouded his jaw dropped for a second he was staring at my hand i realized id picked up narayans tic was fingering the bit of yellow cloth peeping from my waist smokes color turned ghastly i said radisha ask these two about my background i indicated swan and mather theyd emigrated from my empire while i was at the pinnacle of my power some of the company have fallen but our contract remains in force i intend to execute the undertaking admirable but youll find that a lot of people wont want to let you do that i shrugged what they want doesnt matter the contract has been made better understand that you people think you know more about us than we do you must know we dont let anybody back out on a contract the radisha looked at me intently unafraid curious about my confident attitude here alone in a sea of enemies i said ill present a list of needs tomorrow manpower drayage animals weapons equipment half of confidence is the appearance of confidence somebody shouted from the stairwell the radisha signalled mather who checked it he came back said jahs kicking up a fuss wants to see you guess that means he knows youre here i said might as well meet him head on tell them to bring him mather mather passed the word we waited the radisha and i eyed one another like sheleopards i asked why are you afraid of the company she didnt bat an eye you know quite well i do ive studied the history of the company in detail i dont recall anything that would explain your attitude smoke whispered something i think he accused me of lying i was developing an intense dislike for him jahamaraj jah swept in like a king i was curious to see how the radisha handled the handicap of her sex in a moment i was curious to see how jah handled his handicap he had made his entrance dramatically he had looked us over we hadnt responded to the gloriousness of his size his wealthy apparel the power he represented now he didnt know what to do next he was a fool croaker hadnt quite erred in ridding the shadar of his predecessor that man had been our enemy but jah wasnt much of an improvement he was all appearance without substance he was impressive for a taglian six feet and two hundred pounds half a foot taller than average and much more massive his skin was fairer than most a desirable trait from the taglian perspective wealthy women often spent their entire lives hiding from the sun he was handsome even by northern standards but his mouth was petulant and his eyes gave the impression he was a moment short of breaking into tears because he wasnt getting his own way the radisha gave him ten seconds snapped you have something to say indecision he was surrounded by people who had no use for him several would have cut his throat happily even smoke found the nerve to look at him like he was a slug i said caught by a jury of your enemies id thought you were better at the game what game he wasnt good at concealing his feelings what he thought of me came through intrigue that was a poor move running at dejagore everybody will blame you hardly the battle was lost i made sure a force survived you ran out before it was decided your own men say so the radisha snapped if you give us any grief well remind the families of those men who arent coming home pure hatred jah wasnt used to being thwarted im not accustomed to being threatened i dont tolerate it from anyone i asked do you recall how you came to power people might be interested in the details among them everyone there the others stared wondering youd be wise to go quietly abandon the pursuit of arms and power and content yourself with what you have he glared daggers youre vulnerable you cant erase that youve made too many poor choices keep it up and youll destroy yourself he looked at us found no sympathy anywhere his only weapon was bluster he knew what that was worth this round to you he headed downstairs blade laughed he did it knowing jah couldnt tolerate being mocked blade wanted trouble i sent him a warning look he stared back impassively he wasnt intimidated by anyone jah was gone i said i have work to do we arent accomplishing anything we know where we stand i expect to finish the companys work you intend to let that go only as far as it conveniences you then you plan to backstab me i dont plan to let you blade you coming or staying coming theres nothing here for me swan and mather looked croggled smoke pained and the radisha exasperated as soon as we left the fortress blade said jah could try something desperate now ill handle it hell vacillate till its too late check on your battalion once he was out of hearing i told narayan hes right do we wait for jah or do we move first he didnt respond just waited for me to answer myself well do something when we know hes planning something himself i surveyed the camp the outer enclosure was complete it would do for the moment id keep making improvements mainly to keep the men occupied a wall can never be too high or a ditch too deep i want the shadar to know i need cavalrymen their response will show us what support jah has pass the word amongst all the fugitives that those who join voluntarily will get preferential treatment we need volunteers from the provinces too we need to spread our story before these idiots unleash the hounds of factionalism there are ways to get word out narayan admitted but well have to send some of my friends across the river do what you have to starting now we dont mark time we dont let them catch their balance go i climbed a platform that had been erected near what would become the camps north gate surveyed the countryside my men were as busy as ants their industry hadnt communicated itself to anyone else only the builders across the river and the gunni women were doing much smoke curled up from one of the ghats when the flames were roaring a woman threw herself in i had to believe it now i retired to the shelter ram had built settled to stretch the limits of my talent id be needing it soon chapter eighteen the dreams worsened they were dreams of death we all have nightmares but id never recalled so many so clearly after i wakened some force some power was summoning me was trying to enlist or subject me those dreams were the creations of a sick mind if they were supposed to appeal to me that power didnt know me landscapes of despair and death under skies of lead fields where bodies rotted and stunted vegetation melted down like slow soft candlewax slime covered everything hung in strands like the architecture of drunken spiders mad mad mad and not a touch of color anywhere mad and yet with its taint of perverse appeal for amongst the dead id see faces i wished amongst the dead i strode that land unharmed vitally alive its ruler the ghouls that ran with me were extensions of my will it was a dream straight out of the fantasies of my dead husband it was a world he could have made home always in the late hours thered be a dawn in that land of nightmare a splash of color on a poorly defined horizon always in front of me it seemed the dawn of hope simple and direct the architect of my dreams there was one dream less common that did without the death and corruption yet was as chilling in its way black and white too it placed me upon a plain of stone where deadly shadows lurked behind countless obelisks i didnt understand it at all but it frightened me i couldnt control the dreams but i refused to let them influence my waking hours refused to let them wear me down ive sent word out mistress narayan said responding to my question about recruits we fenced whenever the subject of his brotherhood arose he wasnt yet ready to talk blade suggested someone ought to be watching things at dejagore i understood though sometimes his brevity caused problems narayan said ghopal and hakim can take a party down twenty men should have no trouble itll be quiet now i said you had them spying on our neighbors theyre done theyve made their contacts sindhu can take over he has a higher reputation another of those little oddities about narayan and his cronies they had their own hidden caste system based on what i couldnt tell narayan was the man of most respect here broad stolid sindhu ran a close second send them if we have spies everywhere why havent i gotten any information theres nothing to report that isnt common knowledge except that theres a lot of disaffection among jahs men a third might defect if you offered to enlist them jahs been doing some talking about you ignoring your duties as a wife because you wont commit suttee or go into isolation as befits a shadar woman hes working on a dozen schemes but none of our friends are in his closest councils kill him blade said and sindhu nodded why a political victory would be better long range you dont let the serpent strike if you know where he lies in wait you destroy him a simplistic solution with a certain appeal it could have a big impact if we took him out where he seemed least vulnerable and at the moment i didnt feel patient enough to spin out a long game agreed but with finesse do we have good enough friends over there to let us sneak into camp close enough narayan admitted thered be a question of timing so the friends would be on duty set it up what about other enemies jah is just the most obvious because hes right here therell be more in the north itll be handled narayan promised when there are men and time we have too much work and too few hands right but i felt good about my prospects no one else was doing as much or pushing as hard i asked can we get any closer to the radisha and her pet wizard smoke are swan and mather devoted allies of the radishas devoted blade said no but theyve given their word more or less they wont turn unless the woman turns on them first something to consider maybe they could be misdirected though that would work against me if they found me out offered places in my camp and safety from reprisals two hundred of jahamaraj jahs men defected another fifty just deserted and disappeared several hundred of the other fugitives enlisted the same day the shadar came over i got the impression the radisha wasnt pleased nearly a hundred gunni women walked into fire the same day i heard my name cursed from that side of the river i went over and spoke to a few women we had no basis for communication smoke was at the fortress gate when i recrossed the ford he smirked as i passed i wondered how much the radisha would miss him there are times when you wonder about the self hidden from yourself i certainly did as narayan sindhu and i stole toward the shadar cavalry camp i was excited i was eager i was drawn as a moth to flame i told myself i was doing this because i had to not because i wanted it it wasnt a pleasure jahs malice had called this down upon him narayans friends had confirmed that jah planned to grab the radisha and me and make it look like id carried her off how he figured he could get to me i dont know i guessed his plan included me murdering the radishathus eliminating her brothers spinethen being a good girl who committed suttee with assistance so i was moving first earlier than id wanted narayan exchanged whispered passwords with a friendly sentry who turned blind as we stole past the camp beyond was a pesthole ordinarily shadar set great store by cleanliness morale was abysmal we stole like shadows i was proud of myself i moved as silently as those two they were surprised a woman could do it we approached jahs own tent it was oversized and guarded well the man knew he wasnt popular a fire burned on each of the tents four sides a guard stood near each fire narayan cursed said something in cant sindhu grunted narayan whispered no way to get any closer those guards will be men he trusts and theyll know who we are i nodded pulled them back said let me think they whispered while i thought they didnt expect anything from me there was a small spell which could be used to blind the unaware briefly perfect if i could manage it i recalled it all right one of those childrens things that used to be as easy as blinking i hadnt tried it in ages thered be no way to tell if it was working unless i messed it up so badly the sentry sensed me and gave the alarm nothing to lose but my life i went into that spellcasting as though it was the most dangerous demonsummoning id ever done i did it three times to make sure it had a chance to take but when i finished i didnt know if id succeeded or failed the guard didnt look changed sindhu and narayan still had their heads together i said come on and returned to the edge of the light no one was in sight but that guard time to test it or chicken i walked straight toward the sentry narayan and sindhu both cursed and tried to call me back i summoned them with a gesture the guard couldnt see me he didnt see me my heart leaped as it had when id summoned the horses i beckoned narayan and sindhu indicating they should stay out of the guards direct line of vision he might remember someone he saw head on and he would be questioned later they slunk past like dogs unable to believe he couldnt see them they desperately wanted to know what id done how id done it if they could learn to do it too but they dared not say a word i parted the tent flap an inch saw no one on the other side the interior was compartmented by hangings i slipped into what must have been the audience area it constituted the majority of the interior it was well appointed further evidence that jah had put his own comfort before the welfare of his men and the safety of his homeland i had learned better as a child you win more loyalty and respect if you share the hardships eyes still big narayan gestured reminding me of the layout as he had it from his spies i nodded this late jah should be asleep we moved toward his sleeping area i moved the hanging with a dagger narayan and sindhu got their rumels out i know i made no noise im sure they didnt but as we went in jah boiled up off his cushions flung himself between narayan and sindhu bowling them aside he charged me there was a lamp burning he saw us well enough to recognize us ever a fool jahamaraj jah he never yelled he just tried to get away my hand dipped to the triangle of saffron at my waist yanked flipped my rumel moved as if alive snaked around his throat i seized the flying end yanked the loop tight rolled my wrists and held on luck fate or unconscious skill none of that would have mattered had i been alone jah was a powerful man he could have carried me outside he could have shaken me off but narayan and sindhu grabbed his arms and held them extended twisted them forced him down sindhus bull strength counted most narayan concentrated on keeping jahs arms extended i got my knees into jahs back and concentrated on keeping him from breathing it takes a while for a man to strangle the skilled strangler is supposed to move so quickly and decisively that the victims neck breaks and death comes instantly i did not yet have the wrist roll perfected so i had to hang on while jah went the hard way my arms and shoulders ached before he shuddered his last narayan lifted me away i was shaking with the intensity of it the almost orgasmic elation that coursed through me id never done anything like that with my own two hands without steel or sorcery he grinned he knew what i was feeling he and sindhu seemed unnaturally calm sindhu was listening trying to judge if wed made too much noise it had seemed a ferocious uproar to me there in the middle of it but evidently wed made less racket than id thought nobody came nobody asked questions sindhu muttered something in cant narayan thought a moment glanced at me grinned again he nodded sindhu pawed through jahs clutter looking for the ground he cleared a small area looked around some more while i watched him trying to figure out what he was doing narayan produced an odd tool hed carried under the dark robe hed donned for the adventure the tool had a head that was half hammer half pick that weighed at least two pounds maybe more if it was the silver and gold it appeared to be its handle was ebony inlaid with ivory and a few rubies that caught the lamplight and gleamed like fresh blood he began pounding the earth with the pick side but quietly unrhythmically that wasnt a tool that would be used that way ordinarily i know a cult object when i see one even if its unfamiliar narayan broke up the earth sindhu used a tin pan to scoop it onto a carpet hed turned face down careful not to scatter any i had no idea what they intended they were too intent on what they were doing to explain a litany of sorts in cant passed between them i heard something about auspices and the promise of the crows more about the daughter of night and those peopleor whatever they were all i could do was keep watch time passed i had a tense few minutes when the guard changed outside but those men had little to say to one another the new men didnt check inside the tent i heard a meaty whack and muted crunch turned to see what they were doing now theyd gotten a hole dug it was barely three feet deep and not that far across i couldnt guess what they meant to do with it they showed me narayan used the hammer face of his tool to break jahs bones just as ram had been doing with a rock that morning in that draw he whispered its been a long time but i still have the touch its amazing how small a bundle a big man makes once you pulverize his joints and fold him up they cut open jahs belly and deposited him in the hole narayans final stroke buried the pick in the corpses skull he cleaned the tool then they filled the hole around the remains tamping the earth as they went half an hour later you couldnt tell where theyd dug they put the carpets back bundled up the excess dirt looked at me for the first time since theyd begun they were surprised to find me impassive they wanted me to be outraged or disgusted or something anything that betrayed a feminine weakness ive seen men mutilated before narayan nodded maybe he was pleased hard to tell we still have to get out the firelight outside betrayed the positions of the guards they were where they were supposed to be if my spell worked a second time wed only need a little luck to get out unseen narayan and sindhu scattered dirt as we walked toward our camp good rumel work mistress narayan said and something more in cant to sindhu who agreed reluctantly i asked why did you bury him no one will know what happened to him i wanted him to become an object lesson leaving him lie would have told everyone who was responsible innuendo is more frightening than fact better youre guilty in rumor maybe why did you break him up and cut him open a smaller grave is harder to find we cut him open so he wouldnt bloat if you dont they sometimes bloat so much they come up out of the ground or they explode and loose off enough gas so the grave can be found by the smell especially by jackals who dig them up and scatter them all over practical logical obvious once he explained it id never had occasion to conceal a body before id surrounded myself with very practicaland clearly very experiencedmurderers we have to talk soon narayan he grinned that grin hed tell me some truth when he did we slipped back into camp and parted company i slept well there were dreams but they werent filled with gloom and doom in one a beautiful black woman came and held me and caressed me and called me her daughter and told me id done well i wakened feeling refreshed and as vigorous as if id had a full nights sleep it was a beautiful morning the world seemed painted in especially vivid colors my exercises with my talent went very well chapter nineteen the disappearance without trace of the high priest jahamaraj jah so trivial an opponent that i recall him only as a faded caricature of a man stunned the thousands cluttering the region around the ghoja ford a whisper went around saying he had schemed against the radisha and myself and that had sealed his fate i wasnt responsible for the rumor narayan denied having said anything to anybody two days after we buried jah everybody was convinced id eliminated him nobody knew how they were scared the possibility had a big impact on blade i got the feeling he thought id gone through some rite of passage and he could now devote himself to my cause i was pleased but had to wonder about a man so devoutly antagonistic toward priests i had narayan spread word that i still needed recruits especially skilled horsemen another two hundred shadar enlisted likewise nearly five hundred survivors of the dejagore battle though many just wanted regular meals or the comfort of a known place in the hierarchy taglian caste systems encourage dependence upon hierarchy the chaos at the ford provided none of the benefits of social rigidity only the handicaps i told narayan to think about expanding the camp soon wed be overcrowded i told blade to look for likely leaders wed never have enough of those the taglians continued to amaze me they remained pacifistic in their thinking yet admired what they thought was the direct and casual way i disposed of enemies the bigger the violence the more they would applaud as long as they were not threatened personally the radisha sent for me the third morning after jahs death it was a brief interview of no consequence except that i left convinced that smoke was more than a fakir hed penetrated the veil of time well enough to assure himself that id had a hand in jahs disappearance he was more frazzled than ever for the first time the radisha was rattled she saw her control slipping that night she and smoke and a few followers slipped over the main and headed north she left swan and mather to pretend she was secluded in the fortress that deceit was useless narayan told me what was happening before the radisha hit the water the day was noteworthy too because we enlisted our first nonveterans there were just three of them two were friends of narayans friends but their arrival was a sign that word was spreading and there were taglians willing to join the cause drills and training continued as intense as i could make them always designed to strip each man of all loyalties but those to his comrades and commander former slaves had become the most plentiful volunteersand best students they had nothing else the shadowmasters had destroyed their world i thought it might be a good idea to send trusted men to roam the lands below the main in search of more men without strong ties to taglios narayan and sindhu told me the radisha was doing her sneak i listened then said sit the time has come they understood they didnt look as distressed as id expected they had talked it over and had agreed to open up who are you what are you doing narayan took a deep breath he did not look me in the eye mistress we are deceivers followers of the goddess kina who has many names and many guises but whose only truth is death he went into a longwinded explanation about the goddess and how she related to the gods of taglios and its neighbors it was an improbable mishmash like that surrounding the genesis and attributes of most dark gods narayan plainly had not thought much about the doctrine his explanation didnt tell me much except that he and sindhu were devoted to their goddess it took some pressure but they admitted they worshipped kina in part by committing murder sindhu volunteered narayan jamadar of the changlor band is famous among us mistress evidently he broke the silence because it wasnt good form for a man to brag about his own accomplishments he has given the gift of paradise to more than a hundred souls one hundred fiftythree narayan said that apparently was not considered braggery paradise you want to explain that those whose lives are taken for the goddess are freed from the wheel of life and ascend to paradise immediately the wheel of life was a gunni concept you kept going around and around rebirth after rebirth till the good you did sufficiently outweighed the evil then you were allowed escape but not to paradise paradise was not a gunni concept the gunni who escaped the wheel became one with the generative force that had created the lords of light the gods who were its champions in the endless struggle with shadow which would be defeated only when the generative force had absorbed so many good souls it filled the universe shadow of course fought back by leading men to evil paradise is a vehdna notion something originally imagined by adolescent males and dirty old men it is stocked with all the comforts a male from a hard world could lust after in particular it is infested with eager virgins of both sexes so the elevated will have something with which to while away eternity the vehdna paradise gives no gate passes to women the vehdna say women have no souls the gods created them to bear children serve the lusts of men and work themselves into early graves the vehdna doctrine is the most perniciously antifemale of taglios cults but the most flexible as well they have their female saints and heroines and the vehdna amongst my soldiers adapted to my command more easily than did the shadar or gunni they just cast me in the role of their warrior saints esmalla and concentrated on doing their jobs the religions in my end of the world had not made more sense i did not criticize taglian beliefs but i did ask questions understanding is an important tool narayan insisted his beliefs were not derivative he claimed kina worship antedated all other religions what i saw were echoes of its primal influence mistress it is said the books record the histories of the children of kina back to the most ancient times when men first received the gift of letters it is said some are in tongues no man has spoken in ten thousand years what books are these where are they the books of the dead theyre sometimes called they are lost now i think there was a very bad time for the children of kina a long time ago a great warlord rhadreynak forged a vast empire he insulted kina she visited vengeance upon his house but by chance he was spared he launched a crusade without mercy the keepers of the books fled into a hidden place all who knew where they had gone were devoured by rhadreynaks wrath before the sainted mahtnahan dan jakel broke his neck with the silver rumel sindhu said something in cant softly the way men of other paths would say praise god or blessed be his name whats that i asked mahtnahan was the only silver rumel man ever to have lived the only deceiver ever to have sent more than a thousand souls to paradise sindhu said still softly every man when he plies his rumel for the first time and knows the ecstasy of kina for the first time aspires to the heights attained by mahtnahan narayan brightened grinned his grin and to his luck mahtnahan not only freed us of our greatest persecutor he survived the killing he lived another forty years i led them on through legends and oral histories interested in the way croaker would have been interested intrigued by the dark history over and over narayan insisted there were true written records somewhere and that it was the great dream of every jamadar in every generation to recover them this is a feeble world today mistress the greatest powers afoot are these shadowmasters and they dont really know what theyre doing the books ah the secrets said to lie within their pages the lost arts we talked about those books again i did not swallow their story whole id heard similar legends about books filled with earthshaking secrets before but narayan did startle me with a description of the place where they had been hidden it could have been the caverns i visited in my dreams as they might have been recalled after a thousand years of oral history the history of kinas cult might deserve some study someday after i secured myself in todays world i had not spent all my time just waiting for narayan to decide the time was ripe to let me in on a few secrets over the weeks i had done my listening among the men had dropped a question here and there to hundreds of individuals and had put together a fair picture of the kina cult as it was seen from outside every living taglian had heard kinas name and believed she existed every taglian had heard of the stranglers they thought of them more as bandits and gangsters than as religious fanatics and not one in a hundred believed the stranglers existed today they were something from the past eradicated during the last century i mentioned that to narayan he smiled that is our greatest tool mistress no one believes we exist you have seen how sindhu and i make little effort to hide from the men we go among them and say we are the feared and famous stranglers and they had better not displease us and they dont believe us but they fear us even so because they know stories and think we might try imitating the deceivers of old there are some who believe i suspected those included smoke the radisha and some others in high places always just enough he was a sinister little man and probably really a vegetable peddler honored in his community as a good gunni good father good grandfather but during the dry season when large portions of the taglian population were on the move for reasons of trade he would be too with his band pretending to be travellers like other travellers murdering those others when the opportunity arose he was good at that obviously that was why sindhu thought so highly of him now i understood their caste system it was based on number of successful murders narayan was likely secretly a wealthy man the followers of kina always robbed their victims they were more egalitarian than other cults narayan of low caste and cursed with a shadar name had become jamadar of his band because he was a brilliant tactician and favored of kinameaning he was lucky i assumedaccording to sindhu he was famous among the stranglers a living legend he doesnt need armholders sindhu said only the best black cloths kill so quickly and efficiently that they dont need armholders a living legend and my lieutenant interesting armholders he used the word as a title more than as a job description a band consists of many specialists mistress the newest members begin as gravediggers and bonebreakers many never advance beyond that level for they develop no skill with the rumel the yellow rumel men are the lowest ranked stranglers apprentices they seldom have a chance to kill being mostly assigned as armholders for red rumel men and as scouts and victimfinders red rumel men do most of the strangling few win the black rumel those almost always become jamadars or priests the priests do the divining and take omens intercede with kina and keep the chronicles and accounts of the company when it becomes necessary they act as judges i was never a priest narayan said a priest has to be educated never a priest but once a slave hed managed to keep his rumel throughout his captivity i wondered if he had fought back dealing silent death sometimes when the moment was propitious he admitted but kina teaches us not to slay indiscriminately nor in anger but only for her glory we do not slay for political reasonsexcept for the safety of the brotherhood interesting how many followers do you suppose kina claims there is no way to tell mistress narayan seemed almost relieved by this line of questioning we are outlawed we come under sentence of death the moment we take our oath to kina a jamadar will know how many there are in his band and will have contacts with a few other jamadars but hell have no idea how many bands there are or how strong they might be there are ways we have to recognize one another ways we communicate but seldom do we dare gather in large numbers the risks are too great sindhu said the festival of lights is our great gathering when each band sends men to the rites at the grove of doom narayan silenced him with a gesture a great holy day but little different than the shadar festival of the same name many of the band captains come but bring few of their followers the priests attend of course decisions are made and cases judged but i would guess that not one in twenty believers attends i would guess that there are between one and two thousand of us today more than half living in taglian territory not many at all then and only a minority of those truly skilled murderers but what a force to unleash in the darkness if i could make it my instrument and now the true question narayan the heart of the thing where do i fit why have you chosen me and for what chapter twenty crowing and clatter wakened croaker he rose and went to the temple entrance ghostly dawn light permeated the misty wood soulcatcher had returned the black stallions were lathered they had run long and hard the sorceress was besieged by squawking crows she cursed them and beat them back beckoned him he went out asked where have you been things have been happening so i gather i went for your armor she indicated the horse she hadnt ridden you went all the way to dejagore for that why well need it tell me what happened how were they my men holding out better than i expected they may hang on for quite a while shadowspinner isnt at his best the voice she chose rasped with irritation when she continued though it had become that of a cajoling child tell me itll take forever to get it out of them they all try to tell me at once the howler came past yesterday she raised that wooden box to eye level though she didnt make him look at the face inside the howler tell me he did the game grows more interesting how did longshadow lure him out of his swamp i dont know i was speaking rhetorically croaker go inside im tired i was in a bad mood already he went he didnt want to test her temper outside she chattered with a flock of crows so dense she disappeared among them somehow she brought confusion out of chaos minutes later the temple vibrated to the beat of countless wings a black cloud flew away south soulcatcher came inside croaker kept his distance kept his mouth shut not much intimidated him but he wasnt one to stick his hand in a cobras mouth morning came croaker wakened soulcatcher appeared to be sleeping soundly he resisted temptation it was less than a flutter of a thought anyway he wouldnt catch her off guard that easily chances were she wasnt asleep at all resting yes maybe testing him he couldnt recall ever having seen her sleep he made himself breakfast soulcatcher wakened while he cooked he didnt notice a dramatic pink flash startled him he whirled pinkish smoke swirled beyond the sorceress a childsized creature pranced out flipped the woman a salute sauntered over to him how they hanging chief long time no see want an honest answer or one that will please you frogface hey you aint surprised to see

final debacle there whats the news the imp stood only two feet tall though he had the proportions of an adult he glanced at soulcatcher received some intangible permission that mogaba is one bad actor

buddies oneeye goblin and murgen they dont like the way he operates he dont like them all the time telling him about it you get a split there or shadowspinner breaks loose you got a whole new game croaker settled with his meal shadowspinner breaks loose yeah he got hurt in the fight you know his old buddy from down south longshadow got a whammy in on him while he was down keeps him from using his talents them shadowmasters was a lovely bunch all the time trying to slide around behind each other even when they was up to their asses in alligators longshadow hes got a notion he can play shadowspinner just loose enough to let him wipe dejagore then squish the clown and make himself king of the world in a voice little more than a whisper the sorceress said he has the howler to consider now and me the imps grin faded you aint as secret as you think boss they know youre down here they all did from the beginning damn she paced i thought id been more careful hey not to worry none of them got the faintest where you are now and maybe when we get done with them theyll wish they was nicer to you in the old days eh eh he laughed childlike croaker had encountered frogface first in geaxle far to the north oneeye one of the company wizards had bought him there everyone but oneeye had doubted the imps provenance and loyalty though frogface had made himself useful croaker asked soulcatcher you have something planned yes stand up he did she rested one gloved hand against his chest uhm youve healed enough and im running out of time nervous excitement flooded him he knew what she wanted and did not want to do it i thought that was why he was here do you trust him enough to have him watch me hey chief the imp said you hurt my feelings sure she does i done hitched my star one word from me and he spends eternity in torment her voice was a merry little girls she could be chilling in her choices that too the imp said all of a sudden surly its a hard life cap nobody dont

little while for you soulcatcher said enough banter croaker calm yourself get yourself ready for surgery the imp and i will ready everything else nude and headless the sorceress floated four feet off the floor shoulders elevated her unboxed head sat on a stone table nearby eyes alert croaker scanned the body it was perfect though pale and waxy hed seen only one to compare her sisters he glanced at the imp perched on the head of a stone monster that protruded from the wall the imp winked show us what you got cap croaker was not reassured he glanced at his hands they were steady a legacy of surgeries performed on a dozen battlefields under terrifying conditions he stepped to the table the sorceress had gathered the best surgical instruments the world had to offer this will take a while imp if i tell you to do something you do it now understood sure chief might help if i knew what you were going to do ill start by removing the scar tissue thatll be delicate youll have to help control bleeding he didnt know if there would be bleeding or not hed never carved on somebody who should have been dead fifteen years ago he could not believe this operation was possible but catcher being alive was impossible how much control would she have how much would she participate his would be the least part here physical preparation for the mating of head and neck the rest tying nerve to nerve and blood vessel to blood vessel would be up to her it wouldnt work it couldnt he went to work soon he was concentrating enough to forget the price of failure chapter twentyone longshadow watched the upper limb of the sun slide below the horizon he barked an order a wrinkly little brown man whispered yes my lord he scurried out of the crystal room longshadow remained motionless watched the day fade welcome the enemy hours it was summertime longshadow preferred summers the nights were shorter he was less troubled less fearful now those nights after the stormgard debacle had included a crisis of confidence now past he was not cocky but was sure of himself now everything he touched was turning to gold unfolding to perfection the howler was on his way from the swamps undetected the siege of stormgard continued to enervate shadowspinners armies spinner remained impotent she seemed to have faded content to avenge herself on dorotea senjak senjak was playing her own game unaware that she was playing his soon now she would stumble he had just one move to make and it was time each seventy feet along overlooks wall stood a tower topped by crystal inside each cylinder was a large curved mirror fires came to life within those towers the flames burned brightly the mirrors hurled light onto the old road descending from the plain of glittering stone no shadow could move there unseen his confidence was back he could leave the night watch to others he had other business to conduct there were reports to receive orders to send communiques to issue he turned his back on the outside world approached a crystal sphere on a pedestal at the heart of the chamber the sphere was four feet in diameter channels wormholed through it to a hollow at the heart shimmers of light rippled over its surface snakes of light wriggled through the channels inside longshadow rested withered hands on the sphere surface light absorbed them his hands sank into the globe slowly as though melting through ice he grasped serpents of light manipulated them a port opened where the sphere rested on the pedestal unsealing one channel darkness oozed in it came reluctantly compelled fighting every inch it hated the light as the shadowmaster hated darkness it filled the heart of the sphere longshadow spoke to it the light on the sphere rippled crept up his arms the sphere vibrated a sound weaker than a whisper came off it longshadow listened then he sent the shadow away and summoned another to the fourth such shadow he said take this message to taglios create the agent as the shadow oozed away fleeing the light the shadowmaster suddenly felt that he was no longer alone frightened he tried to turn to look at the road from the plain nothing moved there the shadowtraps were holding what then something inky glossy flashed through the nearest beam huh no shadow that a crow a lot of crows what were crows doing here it was night crows didnt fly at night it came then there had been crows around overlook for weeks seldom behaving as crows should hers he cursed stamped angrily childishly shed been watching all along she knew everything fear fled before rage hed never had much selfcontrol he tried to yank his arms free forgetting there should be no quick movement in the sphere the crows seemed to laugh at him hell they swarmed over the surrounding walls cawing mockingly he ripped a hand out of the sphere bloody sparks crackled between his fingers there would be an end to those cackling devils she wouldnt spy on him again he hurled a bolt a dozen crows exploded blood and feathers splattered the tower the survivors cawed uproariously sense penetrated rage something was wrong they wanted him to attack them diversion the sphere a gap remained where hed freed his hand the hole penetrated to the core a darkness was slithering through already he screamed he clamped down on his fear removed his other hand slowly he closed the deadly gap carefully but not before the shadow escaped it darted through the doorway out of the chamber down into the bowels of overlook fleeing the light there was a shadow loose in the fortress somewhere a scream the shadow was hunting longshadow forced an icy calm it was one lone shadow small controllable outside the crows made merry he stifled rage they would not provoke him again your hour will come he promised fly to the bitch report your failure i live i still live chapter twentytwo when the watchful eye lapses those who are watched invariably sense the instant of freedom a prodigious wail escaped the little thing called the howler it gobbled at the men carrying it they raced forward carried it into the camp of the shadowmaster shadowspinner while the watcher in the south was diverted the howler remained just long enough to make contact speak briefly exchange views reach an understanding by which he stood to evade the inevitable treachery of longshadow sure to surface the instant the threat from taglios evaporated he was long gone when longshadows seekers found him again the only evidence of his visit was an improvement in shadowspinners condition spinner kept that well hidden chapter twentythree the breeze had shifted it came from the northeast now carrying smoke from across the river i asked narayan could we confiscate their wood there had been suicides all morning unwise mistress interfering might start a rebellion your grip isnt that tight and likely would never be unpleasant as i found that truth just wishful thinking tinkering with customs isnt my mission nor his i had not pressed narayan about that i could guess though it was implicit in his beliefs he wanted to bring on the year of the skulls he wanted kina free he wanted to become immortal a deceiver saint its all far away mistress what do we do today were approaching that point where assembling an army begins snowballing snowballing id used forsberger for snowballing not thinking i did not know the taglian for snow it did not snow here narayan had never seen snow it starts growing of its own momentum in another week ten days id guess well begin getting more recruits than we can handle even with the radisha against us he was convinced the woman was an enemy that could work for us if we appeal to resentment of the powers that be narayan understood such resentments brought recruits to the deceivers theres less of that than you hope this isnt your land my people are very fatalistic they were but they had their handles there would not be two thousand men under my standard now otherwise theyll respond to the right spark true we all will mistress absolutely ive provided that spark for you and your friends havent i but how about a spark to fire the masses one that will make them forget their fear of the black company and their objections to a woman commander i understood why the company was feared now for his sake maybe it was best croaker had gone before he figured it out it would have broken his heart narayan had no suggestions i said we need an electrifying rumor to hand your brotherhood to whisper everywhere word should have reached all the jamadars now mistress wonderful narayan so every band captain has heard that your strangler messiah is come assume they all believe because the news came from you famous and honored master strangler my tone was getting sarcastic how many men will that bring to a standard that needs thousands id rather have your friends stay where they are as our hands and knives in hiding are there other legends i can exploit are there other fears the shadowmasters are scary enough at least in the country where they remember last year true we were getting volunteers from across the river already men whod had no chance to enlist before we marched on dejagore the men we had taken down had come from the city or were slaves we had liberated after overrunning ghoja the country folk intimate with the terror of the shadowmasters should prove a rich source of manpower and would be hardier than city folk but i might have to gather my harvest quickly around here power emanated from the palace and the temples of trogo taglios a few frightened men there could issue bulls and dictates forbidding the faithful from joining me do you have friends in the city not many none that i know personally sindhu may know some ram came from the city yes and a few others whatre you thinking it might be wise to get established there now before the radisha and especially that whimpering runt smoke can swing opinion against us i said we and us always but meant i and me narayan was not fooled much we cant leave ghoja thousands more men will come here we have to collect them i smiled suppose we split what we have you take half stay here do the gathering and i take half to the city he reacted the way i expected almost panicky he didnt want me out of his sight or i could leave blade blade is a man of respect with a strong reputation down here excellent idea mistress i wondered who was manipulating whom do you suppose sindhu is a man of enough respect to leave with him more than enough mistress good blade will have to know something about him something about your brotherhood mistress if youre going to use a tool you should know its capabilities only a priest demands we take things on faith priests and functionaries narayan corrected youre right blade will take nothing on faith he was the last man alive who would that might come between us someday are any of your brotherhood cynical enough to be hiding inside other priesthoods mistress he sounded hurt i have few sources of information if we had friends within the priesthoods i dont know about taglios mistress it seems unlikely i did miss the old days when id had the unbridled use of my powers when i could summon a hundred demons to spy for me when i could recall the memories of a mouse that had been in the wall of a room where my enemies had congregated id told narayan that id built an empire from beginnings as humble as ours that was true but id had more weapons this time i often felt disarmed the weapons were coming back but far too slowly send blade to me i took blade for a walk up the river east of the fortress he was content to wait on me he spoke only once cryptically as we approached a bankside tree where a fishing pole leaned looks like swan never got back i had him explain it didnt mean much i looked at the fortress swan and mather were in there nominal commanders of all taglian forces below the river i wondered how seriously they took that they hadnt been out much i wondered if blade was in touch hed hardly had time hed been working hours longer than mine teaching himself as he taught his men i wondered why he made the effort i sensed a deep reservoir of irrational hatred inside him i suspected he was a man who wanted to change the world such men are easy to manipulate easier than the swans who mostly just want to be left alone im thinking of promoting you i told him he responded sardonically to what unless youre promoting yourself too of course you become legate of the ghoja legion i become general of the army youre going north he didnt waste words and didnt need many to extract a lot of information i should be in taglios now to guard my interests its a bad spot in the crocodiles jaws i dont follow you need to be here to gather soldiers to gain power you need to be there to control the priests who can keep recruits away yes you need trustworthy lieutenants but youre alone am i maybe not maybe i misinterpret the interest of narayan and sindhu probably not their goals arent mine what do you know about them nothing they arent what they pretend i thought about that decided he meant they werent what they pretended to be to the world have you heard of the deceivers blade sometimes called the stranglers death cult legendary probably the radisha mentioned them and their goddess the wizard is terrified of them the soldiers say they are extinct that isnt true is it no a few still exist for their own reasons theyre backing me i wont bore you with their dogma its repulsive and im not sure it was related to me truthfully he grunted i wondered what went on inside his head he hid himself well id met others like him i will be stunned the day i meet someone entirely new go north without fear ill manage ghoja i believed him i turned back we walked toward camp i tried to ignore the stench from across the river what do you want blade why are you doing this he shrugged an uncharacteristic action there are many evils in the world i guess ive chosen one for my personal crusade why such a hatred for priests he didnt shrug he didnt give me a straight answer either if each man picks an evil and attacks it relentlessly how long can evil persist that was an easy one forever more evil gets done in the name of righteousness than any other way few villains think they are villains but i left him his illusion if he had one i doubted he did no more than a swords blade does at first id thought him moved as swan so obviously was when he looked at me but he hadnt so much as hinted that he considered me anything but a fellow soldier he confused me he asked will you talk to willow and cordy or shall i what do you think depends what you want to discuss how you wiggle some you can lead swan anywhere not interested ill talk to them then you go ahead do what you have to do sunrise next morning i was on the road north with two incompetent and incomplete battalions narayan and ram and all the trophies i had claimed from the shadowmasters horsemen chapter twentyfour the radisha waited impatiently while smoke bustled around making sure his spells were proof against eavesdroppers the prahbrindrah drah lounged in a chair looking indolent and unconcerned but he spoke first when the wizard signalled satisfaction with his precautions more bad news sis bad i dont know not pleasant dejagore was a disaster though experts tell me it hurt the shadowmasters so badly they cant bother us this year the woman you lust after did survive though the prahbrindrah grinned is that the good news or the bad subject to interpretation for once though i think smoke might be right ah she insists the defeat neither destroyed the black company nor terminated our contract she gave me a requisition for more men equipment and materials shes serious deadly she reminded me of the companys history and what becomes of those who renege on contracts the prahbrindrah chuckled bold wench all by herself smoke squeaked something the radisha said shes already recruited a force two thousand strong shes training them shes dangerous dear youd better take her seriously smoke squeaked again apparently unable to articulate what he wanted to say yes she killed jahamaraj jah jah tried giving her some trouble poof she made him disappear the prince took a deep breath blew it out between puffed cheeks cant fault her taste but thats no way to make friends with priests smoke gobbled again the radisha said she doesnt intend to try she got blade to defect hes her number two man now you know his attitude dammit smoke one thing at a time swan and mather they stuck i think but swan is taken with her too i really dont know what you see in her the prahbrindrah chuckled shes exotic and gorgeous where are they now i left them in charge supposedly its meaningless she considers herself the captain and free to do whatever she pleases with those two there ill have eyes on the scene they can keep us informed all right smoke all right whats he lathered about he thinks shes made an alliance with the stranglers the stranglers kina worshippers like smokes been whining all along oh first time she visited me she brought two of them with her or men who appeared to be stranglers smoke managed a clear statement she carried a strangling cloth herself i believe she slew jah personally i believe she disposed of his corpse in a deceivers rite let me think the prince steepled his fingers before his lips finally he asked were they men shed recruited or did she make an alliance with the whole cult smoke gobbled the radisha contradicted him i dont know who knows how that cult works its not monolithic smoke said she carried a rumel herself she posed as kina during the fight with the shadowmasters cavalry the radisha had to explain that the prince observed so we assume the worst no matter how unlikely even if she has access to only a few stranglers dear shes acquired an unholy power they have no fear of death if theyre told to kill theyll kill disregarding any cost to themselves and we have no way of knowing who might be one of them the year of the skulls smoke piped its coming lets dont get carried away you talked to her sis what does she want to continue the war to fulfill the black companys commission then see us meet our end of the agreement then were in no immediate danger why not let her have her head kill her now smoke said before she grows any stronger destroy her or she will destroy taglios he seems to be overreacting dont you think sis im not so sure anymore but you didnt talk to her her with all the confidence of a tidal wave shes turned damned scary and the shadowmasters wholl handle them we have a year you think we could build an army i dont know i think we made a lethal mistake dealing with the black company the way we did quiet smoke we wove webs of deception that will come back on us because were in too deep to retreat swan blade and mather were convinced we were treacherous in our promises im sure blade shared his opinions with the woman well step carefully then the prahbrindrah reflected but right now i dont see the threat if she wants to get the shadowmasters i say let her go after them smoke had a fit he ranted he cursed he issued dire prophecies every sentence included the words the year of the skulls his histrionics were so craven they drove the radisha toward her brothers position brother and sister left him to his humors as they moved toward their part of the palace the prahbrindrah asked whats gotten into him hes lost his nerve completely he never had much no but hes gone from a mouse to a jellyfish first it was fear of getting found out by the shadowmasters now its the stranglers they scare me the prince snorted we have more power than you suspect sis we have the power to manipulate three priesthoods the radisha sneered she knew what that was worth so did jahamaraj jah now chapter twentyfive eight men sat around the fire in the room without a roof that room was on the top floor of a fourstorey tenement in taglios worst slum the landlord would have suffered apoplexy had he seen what they had done they had been there only a few days they were wrinkled little brown men unlike any taglian native but taglios lay beside a great river strangers came and went unusual people seldom drew a second glance they had opened the room to the elements and now some regretted it a summer shower had come down the river it was not a heavy rain but the clouds had stalled over the city they shed a steady drizzle taglios people were pleased rain cleared the air and carried away the trash in the streets tomorrow though the air would be muggy and everyone would complain seven of the eight brown men did nothing but stare into the flames the eighth occasionally added a bit of fuel or a pinch of something that sent sparks flying and filled the air with aromatic smoke they were patient they did this for two hours each night suddenly shadows rippled in over the tops of the walls danced behind and among the men they did not move did nothing to admit they sensed the new presence the one added another pinch of aromatic then rested his hands in his lap shadows gathered around him shadows whispered he replied i understand the language he spoke was not taglian it was spoken nowhere within six hundred miles of taglios the shadows went away the men did not move till the fire died the rain became a blessing then it quenched the flames quickly the one who had fed the fire spoke briefly the others nodded they had their orders discussion was unnecessary in minutes they were out in the taglian streets smoke muttered curses as he stepped into the rain story of my life nothing goes right anymore he scuttled along head down what am i doing out here he ought to be inside trying to make the radisha see sense so she could make her brother see sense they were going to ruin everything all they had worked toward was going to fly away if they didnt do something about that woman they were going to destroy taglios by default why couldnt they see that sometimes a walk helped clear the mind he needed to be out away alone free some new avenue would present itself there was a way to get through he was sure there had to be a bat zipped past so close he felt the air stirred by its wings a bat on a night like this he recalled a time before the legions marched when bats had been everywhere and someone had made a considerable effort to eliminate them someone like maybe those wizards who had travelled with the black company he halted suddenly nervous bats in weather when bats should not fly not a good omen he had not come far one minute and hed be safely in the palace another bat whipped past he turned to run three men blocked his path he whirled more men everywhere men he was surrounded for half a minute they seemed a horde but there were only six in very bad taglian one said a man want see you you come he looked around wildly there was no escape the paradox of being smoke smoke thought terrified when the danger was insubstantial calm now with it concrete he moved through streets dark and wet surrounded by men no bigger than he his mind worked perfectly he could break away whenever he willed one small spell and he could be gone safe but something was afoot it might be crucial to know what that spell could be loosed later as well as now he pretended to be as rattled and craven as ever they took him to the worst part of the city to a tenement that looked like it could collapse any second he was more frightened of it than of them they led him up four creaky flights one man tapped a code on a door the door opened they went inside smoke eyed the man waiting he looked just like the six who had brought him nor did the man who had opened the door seem any different all hatched in the same nest but the man who waited spoke passable taglian he asked you are the one called smoke the fire marshall i cannot recall the full title the wizard supposed they knew who and what he was else he would not be here i am you have me at a disadvantage i have no name i can be called one who leads eight who serve ghost of a smile unwieldy yes it is of no importance i am the only one here who can speak your language you wont confuse me with anyone else why did you interrupt my stroll keep it cool casual he thought because we have a common interest in dealing with a peril so great it could devour the world the year of the skulls now smoke knew who they were he controlled himself but his mind went wild his efforts to maintain his anonymity had gone for naught the shadowmasters knew him maybe swan was right maybe he was just a coward he was he had known that always but he was no puling craven he could manage his fear if he had to still it rankled that swan could be right about anything willow swan was an animal that walked on its hind legs and made noises like a man the year of the skulls he asked what do you mean the man smiled thinly it will save time if we dont pretend you know kina is stirring and when she stirs ripples go out and waken other things best left undisturbed the first whisper of kina passes over the world soon the woman who is her avatar will become aware of what she is do you think me simple smoke demanded do you believe i can be weaned from my loyalty so easily do you believe an appeal to my fears will subvert me no subversion is not the point he who sent me is to you as you are to a mouse he is afraid he has cast the bones of time he has seen what may be that woman can bring on the true year of the skulls what she was once she can become again filled with the breath of kina before that terror all else pales the contention of armies becomes the squabbling of children but he who sent me has no power to reach out where the danger abides she has surrounded herself with kinas children she grows stronger by the hour and he who sent me must remain where he is holding back the tide of darkness that laps at shadowcatch he can do nothing but register his appeal for help and offer his friendship which you may test as you will and call upon as you see fit a scheme a tortuous scheme surely but he dared not reject it out of hand there was sorcery in this place he hadnt time to take its measure if he turned them down flatly he might not get out alive which shadowmaster do you call lord he thought he knew the man had mentioned shadowcatch the brown man smiled you call him longshadow he has other names longshadow master of shadowcatch the shadowmaster whose demesne was farthest from taglios who was the least known of the four rumored to be insane he hadnt been much involved in the attacks upon taglios the foreigner said he who sent me has not been involved in this war he opposed it from the beginning he has refused to participate there are more pressing dangers more deadly concerns which preoccupy him men much like you have attacked taglians several times stipulated on the river in the southern taglian territories can you guess the common denominator wizard the woman the woman kinas fulcrum he who sent me cast the bones of time and as she becomes a greater danger he becomes more pressed elsewhere less able to fight he needs allies he is desperate with fear he will give more than he takes the weed of doom has taken root in taglios and he can do so little it must be expunged by taglians theres a war on taglians didnt initiate it neither did he but that war can be ended he has that power of the three who wanted war two are dead stormshadow and moonshadow are gone shadowspinner lingers he controls their combined armies but he is injured he can be compelled to accept peace he can be expunged if that is the price of peace peace can be restored taglios can be as it was before the madness began but he who sent me will not invest resources in making these things come true if there is nothing to be gained by letting some of his attention be diverted from what glittering stone khatovar you are no unlettered peasant you have read the ancients you know the shadar khadi is but a pale shade of kina though khadis priests deny it you know khatovar in the old tongue means khadis throne and is supposed to be the place where khadi fell to earth he who sent me believes the legend of khatovar is an echo of an older truer tale of kina smoke controlled his emotions and fears he forced a smile youve given me a great deal to digest a veritable feast only a first course truly he who sent me is desperate he needs a friend an ally who has influence here who has some chance to cut the weed before it flowers he will do what he has to do to demonstrate his good faith he has told me to tell you he will even bring you to him so you can judge his honesty for yourself if that is your wish if you are able to feel safe doing so hell agree to whatever safeguards you feel you need if you wish to speak to him directly a lot to digest smoke said again just wanting to get out of there before somebody turned vicious i expect so enough to overturn your world and more to come and you have been gone a long time now we wouldnt want your absence to become an object of concern go think make decisions how should i get in touch the brown man smiled we will find you we will move from this place after you leave lest you suffer some shortsighted inspiration to make yourself a hero a bat will find you when it is time place yourself where you cannot be watched and these others will meet you all right youre right id better get back he eased toward the door still not sure where he stood but no one interfered with his departure he had a lot to mull over and the interview had been productive if for no other reason than that it proved the shadowmasters had put new agents into the city after the black companys wizards rooted out those that had been there before the little brown man who spoke bad taglian asked his leader will he take the bait the leader shrugged the appeal was broad enough to touch him somewhere his fears his ego his ambitions hes been handed the chance to destroy what he fears and hates hes been offered the chance to make himself big as a peacemaker hes been offered the opportunity to fatten his own power with potent friends if he has any need to become a traitor weve touched it the man smiled his companions did too then all eight began packing the leader was sure the wizards conscience would move him to report this initial approach he hoped the wizard would not take long seducing himself the shadowmaster was concerned about wasting time he was not pleasant when he was worried chapter twentysix the radisha had only a days start on us though a thousand men should find it harder to stop and start than a smaller party we gained ground narayan had supplied us with the most efficient and motivated men we were only two hours behind when the radisha reached the city i marched in boldly trophies displayed and went straight to the barracks the company had used when we were training the legions the barracks were occupied by men we had left behind men who had been injured in the battle at the ghoja ford and men who had volunteered after our departure most were commuting from their homes for daytime selftraining but the barracks were still crowded enrollment exceeded four thousand get them under control i told narayan as soon as i grasped the situation make them ours isolate them as much as possible work on them bold words but how practical word of our arrival is spreading he said the whole city will know soon no avoiding it ive been thinking between them the men ought to have some notion what happened to almost everybody who didnt come home a lot of taglians will want to know what happened to their men we could make a few friends telling them wed be swamped he was forgetting to offer an honorific more and more often he thought he was a partner in my enterprise maybe but let it out that we welcome inquiries and push news that a lot of taglians are trapped in dejagore and i could get them out if i could get a little help narayan looked at me oddly no chance mistress those men are dead even if theyre still breathing we know it but the world doesnt anybody asks to get them put we just put together enough men and arms quick enough that will fix anybody who wants to interfere with me someone opens his mouth he says he doesnt care about those men blade says the people here all think their priests are thieves they might get real upset if the priests start playing with their sons and brothers and husbands lives we take advantage of religious friction if a gunni priest gets on me we just appeal to the shadar and vehdna laity and never stop mentioning that im the only professional soldier around narayan grinned that repulsive grin youve given this a lot of thought wasnt much else to do on the way here get moving we have to take control before anybody wonders if we really ought to before troublemakers think up ways to give us grief get feelers out to members of your brotherhood we need information narayan had some organizational skills though he was no charismatic leader he could rise in a small group by demonstrated ability but hed never get a large gang to follow him just because he cut a bold figure thinking that made me think of croaker croaker hadnt been charismatic hed been a workaday sort of commander hed identified the task to be accomplished had considered his options had put the bestsuited men to work he usually guessed right and got the job done except for that last time at dejagore when his weakness became obvious he didnt think fast on his feet he didnt intuit well past tense woman hes gone i didnt want to think about him it still hurt too much there was plenty of work to occupy me i began looking at the manpower resources that had fallen into my lap not promising plenty of spear carriers determined young men but hardly anyone who stood out as an immediate leader damn i missed the military engine id had back home i started wondering what i was doing here why i had come pointless woman i could not go back that empire had moved on it had no place for me now i missed more than my armies i had no intelligence machine no way to ferret out secrets ram remained my shadow as much as he could determined to protect me ram was probably under the most dire orders of jamadar narayan ram do you know the country around taglios no mistress i never went out till i enlisted i need men who do know find them please mistress this place is indefensible most of the men are drilling out of their homes why was i explaining we need to get away from distractions and vulnerabilities ideally on a hill near the south road water and a large wood ill ask around mistress he was reluctant to leave me but no longer had to be ordered away he was learning give him another year narayan materialized before ram returned its going all right a lot of excitement the men who were therethere must be at least six hundred of them noware telling inflated stories about how we beat those cavalrymen theres talk about relieving dejagore before the rainy season i didnt have to start it during the rainy season the main became impassable for five or six months it was taglios wall against the shadowmasters and theirs against taglios what would happen if i got caught south of the river when the rains came that would give me time to get the army whipped into shape on the other hand it would not leave me anywhere to run narayan get me mistress i forget you havent been with me forever i was going to send you after something we compiled before we went south one of our great enterprises had been a census of men materials animals skills and other resources an army needs the results should be around somewhere still there was a way around the high water dilemma if the right men and materials were available mistress narayan asked again sorry just wondering what im doing here i have these moments he took me literally he started in on revenge and rebuilding the company i know narayan its just fatigue rest then youll have to be at your best later oh those who want to know about their men are gathering already surely the news of our arrival has reached all the false priests and even the palace men will come to see how they can take advantage of you youre right ram returned with a half dozen men and some maps none were men who had come north with me they were nervous they showed me three sites they thought might suit my purpose i dismissed one immediately it had a hamlet there already neither of the others had much to recommend it either way which meant i had to go look for myself something to kill time i was getting as sarky as croaker in my old age i thanked everybody and sent them away a few minutes rest would be useful like narayan said the siege would begin soon we might have problems with men who could not wait to see their loved ones i dragged my things into the quarters i had occupied last time one small room i refused to share i plopped on the cot it had not changed while i was gone still a rock within a mask of linen id just relax for a few minutes hours fled i dreamed i was confused when narayan wakened me he came while i was visiting the caverns of the ancients the voice calling me was louder clearer more insistent more pressed i got hold of myself what is it the crowds of relatives i was having them visit the gate one by one but theyve started pushing and shoving there must be four thousand people out there and more arriving all the time its dark why did you let me sleep you needed it its raining too that may be a blessing itll keep some people home but this would cost time however we handled it theres a public square where we paraded before we went south i dont recall the name find out tell those people to assemble there tell the men to prepare for a short march in the weather tell ram to ready my armor but forget the helmet there were five thousand people in the square i managed to intimidate them into keeping quiet i faced them on my stallion looking at a sea of lamps and lanterns and torches while the soldiers formed up behind me i said you have a right to know what happened to your loved ones but the soldiers and i have a great work before us yet if youll cooperate well handle this quickly if you dont remain orderly well never get it done my taglian had improved dramatically no one had trouble understanding me when i point you out name the man you want to know about in a clear loud voice if one of the soldiers knew him hell speak up go to that soldier talk quickly and quietly if the news is bad contain yourself there are others who want news too they have to be able to hear i doubted it would go smoothly for long but it was just a gesture meant to get me mentioned kindly outside the corridors of power it worked well for longer than i expected but taglians are pliable people used to doing what theyre told when disorder did develop i just announced that we would leave if it did not stop some of my men were the objects of queries i had narayan moving through the formation those he knew were industrious cooperative hardworking and loyal he could grant a short leave he was supposed to remind the less diligent why they would remain on duty carrot and stick it held up even the greenest behaved it took all night but we satisfied half the crowd i reminded everyone frequently that mogabas legion and who knew how many more men were trapped in dejagore thanks to the desertion of jahamaraj jah i made it sound like everyone not accounted for was among the besieged most were probably dead whips and carrots and emotional manipulations id been at it so long i could do it in my sleep a messenger came there were priests at the barracks to see me took them long enough i muttered were they late because they were off balance or because they waited till they were ready for a confrontation no matter they would wait till we finished the rain stopped it was never much more than a drizzling nuisance once we cleared the square i dismounted and walked with narayan we were seventy fewer now he had let that many go i asked did you notice the bats a few mistress he was puzzled are they special among the omens of kina i dont think so but i was never a priest theyre significant to me eh they tell me plain as a shout that the shadowmasters have spies here general order to the men kill all bats if they can find out where theyre roosting watch out for foreigners pass the word to the populace too there are spies among us again and i want to lay hands on a few wed probably end up swamped with useless reports about harmless people but a few wouldnt be harmless and those needed their teeth pulled chapter twentyseven the men waiting included delegations from all three religious hierarchies they were not pleased that i had kept them waiting i did not apologize i was not in a good humor and did not mind a confrontation theyd had to wait in the mess hall because there was nowhere else to put them even there they had to crowd up because they had to get out of the way of men who had nowhere else to spread their blankets before i went in i told narayan first score to my credit they came to me probably because none of them want you making a private deal with the others probably i put on my best scowl laid on a light glamor clanked into the mess hall good morning im honored but im also pressed for time if you have something to discuss please get to the point im an hour behind schedule and didnt budget time for socializing they didnt know how to take me a woman talking hard was something new somebody shot an obnoxious question from the back all right a position statement that should save time my religious attitude is indifference ill stay indifferent as long as religion ignores me my position on social issues is the same im a soldier one of the black company which contracted with the prahbrindrah drah to rid taglios of the shadowmasters my captain fell i replaced him i will fulfill the contract if that statement doesnt answer your questions then you probably have questions you have no right to ask my predecessor was a patient man he worried about offending people i dont share those qualities im direct and unpleasant when aroused questions they had them of course they yammered i picked a man i recognized one who was offensive and was not loved by his peers he was a bald gunni in scarlet tal youre being unpleasant stop it you have no legitimate business here none of you have really i said i have no interest in religion you have little cause to be interested in things military lets leave each other to our own competences beautiful tal played his part as though rehearsed his response was more than offensive it was a direct challenge predicated upon my sex speaking to my failure to commit suttee i tossed him a golden hammer not to the heart but to the right shoulder it spun him around and knocked him down he screamed for more than a minute before he passed out it got real quiet everyone including poor fuddled narayan stared at me wideeyed you see im not my predecessor he would have remained polite he would have clung to persuasion and diplomacy long past the point where a demonstration is a more effective way to communicate go tend to priestly matters ill tend to making war and to wartime discipline that should not be hard for them to figure out the companys contract made the captain virtual military dictator for a year croaker had not used the power i did not expect to but it was there if needed go i have work to do they went quietly thoughtfully well narayan said after they left well now they know im no fainter now they know im missionoriented and dont care who i stomp if they get in the way theyre bad men to make enemies they make the choice yes i know but theyre confused itll take them a while to decide what to do then theyll all get in each others ways ive bought time i need intelligence sources narayan find ram tell him i want those men he brought to me earlier its time to look at those sites before he could argue i added and tell him if he plans to keep on being my shadow hed better learn to ride i expect to be moving around a lot now yes mistress he hurried off paused just before he left looked back frowned he was wondering who was using who and who had the upper hand good let him while he was wondering id get my foundations set solidly the men in the mess hall all stared at me with varying degrees of awe few met my gaze rest while you can soldiers the sands are running through the glass i went to my quarters to wait for ram chapter twentyeight croaker stared into the drizzly night fingers nervously twisting strands of grass one of the horses made a sound out there he thought about walking over there mounting up bareback riding away he would stand a fiftyfifty chance of staying ahead except that things had changed now catcher did not have to catch up physically he held up the figure he had made a man shape two inches tall the grass gave off a garlic odor he shrugged flipped it out into the rain took more strands of grass from a pocket he had made hundreds now grass figures had become a sort of measure of time a steady banging came from behind him he turned away from the night walked slowly toward the woman she had produced a set of armorers tools from somewhere this was the second day running she had spent building something obviously black armor but why she glanced at the horse figure he was twisting i may get you some paper and ink would you there was a lot he wanted to set down he had grown used to keeping a journal i may thats no pastime for a grown man he shrugged put the horse aside take a break time to check you over she no longer wore robes she was outfitted as she had been when first he had met her in tight black leather that somehow left her sex ambiguous her soulcatcher costume she called it she hadnt bothered with the helmet yet she set her tools aside looked at him with mischief in her eyes you sound depressed the voice she chose was merry i am depressed stand up she did he peeled away the leather around her neck its healing quickly ill remove the sutures tomorrow maybe will there be much scarring i dont know depends on how well your healing spells work i didnt know you were vain im human im a woman i want to look nice same voice but less merry you do look nice he did not think before he spoke just making a statement of fact she looked nice in the sense that she was a beautiful woman like her sister he had become very conscious of that since she had changed her style of dress that left him nagged by lowgrade guilt she laughed im reading your mind croaker she was not literally she would not be pleased with him if she was but she had been around a long time and had studied people she could read books from a few physical clues he grunted he was getting used to it there was no point trying hard to hide from it what are you making armor well be healed enough to go soon well have great fun ill bet he felt a twinge in his chest he was almost healed there had been none of the complications he had expected he had begun taking forced exercise were the gadflies here love the chaos factor my beloved sister and the taglians know nothing about us those clubfooted shadowmasters know im here but they dont know about you they dont know what youve accomplished they think im a nuisance floating around in the dark i doubt theyve entertained the notion that i could be restored she rested a hand on his cheek im more basic than you think oh change of voice businesslike masculine at odds with the invitation i have eyes everywhere i know every word spoken by anyone who interests me a while back i arranged for longshadow to be diverted while howler visited spinner and cut longshadows webs of control damn hell hit dejagore with everything hell lie low and pretend hes unchanged the siege costs him nothing hell be more interested in improving his position in relation to longshadow he knows longshadow will destroy him when hes no longer useful well have fun well poke around and make them chase their tails when the dust settles maybe therell be no longshadow no shadowspinner no howler just you and me and an empire of our own or maybe the spirit will move me some other direction i dont know im just having fun with it he shook his head slightly hard to believe but it sounded true her schemes could kill thousands could distress millions and to her it was play ill never understand you she giggled the giggle of a girl with nothing between the ears she was neither young nor emptyheaded i dont understand myself but i gave up trying a long time ago its distracting games from the first she had been involved in tortuous maneuvers and manipulations to no obvious end her great pleasure was to watch a scheme flower and devour its victim her only plot to fail had been the one meant to displace her sister and she had not failed completely then because she had survived somehow she said soon kinas followers will start arriving well have to be somewhere else so lets go down to dejagore and cause some confusion we ought to get there about the time spinner figures hes ready to make an independent move be interesting to see how it goes croaker did not understand but did not ask he was used to her talking in riddles she let him know what she wanted him to know when she was ready to tell him no point pressing her he could do little but bide his time and hope its late she said weve done enough for today lets turn in he grunted not eager the place gave him the creeps when he thought about it which meant every night as he fell asleep which meant at least one potent nightmare he would be glad to get out maybe out there he could vanishif he could think of a way to hide from the crows fifteen minutes after the lamp went out soulcatcher asked are you awake yeah its cold in here uhm it always was most nights he fell asleep shivering why dont you come over here the shivering worsened i dont think so she laughed some other time he fell asleep worrying about how she always got her way instead of about the temple his dreams were more troubling than nightmares once he wakened momentarily the lamp was alive again soulcatcher was murmuring with a clatch of crows the subject seemed to be events in taglios she appeared pleased he drifted off without understanding what it was about chapter twentynine neither potential campsite was perfect one had been fortified before in ancient times for centuries people had carried the stone off for use elsewhere i chose that site nobody remembers the name i told ram as we rode toward town makes you think huh about what the fleeting nature of things taglios entire history could have been influenced by what happened there and now nobody remembers the name he looked at me oddly straining for understanding he wanted to understand but he didnt have the capacity the past was last week the future tomorrow there was no reality in anything that happened before he was born he was not stupid he seemed big and dull and slow but possessed an average intellect he just had not learned to employ it never mind it doesnt matter im just being moody he understood moody he expected it his wife and mother had been moody he did not have time now to think anyway he was too busy staying on his horse we returned to the barracks there was another crowd looking for their loved ones narayan was handling them efficiently they eyed me curiously not at all the way they had looked at croaker him they had hailed liberator everywhere me i was a freak without the sense to know she was not a man i would grow on them just a matter of creating a legend narayan caught up with me there was a messenger from the palace the prince wants you to dine with him tonight someplace called the grove oh that was where i had met him first croaker had taken me the grove was an outdoor place frequented by the rich and influential request or order invitation will you do me the honor of like that did you accept no how could i guess what youd want to do good send a message i accept what time he wasnt specific it would slow me down but i might accomplish something that would save fussing and feuding later at least id learn how much grief i could expect from the state im going to sketch out the camp i want built well send one company plus five hundred recruits to start pick whoever you think we should get out of the city that mess outside hows it going well enough mistress any volunteers showing a few and intelligence have you gotten anything started lot of people want to tell us things mostly about foreigners nothing really interesting keep at it let me do those sketches after that ill make a list to give the prahbrindrah after that ill make myself presentable around here somewhere would be my imperial getup that id worn last time and my coach that we had brought down from the north and had left here when we had marched on ghoja ram before we went south i had several men help me make special armor i need to find them again i went to work sketching and estimating the coach was not as impressive with a fourhorse team but people did gawk i had enough skill to make hooves strike fire and to set a glamor running the coachs exterior the firebreathing skull of the company blazed on both doors the steelrimmed wheels and pounding hooves rumbled thunderously i was satisfied i reached the grove an hour before sunset entered looked around just like last time the cream of taglian society had come out to rubberneck ram and a red rumel man named abda of vehdna background were my bodyguards i did not know abda he was with me because narayan said he was good they had spruced up ram cleaned up nicely when you held a knife to his kidneys bathed hair and beard trimmed in new clothes he cut a handsome figure but abda did not improve much he was a shiftyeyed little villain who looked like a villain no matter what i wished i had brought a gunni bodyguard too to make a symbolic statement you cant think of everything when youre rushed the prahbrindrah rose as i strode up to him he smiled you found me i was concerned i wasnt specific about where wed meet it seemed logical id find you where we met before he eyed ram and abda he had come alone a measure of his confidence in his peoples reverence misplaced confidence maybe make yourself comfortable he invited ive tried to order things i think youll like he glanced at ram and abda again perplexed he did not know what to do about them i said last time i was here somebody tried to kill croaker forget them i trust their discretion i had no idea whether i could trust abda or not didnt seem smart to make a point of it though servitors started with refreshments and appetizers from the state of the grove you could not tell taglios was a nation threatened with extinction you look radiant this evening i dont feel it i feel worn out you should relax more take life easier have the shadowmasters decided to take a holiday he sampled something that looked like shrimp where had shrimp come from here well the sea was not that far away which sparked a germ of an idea i set it aside for later examination the prince swallowed dabbed his lips with a napkin you seem determined to make my life difficult oh you roar ahead like the whirlwind giving no one time to think you rush headlong everyone else has to concentrate on keeping their balance i smiled if i give anyone time to do anything but run along behind me ill be up to my ears in grief none of you seem to understand the magnitude of your enemy you all have your priorities inverted everybody wants to dance around and get the angle on everybody else meantime the shadowmasters are planning to exterminate all of you he nibbled and pretended to think youre right but people are human nobody here has ever had to think in terms of external enemies or really deadly enemies the shadowmasters count on that too no doubt a new course arrived more substantial some kind of bird i was surprised the princes background was gunni the gunni were determined vegetarians watching my surroundings i spied two things i did not like there were dozens of crows among the trees and that priest tal i had embarrassed earlier with several of his cronies was watching us the prahbrindrah said im under a lot of pressure because of you some from close quarters it puts me in a delicate position where was his sister were she and smoke riding him probably i shrugged and ate the prince said it would help if i knew your plans i told him suppose some important people dont approve or dont feel youre the right champion it wouldnt matter theres a contract in force it will be fulfilled and i dont distinguish between enemies foreign or domestic he understood nothing got said during the next course then he blurted did you kill jahamaraj jah yes my gods why his existence offended me he gulped some air he deserted at dejagore that cost us the battle that was reason enough but he also planned to kill your sister and blame me he had a wife if shadar women are foolish enough to kill themselves over men you can tell her to fire her ghat any priests wife who has a husband like jah had better start collecting firewood shell need it he winced youll start a civil war not if everybody behaves and minds his own business you dont understand priests consider everything their business how many men are we talking about a few thousand you ever watch a gardener prune he snips a twig here a branch there and the plant grows stronger ill prune if i have to but theres only you you cant take on i can i will im going to fulfill the contract and so are you what ive heard that you and your sister didnt negotiate in good faith not smart my friend nobody cheats the company he did not respond im not really good at games im not subtle my solutions are forthright and final forthright and final begets forthright and final you kill a jah the other jahs will get the idea their only option is to kill you only if they ignore the option of minding their own business and wheres my risk i have nothing to lose thats the fate planned for me once im used up anyway why cooperate in my own destruction you cant just keep killing people who dont agree with you i wont only people who disagree and try to force their ideas on me here in taglios now theres no legitimate cause for conflict the prince seemed surprised i dont follow taglios must be preserved from the shadowmasters the company contracted to do that wheres the problem we do what we agreed you pay up as agreed we go away that ought to make everyone happy the prince looked at me like he wondered how i could be so naive im starting to think we have no basis for communication this dinner may have been a mistake no its been productive itll keep on being productive if you listen to me im not beating around the bush im telling you how it is and how its going to be without me the shadowmasters will eat you alive you think theyll be impressed by which cult got a leg up on what with a boondoggle wall construction grant i know how those people think if they reach taglios theyll slaughter everybody who could possibly make trouble ever you should understand that you saw what they did elsewhere its impossible to argue with you because you know im right i have a list of things i need right away i have to build an encampment and prepare a training ground immediately this could lead to a quick confrontation the resources would have to come from that absurd wall project the city was toobig to surround effectively the project could not be justified it was a tool for transferring the wealth of the state to a few individuals i said the men and resources devoted to the wall can be more profitably employed he understood i was asking for trouble he grunted i said why dont we just enjoy our meal we tried but it never turned into a festive evening a few courses along with the conversation darting between his younger years and mine i took the offensive again one more thing i want the books smoke hid his eyes got big i want to know why youre afraid of the past he smiled weakly i think you know smoke is sure you do he believes it was the point of your coming give me a clue the year of the skulls i was not entirely surprised i feigned bewilderment year of the skulls whats that he glanced at ram and abda doubt appeared i recalled toying with my rumel while talking to his sister he would not doubt long if you dont know you should find out but im not the best authority talk it over with your friends i have no friends if i dont have the prahbrindrah drah a pity do you have that baffled him again he forced a smile perhaps i dont perhaps i ought to try to make some the smile changed we all need a few sometimes our enemies wont let us find them i should be getting back my number two is inexperienced and handicapped by his place in your caste system a hint of disappointment he had wanted more than a discussion of princes and warlords thank you for the dinner prahbrindrah ill treat you in kind soon ram abda they stepped close ram offered a hand up they had stayed behind me unseen i was pleased that they were alert ram would have been if only because of where we were a man of his station had no hope of visiting the grove ordinarily have a pleasant evening prince i expect to hand you the heads of taglios enemies within the year he wore a sort of sad yearning look as he watched us go i knew what he was feeling i had felt it often while i was empress in the north but i had hidden it better chapter thirty ram waited till he was confident we were out of earshot something is going to happen mistress trouble we were watched by sneaking gunni priests all the time they acted like they were up to no good ah i did not question his estimate he did not have too rich an imagination i snapped fingers at a nearby servitor fetch master gupta master gupta ran the grove a benign dictator he was attentive to his guestsespecially those who were close to the prahbrindrah drah he appeared almost instantly bowing like a coolie he asked what could the great lady want of this lowly worm how about a sword dressed as a woman and empress i had not come heavily armed i had one short dagger his eyes got huge a sword what would i do with a sword mistress i havent the faintest but i want to borrow one if you can provide it eyes even bigger he bowed several times ill see what can be found he scooted off throwing uncertain looks over his shoulder ram help me shed some of this showpiece he was scandalized he refused ram youre pushing for the opportunity to spend your army time digging latrine trenches he took my word for it accepted the disapproval of several dozen watchers as he helped me shed my most cumbersome garments he was embarrassed abda not asked to participate pretended blindness gupta materialized he had a sword it was someones show toy i borrowed this from a gentleman who was gracious enough to permit me to carry it to you he was blind too i expect he had seen everything over the years the grove was a place where lovers managed clever assignations i shall harbor kind thoughts toward you forever gupta am i correct in assuming the staff sent for my coach when they saw me getting ready to leave the men responsible will be seeking employment elsewhere if it isnt there when you arrive lady thank you ill send this toy back shortly ram again waited till he thought no one could hear grunted a question i replied if theres to be trouble itll come just inside the gate if we reach the coach well be safe you have a plan mistress spring the trap if there is one we wipe them out or take them prisoner and carry them off never to be seen again how many might there be ram shrugged he did not waste time looking at me now he had eyes for trouble only abda said eight and the one you embarrassed but hell avoid getting too close he might have to explain if someone saw him oh i was involved in two similar schemes when i was an acolyte i had no idea what he meant it did not seem like the best time to fill myself in on his past we were approaching a brushy area that crowded the path to the exit i say brushy but im no devotee of formal gardening the area consisted of heavy vegetation four to eight feet high every single leaf was tended and considered daily its function was to mask the grove from the world so taglios lords would not be defiled by common eyes i started a spell as soon as we left gupta i was ready when we reached the shrubbery it was another childs plaything but my most ambitious effort yet i spoke the initiator and threw the resulting fireball into the growth to my left by the time the ball went ten feet it was hot enough to melt steel it broke into fragments that broke into smaller fragments someone screamed someone else screamed a man plunged out of the growth pounding his side i got another ball ready threw it the other way wait i said let them come out well push them down the path to the gate there were three men on that path now wildeyed then three more came out like spooked cattle the brush was burning thats long enough lets move we hustled forward the baffled wouldbe assassins retreated they piled up against the closed gate the gatemen stared at the flames stunned unsure what to do ram bang them over the head put them in the coach a guard recognized me did his job by rote as ram waded into the six mistress abda was behind me i turned a man afire was charging us with an upraised tulwar a weapon i had not seen here before it looked like an antique abda ducked darted had his rumel around the mans neck in a blink i did not get to use my borrowed blade the assassins impetus broke his neck that was it ram tossed bodies into the coach i told the least rattled gate guard thank master gupta for the loan i gave him the sword and extend my apologies for the damages the priest chandra chan tal should be happy to make them good ready ram yes mistress abda get that carrion loaded i walked to the coach climbed up beside my driver looked around spotted tal he and two other priests in red were standing streetside eighty feet away bugeyed i saluted them loaded mistress abda called up i got some amusement from him and ram they did not want me up there exposed but did not want me inside with the dead and captive either shall i run along behind like a good taglian woman ram embarrassed he shook his head climb aboard we rolled right past tal and his cronies i called down get what pleasure you can from the hours you have left tal blanched the other two were made of sterner or stupider stuff chapter thirtyone it was a gorgeous day a few clouds above to break up the sky a gentle breeze the air unseasonably cool if you stayed in the shade you could remain sweatfree it was midafternoon work on the camp had begun at dawn four thousand men made progress obvious first we would provide shelter mess halls stables storage i had planned ambitiously for a garrison of ten thousand even narayan was worried that i wanted to grab too much too soon i had spent the morning administering oaths to the soldiers in small groups by cult having them pledge everything in the sacred defense of taglios wormed into the oath was a line about unquestioning obedience to commanders narayans cleverer cronies weeded out the priests and religious fanatics beforehand the dross we isolated in what was supposed to be a special unit there were about three hundred such men they were on the field below the hill being given accelerated training as soon as i found a good one i would send them off on a bold and dramatic mission somewhere far away i sat in the shade of an old tree observing and directing ram hovered i spied narayan approaching i had left him in the city i rose asked well its done the last one was found an hour before i left good tal had been easy but his companions had been hard to trace narayans friends had disposed of them thats good has it caused excitement hard to tell yet though a gunni emissary did show up just before i left oh he wanted to arrange the release of the men from the grove and i told him theyd been released hell figure it out excellent any word on the shadowmasters spies no but people have seen the wrinkled little brown men you mentioned so they must be here theyre here id give a couple of teeth to know what theyre up to anything else not yet except a rumor that the prahbrindrah drah called in the big men in the wall project and told them they have to build you a fortress instead ive located a friend who works in the palace occasionally when their normal resources are taxed our prince doesnt maintain a household in keeping with his station he wont get much if the prince doesnt entertain and probably not much then look into the possibility of arranging for your friend to become employed full time have there been many more volunteers only a few its still too early people want to see how you manage with the powers that be understandable nobody wants to sign on with a loser be interesting to know what they said about me at that meeting a pity i did not command the resources i once had i was not going to get them back loafing ill ride back with you i have things to do i had recalled one thing my husband had done to secure his rule a version here just might make everyone forget politics for a while i would need a suitable theater i had to start looking as we rode i asked narayan do we have many archers i knew we did not but what i lacked he had a knack for finding no mistress archery wasnt a skill much encouraged a hobby for marhans thats all he meant the topdog caste we had a few though find them have them teach the most reliable men you have something in mind a new twist on an old story maybe i may never need them but if i do i want to know theyre there as always we shall endeavor to provide he grinned that grin i wished i could scrub off his face forever to create a body of archers youll need bows and arrows and all the ancillary paraphernalia that would keep his mind occupied i did not feel like talking i did not feel ready to wrestle lions today had not for several days in fact i supposed it was lack of sleep bad dreams and the fact that i had been driving myself to the limit the dreams persisted they were bad but i just shoved them aside in my mind took the unpleasantness and got on with getting on there was just so much i could do in the time available i would deal with the dreams when i finished with more immediate concerns for a while i thought about my onetime husband the dominator and his empirebuilding techniques then about my own plight lack of leaders continued to plague me every day men were handed tasks beyond their training based on my or narayans gut feelings some worked out some folded under the pressure that was heavier now that we meant to digest a horde with no idea what was happening as we neared the city approaching scaffolding where wall construction had started narayan observed mistress its less than a month till the festival of lights he lost me for a moment then i recalled the festival as the big holy day of his cult and remembered him hinting around that i should be there if i wanted the support of the stranglers i had to go convince the other jamadars that i was the daughter of night and could bring on the year of the skulls i had to learn more about the cult to find out what narayan might be hiding there was no time to do everything that had to be done we had gotten our first message from the men watching dejagore last night mogaba was holding out stubborn mogaba i did not look forward to seeing him again sparks would fly he would claim the captaincy too i knew that as sure as i knew the sun rose and set one step at a time one step at a time chapter thirtytwo the meeting with the priests had not gone well the radisha was in a blistering rage her brother looked grim smoke squeaked something has to be done about that woman they were in a shielded room but something had installed itself amongst clutter on a high shelf those below did not notice the one yellow crow eye watching im not so sure the prahbrindrah drah replied we talked extensively i think she was truthful my gut feeling is that we should give her her head gods smoke swore no the radisha remained neutral for the moment we were inches from getting thrown out tonight we couldnt drive a wedge between them the fact that we might be able to point her in their direction was all that saved us we cant get rid of her smoke the prahbrindrah drah said weve got the tiger by the tail cant let go i feel like im in a big bowl and all around the rim are people who want to roll boulders down on me she will devour us smoke said he kept his tone reasonable panicky talk had worked against him before the prahbrindrah drah and radisha had to be convinced intellectually she traffics with stranglers of whom there are maybe only a few hundred in the whole world the radisha observed how many men are there in the shadowlands how many shadows therere more backstabbing priests here in the city than there are stranglers anywhere read those old chronicles again smoke suggested how numerous were the black company when they came here before yet before they were driven out our ancestors very nearly witnessed the year of the skulls you cant traffic with this darkness it wakens the devil in everyone you cant invite the tiger into your house to keep the wolf away there are no greys there is no tightrope to walk no one can hope to play this off against other darknesses this is the deep and ultimate evil beyond all evils consider what the woman did last night the prahbrindrah drah said i was put out by the damage done master gupta and his predecessors worked on that for a century not the damned plants smoke almost lost control a man is dead killed by sorcery seven more were carried off to who knows what fate tal and his cronies were slain in their very temples strangled they asked for it the radisha said they did something stupid they paid for it you notice the other gunni priests werent put out ghapors bunch they probably encouraged tal and didnt mind when he came out on the short end probably dont you see what shes done a year ago no priest would have considered murder now its accepted nobody is distressed tal is gone you say he was stupid and asked for it and youre right but he was one of the most important men in taglios so was jahamaraj jah he asked for it too when she picks off the next one well maybe everybody will say the same thing again he asked for it and the next one and the next and then its you and the prahbrindrah drah and after that the deluge never mind professionalism as a soldier she might be the best that ever was maybe she can ruin the shadowmasters in her sleep but even if they never cross the main again if they never come north of dejagore if they never win another skirmish if shes in charge taglios will lose as certainly as if we hadnt resisted at all the prahbrindrah drah started to speak the radisha jumped in first he has a point taglios wont ever be the same oh if we give the woman a free hand shell make taglios over into the image of the shadowlands because thats what it will take to win smoke i see that even if youre obsessive about the stranglers and the year of the skulls ive watched the woman i doubt if anyone but that man croaker ever had any influence on her brother hes right shell turn us into what we fear in order to save us then were damned if we do and damned if we dont we let her go on were done we dont the shadowmasters eat us smoke said theres another way but he could not tell them he had not told them everything when he had reported the approach by longshadows agents too late now if he brought up overlooked details they would no longer trust him they might even think his opposition to the woman had been ordered by taglios enemies that wrinkled little man had foreseen this damn him well the radisha demanded i had a thought it was impractical emotion guiding the mind forget it kina is stirring the daughter of night walks among us we must silence her the prahbrindrah drah said we can talk about this all night none of us will change our minds wed better concentrate on staying a step ahead of the priests till we do agree smoke shook his head that would not do the woman would keep everyone confused and divided then it would be too late that was the way of darkness deceit endless deceit no point talking anymore there was only one choice left they would hate him if they caught him they would brand him traitor but there was no other answer he had to pray for courage and a clear head the shadowmasters were masters of deceit themselves they would use him if they could but if he played the game carefully he could serve taglios better than any dozen armies he started trying to cut the conversation short as brother and sister were leaving the prince said smoke i meant to ask why would she put a bounty on bats all of a sudden a what the shadar singh mentioned it he heard it on his way here she put out word that any children who wanted could pick up a few coppers by bringing her dead bats every poor family in town will start hunting them and the treasury will have to pay for them why i have no idea smoke lied his heart was in his throat she knew that business about reporting strangers it wasnt a propaganda ploy she knew a few exotic spells use bat parts powdered fur claws livers but theyre the kind that make your neighbors cattle sterile or his hens stop laying nothing of use to her but live bats were useful to the shadowmasters he barely waited till the prince and his sister turned a corner down the hall then he headed for the world outside before there were no bats left to find him chapter thirtythree croaker sat on a rock in the wood leaning against a tree twisting an animal figure he finished it and tossed it at a stump crows watched he paid them no heed he was thinking about soulcatcher she was not great company she had spent ages turned inward she could be amiable and animated for brief periods but did not know how to keep it up neither did he sometimes it seemed they were moving in parallel rather than together but she would not let him go just because they werent soulmates she had uses for him she had been bustling around the temple all day he did not know why he felt no urge to find out he was depressed he came to this spot when his mood was at low ebb the imp frogface materialized why the long face cap why not you got me there whats happening in dejagore got me there too ive been busy doing what cant say the imp aped his morose stance last time i was there your boys was doing fine maybe fussing and feuding a little more than before old oneeye and his sidekick dont get along with that mogaba not even a little they been talking about doing a fade and letting him go to hell his own way hed get wiped out if they did he dont appreciate them enough thats sure she says were going down there well then you can look for yourself i dont think thats what shes got in mind she call you in came to report interesting things happening you could ask she might tell you whats she doing fixing the place up so it dont look like somebodys been living there that festival thing is coming up them weirdos will be getting here real soon croaker doubted he would get a straight answer but he asked anyway hows lady fine keeps on shell be running the whole show in six months got every poobah in taglios so confused shes doing any damned thing she pleases shes in taglios he hadnt known that catcher hadnt told him he hadnt asked has been for weeks left that blade character in charge at ghoja and went up to the city and started taking over she would she isnt the kind to wait for things to happen tell me about it whoa i hear the boss calling better get on over there pack up your things what things he did not have much but the clothes he wore and those were rags whatever you have to take with you shes leaving in an hour he did not argue that was as futile as arguing with a stone his wants and interests did not count he had less freedom than a slave take it easy cap the imp said and vanished they rode till croaker collapsed they rested then rode again soulcatcher ignored such niceties as restricting travel to daylight hours she permitted a third halt only after they entered the hills northwest of dejagore she spoke seldom except to her crows and to frogface briefly after they arrived while croaker was sleeping she wakened him as the sun rose we reenter the world today my love sorry i havent been as attentive as i should he could tell nothing from her choice of voices this one he thought was her own much like her sisters always neutral ive had a lot on my mind i should bring you up to date that would be nice your flair for sarcasm hasnt disappeared it keeps me going maybe this is how things stand last week spinner attacked dejagore in force he was thrown back he would have succeeded if hed used all his skills but he couldnt without longshadow finding out hes not as feeble as he pretends hell try again tonight he could succeed your oneeye and goblin have broken with their commander my beloved sister has obtained a strong position in and around taglios she has five or six thousand men none of them worth a damn she left the man blade at ghoja when she headed north he has the same problems and none of her expertise but some of the men he has have legionary experience hes decided to let them learn the hard way hes begun occupying surrounding territories especially southward along the road to dejagore makes it easier to feed his men probably yes he has a force exceeding three thousand men now his scouts have skirmished with shadowspinners patrols and the big news of course is that the wizard smoke has been seduced by longshadow say what that little bastard i never did trust him longshadow appealed to his idealism and to his fear of my sister and the black company offered him assurances he couldnt help but believe made him think he could become a hero by saving taglios from its supposed saviors while he made peace with the shadowlands that man is a fool i thought you had to be smart to be a wizard smart doesnt mean sensible croaker and he isnt a complete fool he didnt trust longshadow he used every device he could to make longshadow keep his word his real mistake was going to visit longshadow at shadowcatch what the howler and longshadow combined their talents to create a flying carpet like those we had back when before they were destroyed its a puny one but good enough for howler to fly the wizard to shadowcatch and to drop spies into taglios smoke is down there now frogface is watching him longshadow is trying to do a poor mans taking of smoke hell go back to taglios as longshadows creature croaker did not like the sums he came up with three major wizards against taglios now and taglios only magical defender was a creature of the enemy lady might be doing well but could not be doing as well as she must to manage both the shadowmasters and her enemies behind her doom would be stalking taglios long before anyone expected it khatovar was farther away than ever he could not manage that mission on his own taking the annals back he did not have them they were trapped inside dejagore he could not get to them was murgen keeping them up hed better be you havent said anything about our part in all this but i have often were just going to have fun with it were going to kick the props out from under people tonight well have this whole end of the world wondering whats going on and whos doing what to who he began to understand soon after she told him to start getting ready ready how get your armor on its time to scare the shit out of spinners men and save dejagore he just stood there puzzled she asked would you rather let them be wiped out no the annals were in the city they had to be preserved he unpacked the armor they had lugged all the way from the temple i cant get this on by myself i know youll have to help me with mine too with hers he had assumed she would use her old soulcatcher guise he began to see her subtlety the armor she had made at the temple was a copy of ladys lifetaker rig their appearance would leave all the principals completely confused his widowmaker was supposed to be dead ladys lifetaker was supposed to be in taglios neither was supposed to amount to anything in sorcerous terms the besieged would be stunned spinners men would be dismayed longshadow might suspect the truth but would not be sure smoke and the taglian prince and his sister would be baffled even lady would be confused he was sure she believed him dead damn you he said as he settled her helmet over her head damn you to hell he could not refuse to cooperate dejagore would fall and its defenders would be massacred if he and she did not intercede relax my love relax put emotion aside have fun with it look the lance she pointed it was the lance that had carried the company standard for centuries he had searched in vain for it at the temple he had not seen it coming down now it stood beyond the fire they had lighted for illumination it glowed gently a banner hung from it but he could not make it out how did you to hell with her sorcery he would play her game only as far as he had to he would give her no pleasure get it croaker mount up its time shed even conjured the armor that went with the stallions baroque and beginning to show highlights of witchfire he did as he was told and was startled her armor had a subtly different look from that which lady had created for her lifetaker character this was more intimidating it radiated menace it had the feel of an archetypal doom two huge black crows settled on his shoulders their eyes burned red more crows circled catcher frogface materialized on the neck of her horse chattered briefly vanished come we should arrive just in time to save the day the voice she used was that of a happy kid contemplating a prank chapter thirtyfour mather stuck his head into the room hes on his way willow swan grunted opened shutters for more light he looked out at blades camp and its satellites the gods themselves were on blades team recruits had een arriving in droves none of them wanted to enlist in the radishas guard hed had high hopes when he had invented that but the radishas name carried less weight here than blades and damn him he was as stubborn about sticking with lady as cordy was about the radisha cordy cordy why the hell dont we just go home he muttered to himself blade came in escorted by mather that human stump sindu was right behind them he was like blades shadow anymore swan did not like the man he was creepy blade said cordy says you have something yeah we finally got one up on you he had begun fielding patrols of his own after blade started expanding southward our boys grabbed some prisoners i know of course he did there was no hiding from each other here they did not try they remained friends however much they disagreed blade did most of his planning in that room on the map table there anything swan wanted to know he could see right there there was a big dustup at dejagore the other night shadowspinner hit the burg with everything he had he grabbed our friends by the short hairs then what should pop up but two giant firebreathing riders in black armor flinging thunderbolts around and kicking ass wholesale when the smoke cleared away it was the shadowlanders that got whupped one of the prisoners saw it with his own eyes he said shadowspinner had to yank everything out of his trick bag to hold those two off heres the way they say it went down swan kept a close eye on blade while he chattered there was some emotion showing through that bland facade he finished his tale what you think old buddy those two miracle visitors sound like anybody we know lady and croaker in their costume armor bingo but hes dead and shes in taglios two in a row give the man a prize i think so what the hell really went down sindhu what you grinning about man kina the others looked hard at the broad man mather said descriptions again willow swan repeated mather said kina the way shes described by people who know her not her sindhu said kina sleeps the daughter is bound in flesh sindhus association with the deceivers was an open secret but he was not much help usually it was like this he would say one thing then contradict himself swan said im not going to try to figure that out buddy somebody fits the description went in and tore them new buttholes down there kina or notkina i dont care somebody wanted people to think kina right sindhu nodded so who was that with her that fit anywhere sindhu shook his head this confuses me mather hoisted himself to a seat in the window swan shuddered cordy had a fortyfoot drop behind him he said be quiet let me think swan echoed quiet let him cordy was a genius when he took the trouble they waited swan paced blade studied the map he let no time waste sindhu remained impassive and still yet seemed shaken mather said theres another force in the field say what swan chirped only way it adds up willow the shadowmasters are out to get each other but they wouldnt go that far helps us too much our side doesnt have anybody who could pull off the sorcery angle so somebody else did it what the hell for to confuse things they did that why i couldnt guess then who i dont know just like everyone else wont know and will be chasing their tails trying to figure it out was blade listening didnt seem like it he asked how bad were the shadowlanders hurt huh shadowspinners armies how bad off are they bad enough they cant take a crack at dejagore again till they get replacements but not so bad our guys have a crack at breaking out just enough interference to keep the balance then our guys got cut up bad way the prisoners talked as many as half of them killed meaning the shadowmasters men really got mauled but they could still send out patrols for you to catch shadowspinner is scared well move on him he doesnt want any more surprises blade paced he returned to the map tapped out the garrisons and posts he had established as much as a hundred fifty miles south he paced he asked mather is it true or is it something they want us to believe bait for a trap swan said the prisoners believed it blade said sindhu why havent we heard from hakim why did this news reach us this way i dont know find out go talk to your friends right now if this is true we should have known before their patrol got here with the prisoners sindhu departed disturbed swan said now you got rid of him whats on your mind is the story true thats whats on my mind sindhu has people babysitting dejagore they shouldve had a messenger moving the minute the dustup started another shouldve brought a complete report when it was over one might not have gotten through but two wouldnt have failed we made that road safe we enlisted most of the bandits and feistier peasants you think the prisoners are plants blade paced i dont know if they are why on you mather cordy thought if theyre a plant we shouldnt have been the captors unless their purpose is to cause confusion or they dont know the difference it could be theyre telling the truth but were not supposed to believe it because you havent heard from your scouts it could be a device to buy time illusion swan said you remember what croaker used to say that his favorite weapon was illusion thats not quite what he said willow mather corrected but close enough somebody wants us to see something that isnt there or to ignore something that is blade said im moving swan squawked what do you mean moving im heading down there hey man what are you crazy youre getting a little carried away chasing that tail blade walked out willow spun on mather what do we do cordy mather shook his head i dont know about friend blade anymore hes looking to get killed maybe we shouldnt have taken him away from those crocs yeah maybe but what do we do now send a message north then go with him but were in charge we can do whatever we want mather hustled out theyre both crazy swan muttered he looked at the map a minute went to the window watched the excitement in blades camp eyed the ford and the swarming engineers setting wooden pylons for ladys temporary bridge everybodys gone crazy he laid a finger between his lips and wiggled it furiously while saying why the hell should i be any different chapter thirtyfive thats it i said ive had it id just gotten word that a vehdna priest iman ul habn adr had ordered vehdna construction workers to abandon my camp and report for work on that absurd city wall it was the second defection of the day the gunni contingent had walked an hour after starting time the shadar wont show tomorrow theyve finally decided to test me narayan assemble the archers ram send those messages i had the scribes prepare narayans eyes got big he could not get himself moving he did not believe i would do it mistress move they went i prowled trying to walk off my anger i had no reason to be mad this was no surprise the cults had given me no grief since i had taken care of tal that meant they were working things out between them before they tested me again i took advantage of the respite recruiting two hundred men a day i got the camp established in temporary form the stonework of the fortress meant to replace it was well started id gotten some of the men through the first stages of their training i had cajoled or extorted weapons and animals and money and materials from the prahbrindrah drah in that area i had more than i needed i had stretched my talent considerably i was still no threat even to smoke but my progress excited me the big negatives were the dreams and an incessant mild nausea i could not shake it might be the water at the campsite though it persisted when i returned to the city probably it was mostly reaction to lack of sleep i refused to yield to the dreams i refused to pay attention i made them something to be suffered through like boils someday i would have the chance to do something about them then balances would be redressed i watched my messengers trot toward town too late to back down now succeed or fail i would get their attention ram helped me don my armor a hundred men watched the barracks remained as overcrowded as ever though i had moved five thousand men to the campsite more volunteers than i know what to do with ram he grunted lift your arm mistress i raised both and spied narayan pushing through the press he looked like he had seen a ghost what is it the prahbrindrah drah is here by himself he wants to see you he tried to whisper but men heard word spread quiet all of you here where i told abda to bring him around the long way that was thoughtful narayan keep working ram narayan fled before abda brought the prince i started in on the appropriate public courtesies he said forget that can you clear this out some id like a little privacy fire drill something you men outside abda see to it the crowd started moving reluctantly the prince eyed ram i said ram stays i cant get dressed without him surprised to see me yes good its time somebody surprised you i just looked at him he demanded whats all this bull about you quitting quitting what resigning going away leaving us to the shadowmasters that had been the implication but not the substance of the messages id had delivered i dont know what you mean im going to make a speech to some priests just to straighten them out where did you get the idea i was deserting thats the talk theyre all excited they think theyve beaten you that they just stood up to you stopped letting you walk over them and youre going to say goodbye exactly what i wanted them to think what they wanted to think then theyre going to be disappointed he smiled ive had nothing but trouble from them all my life ive got to see this i wouldnt recommend it why not i could not tell him trust me if youre there youll regret it i doubt it they couldnt give me much more trouble than they have already i want to see them when you disappoint them you do youll never forget dont go i insist i warned you him being there would not do him any good but it would be good for me i told myself id done my best my conscience was clear ram finished dressing me i told him i need narayan abda would you look after the prince if youll excuse me i got narayan into a corner where we could whisper i told him what had happened he grinned that damned grin of his till i was ready to rip it off his face but he jumped to another subject the festival is almost upon us mistress we have to make travel plans soon i know the jamadars want to look me over but i have too much on my mind now lets get through tonight first of course mistress of course i didnt mean to press the hell you didnt is everything set yes mistress since early this afternoon will they do it when it comes to the moment of decision will they you never know what a man will do till hes faced with a decision mistress but the men are all former slaves very few of them taglian excellent go well be leaving in a few minutes the square was called aiku rukhadi khadi junction it had been a crossroads long ago before the city swamped the countryside it was shadar then but vehdna now it was not a big square being a hundred twenty feet in its greatest dimension it had a public fountain in its center water for the neighborhood it was crowded with priests the cult leaders had come and had brought all the friends they wanted to witness the humiliation of the female upstart they had dressed for the occasion the shadar wore white simple shirts and pantaloons the vehdna wore kaftans and glamorous turbans the most numerous contingent the gunni crowd was subdivided by sect some wore scarlet robes some saffron some indigo some aquamarine jahamaraj jahs successors wore black i guessed the crowd at between eight hundred and a thousand the square was packed every priest whos anybody is here the prince told me we entered the square behind a half dozen incompetent drummers they were my only bodyguards even ram was absent the drummers cleared a space against a wall i told the prince thats the way i wanted it i hoped i looked sufficiently impressive in costume atop my great black stallion i loomed over the prahbrindrah whose chestnut was no dwarf the priests noticed him and started whispering eight hundred men whispering make as much noise as a swarm of locusts i positioned us with the wall behind and the drummers in front would it work it had wonderfully for my husband so long ago soul lords of taglios silence fell i had that spell right my voice carried well thank you for coming taglios faces a severe test the shadowmasters are a threat that cannot be exaggerated the tales out of the shadowlands are ghosts of the truth this city and nation has one hope turn a single face toward the enemy in faction lies defeat they listened i was pleased in faction defeat some of you feel im not the champion for taglios cause more of you have been seduced by lust for power by factionalism rather than let that worsen and distract taglios from its grand mission ive decided to eliminate the cause of factionalism taglios will present one face after tonight i donned my helmet while they were waiting for me to announce my abdication i set the witchfires free they began to suspect then someone shouted kina i drew my sword the arrows began to fall while i was talking narayans picked men had placed barricades in the narrow streets entering the square when i drew my sword soldiers inside the surrounding houses let fly priests screamed they tried to flee they found the barricades too high they tried to turn on me my talent was enough to hold them off beyond my terrified drummers the arrows continued to fall they surged this way and that they fell they begged for mercy the arrowfall continued till i lowered my sword i dismounted the prahbrindrah drah looked down face bloodless he tried to say something could not speak i warned you narayan and his friends joined me i asked did you send for the wagons it would take dozens to haul the bodies to an unhallowed mass grave he nodded no more able to speak than the prince i told him this is nothing narayan ive done lots worse ill do worse again check them out see if anybody important is missing i walked across the killing ground to tell the bowmen they could release the people who lived in the houses the prahbrindrah never moved he just sat there and stared painfully aware that his presence made it seem he approved ram found me there mistress he gasped he had run all the way from the barracks what are you doing here there is a messenger from ghoja from blade he rode night and day come immediately he was not affected by the mass of bodies he might have been watching the neighborhood women at the well instead of narayans cronies finishing the wounded i went i spoke with the messenger for a minute i was furious with blade then i saw the silver lining blades actions gave me an excuse to move the troops out before they got wind of what had happened here tonight chapter thirtysix the prahbrindrah drah sat there an hour staring at his bedchamber wall he would not respond to his sisters questions she was shaken what had happened he looked at her at last did she go through with it did you hope she wouldnt i told you not to go she didnt resign no she didnt he laughed squeakily not by a long shot his tone was spooky what happened she resolved our problems with the priests not permanently but itll be a long time before his voice trailed off im as guilty as she is what happened dammit tell me she killed them every last one of them she lured them there by making them think they were going to humiliate her she had archers cut them down a thousand priests and i was there i watched her walk among them afterward cutting the throats of the wounded for a moment the radisha thought it was some grisly joke that was impossible he said she made her point did she ever make her point smoke was right the radisha began pacing lending only half an ear to his selfflagellation it was grotesque it was an atrocity surpassing comprehension things like that did not happen in taglios they couldnt but what an opportunity the religious hierarchies would be in disarray for years atrocity or not this was a chance to achieve all they had worked for it could mean the return of the primacy of the state he heard a sound she whirled startled gawked the woman was there having penetrated the palace who knew how she still wore her bizarre armor covered with blood hes told you yes the shadowmasters attacked dejagore they were repelled with heavy losses blade is moving south to relieve the city before they gather reinforcements im going to join him i have no one to leave here to continue my work you two will have to handle it send the construction crews back to the fortress continue enrolling volunteers theres a slim chance we may get past the worst in the coming few weeks leaving no one but longshadow to deal with but its more likely well face a prolonged struggle that will require every man and resource available the radisha could not speak the woman had the blood of a thousand priests on her hands how could you argue with someone like that ive handed you an opportunity you always wanted grab it the radisha willed herself to speak still nothing came out never had she been so terrified the woman said i have no ambitions here you have no need to fear meso long as you dont interfere with me i will destroy the shadowmasters i will fulfill the companys undertaking and i will collect its reward the radisha nodded as though a hand had grabbed her hair and forced her to move her head the woman said ill come back after ive seen whats happening at dejagore she moved to the prahbrindrah rested a hand on his shoulder dont take it on yourself they wrote their own destinies youre a prince a prince must be stern be stern now dont let chaos claim taglios ill leave you a small garrison their reputation should be enough to enforce your will she strode out the radisha and her brother stared at one another what have we done he asked too late to cry about it lets do what we can with it wheres smoke i dont know i havent seen him for days was he right is she really the daughter of night i dont know i just dont know but were on the tigers back now we cant let go chapter thirtyseven i moved out before dawn i took every man i could round upexcept those who had helped despatch the priests those i left as a garrison with orders to remain in the city a week then to move to the remote vehdnabota ford across the main i did not want them talking to the other men who did not yet know about the massacre there were six thousand men in the force they were scarcely more than an armed rabble they were enthusiastic though they wanted to relieve dejagore i tried to teach them on the march narayan did not like the move he brooded he came to me late the third day of the march we were twenty miles from ghoja mistress youve finally decided to talk about it he pretended not to be surprised he tried to accept everything about me on the surface did he regret his snap decision that i was his strangler messiah i am sure he wanted more control he did not want his daughter of night to be independent of his own ambitions and wishful thinking yes mistress tomorrow is etsataya first day of the festival were only a few miles from the holy grove it is important that you present yourself to the jamadars i guided him out of the human stream i havent been trying to duck it ive been preoccupied you said the first day i thought this was a oneday holy festival its three days mistress the middle day is the actual high holy day i cant afford a threeday delay narayan i know mistress funny how the honorifics showed up so much more often when he wanted something but we do have men capable of keeping the mob moving all they have to do is follow the road with your horses we can overtake them quickly i masked my feelings this was something i had to do but not something i wanted to do narayans cult had not been much use yet but narayan himself was a valuable aide i had to keep him happy all right get this mob pointed in the right direction and going on its own momentum ill want ram and my gear yes mistress we left the column half an hour later it was dark when we reached the stranglers holy grove i did not see much of it but i felt it seldom had i encountered a place with a darker aura some of narayans brotherhood were there already we joined them they watched me sidelong afraid to look at me directly there was nothing to do i went to sleep early the dreams were worse than ever before unrelenting continuous i did not escape till the sun rose probed through the mist and dark trees ten thousand crows bickered and squawked overhead narayan and his cronies thought that a hugely favorable omen the crow was kinas favorite bird her messenger and spy was there a connection with the crows that had followed the company so long according to croaker they had picked us up before we had crossed the sea of torments the sea lies seven thousand miles north of the grove as soon as i wakened i was sick i vomited as i tried to sit up men bustled around solicitous unable to do anything helpful narayan looked scared to death he had a lot invested in me he would be a nothing if he lost me now mistress mistress whats the matter im puking my guts up i snarled get me something there was nothing anyone could do the worst passed after that it was just nausea that worsened drastically if i moved suddenly i passed on breakfast after an hour i was able to get up and around without too much discomfortif i took it slowly being sick was new to me i had not been ever before i did not like it there were a hundred men in the grove already maybe more they all came for a glimpse at their ragged messiah i dont think they were impressed i would not have been in their shoes nobody could measure up to an anticipation of millennia ragged as i was i had to be a double dose of disappointment narayan did a fair job of arguing his case they did not cut my throat they were a mixed bag all religions all castes and as many of them foreigners as taglians all sinister in that grove it reeked of darkness and old blood nobody seemed festive they seemed to be waiting for something to happen i isolated narayan and asked nothing much happens before nightfall he said most of the men will arrive today those who are here already will make preparation there will be a ceremony tonight to open the festival and let kina know that tomorrow is her day the ceremonies tomorrow are meant to invoke her candidates will be presented to her to accept or reject after the ceremonies the feast will begin all during festival the priests will judge petitions presented there arent many this year an old dispute between the ineld and twana bands is up for judgment though that will attract a lot of attention i frowned bands sometimes come into conflict the ineld band is of vehdna stock the twana of shadar each accuses the other of heresy and poaching its an old dispute that grew much worse after the shadowmasters invaded in parts of their territories the bands are the only law which makes for bigger stakes it was a long story not pretty too human serving to illustrate that the deceivers were more than a lot of deadly fanatics in some areas they ruled the underworld the bands in question hailed from populous hatchpur state where the deceivers were relatively strong their true feud was a contest of criminal gangs over territories anyway narayan said iluk of the ineld band stunned everyone by insisting the conflict be handed to the justice of kina the way he said it was ominous kinas must be a very final justice thats unusual everyone thinks its a bluff iluk expects kowran jamadar of the twana band to refuse that would leave the judgment to the priests who would take his refusal into account and if he doesnt back down theres no appeal from the judgment of kina i thought so are you feeling better some im still nauseous but ive got it under control can you eat you should a little rice maybe nothing heavily spiced they liked their spices in taglios cooking odors could be overwhelming in the city he handed me over to ram ram hovered i kept my composure well i did while i nibbled letting each bite settle narayan brought a parade of priests and jamadars for formal introduction i memorized names and faces carefully i noted that few of the jamadars boasted the black rumel i met only four men who did i mentioned that to ram very few are honored mistress and jamadar narayan is foremost among those hes a living legend no other man would have dared bring you here was he warning me maybe i had best watch myself there could be politics here too some band captains might resist me simply because i was associated with narayan narayan the living legend how had our paths come to cross im no believer in fate or gods in the accepted senses but there are powers that move the world that i know well once i was one the sender of my dreams arranged it no doubt she or it had been interested in me long before i became aware of that interest could it have been she who had struck croaker down to rid me of an inconvenient emotional entanglement maybe maybe when the shadowmasters fell i might turn to another target the anger rose in me i controlled it and rode it let ram finish feeding me went exploring the grove i went to its heart and examined the temple for the first time it barely passed muster it was so buried in creepers it was barely recognizable nobody challenged my presence outside i did not press my luck by climbing the steps instead i rambled around i found a man willing to get narayan for me i did not want to enter the holy place uninvited he came out looking irritated take a walk with me i have a few questions first will anyone get upset if i go inside he thought i dont think so anybody saying i cant be what you claim do you have the kind of enemies who will oppose you on everything no but there are doubts im sure i dont look the part he shrugged id led him to the area where i wanted him i suggested youd need a fair hand at woodcraft to survive your summer travels wouldnt you yes look around he did he came back perplexed someone kept horses here anyone else come on horseback a few highcaste deceivers from afar yesterday and today thats not fresh is there a regular guard no one comes here but us no one dares somebody did and it looks like they stayed awhile thats a lot of manure for a casual visit i have to tell the others this will mean purification rites if the temple was profaned as we ascended the steps to the temple he said you noticing will be a point in your favor no one else did you dont see what you dont expect to see the temple was poorly lighted inside just as well it was ugly in there the architects had dreamed some of my dreams then had recreated them in stone narayan collected several jamadars told them what i had found they fussed and cussed and grumbled spread out to see if the infidels had defiled their temple i wandered they found where the invaders had done their cooking the place had been cleaned but smoke stains are hard to erase the stains suggested that someone had camped there for a long time narayan sidled up gave me his grin now would be a good time to impress them mistress like how by using your talent to find out something about whoever was here sure just like that ive maybe got enough skill to find their latrine and garbage pit he eyed me wondering how i could know they had had one then reasoned it out there was no garbage or human waste around that could tell us a lot one of the jamadars told us that now they were looking they had found plenty of evidence of an extended occupation one man and one woman the woman slept near the fire the man stayed near the altar they dont appear to have bothered that mistress would you look an honor i did not immediately understand how they knew a woman had slept near the fire then one produced a few strands of long black hair can you tell anything from this mistress yes she didnt have naturally curly hair if it was a she some gunni men let their hair grow long shadar and vehdna tended toward curls vehdna men wore their hair short but everyone at this end of the earth had black hair or very dark brown when it was clean swan was a real curiosity with his golden locks my sarcasm did not escape my companions i said dont expect me to see the past or future yet kina comes to me only in dreams that even startled narayan lets see the other place they showed me where the man had slept again they had determined sex by length of hair they had found one strand three inches long fine a medium brown hang onto those hairs narayan they could be useful someday deceivers scurried around seeking more signs narayan suggested lets find that pit we went out we wandered i located the place some lowlife candidates to the cult got to open it i wandered while i waited mistress i just found this a jamadar offered me a small animal figure someone had made by bending and braiding and twisting strands of grass the kind of timekilling thing people do when they have nothing to do but the man looked disturbed its just something somebody did for the hell of it it has no power but if there are more around id like to see them they might tell us something about whoever made them less than a minute passed before another turned up it was hanging from a twig mistress i guess its supposed to be a monkey i had a brainstorm dont move anything i want to see them right where they are over the next few hours we found scores of those things some made of grass some twisted from strips of bark someone had had a lot of time and nothing to do i knew a man once who did that with paper and never realized he was doing it most of those things were stick figures monkeys hanging from twigs fourlegged beasts that could have been anything but a few of the fourleggers carried riders the riders always carried twig swords or spears i must have made a noise narayan said mistress i whispered theres something important about those things but ill be damned if i understand what someone found a whole mob of figures where someone had sat on a rock leaning against a tree making them and maybe daydreaming it was a little clearing about ten feet across a stump stood in the middle i knew i was onto something the instant i arrived but what whatever it stayed way down below consciousness i told narayan if theres anything to be earned its here i whispered again get everybody back to what theyre supposed to be doing i perched on the rock i pulled some grass and started twisting a figure the men went away i let my mind drift into the twilight state wonder of wonders dreams did not intrude minutes passed more and more crows dropped into the trees my interest must have been too obvious were they watching to see if i found out something like maybe something about those who had been staying here ah the birds had more to do with them than with the deceivers they were not omensin the sense the stranglers hoped they were messengers and spies crows everywhere and always crows seldom behaving the way crows should tools their sudden interest suggested they feared i would learn something i ought not which meant there was something my mind leaped from stone to stone across a brook of ignorance if i did discover something i had best not be obvious realization the clearing felt familiar because it recalled a place i had lived if that stump represented the tower whence i had ruled my empire then the scatter of stones might represent the badlands i had created so the tower could be approached along just one narrow deadly path patterns emerged they were almost imperceptible as though put there by someone who knew he was watched someone surrounded by crows if i let my imagination loose that scatter of rocks debris and twisted figures did make a fair representation of the towers surroundings in fact a couple of sticks and a scatter and a boot scuff and a little soil pushed into a mound described a situation that had existed only once in the history of the tower i had trouble pretending calm and indolence if the rocks and twigs and such were significant so must be the creatures of grass and bark i stood up for a better view one thing jumped right out a leaf lay at the foot of the stump a tiny figure sat upon it a lot of care had gone into creating that figure more than enough to make the message clear the howler my then master of the flying carpet was supposed to have been killed by a fall from the heights of the tower i had known that was not true for some time now the message had to be that the howler was somehow involved in current events whoever set this up knew me and expected me to visit the grove that should mean that someone knew what i was doing that someone must have access to what the crows reported but was not their master else there was no reason for such an elaborate and iffy means of passing a message there was more many great sorcerers had been involved in the battle where the howler was supposed to have died most of them were supposed to have been killed since then i have discovered that several had fled after faking their deaths i checked the figures again some were identifiable as representing some of those sorcerers three had been crushed underfoot those known to have been destroyed i gave it all the time it needed and still nearly missed the critical message it was almost dark when i spied the clever little figure carrying what appeared to be a head under its arm it took a while after that to understand the significance of the figure i had told narayan that we do not see what we do not expect to see a lot of things fell into place once i realized that the impossible was not impossible at all my sister was alive i saw a whole new picture of what was going on and i was frightened and frightened i missed the most important message of all chapter thirtyeight narayan was not in a pleasant mood the whole temple has to be purified everything has been defiled at least they committed no willful sacrilege no desecration the idol and relics remain undisturbed i had no idea what he was talking about all the men had long faces i looked at narayan over our cookfire he took my look for a question any unbeliever who found the holy relics or the idol would have plundered them maybe they were afraid of the curse his eyes got big he glanced around made a gesture urging silence he whispered how did you know that these things always have curses part of their rustic charm pardon my sarcasm i did not feel good i did not want to spend any more time hanging around the grove it was not a pleasant place a lot of people had died there none of them of old age the earth was rich with their blood and bones and screams it had a smell psychic and physical probably pleasing to kina how much longer narayan im trying to cooperate but im not going to hang around here the rest of my life oh mistress there will be no festival now the purification will take weeks the priests are distraught the ceremonies have been moved to nadam its only a minor holiday usually when the bands break up for the off season and the priests remind them to invoke the daughter of night in their prayers the priests always say the reason she hasnt come yet is we havent prayed hard enough was he going to dole it out in driblets forever i guess no one of any religion would have spent much time explaining holidays and saints and such though why are we still here then why arent we headed south we came for more than the festival we had indeed but how was i supposed to convince these men i was their messiah narayan kept the specifications to himself how could the actress act without being told her role there was the trouble narayan believed i was the daughter of night he wanted me to be which meant that he would not coach me if i asked he expected me to know instinctively and i did not have a clue the jamadars seemed disappointed and narayan nervous i was not living up to expectations and hopes even if i had discovered that their temple had been profaned in a whisper i asked am i expected to do holy deeds in a place no longer holy i dont know mistress we have no guideposts its all in the hands of kina she will send an omen omens wonderful i had had no chance to bone up on omens the cult considered significant crows were important of course those men thought it wonderful that taglian territory was infested by carrion birds they thought that presaged the year of the skulls but what else was significant are comets important to you i asked in the north last year and once earlier there were great comets did you see them down here no comets are bad omens they were for me they have been called sword of sheda or tongue of sheda shedalinca that shed the light of sheda upon the world sheda was an archaic form of the name of the chief gunni god one of whose titles was lord of lords of light i suspected the deceiver cults beliefs had taken a left turn off the trunk of gunni beliefs a few thousand years ago he said the priests say kina is weakest when a comet is in the sky for then light rules heaven day and night but the moon the moon is the light of darkness the moon belongs to shadow put up so shadows creatures may hunt he rambled off into incomprehensibility local religion had its light and dark right and left good and evil but kina despite her trappings of darkness was supposed to be outside and beyond that eternal struggle enemy of both light and shadow ally of each in some circumstances just to confuse me maybe nobody seemed to know how things really lay in the eyes of their gods vehdna shadar and gunni all respected one anothers gods within the majority gunni cult the various deities whether identified with light or shadow got equal deference they all had their temples and cults and priests some like jahamaraj jahs shadar khadi cult were tainted by the doctrines of kina as narayan clarified by making the waters murkier he got shiftyeyed then would not look at me at all he fixed his gaze on the cookfire talked grew morose he was good at hiding it no one else noticed but i had had more practice reading people i noted tension in some of the jamadars too something was about to happen a test with this crowd that was not likely to be gentle my fingers drifted to the yellow triangle at my belt i had not practiced much lately there had been little time i realized what i had done wondered why that was hardly the weapon to get me out of trouble there was danger i felt it now the jamadars were nervous and excited i let my psychic sense sharpen despite the aura of the grove it was like taking a deep breath in a hot room where a corpse had been rotting for a week i persevered if i could take the dreams without bending i could take this i asked narayan a question that sent him off on another ramble i concentrated on form and pattern in my psychic surroundings i spotted it i was ready when it happened he was a black rumel man a jamadar with a reputation nearly rivalling narayans moma sharrael vehdna when wed been introduced id had the feeling he was a man who killed for himself not for his goddess his rumel moved like black lightning i grabbed the weighted end on the fly i took it away before he recovered his balance snapped it around his neck it seemed id played this game always or as though another hand guided my own i did cheat a little using a silent spell to strike at his heart i wasted no mercy i sensed that that would be an error as deadly as not reacting at all i would have had no chance had i not sensed the wrongness gathering around me no one cried out no one said a word they were shaken even narayan nobody looked at me for no reason apparent at the moment i said mother is not pleased that got me a few startled looks i folded momas rumel as narayan had taught me discarded my yellow cloth and took the black no one argued with my selfpromotion how to reach these men without hearts they were impressed now but not indelibly not permanently ram ram came out of the darkness he did not speak for fear of betraying his feelings i think he might have stepped in if momas attack had succeeded though that would have been the end of him i gave him instructions he got a rope and looped one end around the dead mans left ankle tossed the rope over a branch hauled the corpse up so it hung head down over the fire excellent ram excellent everyone gather round they came reluctantly as the summons spread once they were all there i cut momas jugular the blood did not come fast but it came a small spell made each drop flash when it reached the fire i seized narayans right arm forced him to put his hand out and let a few drops fall on his palm then i turned him loose all of you i said kinas followers do not like spilled blood there is a complex and irrational explanation having to do with the legend of the devoured demons narayan told me later it has a bearing only because it made the evening more memorable for those men once they had the blood of their fellow on their hands they did not look at me while they endured my little ceremony i used the opportunity to hazard a spell that to my surprise came off without a hitch it turned the stains on their hands as indelible as tattoos unless i took it back they would go through life with one hand marked scarlet the jamadars and priests were mine like it or not they were branded the world would not forgive them that brand if its meaning became known men with red palms would not be able to deny that they had been present at the debut of the daughter of night nowhere did i see any doubts now that i was what narayan claimed the dreams were powerful that night but not grim i floated in the warmth of the approval of that other who wanted to make me her creature ram wakened me before there was light enough to see he and narayan and i rode out before the sun rose narayan did not speak all day he remained in shock his dreams were coming true he did not know if that was what he wanted anymore he was scared so was i chapter thirtynine longshadow had fallen into a permanent rage the wizard smoke a trivial little nothing was stubborn he was determined not to be enslaved he might die first a howl echoed through overlook the shadowmaster glanced up imagined mockery in the cry that bastard howler he had pulled a fast one somehow no one else could have freed shadowspinner treachery always treachery he would pay how he would pay his agony would go on for years later there was damage to be undone there was that damnable little wizard to be broken what had happened at stormgard the obvious assumption was that the lifetaker character had been her dorotea senjak had been in taglios of that there was no doubt but she did not have the powers to battle shadowspinner to a draw while ensuring the defeat of his armies who had that been with her bearing the lance the real power a flicker of fear he dropped his work climbed to his crystal chamber looked out on the plain of glittering stone forces were moving not even he could grasp them all maybe that had not been her maybe she was gone the tamed shadows had seen no sign of her for some time maybe she had gone north again after taking her revenge shed always wanted to rule her sisters empire was there an unknown player in the game were lifetaker and widowmaker more than phantoms conjured by senjak the shadows thought some power was guiding her suppose lifetaker and widowmaker were real beings suppose they had put the notion into her head to create imitations so everyone would believe them unreal actors till it was too late grim presentiments grim questions and no answers sunlight danced among the pillars on the plain the howler wailed the wizards groans echoed through the fortress it was closing in he had to capture senjak she was the keystone her head held the keys to power she knew the names she knew the truths she contained secrets that could be hammered into weapons capable of stemming even that dark tide waiting to break out of the plain but first the wizard before all else smoke smoke would give him taglios and maybe senjak he returned to the room where the little man battled his terror and pain there will be an end to this foolish resistance now i have lost patience now i will find what you fear and feed you to it chapter forty blades army moved in twentymile stages he scouted heavily used his cavalry exhaustively sindhus men who had hurried ahead to discover what had become of the deceivers watching dejagore reported finding no sign of those men blade took the news to mather what do you think mather shook his head probably killed or captured swan and mather had their own scouts out farther south swan said word we have is the shadowlanders really did get whipped bad our guys got past their pickets and checked their camp theres only twothirds as many of them as there should be half of those are dinged up that character mogaba keeps hitting them with sorties too they never get to relax are they watching us do they know were coming mather said you have to assume they do shadowspinner is a sorcerer they dont call him a shadowmaster for nothing and theres the bats croaker thought they controlled the bats there have been plenty of those around lately then we should be very careful how many effectives can they field if they decide to meet us listen to this guy cordy swan said hes starting to sound like a pro effectives my oh my shes going to turn him into a real asskicking warlord blade chuckled too many of them if you ask me swan continued if they sneak them away without mogaba noticing they probably could put eight or ten thousand veterans in our way with the shadowmaster mather said i doubt he would leave that would be an invitation to disaster then the thing to do is advance cautiously scout thoroughly try to know as much about them as they know about us right mather chuckled thats what the book would say we have one factor in our favor their scouts dont move during daylight and the days are long now blade grunted thoughtfully blade halted thirty miles north of dejagore scouts brought word that shadowspinner had moved troops into the hills ahead at night when the citys defenders could not see them go the men who had stayed behind were making a show of preparing another assault where are they blade asked the scouts could not tell him somewhere along the road as it snaked through the hills waiting only four thousand apparently but that was enough against this mob you going to mess with them swan asked or just hang around and keep some of them off mogaba that would make sense mather suggested keep some tied up while mogaba does the fighting if we could get a message to him ive tried blade said theres no way they have the city sealed up sitting down there in the middle of that bowl like that well swan asked what do we do blade assembled his cavalry officers he sent them to find the enemy when they encountered no immediate resistance he moved his army ten miles southward and camped next morning as soon as the bats went away he formed line of battle but did nothing else his scouts worked the hills carefully he repeated that the next day and the day following late that afternoon a rider came in from the north his news put a smile on blades face he did not tell swan or mather immediately the fourth morning his battle line advanced he entered the hills slowly made sure his formations stayed integrated there was no hurry the cavalry stayed out front contact came shortly before noon blade did not push he let his men skirmish but avoided a general engagement his cavalry harassed the enemy with missiles the shadowlanders were not inclined to attack them the sun dropped westward blade let the skirmishes grow the enemy commander gave the order to attack blades own officers had orders to stage a fighting withdrawal as soon as the enemy came out to play they were to stop retreating only if the enemy stopped coming if he did that they were to start harassing him again that game went on till the shadowlanders lost all patience chapter fortyone i halted the column gathered narayan and ram and those men who passed for officers this is the place on the back of the swale we put me and the standard on the road spread the men out to either side narayan and the others looked puzzled nobody knew what was going on it seemed wise to keep it that way till it was too late for anybody to worry i set it up practically having to show each squad leader where i wanted him narayan finally figured it out it wont work he decided he had been on a negative kick since the grove he did not believe anything was going to go right ever again why not i doubt they know were here i was able to confuse their bats and shadows i hoped once i had everybody in place i got into my armor got ram fixed up led him and narayan to where we could see what lay beyond the crest i saw what i expected to see a lot of dust headed my way theyre coming narayan go tell the men that in less than an hour theyll get their chance to drink shadowlander blood tell them as soon as blades men slip through the aisles in the formation theyre to plug those up the dust came closer fast i watched narayan off to spring the surprise i watched the nervousness spread among the men i was especially interested in the small troops of horsemen on the wings if they followed jahs old example i was in for another disaster blades men were almost upon me i took my position set witchfires burning on my armor ram came up beside me impressive in the widowmaker armor id had made for him i put fires upon him but could do nothing about giving him the crows that always attached themselves to croakers shoulders when he turned into widowmaker i doubted the shadowlanders would notice blades men poured over the crest there was a lot of confusion till they realized we were on their side willow swan galloped up hair flying laughing like the demented right on time sweetheart right on time go get your men under control cavalry to the wings move it he went there were shadowlanders among the men coming now chaos held court they tried to stop but their comrades behind forced them forward they tried hard to stay away from ram and me where was blade where was his cavalry the shadowlanders pelted my line in no order like hail then turned to flee once they had their backs to us the outcome was not in doubt i signalled for the cavalry to advance i made no effort to keep my men in formation i let them chase the enemy when i crested the rise i saw blade and his cavalry he had had them flee to the flanks distancing the footbound shadowlanders then had brought them back behind our enemies scattered so they could cut down fugitives my own cavalry had the shadowlanders cut off on the flanks only a few got away it was over before darkness fell chapter fortytwo swan could not get over it our man blades done turned into a real live general you had it figured all the way didnt you blade nodded i believed him he might actually make a commanderunless hed had a once in a lifetime stroke of genius swan chuckled old spinner ought to have the word by now bet hes foaming at the mouth very likely i said and he might take steps i want a strong guard posted the night still belongs to the shadowmasters what can he do hey swan demanded i dont know id rather not find out the hard way blade said calm down swan we didnt win the war you would have thought so from the celebrating i told blade tell me more about this other widowmaker and lifetaker you know as much as i do shadowspinner attacked and should have taken the city but they rode out of the hills lifetaker kept him fighting for his life widowmaker rode around killing his men they couldnt touch him they rode away after our men drove the attackers out of the city mogaba tried a sortie they didnt help he took heavy casualties i checked a crow in a nearby bush careful not to be obvious i see we cant do anything about it lets ignore it and get on with plans for tomorrow is that wise mistress narayan asked the night does belong to the shadowmasters meaning there were shadows among us listening and bats whisking overhead there are tools available i could take care of the batsand the crowsbut i could not get rid of the shadows to do anything more than confuse them was beyond my limited powers but does it matter he knows were here he knows well come there he just has to sit and wait or run away if that suits him i had no hope shadowspinner would elect that option he retained the preponderance of forceif not in numbers certainly in power the stunt i had pulled was the limit i would not send these men into a maelstrom of sorcery the victory would increase their confidence but could lead to trouble if i overvalued it that was partly why croaker lost his last battle he got lucky several times and began to count on it luck has its way of running out you have a point narayan no need to ask for trouble well talk about it tomorrow pass the word well make an early start rest we may have to do it again the men had to be reminded there were battles yet to come the others went leaving ram blade and me i looked at blade well done blade very well done he nodded he knew that how are your friends taking it swan and mather were off with their band of radishas guards he shrugged taking the long view uhm taglios will be there after the black company goes theyve set down roots there understandable will they be trouble blade chuckled they dont even want to trouble shadowspinner if there was any way theyd be running their tavern and staying out of everybodys way but they take their pledge to the radisha seriously as seriously as you take your contract then it behooves me to make sure theres no tension he grunted shadows dont need ideas true tomorrow then he rose went ram lets take a ride ram groaned in about a hundred years maybe he would make a horseman we were both in armor still uncomfortable as that was i touched up the glamors we rode among the men had to keep their minds fixed on me i paused to thank men who had been pointed out as having done well when the show was over i returned to my own place in the camp indistinguishable from any other and gave myself up to nights dreams i was sick again ram did his best to keep it from the men i noticed narayan whispering with sindhu about it i did not care at the moment sindhu glided away presumably to tell blade narayan came over perhaps you ought to consult a physician you have one handy his grin was a shadow of itself no there isnt one here which meant some of the wounded would die needlessly often as not victims of their own home remedies medical discipline had been something croaker had started pounding into his men when they were learning to keep in step and hed been right i have dealt with a great many soldiers and armies infection and disease are deadlier enemies than foreign arms determined health discipline had been one of the strengths of the company before croakers passing pain damn me it still hurt i had never grieved over anybody before it was light enough to drive away bats and shadows narayan are they fed damn the sickness lets get them moving where are we going get blade ill explain he got blade i explained i rode out with the cavalry leaving blade to bring the rest i headed east ten miles turned into the hills crows followed i was not concerned about crows they were not reporting to the shadowmasters ten miles into the hills i halted i could see part of the plain dismount rest keep the noise down cold food ram come with me i moved forward quiet there may be pickets we did not encounter any before i could see the whole panorama there had been changes when we had come before the hills had been green with farms and orchards now they were spotted brown especially to the south the canals were not delivering water as they should ram get those two red rumel men abda and whatever his name is he went i studied the prospect shadowspinners camps and siegeworks surrounded the city near the north gate the besiegers had raised an earthen ramp to the top of the wall no mean achievement dejagore squatted atop a high mound behind walls forty feet high the ramp had been damaged badly men were hauling earth up to repair it presumably that had been the point of attack the night whatever had happened had happened the besiegers looked ragged the condition of their camps suggested low morale could i take advantage had word of yesterdays misadventure reached the line troops knowing that knowing a large force could hammer them against the anvil of the city they ought to be ripe for a rout i could not place shadowspinner maybe he was holed up in the remnants of the permanent camp south of the city it had its own rampart and ditch if not he was careful not to stand out maybe mogaba had a habit of picking on him ram returned with abda and the other man i said i want to find a way to get down there unseen spread out try to find one watch for pickets if we can get down there we can give them a nasty surprise tonight they nodded and slipped away ram with his customary worried look he still did not believe i could take care of myself sometimes i wondered i gave them a head start then moved westward i had a surprise for the shadowmastersif my limited talent was up to it it took longer than i hoped but it looked workable it being a bat trap that would call and kill like a candle does moths id been thinking about versions since wed left taglios it should work on crows too with adjustments which left only the shadows we had not encountered it but rumors of old out of the shadowlands in the days of conquest said those shadows could be assassins as well as spies captains and kings had died too opportunely with no other explanation maybe the deaths of two shadowmasters had taken that weapon away maybe a killing took a combined effort i hoped so but did not count on it i set the trap working and hurried back to where i had parted with ram the others were there waiting ram scolded me i suffered it id grown fond of him in a sisterly way it had been a long time since anyone had been concerned about me it felt good when ram finished abda interjected weve found two routes down neither one is ideal the better one might be used by the horsemen we cleared the pickets i sent a few men down in case theres a changing of the guard that could be a problem blade materialized dogged by narayan and sindhu you made good time i told him he grunted studied the city i explained what i wanted to do i dont expect to accomplish much the point is to harass shadowspinner demoralize his men and let ours inside know theres an army out here blade glanced at the westering sun grunted again swan and mather joined us i said get some men moving abda explain the routes mr mather take charge of the infantry sindhu you take the horsemen swan blade narayan ram come with me i want to talk mather and sindhu got things moving we got out of their way i asked swan swan your men brought home the news about the row down here run through what you know he did i entered questions did not get half the information i wanted not that i expected to swan said some third party is playing his own game yes there were crows nearby i could not mention names the attackers definitely masqueraded as lifetaker and widowmaker absolutely then those men down there should panic if they see them again get the armor ram narayan prowled restlessly while we talked putting in nothing keeping one eye on the city he said theyre starting to move around weve been discovered i dont think so they dont act like they expect trouble i went and looked after watching awhile i hazarded a guess the news is out theyre shook their officers are trying to keep them busy you really going to take a whack swan asked a little one just big enough to let mogaba know he has friends on the outside the day was getting on i passed orders for the men to eat cold and keep moving ram showed up with our armor and animals two hours of light we ought to do something while they can see us narayan said theres a group of four five hundred headed out south mistress i checked hard to tell from so far away but they looked more like a labor battalion than armed men on the march curious a similar group was forming north of the city sindhu appeared they got the word about yesterday theyre bad rattled i lifted an eyebrow i got close enough to hear some talk theyre making a move dont know what it is daring sindhu you didnt hear where we could find shadowspinner did you no i sent everybody off with instructions ram and i donned our armor ram said nothing the whole time usually he had some small talk thoughtless but comforting youre awfully quiet thinking all whats happened in just a couple months wondering what if the world really is so black its time for the year of the skulls oh ram he was not a fast thinker but an inexorable one now suffering a crisis of faith brought on by events in the grove but sprouting from seeds that had fallen earlier he cared again kina was losing her hold and damn me i let croaker get past my defenses and turn me soft inside too i felt enough now that i could not just use and discard maybe that soft center was there all the time maybe i was like an oyster croaker always thought so before we hardly knew one another he wrote about me in ways that suggested he thought there was something special inside me those people down there took him they destroyed his dreams and hamstrung mine i did not give a damn about the year of the skulls or kina i wanted restitution ram stop i stepped close placed a hand on his chest looked him in the eye dont worry dont tear your heart out believe me when i tell you ill try to make everything work out he did trust me damn him a big damn faithful dog look came into his eyes chapter fortythree the prahbrindrah drah took smokes advice he reread the old books about the black companys first visit they told a tale of death and heartbreak but reread as he might he found nothing to indict the company returned from the north the more he studied the more he veered from the attitude smoke wanted him to adopt the radisha joined him youre going to wear those things out no i dont have to read any more smoke is wrong but never mind the woman id bet my lifeand i amthat she has no intention of becoming the daughter of night its subtle you have to read this stuff over and over before it sinks in but therere signs missing that would be there no matter how hard they tried to hide them they were exactly what they pretended oh the radisha asked didnt they mean to return to khatovar without knowing what it is could have been interesting seeing what would have happened if theyd made it we still might find out if anyone can pull down the shadowmasters that woman can maybe the prince smiled peaceful as its been im tempted to ride south myself theres no one left here to bother me dont let it go to your head what people being scared of you it wont last better win their respect before their fear wears off just once id like to go off and do something because i want to do it not because it will strengthen the office that sparked an exchange halfway between argument and discussion smoke arrived in its midst he stepped into the room stopped stared stupidly they stared back the radisha demanded where the hell have you been the prince silenced her with a touch whats happened smoke you look awful smoke was stunned his thoughts oozed too slowly this was the last thing he expected walking right into those two he needed time to get hold of himself he opened his mouth longshadow flashed behind his eyes the terror and pain closed in he could not tell them he could do nothing but carry out his orders and pray where the hell have you been the radisha demanded again do you have any idea whats happened while youve been off fooling around she was angry good that would distract her some no she told him he was dismayed she murdered them all of them it was a chance to press his point with passion but he did not have the strength or will he just wanted to lie down and sleep all night for the first time since since all of them that counted for anything right now she could do anything she pleased with taglios if she was here she isnt longshadow had not kept him posted where is she by now she may be in dejagore slowly slowly he milked the radisha of news a lot had happened perhaps longshadow had told him none of this because he did not know himself which might place the situation beyond reclamation who broke up shadowspinners attack on dejagore the prince never said a word he just sat there looking sleepy an awful sign the prince was most dangerous when he seemed indifferent he was not going to pull it off he did not want to but if he failed the face of the shadowmaster burned in his brain terror unmanned him he gobbled we have to do something we have to control her before she devours this whole nation the prahbrindrah had opened his eyes there was no sympathy in them i took your advice smoke i reread those old books six times theyve convinced me the wizard nearly collapsed with joy theyve convinced me youre full of shit this company has nothing to do with that im on her side chapter fortyfour i scattered the spell that baffled shadows though it was not yet dark it would be dark before we finished the horsemen were in place the shadowlanders did not appear suspicious they were up to whatever with those work parties both had vanished into the hills taking a thousand men out of my way what temper possessed shadowspinner not a good one surely having four thousand men nipped off an undermanned siege force had to stick in his craw blade had spread enough infantrymen around to cover the cavalry withdrawal i told ram its time he nodded he did not have much to say now i urged my stallion onto an outcrop from which we would be visible all over the plain he followed i hoped he would do nothing clumsy falling off your horse takes something away from high drama i drew my sword it blossomed fire trumpets sounded the horsemen broke cover the shadar element were very nearly veterans now blade had them in shape i was pleased by their performance chaos broke its chains down below it seemed the shadowlanders would never get together i feared i would have another unexpected victory on my hands it was full dark before i lowered my sword and the trumpets sounded recall the shadowlanders did not pursue my horsemen blade showed up quickly what now the message has been delivered maybe we should back off a gangrenous glow formed inside the walled camp beside the city before that gets here i cancelled the spells illuminating ram and myself dismounted led the way out of there i stumbled into sindhu who had come from narayan with the question blade had asked i told him i want narayan and your friends to join me evacuate the cavalry the infantry should come out behind them well take tomorrow off i needed the rest i felt drained all the time all i wanted to do was lie down and sleep i had been going on will power for so long i feared i would collapse at a critical moment there had been no time to filter all the infantry down the slope once it had become apparent that was impossible i had sent the majority back to make camp i longed to be there now but the night was not yet done the valley glowed as though a cancerous green moon was rising there the green grew brighter down i snapped and hit the dirt a ball of ugly light crashed into the eminence from which i had observed the fighting earth and vegetation melted smoke filled the air fires started but burned out quickly my companions were awed i was pleased shadowspinner had missed by two hundred yards he did not know where i was his bats were flying to my kill trap and his shadows were confused sometimes little tricks can be as useful as ones like spinners fireball lets move out i said hell need time to ready another shot take advantage of it ram lets get out of the way and out of these costumes theyre too damned cumbersome we did that horsemen moved past talking softly wearily in good spirits they had made a big mess out there they were pleased with themselves narayans friends gathered one now one then by the time the infantry started out there were eighty of them mainly men of my band he explained they came to ghoja in answer to my summons what do you plan now down shadowspinner was pasting the hills with random sorceries hurling his darts blind from beside narayan with stones grinding into my belly and breasts i murmured were going to infiltrate their camp and try for the shadowmaster i could not see his face just as well probably the idea did not thrill him but never have a better chance longshadow knows everything that happens as soon as it happens his resources havent been tapped he sees shadowspinner in bad trouble hell do something send the howler probably wed better get what we can while we can get it he did not want to try damn him if he refused his stranglers would too but he had sewn himself into a sack i was his daughter of night for his own sake he dared not argue he grunted whispered i dont like it if it has to be done please dont you go the risk is too great i have to im the messiah remember its still that time when i have to win support by demonstration i did not want to go i just wanted to lie down and sleep but my role demanded i play it totally he selected twentyfive men whose abilities he knew the rest he dismissed they joined the soldiers headed for camp lucky bastards sindhu take four men and scout ahead as carefully as you can dont take anybody out without checking unless you have to he chose the men to accompany sindhu we followed in a tighter crowd with flankers out narayan knew his smallunit tactics shadows fluttered around us still blind to our presence but i did not trust their blindness had i been shadowspinner i would have had them pretend chaos still reigned spinner kept pounding the hills maybe his shadows did not know where we were only that we had not all departed sindhu drifted back from the point grounds wet ahead that made no sense it had been dry before sundown it had not rained water i asked yes strange but no way to see what it meant before morning be careful he went forward again we resumed moving soon i was in water an inch deep the earth beneath was not waterlogged the reason for part of the confusion became apparent the shadowlanders were trying to stay away from the hills when they got too close to the city archers sniped at them but the disorder was sorting itself out sindhu had to eliminate several sentries shadowspinner stopped hammering the hills narayan guessed his shadows were watching his sentries not so their confusion was caused by my proximity it would envelop the sentries but maybe he sensed our approach some other way i sent word to sindhu to run for it the instant he thought we were walking into something i was a hundred yards from the old walled camp sindhu was at its shattered gate he thought the way was clear we might actually get our shot at shadowspinner all hell broke loose half a hundred fireballs jumped straight up to push back the night their light betrayed a hundred men stealing toward the camp taglian men and big black men some were in handshaking distance of my stranglers i looked into the eyes of their commander mogaba the nar from thirty feet away he had had the same idea as id had chapter fortyfive longshadow glanced across a table where a bowl of mercury sat reflecting the frightened wavering face of his slave smoke the howler floated over there between them they had just enough strength to communicate with the little wizard the howler was amused the slave had nothing good to report senjak not only was not available she had evaded his eye well enough to have moved south perhaps as far as stormgard longshadow flung a hand out above the bowl and broke the pattern smoke faded chaotic colors melting howler chuckled you should have seduced him youre too enamored of brute force took more time to do it the hard way and now hes a bent tool and they dont trust him dont tell me how to this was not one of his powerless minions this one was almost as strong as he he would not endure attempts at intimidation he had to be placated lulled seduced lets check on our colleague at stormgard they joined talents though longshadow could reach that far without help help did forge the connection more quickly it was apparent shadowspinner was preoccupied he responded only sporadically the magnitude and scope of his troubles became clear only slowly damn it all four thousand men lost chaos among the besiegers who knew how many more men lost tonight shadowspinner falling back oh his last desperate device for keeping the city sealed thats senjak herself this time has to be and shes recovered some of her skills or shes found someone to provide them that was howler always finding extra explanations confusing issues damn him it would be a pleasure killing him maybe it would take a century to finish him whatever shes there we can end the threat she poses have you completed the new carpet its ready ill give you three capable men from my guard bring her here we will enjoy her for ages to come would howler accept that he was not naive it was a risk sending him he might run off with senjak the knowledge she possessed forewarned is forearmed he would send his best three men fail in this and there will be but one answer left i shall have to loose one of the big ones off the plain the howlers concentration broke momentarily a terrible wail tore through his lips then the little bundle of rags chuckled consider her caught i have a score to settle myself longshadow watched the ragbag drift out taking its odor with it maybe its first torment would consist of soap and water he sent for his best three guards and briefed them then tried contacting shadowspinner again spinner did not respond he was preoccupied or dead he retreated to his crystal tower crows perched on its top peered down it was time he did something about them permanently after he sent shadows to dejagore chapter fortysix mogaba was much more surprised to see me than i was to see him an immense displeasure marred his features a grand measure of his surprise he was always in control of what he showed the world the look persisted only a moment he altered his course to join me before he reached me ram was beside me between him and me and abda had materialized to my left narayan was making certain no outsider caused me grief up ahead sindhu cursed the light and ordered men to move it was hit fast or die lady mogaba said we thought you dead he was a big man without an ounce of waste on him muscled like a fictional hero he was blacker than blade and a consummate commander one of the nar descendants of the original black company croaker had enlisted him in geaxle during our southward journey the nar constituted a separate warrior class there with a thousand nar i could have cleaned the shadowmasters out as fast as the men could march there were only fifteen or twenty left alive i guessed all loyal to mogaba did you im tougher than you think his men piled into the camp with mine trying to reach shadowspinner before he reacted i suspected mogabas men had triggered the lights in spinners place i would have expected an attack from him before one from me do you have the lance he asked the question took me from the blind side i would have thought hed want to talk about the siege or which of us had the stronger claim to the captaincy what lance he smiled relieved the standard murgen lost it he was stretching the truth somehow i turned the conversation to business we would not have much time the shadowlanders were getting ready to interrupt how bad off are you i have no veterans and few trained men i can only harass them not break you out we arent in good shape their last assault nearly overcame us where did you get your power who are you riding with murgen saw croaker die the enemies of the shadowmasters are my friends better to be cryptic than to hand him free information why dont you put an end to the shadowmasters i could not answer without lying i lied my friend is no longer with me who was up there today anyone can wear armor he smiled tightly showing a thin strip of sharp teeth the captaincy then you dont plan to let me get out of here do you we spoke the language of the jewel cities both disinclined to let our companions in on our conversation men started screaming inside the encampment i shouted narayan come on the shadowlanders west of us would be ready to move any moment i told mogaba theres no problem with the captaincy the progression was established when the captain dies the lieutenant steps into his shoes the tradition is for the captain to be elected we were both right mogaba shouted sindawe lets go it wont work his archers and artillerymen on the wall were hard at work laying down fire to cover his withdrawal we know where we stand lady do we i have no enemies but those who choose to make themselves my enemies im interested only in the destruction of the shadowmasters my men flew past me mogabas flew past him a wall of shadowlanders hurtled toward us mogaba showed me that smile turned headed for the city and the safety of ropes hanging down the wall ram gouged me move mistress i moved a gang of shadowlanders came after my band thinking us the easier meat in the hills some observer had initiative enough to bluff them by sounding trumpets they slackened the chase we vanished into the dark ravines we assembled i asked narayan did we get close we would have had him if those others hadnt alerted him sindhu wasnt ten feet from him where is he sindhu had not come back i hated to lose him narayan grinned hes healthy we lost only two stranglers those you dont see got caught in the confusion and fled to the city for once i did not mind his grin quick thinking narayan you think hell find many friends there a few mostly i wanted him to get to your friends those who might not be enchanted with that mogaba mogaba was not much of a problem yet he was in no position to trouble me the cure for him was to let him rot i could just pretend to look for ways to relieve the city while actually only training my men till they suffered the illusion they were soldiers meantime mogaba could wear the enemy down for me the flaw of course was that shadowspinner had allies who might decide to help him dejagore and its surroundings were not worth much anymore but the city did have symbolic value the shadowlands were more heavily populated down south the peoples there would be watching the fate of dejagore could decide the fate of the shadowmasters empire if they lost the city and we looked likely to move south again the oppressed might revolt all that passed through my mind while i tried to muster strength enough to cross the hills to our camp i could not make it ram had to help me chapter fortyseven the riders paused to consider the hill beside the road the woman said shes sure gotten them busy what had been a bald hilltop a few weeks ago now boasted a maze of stonework construction looked like a day and night project she gets things done croaker wondered how lady was getting on down south he wondered why they had come here she does damn her the sorceress touched him gently like a lover she did that all the time now and she looked so much like lady he had trouble resisting she smiled she knew what he was thinking he had his justifications lined up she had the battle halfway won he ground his teeth stared at the fortress and ignored her she touched him again he tried to remark on the layout of the fortress found nothing would come out he looked at her again wideeyed just a precaution my love you havent surrendered your heart but in time youll come around come lets visit our friends she urged her stallion forward circling crows led the way catcher wanted to attract attention she got it she was a beautiful and exotic woman he understood when she spoke to a man as though she knew him she meant to pass as lady no wonder she wanted him mute no one paid him any heed as they passed through the press of sweating men and animals dust and clatter the stench of labor and dung only the insects noticed him in this he might disappear if her attention lapsed if the crows became distracted could they pick him out of such a mob she led the way toward the works atop the hill already nearing completion she paused again and again to speak to men usually about matters of no consequence she was not playing the role right if she meant to usurp lady ladys manner was distant and imperious unless she was striving for a specific result of course she wanted word spread that lady was back what was she up to his conscience told him he had to do something but he could think of nothing nobody recognized him that did his ego no good only months ago all taglios had hailed him liberator word ran ahead as they approached the inner fortress a man came out the prahbrindrah drah himself he was here directing construction that was not like him he stayed holed up where the priests could not get to him the prince said i didnt expect you back right away weve won a small victory north of dejagore the shadowmasters lost four thousand men blade planned the operation and carried it out i decided to leave him in charge i came back to recruit and train new formations youve done well here i take it the priests abandoned their obstructionism you convinced them the prince looked troubled but you dont have any friends now dont leave your back unguarded his gaze kept drifting to croaker he seemed puzzled your man ram seems odd today touch of dysentery how is the recruiting going slow most of the volunteers are helping here most men are holding off waiting to have their minds made up for them let them know about the victory let them know the siege can be broken shadowspinner has no strength left hes getting no help from longshadow hes on his own with an army so battered only its fear of him holds it together croaker glanced up at a few clouds sliding east from the sea nothing remarkable about them but they did cause thoughts to click the subtle bitch he knew exactly what she was doing lady was down there sparring with shadowspinner beyond the main which became impassable during the rainy season a touch here a nudge there and that contest would go on till it was too late for lady to get back over the river the season was not that far away now two months at the most lady would be trapped over there with the shadowmasters catcher would have five months to take control here without interference probably without anyone discovering who she was her crows would watch the routes north messengers would be intercepted the bitch the blackhearted bitch the prince frowned at him sensing his turmoil but he was preoccupied with the woman maybe we can do the garden again sometime that would be lovely but remember its my turn to put on the spread the prince smiled weakly if theyll let you after last time i didnt start it what was that about something involving lady had happened in the gardens soulcatcher did not tell him everything only what would leave his heart raw he sensed someone watching spied smoke lurking in shadows the wizards face was a mask of hatred that faded when he realized he had been spotted he started shivering slipped away crows followed croaker noted of course wherever smoke went he would be watched soulcatcher knew all about him catcher asked have my quarters been completed its been a long dusty road itll take me two hours to get human theyre not finished but they should do shall i have someone take your horses and give you a hand with your things yes of course kind of you she did some trick with her eyes the prince went shy there are some men i want to see she named names unfamiliar to croaker send them to my quarters ram will entertain them till im cleaned up of course the prince summoned his hangerson sent them to find the men she wanted at catchers gesture croaker dismounted and handed his horse over he followed her as she followed the prince the crows did a good job scouting he admitted grudgingly she was pulling it off without a hitch in ladys quarters he discovered why he could be called ram why no one knew him he encountered a mirror he did not see himself in it he saw a big dirty shadar with hair enough for a gorilla she had laid a glamor on him the men catcher asked for were low caste skin and bone nervous little creatures unable to meet her eye as he introduced himself each added words in cant that croaker did not recognize the honorifics were puzzling enough daughter of night what did that mean too much was happening and he had no way of knowing what nor any control catcher told those men i want you to watch the wizard smoke at least two of you should be within sight of him all the time i especially want to know if he goes near the street of the dead lamps if he enters it stop him by whatever means necessary though id rather he didnt make an early entrance into paradise the men all plucked at bits of colored cloth peeking from their loincloths one said as you will so shall it be mistress of course get on with it find him stick tight hes dangerous to us the men hurried out obviously eager to be away from her theyre terrified of you croaker observed his voice came back when he was alone with her naturally they think im the daughter of their goddess why dont you get cleaned up i can smell you from here ill have them bring you new clothes the bath and clothes were the only good things that happened that day chapter fortyeight i did not get the sleep i needed the dreams were bad i wandered the caverns under the earth awash in the stench of decay the caverns were no longer cold the old men were rotting they were still alive but decaying when i passed through their line of sight i felt their appeal their blame i really tried but i could get no nearer whatever my destination was supposed to be the thing trying to recruit me was getting impatient narayan wakened me im sorry mistress its important he looked like he had seen a ghost i sat up and started vomiting narayan sighed his friends moved to mask me from the men he looked worried he feared his investment was going to come up short i was going to die on him i was not worried about that more the opposite that i would not die and never escape the misery what was wrong with me this was getting old every morning sickand not that great the rest of the day i didnt have time to be sick i had work to do i had worlds to conquer help me up ram did i mess myself no mistress thank the goddess for small favors what is it narayan better you see for yourself come mistress please ram had brought horses i collected myself let him help me mount we headed for the hills as we left camp i saw blade and swan and mather with their heads together exercised about something narayan did not ride but he could lope along when he wanted he was right seeing was better than hearing i might not have believed a verbal report the plain had flooded at the north and south ends water roared out of the hills the aqueducts had gone mad i said now we know where those work parties headed they must have diverted both rivers how deep is it at least ten feet already i tried guessing how high it could rise the hills were deceptive it was hard to tell the plain was lower than the land beyond the hills but not much the water should not get more than sixty feet deep but that would be enough to flood the city mogaba was in a fix he had no way outunless he built boats or rafts shadowspinner would not have to waste a man to keep him tied up good gods where did the shadowlanders go i had a bad feeling i had one foot in a bear trap narayan summoned a man on scout duty he told us the shadowlanders had pulled out in two forces north and south shortly after sunrise i consulted maps in my head told narayan we have to run fast or well be dead before noon get up here behind me you soldier get up behind ram and hang on are there other men out here a few mistress theyll have to look out for themselves lets go we were a sight im sure only one of us a competent rider and she so sick she had to stop twice to throw up but we got back to camp before the hammer fell blade had them ready to march now i knew what hed been up to with swan and mather he had heard about the water and had sensed its significance he awaited orders send cavalry north and south to scout and harass done already two hundred men each direction good youre a natural id already recalled rejected and reexamined a trick that had been played on my armies in the north hurry was essential i could see what might be dust north of us move the infantry into the hills i want every horseman to cut brush and drag it behind headed due east get messengers off to the skirmishers i want contact kept as long as possible draw them eastward and keep leading them as long as theyll follow the ruse would not work after darkif it worked at all then shadowspinners pet shadows would tell him hed been taken but that would be time enough to elude him if he kept chasing me mogabas men would escape he would not want that blade wasted no time swan and mather dashed around helping our differences would wait a new sense of confidence and discipline was apparent as the troops moved into the hills they trusted me and blade to get them through this the horsemen headed out raising enough dust for a horde on the march blade swan mather narayan and i watched from a low hill that will do it if he can be fooled at all i said hell see us just slipping out get excited try to nab us on the run swan raised crossed fingers to the sky blade asked whats our next move drift north through the hills hes biting mather said blade said it occurs to me that for speeds sake he would have left behind anyone not in top condition i told him you are learning and youre turning nasty nasty business yes the rest of you understand swan wanted it explained spinner would leave his injured and secondline troops behind so they wouldnt slow him down they should be up where the north road enters the hills we can take them by surprise narayan send some scouts ahead narayan was pleased with me now there was a lot of killing going on there was promise of a real year of the skulls chapter fortynine smoke drifted into the darkness glanced right and left cursed softly there they were again those men he could not shake them they knew where he was going before he went it was disheartening and frightening the longer he delayed visiting his contacts the stronger longshadows image grew within his mind and the more terrified he became on a level so deep it was a part of his soul something terrible had been done to him something that had reached into him as deeply as a man could be reached somehow longshadow had hidden a fragment of himself inside him to drive him into executing the shadowmasters will the voice within had become a shriek if he did not shake the watchers he would not be able to avoid betraying his contacts he pretended not to notice the men though they did nothing to remain anonymous did she know and just want to scare him away from his contacts maybe maybe it did not matter if he betrayed them he started walking his shadows followed he tried to elude them relying on a superior knowledge of the city he had haunted the shadows and alleys andhidden ways all his life as he knew the palace better than anyone living so he knew taglios he gave it his best and when ne stepped out of a shanty warren where he got lost twice himself trying to get back out one of his stalkers was waiting leaning against a building the man grinned longshadow filled smokes mind the shadowmaster was angry his patience was failing smoke stamped across the street how the hell do you keep track of me the man spat to one side smiled again you cant evade the eye of kina wizard kina another terror to pile atop his fear of longshadow you can run but you cant hide you can twist and wiggle but you cant get off the hook you can skulk and whisper in locked rooms but you cant keep secrets each breath you draw is numbered the fear deepened and always has been smoke turned to run theres a way out what theres a way out look at you maintain your allegiance to the shadowmaster and youre dead if your taglian friends find out if they dont kill you he will when hes done with you but you can get out you can come home you can shake the terror thats like a beast starving for your soul smoke was too frightened to wonder why the thug did not talk like a street creature how he would try anything to get out from under the shadowmasters thumb come to kina oh no he nearly shrieked the only escape was to yield himself to a greater horror no up to you wizard but life isnt going to get any better this time smoke did run he did not care if he was followed exercise reduced panic as he neared his destination he realized that he had not seen any bats since leaving the palace that was new where were the shadowmasters messengers he bustled into a tall slum tenement hurried upstairs pounded on a door a voice said enter he froze two steps inside the doorway the man he had been talking to leaned against the opposite wall there were eight corpses in the room all strangled the man said the goddess doesnt want your master to know her daughter is here smoke squeaked like a stomped rat he fled the man laughed the man amongst the corpses shrank he became the imp frogface who chuckled then faded away smoke calmed down before he reached the palace his mind started working he had one bolt left it could bite him as easily as his enemies but engulfed by the darkness he could but flee toward the only light he saw he would not yield to kina chapter fifty as dusk gathered i descended on longshadows staybehinds and routed them completely the slaughter was great it failed being complete only because my cavalry was otherwise occupied we had the field to ourselves before the last light left the sky old spinners going to know in a few minutes swan said i figure hell have him a litter of kittens then hell get pissed we ought to go somewhere where he cant catch us he was on the right track coming through the hills i had been considering going after the group left at the southern approach not till swan spoke did i realize i would not be able to sneak up on that group night had come night belonged to shadowspinner he would know where we were and where we were headed unless that was away from him he would be waiting when we arrived too he might be desperate enough to appeal to longshadow maybe longshadow had help on the way already whatever lay between them it would not be as great as their enmity for the rest of the world though premature theirs was a squabble over the spoils of conquest blade asked any way we could stay here and masquerade as the shadowmasters men no i dont have the skill our best bet is to go back north till he stops chasing us then just keep him nervous while we decide what to do next narayan had started worrying about missing his delayed festival though i had passed my first test he was suspicious of my will to become the daughter of night a move north would assuage him and the men needed time away from danger to recuperate and digest their successes blade asked the men in the city theyre safer than they were shadowspinner cant get at them now narayan grumbled sindhu was in there i said mogaba will cope hes good at coping too good we would have trouble down the road him and me nobody liked heading back north except narayan but no one argued i had gained ground definitely chapter fiftyone smoke was no earthshaker as a wizard but within his limitations which he recognized he was competent and effective and forewarned he was forearmed the woman knew his every move then she commanded some unsuspected agency for espionage he needed blind that only a few minutes he scuttled through the palace ducking his employers who were looking for him he dodged into one of his shielded rooms barred the door obviously his shielding had been penetrated because that man had implied she knew everything meaning she had been peeking here too she was more than she pretended much more she was the daughter of night and that fool the prince had been blinded by her hadnt they been out to the gardens again tonight no one could stop her but him maybe he could shake loose from longshadow later the shadowmasters face formed in his head his legs turned to jelly he shook his head violently forced the apparition away hurriedly set about checking his defenses he found a pinhole through which some wicked spirit could have oozed or a shadow for that matter he plugged it then he worked a spell that pressed his limits it would conceal his whereabouts till he became the object of a very determined search secure he filled a small silver bowl from a mercury flask working as swiftly as he dared before he was finished he feared that he had been too slow someone tried the door he jumped but concentrated on opening the path to overlook it came it came more quickly than he expected it came the shadowmaster had been thinking of him too the racket at the door became pounding and shouting he ignored it the dread face appeared on the surface of the mercury amazed it mouthed words there was no sound the shadowmaster was too far smokes power too feeble the little wizard gestured violently pay attention he was startled by his own temerity but this was a desperate hour desperate measures were necessary smoke grabbed paper and ink and scribbled they were trying to break down the door damn the woman had reacted quickly he held his message up for longshadow the shadowmaster read he reread then longshadow looked him in the eye and nodded he appeared bewildered carefully he mouthed words so smoke could read his lips the door began to give and something else was trying to get in now clawing and tearing at the plugged pinhole the door gave a little more smoke got half the message before the pinhole plug broke dense smoke boiled into the room a face glared out of it hideous and fanged and filled with grim purpose it came for him he squealed jumped up overturned table and bowl the door gave way as the demon caught him he screamed and tumbled down into an abyss of terror the guards took one look cursed dropped the ram and fled the prince stepped inside saw the thing ripping at smoke the radisha crowded up behind him what the hell is that i dont know i dont think you ought to stay to find out he looked for a weapon recognized the absurdity of the impulse as he grabbed a swordlike sliver split from the doorframe the monster looked up startled it stared apparently this situation was beyond its instructions it hung there motionless the prahbrindrah threw the sliver like a spear the thing shrank away into an upper corner of the room swiftly and dramatically leaving behind an odor like cinnamon and mustard and wine all mixed what the hell was it the radisha demanded again she was petrified the prahbrindrah jumped over to the wizard smokes blood was everywhere along with shreds of clothing the thing had driven him into a corner what was left of him had drawn itself into a tight fetal ball the prince dropped to his knees hes alive get some help fast or he wont be for long he started doing what he could chapter fiftytwo longshadow let out one long scream of rage that echoed throughout overlook it brought toadies running bent with fear he would take it out on them whatever it was get out get out and stay wait get in here calm returned suddenly hed always had a facility for gaining control when the crisis was tight that was when he thought his best responded most quickly maybe this was a blessing in disguise bring the big sending bowl bring mercury bring that fetish that belongs to my guest and ally i must contact him they scurried around in terror that was good to see they held him in high fear fear was the power what you feared ruled you he thought of shadows and a plain of glittering stone the rage boiled up he rejected it as he rejected fear one day when the distractions were eliminated that plain would bend to him he would conquer it end the fear of it forever they had everything set before he was ready himself now get out stay out till i call he activated the bowl and reached for his man he touched nothing he tried again again four times five the rage was about to break through again the howler responded where have you been aloft scant whisper barely perceptible i had to set down first bad news shes tricked our friend again slaughtered another several thousand men that went past longshadow shadowspinners travails were nothing is she there at all of course she is are you positive have you seen her my shadows cant find her last night they couldnt do more than suggest she might be in a given general area not with my own eyes howler admitted im tracking her forces though waiting for the chance to strike late tonight i think ive just had a report from the wizard in taglios a desperate effort on his part all our agents there have been strangled he says shes there with her shadar shadow and she knows hes ours before he finished something demonic burst in and tore him apart thats impossible she was here two days ago have you seen her with your own eyes no recall she always favored illusion and misdirection there was evidence she was regaining her powers maybe much faster than she let on maybe shes tricked us into believing she was one place when she was another the taglian said our agents were killed to keep them from reporting her presence the howler did not respond both men thought longshadow finally said i cant fathom why shed send an army to make us believe she was in our territories but i know her you know her if its that important to her that we believe her somewhere she isnt then its lethally important to us theres something in taglios she doesnt want us to discover perhaps shes on the track of the lance someone carried it away from the battlefield it hasnt been seen since if i go were liable to lose dejagore and spinner his skills are impaired his mind is as dull as a knife used to chop rock longshadow cursed softly yes pray come the day when shadowspinner was no longer needed when there was no need for a bulwark against the north but somebody had to bear the brunt now do something then go the runt could understand that collect her quick hell will be a pleasure compared to what well face if she stays loose till all her powers are restored consider it done the howler whispered consider her taken i take nothing for granted where senjak is concerned get her dammit get her he slammed a fist into the mercury that killed the connection he let the rage roar through him he hurled things broke things till it was appeased then he went up into his tower and glowered his hatred at the nighthidden plain why must you torment me why turn away let me be if that was not out there ready to burst its bonds he would be free to deal with these things himself he would make short work of these problems if he could see to them himself but he needs must rely on incompetents and agents with insufficient power to get the job done he thought of the taglian wizard that tool had not done the job for which it had been forged but it had served pity it had been destroyed so quickly a pity chapter fiftythree the cavalry rejoined us two days north of dejagore where i made camp the general mood was positive the men resented having been withdrawn they did not want to believe they had just been lucky not invincible i wanted them to know their luck could turn they did not believe me most people believe only what they want to believe their confidence had infected narayan and blade those two would have turned south again without question had i ordered it i was tempted i considered myself lucky to be sick it kept me thinking rationally they presented a plan for harassing shadowspinner into another trap i told them spinner wont charge into traps if we separate him from his men maybe we can trap them but not him narayan leaned close it wasnt luck mistress it was kina her spirit is loose it is the time of foreshadowing the year of the skulls approaches she passes her hand over the eyes of her enemies she is with us i wanted to tell him that the man who counts on the aid of a god deserves the help he doesnt get but i reconsidered the deceivers were true believers whatever else however bloodthirsty and criminal their enterprises they believed in their goddess and mission kina was not just a convenient fiction excusing their crimes after months of dreams i had trouble not believing in kina myself maybe not as narayans kind of goddess but as a potent force that fed on death and destruction blade asked why not take shadowspinner out of the picture right a stroke of genius blade maybe if we all wish hard enough hell come floating belly up he smiled his smile was no fawning grin like narayans but it was powerful because he used it so seldom he offered me a hand up take a walk with me please right on the edge there blade he was not sufficiently impressed i feared i reminded myself to remember he probably had his own agenda and i did not have the foggiest what it might be we walked away from the others narayan and ram and swan all watched each with his particular breed of jealousy well shadowspinner is the main enemy kill him and his army would collapse probably i have eyes and ears my brain works when im curious i ask questions i know what narayan is i know what you are to him and i think i know what they want you to become no great surprise that probably half the army had some notion though they might not believe ram and narayan deserved their legendary reputation so ive seen sindhu in action i understand narayan is better true then point him at shadowspinner he could have the shadowmaster dead before he knew what hit him strangling a sorcerer is a good way of disposing of him one of spinners magnitude relies heavily on voice spells and secondarily gesture spells stick him with a knife or sword or missile and he can still use both voice and hands unless you kill him instantly a narayan could take away the voice assuming he could break a neck as fast as he claimed gestures would not matter stipulated i think leaving one small problem moving narayan near enough to use his rumel uhm narayan of his kind is what i used to be of mine the pinnacle the acme ive watched him hes death incarnate but he lacks the skills needed to get close to shadowspinner he just never learned how to turn invisible blade chuckled bet thats a trick hed love you to teach him no doubt youve thought this through youve seen the difficulties you think youve seen ways around them so tell me how we do it i dont think its practical but ill listen there are distinct kinds of assassins a lone crazy who doesnt care if he gets killed himself a cabal grasping for power ready to turn on itself when its target is eliminated and the professional i saw no point i said so to be successful we have to avoid the weaknesses of various kinds of assassins ive watched you your skills arent what they were but you sell yourself short you could disguise a strike team sneaking up on shadowspinner if we create the illusion that our goals are impersonal he wont guard against personal attack right to a point to a point shadowspinner shouldnt know you have problems with mogaba so go after ways to relieve the city while a handful work on killing shadowspinner tell me how narayan should do the actual killing you will have to disguise the attack group or make it invisible ram goes because he must i go because no one else is better with a weapon swan goes because his presence implies the involvement of the taglian state mather would be better because theres a personal involvement with the woman but cordy needs to hold the reins here hes steady he thinks willow is all passion action without thought add however many specialists narayan needs two armholders i said it in stranglers cant blade gave me a quick glance he was surprised i was that far into that world we walked in silence then i said youve just talked more than ive heard since i met you i talk when i have something to say do you know card games i had seen none south of the equator here the welltodo played dominoes or board games the impoverished games with dice or sticks you shook in a canister and tossed some cordy and mather had cards but they wore out know what a wild card is he nodded i stopped bent my head closed my eyes concentrated conjured a ferocious illusion it took form high above a flying lizard twice the size of an eagle it dove crows have sharp eyes they have brains for birds but they are not geniuses they panicked the panic would make their reports of the event incomprehensible blade said you did something he watched the crows flee the birds are spies for one of the wild cards in our game i told him what i had found in the grove and what i thought it meant mather and swan have mentioned this howler and soulcatcher they did not speak well of them but they didnt speak well of you either as you were whats their interest here i talked about them till the crows returned blade had no trouble grasping the intricacies of scheming in the old empire he must have had experience the crows reestablished their watch i did not disturb it too often would generate suspicion blade wore a thin pleased smile as we approached the others waiting silently watching intently each with his concerns too evident blade whispered for the first time im glad cordy and willow dragged me out i glanced at him quickly yes he seemed completely alive for the first time since id met him chapter fiftyfour the prahbrindrah drah turned slowly before a mirror admiring himself what do you think the radisha eyed his tailored dress bright silk and jewels he cut a handsome figure when did you turn into a peacock he half drew a sword hed had forged as a symbol of the state nice it was as fine a weapon as could be produced by taglian craftsmen hilt and pommel a work of art incorporating gold silver rubies and emeralds in a symbolic intertwining of the emblems of taglian faiths the blade was strong sharp practical but its hilt was overweight and clumsy still it was not a combat weapon just a trapping of office gorgeous and youre trying to make a fool of yourself maybe but im having fun doing it and youd be having fun making a fool of you if mather was here eh the radisha eyed him narrowly he was not as open as he had been before lady caught his eye he was up to something and for the first time in their lives he was not sharing that worried her but she said only youre wasting your time its raining nobody goes to the gardens when its raining it wont last that was true it was just a brief rain they always were this time of year the real rains were more than a month away but still she felt he should avoid the gardens tonight with no rational basis for her feeling youre investing too much in it slow down make her work harder he grinned give the woman that murderess she might be but she did put a smile on his face dont count me so smitten ill give away the palace i wasnt thinking that but shes changed since she came back it concerns me i appreciate it but im in control taglios is my first love and hers is the company if shes up to anything its trying to make sure we dont go back on our bargain that could be enough regarding the black company she still hovered over the abyss between his position and smokes hows smoke he asked hasnt come to yet they say he lacks the will to recover tell those leeches that for their sakes hed better i want to know what happened i want to know what that thing was i want to know why it wanted to kill him our smoke has been up to something it could get us destroyed they had discussed that again and again there were implications in smokes behavior which boded evil till they learned the truth they suspected a sword hung over their heads you havent said what you think i think everyone who sees you will think you look like a prince of the blood instead of a vegetable peddler someone threw illfitting clothing on and called a prince he chuckled youre right in your sarcastic way i never cared what i looked like wasnt anyone i wanted to impress time to go suppose i go along this once a facetious suggestion to see how he wriggled why not get ready it ought to be amusing seeing her response and instructive the radishas estimate of her brother rose he was not completely smitten i wont be long she was not it took her longer to pass instructions to smokes attendants than to prepare to go out chapter fiftyfive croaker leaned on the lance supporting the company standard wearing his shadar disguise he was bored he was not alert he was depressed he had begun to despair of escape he was ready to say the hell with it and try walking first time a faint chance arose the prahbrindrah drah and soulcatcher chattered and laughed beneath paper lanterns while garden staff came and went they were oblivious to anything but one another the surprise guest the radisha was out in the cold ignored croaker had grumbled about spending so much time on the prince and not enough on preparing soldiers catcher had laughed told him not to worry she would be true to him forever this was just politics he would not be able to resist her much longer she had him on the run desperate on the brink of surrender once he did that she would have won everything maybe he should maybe once she counted that final coup she would just go away back north where her prospects were so much finer she talked about going north sometimes being her companion was cruel she had made of him something more than spoil she talked about the soulcatcher inside sometimes when what she had chosen to be became too much to bear in those moments when she was human he was most vulnerable in those moments he wanted to comfort her he was sure the moments were genuine not tactical her approach to conquest was not subtle brooding it took him a while to notice that the radisha was paying him more attention than a bodyguard deserved she was not obvious but she was subjecting him to intense scrutiny it startled him disturbed him then just left him curious why some flaw in his disguise no way to tell hed never seen the man he was supposed to be he started thinking about what lady might be doing what relationships she might be forming was there yet another level to catchers vengeance did she not only want to seduce him and rape his heart but want lady to find someoneso she could then let her know he was alive after all weird people all this for little pains relatively little pains maybe not so little to them who in their ways were demigods maybe to them love was more significant than to mere mortals the radisha was damned near staring at him she frowned like someone trying to recall a face he had little to lose he winked her eyebrows rose her only reaction but she did not study him anymore she pretended interest in her brother and the woman he thought was lady croaker resumed brooding lost in his own inner landscapes he did not notice the crows departing one by one though she had the greater capacity catcher did not show off the way lady did the coach was dull and quiet croaker beside the driver clutched his lance and wondered what they were talking about below the prince and his sister had accepted a ride because the skies had begun to leak again the drizzle suited his mood perfectly the driver said ho croaker glimpsed the sudden glow in an alleyway now drawing abreast as he turned a blinding fistsized ball of pink fire shot out smashed into the lefthand door of the coach a second ripped out behind it hit the front of the coach flared brilliantly the horses broke loose leaving the vehicle a third ball hit the coach shattered a rear wheel the coach heeled over almost to the point of toppling croaker jumped the countermomentum of his kickoff was just enough to stop the tipping as the coach crashed back he hit the street on the side away from the alley men charged out of that alley croaker ripped open the coach door catcher and the radisha were unconscious the prince was dazed but awake croaker grabbed his pretty suit and yanked up above the driver cried out croaker charged around the rear of the smoldering coachsmack into what looked like a floating bundle of rags he stabbed with the lance he still clutched the bundle howled croakers blood stilled in his veins there were three men with the howler they turned on croaker the prince stumbled around the front of the coach dandys sword drawn he cut one of those men from behind the howler screamed he waved both hands wildly croaker stabbed him again the whole street boomed and rocked croaker was flung back against the coach thought he felt ribs give way the boom seemed to echo endlessly up and down a deep canyon his last clear thought was not again hed just gotten over a serious injury people were scurrying around like panicky mice when croaker recovered the radisha knelt over her brother the more collected bystanders had dragged the attackers away two seemed to be dead a third badly injured croaker got to his knees pressed fingers against his ribs pain answered but it was not the pain of broken bones hed gotten through it with bruises he pushed toward the radisha asked how bad is he just unconscious i think i dont see any wounds she did not look at him there was shouting way up the street belated help was on its way croaker looked into the coach soulcatcher was gone howler was gone he took her the radisha looked up her eyes widened you i thought there was something familiar soulcatchers spells had perished he was himself now where is she that thing that attacked us a sorcerer called the howler as powerful and nasty as the shadowmasters working for them now did he take her i think so damn he lowered himself gingerly recovered the lance used it to support himself you people get out of here go home youre in the way wait did anyone see what happened a few witnesses confessed he demanded the thing that fled where did it go the witnesses indicated the alley using the lance as a crutchhe had a badly twisted ankle to go with the bruised ribshe hobbled into the alleyway nothing there the howler was gone and catcher with him as he headed back he realized what the absence of catchers spells meant he was free for a while he was free the prahbrindrah drah was sitting up the onlookers realizing their prince had been attacked were turning ugly threatening the attacker who had survived croaker bellowed back off we need him alive i said go home thats an order some recognized him now a voice said its the liberator the title had been bestowed by public acclaim when he and the company had undertaken to defend taglios some went some stayed those moved back the racket of help too late drew nearer the prince looked up at croaker in amazement croaker offered him a hand the prince accepted it on his feet he whispered is the disguise part of some grand strategy later the prince must think he had masqueraded as ram all along can you walk lets get off the street before more trouble finds us help arrived in the form of a half dozen palace guards they had been summoned by someone with enough presence of mind to go for them the prince asked someone snatched lady bemused he muttered i guess that was the whole point else wed all be dead thats my guess are they in for a surprise lets get moving as they started walking surrounded by the guards croaker asked where was your pet wizard while all this was happening why the radisha demanded that little shit has been on the shadowmasters payroll for weeks ask him about it the prince said id love to but a demon tried to kill him and almost succeeded hes in a coma wont come back croaker glanced back somebody ought to bring the prisoner he might tell us something useful he would not he had died while no one was looking croaker was amazed at himself taking charge the way he was maybe it was pressure from so many months of helplessness maybe it was urgency brought on by the certainty that he would not have long to grab hold of his destiny the prince had to be right lady had been the object of the attack that meant the bad boys had lost track of her somehow and had thought catcher was her he smiled grimly they would not be prepared for the tiger they had caught how long would catcher toy with them before revealing herself long enough count on nothing hurry he by damned had to grab for all he could get while the opportunity existed croaker finished his story the prince and his sister had listened agape the radisha recovered her poise first shed always had the harder edge way back smoke cautioned us that there might be more going on than met the eye that there might be players in the game we didnt see all eyes turned to the unconscious wizard croaker said prince you used that sticker pretty well tonight think youd have trouble pricking him if he asked for it no trouble at all after what hes done the trouble ill have is not sticking him before we get a story out of him hes not all bad he walked into a trap trying to do what he thought was right his problem is he gets an idea in his head and he cant get it out if its wrong no matter what evidence you hit him with he decided we were the bad guys come back for general mayhem and he just couldnt change his mind probably never will if you execute him hell die thinking hes a hero and martyr who tried to save taglios i think i can waken him when i do you stand by to stick him if he tries any tricks even a puny wizard is deadly when he wants croaker took an hour but did tease the wizard out of lifes twilight and got him to choke out his story afterward the prince asked what can we do even if hes as contrite as he says the shadowmasters have a hold we cant break i dont want to kill him but he is a wizard we couldnt keep him locked up he can stay locked up in his mind youd have to forcefeed him and clean him like a baby but i can put him back into the coma will he heal his body should i cant do anything about what the devil did to his soul smokes past cowardice looked like outrageous courage now do it well deal with him when theres time croaker did it chapter fiftysix shadowspinners shadows remained blind to my whereabouts he did not seem able to adjust and his bats were useless were in fact extinct in that part of the world where my band stole through the night i signalled a halt a mile from where my scouts said spinner had established his camp we had come a long way in a short time we needed rest narayan settled beside me he plucked at his rumel whispered mistress im of a divided mind most of me really believes the goddess wants me to do this that it will be the greatest thing ive ever done for her but im scared you make that sound shameful i havent been this frightened since my first time this isnt your ordinary victim the stakes are higher than youre used to i know and knowing wakens doubts of my ability of my worthiness even of my goddess he seemed ashamed to admit that too she is the greatest deceiver of all mistress it amuses her sometimes to mislead her own and while this is a great and necessary deed even i who was never a priest notice that the omens have not been favorable oh i had noticed no omens good or bad the crows mistress they havent been with us tonight i had not noticed i had grown that accustomed to them i assumed they were there whether i saw them or not he was right there were no crows anywhere that meant something probably something important i could not imagine their master allowing me freedom from observation for even a minute and their absence was not my doing and i doubted it was shadowspinners i hadnt noticed narayan thats interesting personally its the best omen ive seen in months he frowned at me worry not my friend youre narayan the living legend the sainttobe youll do fine i shifted from cant to standard taglian blade swan ready lead on my lovely swan said ill follow you anywhere the more stressed he became the more flip he was i looked them over blade swan ram narayan the two armholders seven of us as swan had observed the obligatory number for a company on quest a totally mixed bag by his own standards each was a good person by the standards of others everyone excepting swan was a villain lets go then before i grew too philosophical we did not have to talk about it we had rehearsed farther away there would be no chatter to alert shadowspinner it was a slovenly encampment it screamed demoralization but for spinner my ragbag army could have beaten those shadowlanders and they knew it they were waiting for the hammer to fall we passed within yards of pickets who sat facing a fire and grumbling their language resembled taglian i could understand them when they were not excited they were demoralized all right they were discussing men they knew who had deserted there seemed to be a lot of those and plenty of sentiment for following their example narayan had the point he trusted no one else to find his way he came sliding into the hollow where we waited in a whisper that did not carry three feet he told me there are prisoners in a pen to the left there taglian several hundred i turned that over in my mind how could i use them there was potential for a diversion there but i did not need one did you talk to them no they might have given us away yes well stick to the mission narayan went ahead he found us another lurking place i began to sense shadowspinners nearness he did not radiate much energy for a power of his magnitude till then i had been sure only that he was in the camp over there the big tent narayan asked i think we moved closer i saw that shadowspinner felt no need for guards maybe he thought he was his own best guard maybe he did not want anyone that close while he was asleep we crouched in a pool of darkness a dozen feet from the tent one fire burned on its far side no light came from within i eased my blade out of its scabbard blade swan ram be ready to cover us if something goes wrong hell if anything went wrong we were dead and we all knew it mistress ram protested his voice threatened to rise stay put ram and dont give me an argument wed had the argument already he did not give up i moved forward narayan and his armholders drifted with me so did the smell of fear i paused two feet from the tent drew my blade down the canvas it cut without a whisper an armholder widened the slash enough for narayan to slip through the other followed i went next then the first armholder it was dark in there narayan held us in place with a touch he was a patient hunter more so than i could have been in his place knowing the moon was about to rise and rape away the darkness its foreglow had been visible as wed approached the tent narayan started moving slowly certainly disturbing nothing his armholders were as good as he i could not hear their breathing i had to rely on extraordinary senses to keep from stumbling over things i felt the shadowmasters presence but could not pin it down narayan seemed to know where to go there had to be hangings ahead no light from the fire outside reached us how i wished for some light light i got unexpectedly just enough light to unveil the awful truth shadowspinner was off to our left seated in the lotus position watching us through a grim beast mask welcome he said his voice was like a snakes hiss it was feeble it barely carried ive been waiting so the shadows had not been fooled after all he guessed my thoughts not the shadows dorotea senjak i know how you think soon i shall know all that is inside your head you arrogant bitch you thought you could take me with three unarmed men and a sword i said nothing there was nothing to say narayan started to move i gestured slightly a stranglers signal he froze there was a chance if shadowspinner truly believed these men unarmed then i spoke if you think you know me then you dont know me at all i wanted him closer i wanted him where narayan could reach him dark mother mother kina listen thy daughter calls my mother attend me he did not move he hit me with something invisible that knocked me back ten feet and tore a groan out of me the discipline shown by narayan and his armholders astonished me they did not rush shadowspinner they did not come to me and separate themselves farther from their target they moved only slightly so they were better balanced and disposed their adjustment barely perceptible shadowspinner rose slowly a man in pain he slipped a crutch beneath one arm yes a cripple with no chance for repairs because my only ally wont lend me help he might regret when he decides ive outlived my usefulness and i have you to thank he extended a hand an almost invisible rope of indigo fire snaked from his fingers to me he made a pulling gesture the rope dragged me forward the pain was intense i contained my scream barely he wanted me to scream he wanted me to waken the camp so he could show his incompetents what he had accomplished despite their inattention he wanted to play cat and mouse the wall of the tent behind him exploded inward two blades ripped canvas and ram came flying through shadowspinner turned ram smashed into him sent him stumbling toward narayan narayan and his armholders moved like mongooses striking narayan had his rumel around the shadowmasters throat so fast my eyes insisted it was witchcraft the armholders had the shadowmasters limbs extended before he lost momentum the purple rope ripped away from me it lashed one of the armholders the mans eyes grew huge he stifled a scream and tried to hang on but lost his grip shadowspinner whipped the rope at narayan narayans eyes bugged he lost his grip on his rumel shadowspinner turned on the other armholder ram grabbed shadowspinner from behind by the neck and buttocks and hoisted him overhead shadowspinner lashed at him he did not seem able to feel pain he dropped to one knee smashed the shadowmaster down on the other i heard bones break the world would have heard an earthshaking scream if narayan had not been so good with a rumel he looped shadowspinners neck on the fly as ram hurled him down falling with spinner he had a tight loop on when the cry tried to force its way out ram and narayan both hung on blade stepped inside the tent casually drove his blade through shadowspinners heart i know you people have your ways but lets not take chances there is an incredible vitality in someone like shadowspinner blade was right even stabbed several times and thoroughly strangled back broken shadowspinner kept struggling ram narayan and both armholders hung on i stepped up and helped blade cut and stab swan stood outside the gap in the tent and gawked so rattled he could do nothing but keep watch poor swan war and violence just were not his thing we carved shadowspinner into a half dozen pieces before he stopped struggling we stood around the results all of us were covered with blood nobody seemed inclined to do anything but pant and wonder if wed really succeeded narayan who seldom showed any humor broke the spell am i a strangler saint now mistress three times over youre immortal wed better get out of here everybody grab a piece swan made a choked questioning noise i told him the only way to make sure is burn him to ash and scatter the ashes someone like longshadow could bring him back even now swan dumped his last meal even so he looked shamed as though he thought he had contributed nothing i picked up spinners head as i passed i winked and gave swans hand a squeeze that should take his mind off his troubles the moon was up it was a day short of full barely over the horizon it was an orange monster i gestured for the others to hurry while there were still shadows to mask our going we were halfway to the perimeter when a terrible howl rolled down out of the night something wobbled across the face of the moon another howl tore the night there was deadly agony in it ram shoved me got to run mistress got to run all around us shadowlander soldiers rose to see what the racket was chapter fiftyseven croaker glanced at the moon as he entered the city barracks not four hours had passed since the attack but already all taglios knew the shadowmasters had struck at the prahbrindrah drah the city was united in outrage already the city knew that the liberator was alive that he had feigned death in order to lead their enemies into a fatal mistake the military compound was swamped with men who wanted to rampage through the shadowlands till not a blade of grass survived it would not last he could do nothing with this illarmed and untrained horde but for their sakes he ordered them to assemble at the fortress lady had begun then move south in forces of five thousand they could sort themselves out on the road he suspected most would change their minds before they reached ghoja however strong their rage they did not have the supporting resources to mount a vengeance campaign but he knew they would not listen so told them what they wanted to hear and stood aside the prahbrindrah drah accompanied him the prince was in a rage himself but a rage channelled by realism croaker discharged his duties to those who wanted him to be larger than life then found the horses that had pulled the coach while they were being prepared he stamped around the barracks gathering equipment and supplies nobody questioned him wouldbe soldiers stared at him like he was a ghost he took a bow and black arrows from hiding soulcatcher had brought them out of dejagore with his armor these were a gift a long time ago before i was anything but a physician theyve served me well i save them for special times special times are here an hour later the two left the city the prince wondered aloud if he had made the right choice outarguing his sister about joining croaker croaker told him turn back if you want we dont have time to examine our hearts and dither over choices before you go though tell me where lady sent those archers which archers the ones who killed the priests i know her she wouldnt have kept them with her she wouldve sent them somewhere out of the way vehdnabota to guard the ford then we ride to vehdnabota or i do if youre going home im coming with you chapter fiftyeight there was no escape from the shadowlander camp we were trapped and i did not know what to do ram said be kina big gentle slow ram he thought faster than i did it was a task of illusion only slightly more difficult than making witchfires run over armor it took just a minute to transform both of us meantime the shadowlanders closed in though not with the enthusiasm you would expect of men who had caught their enemies flatfooted i raised shadowspinners head high they recognized it i used an augmentation spell to make my voice carry the shadowmaster is dead i have no quarrel with you but you can join him if you insist swan had an impulse he bellowed kneel you swine kneel to your mistress they looked at him a foot taller than the tallest of them pale as snow goldenmaned a demon in mans form they looked at blade almost as exotic they looked at me and at shadowspinners head ram said kneel to the daughter of night he was so close i could feel him shaking he was scared to death the child of kina is among you beg for her mercy swan grabbed the nearest shadowlander forced him to his knees i still do not believe it the bluff worked one by one they knelt narayan and his armholders started chanting they chose something basic repeated mantras of a sort common in gunni ceremonials and shadar services they differed mainly in including lines like show mercy o kina bless thy devoted child who loves thee and come to me o mother of night while blood is upon my tongue sing swan bellowed sing you scum typically swan he roared around forcing the slow to kneel and the mute to cry out his actions were not sane sane men do not force enemies who outnumber them a thousand to one they should have torn us apart the thought never occurred to them we are a feebleminded species blade observed in wonder but youll have to keep escalating or theyll start thinking get me water lots of water i held the shadowmasters head high and shouted for silence the devil is dead the shadowmaster is cast down you are free you have won the countenance of the goddess she has blessed you though you have turned your faces away for generations though you have denied and reviled her but your hearts know the truth and she blesses you i raised the intensity of my witchfire showmanship became a fire with a face she has given you freedom but no gift is free blade brought a waterskin i need a goblet too i whispered keep the water out of sight i continued trying to generate a state of hysteria that was less difficult than reason suggested it should be the shadowlanders were tired terrified hated the shadowmasters narayan led another singalong blade brought me a goblet from shadowspinners tent i prepared it the spell was difficult but once again i achieved an unexpected success i knew the water in the goblet was water it tasted like water when i took a drink i drink the blood of my enemy to the shadowlanders it looked like blood when narayan and his armholders started using it to smear marks on shadowlander foreheads i invested those marks with the power to stick those men would bear the stain of blood as long as they lived they even put up with that a lot of them a lot decided to try their legs and headed for home after a few hundred had been marked i ordered the shadowlander officers to join me several score did so but most had chosen to stretch their legs their class was more committed to the shadowmasters than were the rank and file i told the shadowlander officers there is a price for freedom as theres a price for everything you are mine now you owe kina she asks one task of you they did not ask what they wondered if they had been stupid to stay continue to beleaguer dejagore but dont fight the men trapped there take them prisoner when they try to escape expecting only those called the nar theyre enemies of the goddess that was what they had been doing anyway i learned the flooding had played havoc with what food stores remained in the city mogabas rationing ignored the natives disease was rampant the natives had revolted already mogaba had thrown hundreds from the wall to drown the lake swarmed with corpses such draconian measures had cost mogaba the support of many of his soldiers they had begun deserting thus the prisoners in the camp stockade there had been nothing but silence from that stockade maybe the prisoners did not know what was happening maybe they were scared to attract attention i sent blade to let them out and tell them where to find mather if the shadowlanders did not stop me id have to accept this absurd twist as real they did not raise a murmur at dawn they marched off to take their posts in the hills narayan sidled up wearing his biggest grin have you doubts yet mistress doubts about what kina have we her countenance or not we have somebodys ill take kina i havent seen anything this unlikely since my husband i wouldnt believe it if i wasnt here they have lived under the shadowmasters for a generation theyve never been permitted to do anything but what theyre told to do penalties for disobedience were terrible that was part of it so was the will to defy oppression and maybe kina had something to do with it too i did not intend looking the gift horse in the mouth the majority of the prisoners had gone i had had two held to interview i told narayan ill see sindhu and murgen now they came sindhu remained sindhu wide and stolid and brief he told me what he had seen he told me we had friends there they would stay in place ready to serve their goddess he told me mogaba was a stubborn man who meant to hang on to the last man who did not care that dejagore had become a hell of disease and hunger murgen told me mogaba wants a place in the annals hes like croaker was about throwing up times when the company suffered worse murgen was about thirty he reminded me of croaker he was tall lean permanently sad he had been the company standardbearer and croakers understudy as annalist in the normal course twenty years down the road he might have become captain why did you desert it was not the sort of thing he would do regardless of his opinion of his commander i didnt oneeye and goblin sent me to find you they thought i could get through they were wrong they didnt give me enough help oneeye and goblin were minor sorcerers old as sin perpetually at loggerheads together with murgen they were the last of the black company from the north the last of those who had elected croaker captain and made me his lieutenant we talked he told me the men we had recruited coming south were disaffected with mogaba he said hes trying to make the company over into crusaders he doesnt see it as a warrior brotherhood of outcasts he wants it to be a bunch of religious warriors sindhu interjected they worship the goddess mistress they think but their heresies are revolting they are worse than disbelief why was he incensed a prolonged exchange failed to illuminate me no godless person can comprehend those minute distinctions in doctrine that provide true believers excuse for mayhem it is hard enough to accept the fact that they really believe the nonsense of their faiths i always wonder if they are pulling my leg with a straight race those two gave me a lot to digest i tried but it was morning sleep or no sleep it was time to be sick i was sick chapter fiftynine longshadows insubstantial messengers warned him of howlers return long before howler appeared he went to howlers landing place to wait he waited and waited and grew troubled had the little ragbag undertaken some treachery at the last instant no shadows said no he was coming he was coming he was slow he was in mortal agony never had he endured such pain never had he suffered so long pain obliterated consciousness all that remained was will supported by immense talent he knew only that he had to go on that if he yielded to the pain he would tumble from the sky and end his life in the wastes he screamed till his throat was raw till he could scream no more and the poison continued spreading through his old flesh eating him alive raising the level of pain he was lost none could save him but one who wanted him destroyed the blazing crystaltopped towers of overlook rose above the horizon howler was but a few leagues away shadows said barely able to keep moving he had the woman but was otherwise alone it began to make sense howler had had to fight senjak had been stronger than anticipated let howler get her here let howler manage that once he had the woman he would have no more need of the howler the womans knowledge would be enough then shadows came from somewhere far away frolicking in with news that had him cursing before he heard the half shadowspinner slain killed by the devotees of that mad goddess senjak had claimed was there no end to the bad news could not two good things happen in succession must a triumph always presage a disaster stormgard was lost shadowspinners host would evaporate like the dew half the shadow empires armed strength would disappear before sunset those ragged remnants of the black company would come out of the city that madman who led them would pursue his insane quest but he had senjak he had a living library of every power and evil ever conceived by the mind of man once he broached that cask nothing on earth could deny him he would be more powerful than even she had been the equal of her husband at his zenith there were things locked in her head she would never use there had been a core of softness to her at her hardest he was not soft he would not discard a tool he would rule his empire would dwarf the domination and the ladys successor empire the world would be his there was no one in it who could stand in his way no one could match him power for power now with howler crippled and under sentence of death a random crow fluttered by behaving as a normal crow should but its flight brought filth to his lips he had forgotten if only for a moment there was one she was loose out there somewhere the howlers carpet came wobbling down howlers gurgling agony preceding it it plunged the last dozen feet collapsed longshadow cursed again another tool broken the woman unconscious tumbled off she lay still snoring howler tumbled too and did not stop moving when he stopped rolling his body jerked convulsively a whine poured from him between attempts to scream a cold chill crept longshadows spine senjak could not have done this a poisonous sorcery of tremendous potency was gnawing at the little wizard it was so powerful he could not defeat it alone there was something terrible loose in the world he knelt he rested his hands on howler forcing down his loathing he reached inside and fought the poison and pain it retreated a little he pushed himself it retreated farther the respite gave howler strength to join the struggle together they fought it till it receded far enough for howler to regain his reason the little sorcerer gasped the lance they have the lance i did not sense it her bodyguard stabbed me twice longshadow was too shocked to curse the lance was not lost the enemy had it he croaked do they know what they have they had not before only the mad captain in stormgard knew what it was if they learned the truth i dont know howler squeaked he started shaking again dont let me die the lance take one weapon away and they found another fate was a fickle bitch longshadow said i wont let you die he had meant to until that moment but they had the lance he would need every tool he could find he shouted at his servants bring him inside hurry throw her into the keystone cell put shadows in there with her he cursed again it would be a long time before he could tap that cask of knowledge it would be a long battle saving howler the poison eating howler was the most potent in this world because it was not of this world if legends were true he glanced southward at the plain of glittering stone shimmering in mornings light someday the lance had come out of there in ancient times it was a toy compared to what lay there still ready to be take up by him who had the will to seize it someday chapter sixty i invested six days arranging my own investure of dejagore fewer than six thousand men remained of the three great armies shadowspinner had gathered half those men were substandard for various reasons i strung them along the shores of the lake my own men i posted behind them then i sent murgen back to the city he did not want to go i did not blame him mogaba might execute him but somebody had to go to the survivors and let them know they could come out he was to tell everyone but mogabas loyalists my own people did not understand i did not explain they had no need to know they needed to carry out orders the night after murgen left several dozen taglian soldiers deserted from the city their reports were not pleasant disease was worse mogaba had executed hundreds more natives and a dozen of his own troops only the nar were not grumbling mogaba knew murgen was back suspected he had seen me and was hunting him hed had a bitter confrontation with the company wizards over the standardbearer mutiny was in the offingunless the desertions absorbed that energy that would be a first nowhere in the annals was there a record of a mutiny narayan grew more nervous by the hour as he worried about his delayed festival frightened i would try to evade it i kept reassuring him theres plenty of time we have the horses well go as soon as we have this set also i wanted some idea what was happening south of us id sent cavalry to see what effect news of spinners fate was having little information had come back yet the night before narayan ram and i headed north six hundred men deserted mogaba and swam or rafted out of dejagore i had them greeted as heroes with promises of important positions in new formations shadowspinners head with the brain removed and destroyed greeted them at the entrance to my camp it would be our totem in days to come in lieu of the missing company standard six hundred in one night mogaba would be livid his loyalists would make it difficult for that to happen again i gathered my captains such as they were blade theres something i have to do up north narayan and ram will go with me id hoped to know more about the south before i left but we have to take what we get i doubt longshadow will do anything soon keep your patrols out and sit tight i shouldnt be gone but two weeks three if i visit taglios to report our success you might reorganize now that we have some real veterans joining us and consider integrating any shadowlanders interested in enlisting they could be helpful blade nodded he had few words to waste even now swan looked at me with a sort of soulful longing i winked suggesting his time would come im not sure why i had no reason to lead him on i did not mind him remaining attached to the radisha maybe i was attracted he was the best of the crop in his way but i did not want to stumble into that trap again the heart is a hostage the old saw says better not to give it up narayan was happier once we rode out i was not thrilled but i needed his brotherhood i had plans for them shadowspinner might be dead but the struggle had just begun longshadow and howler had to be faced and all the armies they could call up and if those failed at every confrontation in the field there was still longshadows fortress at shadowcatch rumor had overlook tougher than my own tower at charm had been and getting tougher every day i did not look forward to the struggle despite the luck id had taglios was not ready for that kind of fight maybe luck had bought me time enough to raise my legions and train them to mount leisurely expeditions to find capable commanders to retrain myself in the use of my lost skills my immediate goals had been attained taglios was in no immediate danger i had my base i was in undisputed command and unlikely to have more trouble with the priests or mogaba with care i could lock up the stranglers as an adjunct to my will an invisible arm able to dispense death anywhere someone defied me my future looked rosy the biggest potential nuisance was the wizard smoke and he could be handled rosy positively rosy except for the dreams and the sickness both of which were getting worse except for my beloved sister will lady the will will reign triumphant my husband had said that often confident that nothing could resist his will he had believed that right up to the moment i killed him chapter sixtyone croaker trotted his mount into the garrison encampment above vehdnabota ford which was a minor crossing of the main used mostly by locals and open only a few months each year he dismounted handed his reins to a gaping soldier who had recognized the prahbrindrah drah the prince needed help dismounting the ride had been hell for him croaker had shown no mercy the ride had been little better for him you really do this for a living the prince groaned his sense of humor had survived croaker grunted sometimes you cant waste time its not like this all the time id rather be a farmer walk around work out the stiffness that will irritate the sores ill put ointment on after we talk to whoevers in charge the soldier now held both horses and stared by now others had recognized them word flew around like swallows dipping and darting an officer loped out of the only permanent structure in the compound gathering his clothing around him his eyes bugged he dropped onto his face before his prince the prahbrindrah drah snapped get up im in no mood for that the officer rose murmuring honorifics the prince grumbled forget me im just following him talk to him the officer turned to croaker im honored liberator we thought you dead i thought i was too for a while and i need to get that way again the prince and i are joining your company were not being watched now but well be hunted soon by a distant and wicked eye he was sure the search had not yet begun because no crows had chased them during their ride when the search passes this way we want to be indistinguishable from your soldiers youre in hiding more or less croaker explained some he stretched the truth some bent it some made it clear that powerful enemies wanted to find him and that the fate of taglios could hinge on their remaining anonymous till they joined lady at dejagore first thing you do he told the officer is make sure none of your men speak to anyone outside the camp our presence isnt to be discussed at all our enemies have spies everywhere most arent human a stray dog a bird a shadow could carry tales every man has to understand that we cant be discussed well take different names and become ordinary troopers i dont quite understand sir i dont think i can explain take us being here as proof im back escaped from captivity and i need to reach the main army i cant alone even disguised do you have men who know how to ride a few possibly puzzled these horses have to be returned to the new fortress hopefully before the hunt starts theyre a dead giveaway their riders should make no stops and should disguise themselves we dont want them identified with this company croaker had not discussed plans while travelling because someone might hear but the prince got the drift quickly youre going to march this company down to dejagore yes you and i will be archers in the ranks the prince groaned i have less experience walking than riding and i have a tender ankle we wont push while croaker talked his gaze darted seeking the potential listener he continued talking to the officer again and again he tried to drive home the need for the archers to keep quiet about their mission till they found ladys army one slip could kill them all he made it sound like the shadowmasters had all their men and demons out trying to destroy him and the prince and anyone with them true in theme anyway the officer rounded up volunteers to return the stallions impressed them with the need to deliver the animals rapidly without telling anyone where croaker and the prince had gone he sent them off croaker sighed i feel safer already get me a turban and some shadar clothes and something to darken my hands and face prince you look more gunni half an hour later they were ordinary archers except for accents croaker became narayan singh half the shadar alive were narayan singh the prince adopted the name abu lal cadreskrah he felt it would shield him from scrutiny because it suggested mixed vehdna and gunni parentage which could only mean that his mother had been a gunni prostitute no one in his right mind would think the prahbrindrah drah could demean himself that far croaker chuckled maybe so get some rest use that horse liniment well pull out as soon as we get stores and transport together a day and a half later grimly silent ready for anything the archers crossed the river croaker grew more fearful and excited by the hour how would lady react when he turned up alive he was scared of the answer chapter sixtytwo longshadow did without sleep for six days while he fought the sorcery gnawing at howlers flesh and soul he triumphed but barely then he collapsed shadowcatch was an old old city forever in the looming shadow of glittering stone it was a repository for much ancient lore much known nowhere else much known only to longshadow who had plundered its libraries and had disposed of everyone who shared any knowledge he coveted among the legends of the plain which had been old when the city had been founded was one about the lances of passion it said their heads had been forged of metal taken from the sword of a demon king devoured by kina during the great battle between light and shadow that demon kings soul was imprisoned in the steel fragmented amongst eight lance heads he could not be restored while kina slept the shafts of the lances too were the object of legend two were supposed to have been formed from the thighbones of kina herself taken after she had been tricked into endless sleep one was supposedly the penis of the regent of shadow that kina had hacked off during the great battle the rest were supposed to be of wood from the tree in which the goddess of brotherly love rhavilemna had hidden her soul shortly before the wolves of shadow ran her down and devoured her soon after man was created kina had witnessed the concealment and had torn up the tree and had made it into arrows and lance shafts if ever the lords of light did bring rhavilemna together again out of the bellies of the hateful wolves she would have no soul and they could not get that back for her while kina lay sleeping each of the outbound free companies of khatovar had followed one of the lances when they had broken into the world to bring on the year of the skulls but who had sent them forth longshadow could not be sure the ghostspirit of sleeping kina the lords of light who would restore rhavilemna the children of the demon king who remained imprisoned in those lance heads while she slept the regent of shadow weary of being at a disadvantage in the lists of love the librarians of old recorded the return of all the companies but one the black company which lost its own past and wandered aimlessly down the centuries till it elected a captain eager to seek out its roots longshadow knew very little about the lances but he did know more than anyone else alive howler and catcher suspected some no one else had a hint that the black companys standard was anything but an old artifact that had survived for centuries till it vanished during the battle at dejagore only to resurface in taglios in the hands of a bodyguard its recovery was high among longshadows priorities he would send for it as soon as howler recovered he would devote his own time to harvesting the knowledge of his captive but first he slept having conquered the howlers wounds chapter sixtythree it took the imp frogface five days to locate his mistress then he waited till the attention of overlooks master lapsed before he made his way inside he entered with trepidation longshadow was a powerful sorcerer dreaded in the demon worlds his entry disturbed no one overlooks defenses were meant to stop shadows from the south he found his mistress in a dark cell beneath the fortresss roots her drugged mind in a cell of its own deep inside her brain he debated he could forget her he could help and maybe win his freedom freeing her was not within the specific orders she had given him he stretched out beside her bit a hole in her throat drank her blood he cleansed it and returned it she wakened slowly sensed what he was doing let him finish he closed the wound she sat up in the darkness the howler where am i overlook why they mistook you for your sister she laughed bitterly my act was too good yes where is she last seen near dejagore i hunted you for a week and they couldnt see her shes getting stronger what about croaker ive been hunting you find him i want him back i cant let him reach my sister do anything you have to to stop that im forbidden to take life anything else then but keep them apart you dont need help here ill handle youre free to roam here pretty much parts are sealed behind spells only longshadow can penetrate search the place tell me what everyone is doing then find croaker and my sister the imp sighed so much for gratitude she caught the sense of the sound do it right and youre free forever right im gone she waited for her captors to come receive their surprise as she waited she heard the whispers of darkness carrying from the nearby plain she caught some of what was said began to taste the fear that plagued longshadow she could not just sit there like a trapdoor spider waiting longshadow and howler were sleeping she should go the very stones of overlook had been hardened against sorcery she melted her way out for those stones would melt before they yielded the lower levels were dark surprising longshadow feared the dark she climbed slowly wary of ambushes but she encountered no one she grew nervous as she approached the light nothing waited there either apparently was the fortress deserted something was wrong she extended her senses still detected nothing onward and upward and more nothing where were the soldiers there should be thousands constantly scurrying like blood in the veins she spied a way out she had to descend a stairway to reach it she was halfway down when the attack came a wave of little brown men carrying cruel halberds wearing armor of wood and strange ornate animal helmets she had a spell prepared a summoning that taxed her limits she struck a pose loosed it it broke a hole in the fabric of everything sparks of ten thousand colors flew something huge and ugly and hungry started through tearing the hole wider steel left no mark upon its snout its snarls chilled the blood it ripped itself out of the womb of elsewhere and flew after the garrison men screamed it ran faster than they did soulcatcher walked out into the night blanketing overlook that will keep them busy she looked north angry a long walk lay ahead of her chapter sixtyfour the bridge i had wanted built was incomplete but we did cross on foot while soldiers brought our mounts across by the ford my move was symbolic meant to lend encouragement to the engineers narayan was impressed and ram was indifferent except to say it was nice to cross the river without getting his feet wet he did not see the implications of a bridge because i was sick it took longer to reach ghoja than i anticipated we were pressed for time narayan rode the edge of panic but we reached the holy grove late the evening before the ceremonies i was exhausted i told narayan you handle the arrangements i cant do anything more he looked at me concerned ram said you must see a physician mistress soon ive decided to when were done here we head north i cant take this much longer the rains the season would start soon if we dallied in taglios we would return to the main after it started rising already there were scattered showers every day the bridge is there we might have to leave our mounts but we can get across narayan nodded curtly ill talk to the priests see that she rests ram initiation can be stressful that was the first i had heard it hinted that i was expected to go through the same initiation ceremony as everyone else it irked me but i was too tired to protest i just lay there while ram borrowed fire and rice and prepared a meal several jamadars came to pay their respects ram warned them off no priests came by then i had sunk into a lassitude so deep i did not bother to ask ram if that was significant i caught movement from the corner of an eye a watcher where none should be i turned caught a glimpse of a face that was no deceiver i had not seen that face since before the fighting that had cost me croaker frogface they called him an imp what was he doing here i could not catch him i was way too weak nothing i could do but keep him in mind i fell asleep as soon as id eaten drums wakened me they were drums with deep voices the kind men sound by pounding with fists or palms boom boom boom no respite ram told me they would not let up till next dawn other drums with deeper voices joined them i peered out of the crude leanto ram had built for me one was not far away the man pounding the drum used padded mallets with handles four feet long there was one such drum at each of the winds four quarters more drums throbbed within the temple ram assured me it had been cleansed and sanctified i did not much care i was as sick as ever i had been my night had been filled with the darkest dreams yet dreams in which the whole world suffered from advanced leprosy the smell lingered in my nostrils worsening the sickness ram had anticipated my condition maybe he had watched me in my sleep predicting my sickness from how i rested i dont know but he put up a crude privacy screen so i would not become a public entertainment i was past the worst when narayan came if you dont go see a physician after this ill personally drag you to taglios mistress theres no reason not to take the time i will i will you can count on it i do youre important to me youre our future chanting began in the temple why is it different this time so much to crowd in ceremonial obligations and initiations you wont have to do anything till tonight rest and youll rest again tomorrow if the ceremony wears you out just lying around nothing to do that was a strain itself i could not recall a time when id had nothing to do but lie around once i got control of my nausea i tried to extend and stretch my talents they were coming back almost of their own accord i was capable of more than i suspected i was close to being a match for the wizard smoke now good news must be balanced by bad i suppose my elation died when i looked up from cupped palms and found myself caught in a dream right there in broad daylight i could see both the horror of the worst dream and the grove around me neither seemed completely real neither was more substantial than the other i went from the caverns of death to a plain of death i had gone there only rarely i associated that plain with the battle during which kina had devoured hordes of demons a great black figure strode across the plain her movements stylized like gunni dances each step shook the plain i felt the shaking it was as real as an earthquake she wore nothing her shape was not quite human she had four arms and eight breasts each hand clutched something suggestive of death or warfare she wore a necklace of baby skulls from her girdle like bunches of withered bananas hung strings of what i first took to be severed thumbs but which as she stamped closer proved to be more singular and potent male appendages her hairless head was shaped more like an egg than a human head at first it impressed me as insectoid but she had a mouth like that of a carnivore blood dribbled down her chin her eyes were large and filled with fire the stench of old death preceded her that unexpected apparition shook me to the core and from some corner of memory croaker stepped with his irreverent and sarcastic outlook old busybody smells ripe for her centennial bath might even be time for her to brush her teeth the thought was so startling i looked around had someone spoken i was alone it was just a thought in his style loosened by the strain when i looked forward again the apparition had faded i shuddered the smell lingered it was not imaginary a man passing stopped startled he sniffed looked odd hurried off i shuddered again was that how it would be dreams awake and asleep both i shuddered a third time frightened my will was not strong enough to resist that several times during the day the stench came back mercifully the apparition did not accompany it i did not make myself vulnerable by opening channels of power again narayan came when it was time i had not seen him since morning he had not seen me he looked at me oddly i asked whats the matter theres something an aura yes you feel like the daughter of night should feel he became embarrassed the initiations start in an hour i talked to the priests no woman has ever joined us before there are no precedents they decided youll have to face it the way everyone does i take it thats not the candidates stand naked before kina while she judges their worthiness i see to say i was not thrilled would be an understatement though initially my objection was a matter of vanity i looked like hell like a famine victim withering limbs and bloating belly wed seldom eaten well since we had fled from dejagore i gave it some thought it presented me with little choice really if i refused to disrobe i suspected i would not leave the grove alive and i needed the stranglers i had plans for them ill do what has to be done narayan was relieved you wont have to expose yourself to everyone no just to the priests and jamadars and other candidates and whoever is helping put on the show its been arranged there will be six candidates the minimum permitted there will be one high priest his assistant one jamadar as chief strangler with orders to strike down any chanter who raises his eyes from the floor you may pick those three men yourself if you like odd why so thoughtful narayan whispered i shouldnt tell you opinion is divided about whether youre the true daughter of night those who do believe expect you to have the priest his assistant and the chief strangler put to death after kina bestows her favor they want to risk the minimum number of men what about the other candidates they wont remember i see ill be among the chanters as your sponsor i see i wondered what would happen to him if i failed i dont care who the priests and strangler are he grinned excellent mistress you must prepare ram help me put the screen up again mistress this is the robe youll wear till you stand before the goddess he handed me a white bundle the robe looked like it had been used for generations without having been mended or cleaned i got ready chapter sixtyfive the temple had changed inside fires burned dull and red around the perimeter their light sent shadows skulking over ugly carvings a huge idol had materialized it was a close representation of the thing from my vision although equipped with an ornate headdress loaded with gold and silver and gemstones the idols eyes were cabochon rubies each a nations ransom its fangs were crystal three heads lay under the idols raised left foot priests were dragging a corpse away when my group of candidates entered the dead man had been tortured before he had been beheaded ten men lay on their faces to the right ten more to the left a fourfoot aisle passed between groups i recognized narayans back the twenty chanted continuously come o kina unto the world and make thy children whole we beseech thee great mother so swiftly the words ran together i was last in line the chief strangler stepped into the aisle behind me black rumel in hand i suspect his main function was to stop a candidate who developed cold feet not to eliminate chanters who peeped twenty feet of clear space lay between the chanters and the dais where the goddess stood the three heads lay at eye level two appeared to watch our approach the third stared at the sole of kinas foot clawed toes inches from its nose two priests stood to my right beside a tall stand supporting several golden vessels the ceremony started out basic each candidate reached a mark and dropped his robe moved to another mark on a line abased himself and murmured a ritual prayer the prayer just petitioned kina to accept the appellant in the last case me as her daughter but when i spoke the words a gust of wind blew through a new presence filled the place it was cold and hungry and carried the smell of carrion the assistant priest jumped this was not customary we candidates rose knelt with our palms resting atop our thighs the head priest ran through some extended rigamarole in a language neither taglian nor deceivers cant he presented us to the idol as though it were kina herself while he yammered his assistant poured dark fluid from a tall spouted container into one like a gravy boat once he stopped chattering the head priest made holy passes over that smaller vessel lifted it presented it to the goddess went to the far end of the line placed the pouring end of the vessel to the candidates lips and filled his mouth the man had his eyes closed he swallowed the next man took his with his eyes open he choked the priest showed no reaction nor did he when two more men did the same my turn narayan was a liar he had prepared me but he had told me it was all illusion this was no illusion it was bloodwith some drug added that gave it a slightly herby bitter taste human blood i do not know our seeing that body dragged away was no accident we were supposed to think about it i got through it id never endured anything like it but id been through terrible things before i neither hesitated nor twitched i told myself i was just minutes from taking control of the most terrible power in this end of the world that presence moved again it might take control of me the chief priest handed the vessel to his assistant who returned it to the stand began to chant the lights went out absolute darkness engulfed the temple i was startled thinking something unusual had happened when no one got excited i changed my mind must be part of the initiation that darkness lasted half a minute midway through a scream rent the air filled with despair and outrage light returned as suddenly as it had gone i was stunned it was hard to take everything in there were only five candidates now the idol had moved its raised foot had fallen crushing one of the heads its other foot had risen the body of the man who had been two to my left lay beneath it his head held by the hair dangled from one of the idols hands before the lights had gone out that hand had clutched a bunch of bones another hand that had clutched a sword still did so but now that blade glistened there was blood on the idols lips and chin and fangs its eyes gleamed how had they managed it was there some mechanical engine inside the idol had the priest and his assistant done the murder they would have had to move fast and i had not heard a sound but the scream the priests seemed startled too the chief priest darted to the pile of robes flung one my way resumed his place ran through one abbreviated chant cried out she has come she is among us praised be kina who has sent her daughter to stand beside us i covered my nakedness the normal flow had been disrupted somehow the results had the priests ecstatic and at the same time at a loss what to do next what do you do when old prophecies come true ive never met a priest who honestly expected miracles in his own lifetime for them miracles are like good wine best when aged they decided to suspend normal business and go straight to the celebration that meant candidates got initiated without standing before kinas judgment it meant human sacrifices forgotten quite unwittingly i saved the lives of twenty enemies of the stranglers scheduled to be tortured and murdered during that night the priests freed them to tell the world that the deceivers were real and had found their messiah that those who did not come to kina soon would be devoured in the year of the skulls a fun bunch of guys croaker would say narayan took me back to our fire where he told ram to drive off anyone with the temerity to bother me he settled me with profuse apologies for not having prepared me better he sat beside me and stared into the flames its come eh i asked after a while he understood its come its finally real now theres no doubt left uhm i left him to his thoughts for a while before i asked how did they do that with the idol narayan what how did they make it move while it was dark he shrugged looked at me grinned feebly said i dont know thats never happened before ive seen at least twenty initiations always one of the candidates is chosen to die but the idol never moves oh i could think of nothing else till i asked did you feel anything in there like something was with us yes he was shivering the night was not cold he said try to sleep mistress we have to get started early i want to get you to that physician i lay me down grimly reluctant to drift off into the land of nightmare but i did not stay awake long i was too exhausted physically and emotionally the last thing i saw was narayan squatting there staring into the flames much to think on narayan much to think on now there was no dreams that night but there was sickness aplenty in the morning i threw up till there was nothing left but bile chapter sixtysix the imp drifted away from the grove the woman had not been hard to find though that had taken longer than he had hoped now for the man nothing for a long long time not a trace he was not in taglios a frantic search produced nothing logic suggested he would search for his woman he would not know her present whereabouts so he would head toward her last known location he was not at the ford there was no sign he had visited ghoja therefore he had not they would be talking about it still as they were talking about him still in taglios no croaker but a whole horde was headed for the ford descending from the city the woman had just missed meeting them headed north a stroke of luck that but there was no way to keep her from learning he was alive not in the long run the prime mission was to keep them apart anyway was he amongst that mob couldnt be their talk would have pointed him out the imp resumed his quest if the man had not crossed at ghoja and was not amongst the horde then he would cross the river elsewhere sneaking he visited vehdnabota last because it seemed the least likely crossing he expected to find nothing there nothing was what he found but this was a significant nothing a company of archers was supposed to be stationed there he tracked those archers and found his man he had to make a decision run to his mistress which would take time because he would have to find heror take steps on his own he chose the latter course the rainy season was fast approaching it might do his job for him they could not get together if they could not cross the river amidst a moonless night the growing ghoja bridge collapsed most of its timberwork washed away the engineers could not figure out what went wrong they understood only that it was too late to rebuild this year any taglian forces not back across before the waters rose would spend half a year on the shadowlander side satisfied the imp went looking for his mistress chapter sixtyseven the archers halted in sight of the taglian main camp were safe now croaker told the prince lets make a proper entrance cavalry had found them two days earlier forty miles north horsemen had visited regularly since yesterday the archers had kept their mouths shut admirably willow swan had led one patrol he had not recognized anyone croaker had had the captain borrow horses the archers transport consisted only of mules enough to carry what the soldiers themselves could not two mounts had arrived an hour ago saddled the prince dressed up as a prince croaker donned what he called his work clothes a warlords outfit given him back when he had been every taglians hero he had not taken it along when he had gone south the first time he dug out the company standard and reassembled it im ready prince whenever the march south had been hard on the prahbrindrah drah but he had endured the hardships without complaint the soldiers were pleased they mounted up and led the archers toward the camp the first crows arrived during that passage croaker laughed at them stone the crows people in beryl used to say that when the company was there i never did figure out what it meant but it sounds like a damned good way to do business the prince chuckled and agreed then faced the greetings of soldiers from the camp who could not decide which of their visitors was more unlikely croaker spied familiar faces blade swan mather hell that looked like murgen it was murgen but nowhere did he spy the face he wanted to see murgen approached in little spurts each halving the distance between himself and his captain croaker dismounted said its me im real i saw you die you saw me hit i was still breathing when you took off oh yeah but the shape you were in its a long story well sit around and talk about it all night get drunk if theres anything drinkable he glanced at swan where swan lighted beer usually appeared here you left this behind when you went off to play widowmaker he shoved the standard at murgen the younger man took it like he expected it to bite but once he had hold of it he ran his hands up and down the shaft of the lance it really is i thought it was lost for sure then its really you alive and in a mood to do some serious asskicking but ive got something else on my mind right now wheres lady blade made a perfunctory acknowledgment of the princes presence said lady went north with narayan and ram eight nine days ago said she had business that couldnt wait croaker cursed swan said nine days ago that really him not somebody fixed up to fool us mather said its him the prahbrindrah drah wouldnt lend himself to any deceit aint that my luck aint that the story of my life just when my future is so bright i have to wear blinders croaker noted a broad stubby man behind blade he did not know the man but recognized personal power this was someone important and someone not thrilled to see the liberator alive he would bear watching murgen stop making love to that thing fill me in on whats been happening ive been out of touch for weeks or months if filtered truths were considered can somebody take this animal so we can all go find some shade there was more confusion in the camp than might have been if longshadow had materialized there the return of a dead man always complicates things without appearing to take particular note croaker noticed that the short wide man stayed close pretending insignificance beside blade swan and mather he never spoke murgen talked about his experiences since the disastrous battle blade told his tale swan tossed in a few dozen anecdotes of his own shadowspinner himself eh croaker asked swan said thats the old boys head on the pole over yonder the field gets narrower murgen said lets hear your story while its still news you going to put it in the annals you been keeping them up embarrassed the younger man nodded only i had to leave them in the city when i came out i understand i look forward to reading the book of murgen if its any good youve got the job for life swan said lady was doing one of them things herself everyone looked at him he wilted some well what she really did was talk about writing one when she got the time i dont think she ever really put anything down she just said how she had to keep some things straight in her head so she could get them down right the obligation of history she called it let me think a minute croaker said he picked up a stone threw it at a crow the bird squawked and fluttered a few feet but did not take the hint it was catchers all right she was back in circulation free or in alliance with her captors after a while croaker observed we have a lot of catching up to do but i suspect the critical business is to end this problem with mogaba how many men does he have left in there maybe a thousand fifteen hundred murgen guessed oneeye and goblin stayed when hes become their enemy they can protect themselves murgen said they dont want to come out here they think theres something waiting to get them they want to sit tight till lady gets her powers back powers back is she nobody mentioned that but he had suspected it for a long time she is blade said not as fast as shed like nothing happens as fast as shed like what are they afraid of murgen shifters apprentice remember her she was there when we got rid of shifter and stormshadow she took off on us they say shes locked into the forvalaka shape but still has her own mind and shes out to get them for killing shifter especially oneeye oneeye had killed the wizard shapeshifter because shifter had killed his brother tomtom long ago the wheel of vengeance turning croaker sighed shes maybe out to get everybody who was involved that angle hasnt come up before i think theyre imagining it you never know with those clowns croaker leaned back closed his eyes tell me more about mogaba murgen had a lot to say croaker observed i always suspected there was more to him than he showed but human sacrifices thats a little much they didnt just sacrifice them they ate them what well their hearts and livers some of them there was only four or five guys really into that with mogaba croaker glanced at the wide man the fellow was indignant to the point of explosion croaker said i guess that explains why geaxle was such a peaceful town if the city guard eats criminals and rebels he chuckled but cannibalism was not humorous you sir we havent been introduced you seem to have strong feelings about mogaba murgen said thats sindhu one of ladys special friends oh what did that mean sindhu said they have abandoned themselves to shadow the true deceiver seldom spills blood he opens the golden path without tempting the goddesss thirst only the blood of an accursed enemy should be spilled only an accursed enemy should be tortured croaker glanced around anybody know what the hell hes talking about swan said your girlfriend is running with some strange characters he chose a northern dialect maybe cordy can explain hes spent more time trying to figure it out croaker nodded i suppose we ought to put an end to this murgen you game to go back again take a message to mogaba i dont want to sound like a slacker captain but not unless its an order he wants to kill me crazy as hes gotten he might try it with you standing right there watching ill get somebody else ill do it swan said mather jumped him its not your no nevermind willow yes it is i got to find out something about myself cordy i wasnt no help when we went after shadowspinner i froze up i want to see if somethings wrong with me mogaba is the guy to show me hes about as spooky as a shadowmaster damned poor thinking willow i never did have any sense ill go captain when you want to do it croaker glanced around anything going on blade any reason we shouldnt walk over and take a look send swan no chapter sixtyeight life is full of surprises i dont mind the little ones they add spice its the big ones that get me i stumbled into a parade of big ones at my new fortress the first thing they did was arrest all three of us and shove us into a cell nobody bothered to explain nobody said anything they seemed surprised i did not go berserk we sat in gloom and waited i was afraid smoke had won his point at last and had turned the prahbrindrah drah against me narayan said maybe id missed a few priests and this was all their fault we did not talk much we used only sign and cant when we did no telling who was listening three hours after we went into the cell the door opened the radisha drah strode in backed by a squad of her guards it got crowded in there she glared at me who are you what kind of question is that lady captain of the black company who should i be she even takes a deep breath kill her the radisha wheeled on ram you stand up faithful ram might not have heard he looked to me i nodded then he stood the radisha grabbed a torch from a guard held it close to ram circled him slowly she sniffed and sniffed after her third circuit she relaxed sit youre who youre supposed to be but the woman who is she that seemed a little too tough for ram he had to think about it he looked at me again i nodded he said she told you she looked at me can you prove youre lady can you prove youre the radisha drah i have no need no one is masquerading as me i got it that bitch she never was short on nerve walked in here and took over eh what did she do the radisha considered some more we have the right one this time guards you may go they went the radisha said she didnt do much mostly played up to my brother she wasnt here that long then somebody called the howler knocked her out and carried her off thinking she was you croaker said ha serves the bitch who said croaker your captain she brought him with her disguised as that one she indicated ram some sort of impenetrable membrane lay between my ears and my heart very carefully before it broke i asked did howler take him too where is he he and my brother went to find you disguised he said she would look for him as soon as she got free of the howler and longshadow my mind slid away from the unbelievable dwelt on crows now i knew why there had been none spying till shortly before we reached the fortress she had been in unfriendly hands he went to dejagore thats my guess my fool brother went with him and i came here i laughed maybe crazily that membrane was giving id appreciate it if everyone would leave i need some time alone the radisha nodded i understand you two come with me narayan rose but ram did not budge i asked will you wait outside ram just for a while yes mistress he went out with the others id bet he did not go five feet past the door before they left narayan started telling the radisha i needed a physician the anger and frustration faded i calmed down thought i understood croaker had been struck down by a random arrow in the confusion his corpse had disappeared only now i knew he had not been a corpse at all and i thought i knew whence that arrow had come my everloving sister just to get even with me for having thwarted her attempt to displace me when id been empress in the north i knew how her mind worked i had evidence she was loose again she would continue to keep us apart and punish me through him she was whole again she had the power to do whatever she willed she had been second only to me when i was at my peak i came as close to despair as ive ever come the radisha invited herself in without knocking a tiny woman in a pink sari accompanied her the radisha said this is doctor dahrhanahdahr her family are all physicians shes my own physician shes the best even her male colleagues admit shes marginally competent i told the woman what i had been suffering she listened and nodded when i was done she told me youll have to disrobe i think i know what it is but ill have to look the radisha stepped to the cell door used her own clothing to cover the viewport ill turn my back if your modesty demands it what modesty i stripped actually i was embarrassed i did not want to be seen looking as bad as i did the physician spent a few minutes examining me i thought so what is it you dont know if i did i wouldve done something about it i dont like being sick at least the dreams had let up since the initiation i could sleep youll have to put up with it a while longer her eyes sparkled that was a hell of an attitude for a physician youre pregnant chapter sixtynine croaker posted himself where he could be clearly seen from the city murgen stood beside him with the standard swan set off in a boat the cavalry had stolen off the banks of the river north of the hills murgen asked you think hell come maybe not himself but somebody will hell want to make sure one way or the other murgen indicated the shadowlander soldiers along the shoreline you know what thats about i can guess mogaba and lady both want to be captain she took care of shadowspinner but thought it might be inconvenient if she told mogaba as long as hes trapped in dejagore hes no problem right stupid nothing like this ever happened before murgen nowhere in the annals can you find a squabble over the succession most captains come in like me kicking and screaming most dont have a holy mission lady and mogaba both do lady shes decided shell do anything to get even with the shadowmasters for killing you thats real sane but it sounds like her looks like swans gotten some attention your eyes are better than mine somebody black is getting in the boat with him would mogaba make up his mind that fast hes sending somebody swans passenger was mogabas lieutenant sindawe an officer good enough to have commanded a legion croaker saluted sindawe the black man returned the salute tentatively is it you indeed in the flesh but youre dead nope just a story spread by our enemies its a long tale maybe we dont have time for it all i hear things arent good over there sindawe guided croaker out of sight of the city settled on a rock im caught on the horns of a dilemma croaker settled facing him winced his ankle had taken a lot of abuse coming south how so my honor is sworn to mogaba as first lord of the nar i must obey but hes gone mad so i gather what happened he was the ideal soldier even when he didnt agree with the way i ran things ambition hes a driven man he became first lord because hes driven among the nar chieftainship was determined by a sort of soldierly athletic contest the allround best man at physical skills became commander he joined your expedition thinking you weak likely to perish quickly he saw no obstacle to his replacing you whereupon he would become one of the immortal stars of the chronicles hes still a good soldier but he does everything for mogabas sake not that of the company or its commission most organizations have mechanisms for handling such problems the mechanism among the nar is challenge combat or contest which is no good here hes still the quickest fastest strongest amongst us hes still the best tactician begging your pardon i never claimed to be a genius i got to be captain cause everybody voted against me i didnt want it but i didnt not want it as badly as everybody else didnt want it but i wont abdicate so mogaba can rack himself up some glory my conscience permits me to say no more even so i feel like a traitor he sent me because weve been like brothers since we were boys im the only man left he trusts i dont want to hurt him but hes hurt us hes blackened our honor and our oaths as guardians sindawes guardians was a nar word for which there was no exact translation it carried implications of an obligation to defend the weak and stand firm in the face of evil i hear hes trying to stir up a religious crusade sindawe seemed embarrassed yes from the beginning some have clung to the dark mother i didnt realize he was one of themthough i should have guessed his ancestors were priests whats he going to do now i cant see him getting excited about me turning up i dont know im afraid hell claim youre not you he may even believe youre a trick of the shadowmasters a lot of men thought they saw you killed even your standardbearer a lot of men saw me hit if anyone questioned murgen closely they know i was alive when he left me sindawe nodded i remain on the horns croaker did not ask what would happen if he tried to eliminate mogaba the nar would fight sindawe included that was not his style anyway he did not eliminate a man because he was a nuisance ill come over and confront him then hell either accept me or he wont itll be interesting seeing where the nar stand if he chooses mutiny youll exact the penalty i wont kill him i respect him hes a great soldier maybe he can continue to be a great soldier maybe not if not hell have to give up his part in our quest sindawe smiled youre a wise man captain ill go tell him and everyone else ill pray the gods remind him of his oaths and honor fine dont dawdle since i dont want anything to do with this ill be over as soon as i can eh if i put off doing something unpleasant i never get around to dealing with it go ill be right behind you chapter seventy longshadow consulted the shadows he had left in the cell with the missing woman then he visited the bedridden howler you idiot you grabbed the wrong woman howler did not respond that was soulcatcher her and whole how had she managed that in a voice little more than a whisper howler reminded you sent me there you insisted senjak was in taglios and what did that have to do with the result you couldnt scout the situation well enough to find out wed been deceived contempt poorly veiled flashed across howlers face he did not argue there was no point longshadow never made a mistake whatever dismayed him it was always anothers fault longshadow pitched a tantrum then he went coldly calm error no error fault no fault the fact is weve made an enemy she wont bear it she was just playing with her sister before now she wont be playing howler smiled he and soulcatcher were not beloved of one another he rasped out shes walking longshadow grunted yes there is that shes in my territories afoot he paced shell hide from my shadow eyes but shell want to watch the rest of the world i wont look for her then ill look for her spies the crows will lead me to her and then i shall test us both howler caught the timbre of daring in longshadows voice he was going to try something dangerous disasters had knocked the daring out of howler his inclinations were toward the quiet and safe that was why he had chosen to build his own empire in the swamps they had been enough and nothing anyone wanted to take away but he had succumbed to seduction when longshadows emissaries had come to him so here he was easing back from the brink of death alive only because longshadow still thought him useful he was not interested in more risks he would return to his sloughs and mangroves happily but till he fashioned some means of flight he would have to pretend interest in longshadows plans nothing dangerous he whispered not at all longshadow lied once i find out where she is the rest is easy chapter seventyone volunteers willing to cross the lake with croaker were few he accepted swan and sindhu rejected blade and mather you two have plenty to do here three of them in a boat croaker rowed the others did not know how sindhu sat in the stern swan in the bow croaker did not want the wide man behind him that might not be wise the man had a sinister air and did not act friendly he was biding his time while he made up his mind about something croaker did not want to be looking the wrong way when that happened halfway across swan asked it serious between you and lady he chose rosean the language of his youth croaker spoke the tongue though he had not used it for years it is on my side i cant say for her why i dont want to stick my hand in where im going to get it bit off i dont bite and i dont tell her what to do yeah it was nice to dream about i figure shell forget im alive as soon as she hears you still are croaker smiled pleased can you tell me anything about this human stump back here i dont like his looks swan talked for the rest of their passage evolving complex circumlocutions to get around nonrosean words sindhu would recognize worse than i thought croaker said as the boat reached the city wall where part had collapsed and left a gap through which the lake poked a finger swan tossed the painter to a taglian soldier who looked like he had not eaten for a week he left the boat croaker followed sindhu followed him croaker noted that swan placed himself so he could watch sindhu the soldier tied the boat up beckoned they followed him he led them to the top of the west wall which was wide and unbroken croaker stared at the city it was nothing like it had been it had become a thousand drunken islands a big island marked its heart the citadel where they had dispatched stormshadow and shapeshifter the nearer islands sprouted spectators he recognized faces waved ragged at first beginning with the surviving nonnar he had brought to taglios a cheer spread rapidly the taglian troops raised their liberator hail swan said i think theyre glad to see you from the looks of the place theyd cheer anybody who might get them out streets had become deep canals the survivors had adapted by building rafts croaker doubted anyone travelled much though the canals were choked with corpses the smell of death was oppressive plague and a madman tormented the city and there was nowhere to dispose of bodies mogaba and his nar came marching around the curve of the wall clad in all their finery here we go croaker said the cheering continued one raft almost awash under the weight of old comrades began laboring toward the wall mogaba halted forty feet away he stared his face and eyes smoldering ice say me a prayer swan croaker moved to meet the man who wanted so badly to be his successor he wondered if he would have to play this out again with lady assuming he survived this round mogaba moved to meet him taking stride for stride they stopped a yard apart youve done wonders with nothing croaker said he rested his right hand upon mogabas left shoulder sudden silence gripped the city ten thousand eyes watched native and soldier alike knowing how much hung on mogabas response to that gesture of comradery croaker waited quietly it was a time when almost anything said would be too much said nothing needed to be discussed or explained everything hinged on mogabas reaction if he reciprocated all was well if not the men looked one another in the eye hot fires burned within mogaba nothing showed on his face but croaker sensed the battle within him his ambition against a lifetime of training and the obvious will of the soldiers their cheers made their sentiments clear mogabas struggle went on twice his right hand rose fell back twice he opened his mouth to speak then bit down on ambitions tongue croaker broke eye contact long enough to examine the nar he tried to send an appeal help your chieftain sindawe understood he fought his own conscience a moment started walking he passed the two joined the old members of the company forming up behind croaker one by one a dozen nar followed mogabas hand started up a third time men held their breaths then mogaba looked at his feet i cant captain there is a shadow within me i cant kill me and i cant do that i promised your men i wouldnt harm you no matter your choice kill me captain before this thing in me turns to hatred i couldnt even if i hadnt promised ill never understand you mogabas hand fell youre strong enough to come face me when for all you knew youd be killed but youre not strong enough to save the trouble sparing me will cost i cant snuff the light i sense in you it may yet become the light of greatness not a light captain a wind out of nowhere born in darkness for both our sakes i hope im wrong but i fear youll regret your mercy mogaba took a step backward croakers arm fell everyone watching sighed dismayed though they had had little hope of rapprochement mogaba saluted wheeled marched away followed by three nar who had not crossed over with sindawe hey swan yelled a moment later breaking the silence them bastards is stealing our boat let them go croaker faced friends he had not seen for months from the book of cloete in those days the company was in service to the syndarchs of dai khomena and they were delivered his friends all grinned and roared approval he grinned back hey weve got work to do here weve got a city to evacuate lets hit it from one eye he watched the boat cross the lake from the other he kept watch on sindhu it felt good to be back thus was dejagore delivered and the true company set free chapter seventytwo the howler perched atop a tall stool out of the way while longshadow prepared he was impressed by the array of mystical and thaumaturgic gewgaws longshadow had assembled during one short generation such had remained scarce while they had been in thrall to the lady and nonexistent under the rule of her husband before her they had wanted no one getting independent howler had very little though he was free now he had little need to possess not so longshadow he wanted to own at least one of everything he wanted to own the world not much of longshadows collection was in use now not much would be ever howler suspected most had been gathered mainly to keep anyone else from having it that was the way longshadow thought the room was brightly lighted partly because it was approaching noon beyond the crystal walls partly because longshadow had packed a score of brilliant light sources into the room no two of which used the same fuel against an ambush of shadows he left no precaution untaken he would not admit it but he was terrified longshadow checked the altitude of the sun noon coming up time to start why now theyre least active under a noonday sun oh howler did not approve longshadow meant to catch one of the hungry big ones to train and send after soulcatcher howler thought that a stupid plan he thought it unnecessary and overly complicated they knew where she was it made more sense just to hit her with more soldiers than she could handle but longshadow wanted drama this was too risky he could loose something nothing in this world could control he did not want to be part of this but longshadow left him no choice longshadow was a master of leaving one no choice several hundred men climbed the old road to the plain dragging a closed black wagon ordinarily drawn by elephants but no animal would go near the shadowtraps however much it was beaten only longshadows men feared him more than they feared what might befall them up there longshadow was the devil they knew those men backed the wagon against the main shadowtrap longshadow said now we begin he giggled and tonight in the witching hour your old comrade will cease to be a threat to anyone howler was skeptical chapter seventythree soulcatcher sat in the middle of a field disguised as a stump crows circled their shadows scooting over wheat stubble an unknown city loomed in the distance the imp frogface materialized theyre up to something ive known that since they started blocking the crows what theyre up to is what i want to know the imp grinned described what he had seen either theyve forgotten to take you into account or theyre counting on you feeding me incorrect information she started moving toward the city but if they wanted to feed me false information they would confuse the crows too wouldnt they the imp said nothing no answer was expected why do this during the daytime longshadow is scared to death of what might break out if he tried during the night ah yes but they wont move till nightfall theyll want their sending at full strength frogface muttered something about just how much did he have to do to earn his freedom soulcatcher laughed a merry little girls laugh tonight i think youll have done with me if you can do a creditable illusion of me what lets have a look around this city first whats its name dhar new dhar really old dhar was levelled by the shadowmasters for resisting too strongly back when they first conquered this country interesting what do they think of the shadowmasters not much and a new generation is at hand this could be amusing when darkness fell the great public square at the heart of new dhar was strangely empty and silent except for the cawing and fluttering of crows all who approached developed chills and dreads and decided to come another time a woman sat on the edge of a fountain paddling her fingers through the water crows swarmed around her coming and going from the shadows at the squares edge another figure watched this one seemed to be a gnarled old crone folded up against a wall her rags clutched tightly against the evening cool both women seemed content to stay where they were indefinitely they were patient those two patience was rewarded the shadow came at midnight a big dreadful thing a terrible juggernaut of darkness that could be sensed while still miles away even the untalented of new dhar felt it children cried mothers shushed them fathers barred their doors and looked for places to hide their babies and wives the shadow roared into the city and swept toward the square crows squawked and dipped around it it bore straight down on the woman at the fountain dreadful and implacable the woman laughed at it and vanished as it sprang upon her crows mocked the woman laughed from the far side of the square the shadow surged struck but the woman was not there she laughed from behind it frogface pretending to be soulcatcher led the shadow around the city for an hour took it into places where it would destroy and kill and be recognized and fire hatreds long and carefully banked the shadow was tireless and persistent but not very bright it just kept coming indifferent to what effect it had on the population waiting for its quarry to make a mistake the crone on the edge of the square rose slowly hobbled to the palace of longshadows local governor entered past soldiers and sentries apparently blind she hobbled down to the strongroom where the governor stored the treasures he wrested from the peoples in his charge opened a massive door none but the governor supposedly could open once inside she became not a crone but soulcatcher in a rnerry mood she had studied the shadow carefully while frogface led it about that shadow had to travel all the distance between two points frogface did not he could stay ahead forever as long as he remained alert her studies had shown her how she might contain it she spent an hour preparing the vault so it would keep the shadow in then another arranging a peck of little spells that should distract it so that by the time someone released it it would have forgotten why it had come to new dhar she stepped outside closed the door till it stood open only a crack arranged an illusion that made her look like one of the governors soldiers then she sent a thought spinning toward frogface the imp came prancing enjoying himself taunting his hunter into the trap soulcatcher shoved the door shut behind it sealed it up frogface popped into existence beside her grinning that was almost fun if i didnt have business in my own world id almost want to hang around another hundred years never a dull moment with you is that a hint you bet it is sweetie im going to miss you all you and the captain and all your friends maybe ill come back and visit but i got business elsewhere soulcatcher giggled her little girls giggle all right stay with me till im out of the city then youre free to go wow i bet this place blows up i wish i could see longshadows face when he gets the news she laughed he isnt half as bright as he thinks you have any friends over there who might want to work for me maybe one or two with the right sense of mischief ill see they walked on laughing like children who had pulled a prank chapter seventyfour pregnant no doubt about it everything fell into place once the physician gave me that word everything made sense and nonsense one time one night it never occurred to me that that could happen to me but here i am swollen up like a gourd on toothpicks sitting in my fortress south of taglios writing these annals watching the rains fall for the fifth month running wishing it was possible to sleep on my stomach or side or to be able to walk without waddling the radisha has provided me with a whole crew of women they find me amusing i come back from trying to teach their menfolk something about soldiering and they point at me and tell me this is why women dont become generals and whatnot it is hard to be light on your feet when you cant see them for your belly the baby is an active little thing whatever it will be maybe it is practicing to be a long distance runner or a professional wrestler the way it hops around in there my timing seems to be good i have gotten almost everything i have to record written if as the women promise me all my fears and doubts come to nothing and i survive this i will have five or six weeks to get into shape before the rivers go down and the new campaign season begins regular messages come from croaker at dejagore thrown across the river by catapult it is quiet down there he wishes he could be here i wish he could be here that would make it easier i know the day that the main is down enough to cross i will be on the north bank and he will be there on the south i am feeling very positive these days like not even my sister can ruin things now she knows about this her crows have been watching i have let them hoping it irks the devil out of her here is ram back from his bath i swear the closer i get to my date the worse he gets you would think it was his child he is scared to death that what happened to his wife and baby will happen to me and mine i think he has grown a little strange almost haunted he is terrified of something he jumps at every little sound he searches the corners and shadows every time he enters a room chapter seventyfive ram was scared with good reason he had learned something he should not have he knew something he was not supposed to know ram is dead ram died fighting his strangler brothers when they came to take my daughter narayan is a dead man he is walking around somewhere out there maybe grinning that grin but he will not wear it long he will be found if not by soldiers hunting men with indelible red stains on their palms then by me he has no idea how strongly my powers have returned i will find him and he will become a sainted strangler much earlier than he would like i should have been more wary i knew he had his own agenda i have been around treacherous men all my life but never ever did it occur to me that from the beginning he and his ranking cronies were interested in the child developing within me instead of in me myself he was a consummate actor grinning bastard he was a true deceiver i never even chose a name before they collected their daughter of night i should have suspected when the dreams went away so suddenly as soon as i had been through that ceremony i was not the one consecrated there i did not change i could not be marked that easily ram was only a yellow rumel man but he knew they were coming he killed four of them then narayan killed him according to the women then narayan and his band fought their way out of the fortress all while i still lay unconscious narayan will pay i will tear his heart out and use it to choke his goddess they do not know what they have awakened my strength has returned they will pay longshadow my sister the deceivers kina herself if she gets in my way their year of the skulls is upon them i close the book of lady envoi down there incessant wind sweeps the plain of stone it murmurs across pale grey paving that sprawls from horizon to horizon it sings around scattered pillars it tumbles leaves and dust come from afar and stirs the long black hair of a corpse that has lain undisturbed for generations desiccating playfully the wind tosses a leaf into the corpses silently screaming mouth tugs it out again the pillars might be thought the remnants of a fallen city they are not they are too sparsely and randomly placed nor are any of them toppled or broken though some have been etched deeply by gnawing ages of wind and some seem nearly new a century old at most in the dawn and at the setting of the sun parts of those columns catch the light and gleam golden for a few minutes each day auric characters burn forth from their faces for those remembered it is immortality of a sort in the night the winds die and silence rules the place of glittering stone to be continued in glittering stone
