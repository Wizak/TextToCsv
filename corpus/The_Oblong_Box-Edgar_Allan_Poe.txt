my home is in new york but several years ago i stayed in charleston south carolina for a few months at the end of my visit i returned to new york by ship in those days we traveled by sailing ships sailing ships took about a week to sail from charleston to new york when the winds and the tides were good the journey took six days if there was little wind and we had to wait for a good tide the journey took eight days there were no regular days and times for ships to sail passengers went to a shipping office they asked a clerk where ships were going the clerk told the passengers the names of the ships and their destinations then he wrote the passengers names beside the names of the ships the captains of the ships looked at this list then they sent messages to the passengers when their ships were ready a ship was going to sail from charleston in the middle of june its destination was going to be new york i booked a cabin on the ship then i waited in a hotel i wanted to find out the names of the other travelers the list of the passengers names was kept in the shipping office so i went to the shipping office and i looked at the list there was one name on the list that i knewcornelius wyatt cornelius and i were students together at university a few months earlier i had heard news about cornelius wyatt a friend in new york wrote me a letter cornelius had married a beautiful and charming young woman i wanted to meet mrs wyatt i had never seen her why were cornelius and his wife in charleston cornelius was an artist he painted pictures he also bought and sold paintings old paintings were worth a lot of money in new york was that the answer to my question maybe cornelius had found a valuable painting in charleston there were many old families in south carolina the families had brought many paintings from europe was cornelius taking an old painting to new york i was going to find the answer to both these questions soon we were traveling together on the same ship a captain sent a message his ship was going to sail to new york the next dayjune th i went to the harbor and boarded his ship i looked at the list of passengers and their cabins cornelius wyatt had booked three cabins he had the two cabins opposite mine and the cabin beside mine he was not traveling alone he had three ladies with himhis wife and his two sisters the two sisters were in a cabin opposite my own cabin i expected cornelius and his wife to take the second cabin opposite mine but who was going to be in the third cabin i was surprised when i met mr and mrs wyatt at last cornelius looked ill and he was not pleased to see me my friend we have much to talk about i said and is this your charming and beautiful wife the lady with cornelius was wearing a veil the thin material covered her face and i could not see her clearly but she said good morning to me politely she spoke slowlyshe had the accent of south carolina she did not speak with a new york accent cornelius did not speak to me he took his wife into the cabin opposite mine and shut the door cornelius was very rude i thought but he is an artist artists can be very selfish we will talk later but who is staying in the third cabin maybe a servant will be in the cabin beside me two men brought a box onto the ship it was an oblong box about six feet long the men took the box to cornelius wyatts third cabinthe cabin beside mine they put the box down on the floor while they opened the door the words wyatt and new york were written on the top of the box i watched the two men carry the oblong box into the cabin then i heard the men talking the walls of the cabin were thin and i could hear their conversation it smells bad doesnt it said one man yes said the other man whats in it do you think the two men left the cabin and closed the door i wanted to look at the strange box more carefully but i could not do that first i must speak to cornelius there were paintings in the box that is what i believed but i wanted to see them what had cornelius found in charleston maybe the paintings were secret and valuable i saw cornelius later in the evening all the passengers were in the diningroom eating dinner i tried to speak to cornelius but he did not want to talk he was rude to me also he was not hungry he ate nothing was he ill well i said were old friends but youre behaving badly cornelius said nothing i was angry with him now i wanted to be rude too are you worried about the things in your box i asked i have guessed what is inside it but i wont tell anyone i said the words then i wished that i had not said them suddenly cornelius wyatts face became very pale his eyes were large and bright was he ill or was he mad cornelius wyatt suddenly fell to the floor and was still he had fainted the captain and two sailors helped cornelius to his cabin i went to my own cabin and tried to sleep but i could not rest i heard someone open the door of the cabin beside me had cornelius gone into the cabin had he gone to look at his pictures i heard the sound of metal on wood was cornelius opening the box maybe i slept a little then maybe i dreamt i thought that i heard the sound of someone crying cornelius stayed in that cabin he did not want to come out food was taken to him he did not eat it those paintings must be extremely valuable i said to myself cornelius cannot leave them for a minute then i thought of another reason for my old friends strange behavior mrs wyatt did not stay in her cabin she came out and talked to the other passengers i saw her in the dining room i was very surprised i had been told that mrs wyatt was beautiful and charming but she was neither beautiful nor charming and she was not young my friend had said that mrs wyatt was from new york but she spoke with a south carolina accent was this the reason for my friends strange behavior had cornelius made a mistake had he married the wrong woman was he sad and upset about this the door of the cabin was locked and cornelius did not come out what was he going to do when we reached new york then something happened and i forgot cornelius wyatts secrets a few days after we left charleston there was a storm the wind blew and the sea became rough the waves grew taller and taller it was a very bad storm it blew the ship southback toward charleston the wind was very strong it blew all night the ship moved from side to side it almost turned over the mast broke the captain could not steer the ship and it went toward the shore the ship hit some of the sharp black rocks on the coastline and it started to sink soon seawater came along the corridors and into the cabins leave the ship the captain shouted to everyone quickly go to the small boats do not stop to take anything with you i ran out of my cabin and i saw mrs wyatt i saw cornelius wyatts two sisters the sailors helped us to get into a rowboat there were fifteen of us in the boat the captain was with us it was daylight but black clouds were in the sky we could see land two miles away the wind was blowing toward the land we looked up at the ship it was now low in the water the ship was sinking soon it was going to be under the sea suddenly we saw cornelius wyatt we had forgotten him cornelius was pulling the oblong box toward the side of the ship he was pulling the box toward our rowboat his eyes were wild he was terribly frightened mr wyatt shouted the captain get into this boat now the ship is sinking i cannot leave my box cornelius replied i must get into the boat with my box no shouted the captain we can only take you you cannot bring your box quick get into the boat the ship is sinking i cannot leave my box cornelius shouted again is your box more important than your life i shouted cornelius looked at me i saw madness in his eyes he hated me he hated my question yes yes yes cornelius shouted he lifted the box onto the side of the ship as he pushed it over the side he held onto it the box and cornelius fell into the sea both the man and the box went straight down into the water cornelius and the oblong box did not come up again get the boat away from the side of the ship shouted the captain we pulled on the oars and the rowboat moved away from the sinking ship in a few minutes the ship had sunk beneath the sea the wind blew our rowboat to the shore at last we were safe a month later i met the captain again we talked about the storm and our escape from the sinking ship we talked about cornelius and the oblong box it was a mistake to bring that box onto the ship the captain said the box brought bad luck to the ship i did not want to take the box what was in the box i asked the body of mr wyatts dead wife the captain replied mr wyatts wife died suddenly on june th she died in charleston on the day before we sailed mr wyatt had to return to new york and he wanted to take his dead wifes body with him none of the other captains wanted to carry a dead body in their ships some people believe that it is bad luck to keep a dead person on a ship but mr wyatt asked me again and again he became very upset at last i agreed he lied to the shipping clerk and the other passengers he said that there were valuable paintings in the box so who was the mrs wyatt that i met i asked him she was his servant said the captain wyatt loved his beautiful wife very much only i knew the truth
