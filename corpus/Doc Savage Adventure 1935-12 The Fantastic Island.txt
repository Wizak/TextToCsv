 chapter i shipwrecks to order the disappearance of william harper littlejohn attracted no public attention whatever the reason for this was simple the public never learned about it william harper littlejohn was a very famous man it was impossible that if ten average men on the street should be stopped and asked who william harper littlejohn was they would not have had the slightest idea but in his field william harper littlejohn was tops his field was archaeology and geology wherever men are interested in such things he was known william harper littlejohns disappearance was simple he had chartered a ship and was taking an archaeological expedition to the galapagos islands below the equator in the pacific ocean the galapagos are said to be the worlds strangest islands william harper littlejohn simply disappeared the ship vanished also the whole expedition too it could not have been that their radio merely failed there were three radio transmitters on the expedition ship no there was some other reason it was strange just how strange it was no one had any idea at the beginning of the thing william harper littlejohn happened to be one of the five men associated with that remarkable man of mystery doc savage word of his disappearance reached doc savage at his new york headquarters doc savage acted promptly two of doc savages aids he had five of them altogether were on a vacation cruise in the yacht seven seas which chanced to be off the coast of panama in the pacific aboard the yacht also was patricia savage a remarkable young woman whose relationship to doc savage was that of cousin pat had gone along for the trip she claimed but it was to be suspected that she was looking for excitement if she was looking for excitement she was certainly destined to find it doc savage man of bronze individual of mystery mental wizard and physical marvel to quote the newspapers sent a radiogram to the yacht seven seas headed for the galapagos to look for william harper littlejohn who was better known as johnny and his expedition the seven seas was now about to slam headlong into more trouble than those aboard would ever have believed possible the seven seas was riding a radio beam radiated by special courtesy on the part of the powerful united states naval radio station from the panama canal zone this beam simplified navigation and they were riding it straight for the galapagos brigadier general theodore marley brooks stood on the dripping deck of the seven seas and stared into an immensity of black sky and blacker water occasionally he scowled anxiously upward at the radio rigging water slapped and phosphoresced around the bow right now the yacht was rolling in a huge ground swell rolling alarmingly rivets strained and bulkheads creaked there was at least half a gale blowing and it made noises in the rigging like the sighs of dying men brigadier general theodore marley brooks was commonly called ham a name which he did not like he now frowned darkly and made his way to the pitching bridge this is dangerous he snapped we may run onto a reef any minute dont i know it a surprisingly childlike voice retorted from the semidarkness of the bridge this ground swell is bad mighty bad when it piles up like this it means the water is getting shallow ham snapped but i thought you said something screwy piped the childlike voice according to your log were supposed to have more than a hundred miles between us and the nearest land a young woman joined them on the bridge she was a very striking young woman to look at having not only a lovely face but hair of a very unusual bronze color and eyes which actually looked golden she was patricia savage who loved excitement i wish youd ask your old ocean to behave she requested cheerfully ive been thrown out of my bunk three times in the last fifteen minutes i gave it up something is wrong pat ham told her were getting into a big ground swell that means we are near land or at least in shoal water and that is very much impossible pat walked over to the second man on the bridge just what is the trouble monk she asked the man addressed as monk sat in the shadows hunched like a bulky buddha over an audiofrequency amplifier his thick hands indicated the apparatus containing vacuum tubes for increasing the voltage and power of radio beacon signals these directionfinding doodads have gone plain haywire he insisted in that small squeaky voice ham joined them and listened to the signal pulsations coming from the loudspeaker he said the beat frequency is sounding just as it should we are certainly not off the course as broadcast to us from the government radio beacon in the canal zone were right in the beam all right monk grunted the a wave is jammed with the n waves so you dont hear any dots just a blur of dashes we cant be off our course but we must be impossible snapped ham our goniometer with its new type amplifier developed by doc savage himself insures that the direction finder couldnt go wrong and the united states government station is transmitting the beam to us the word exchange had the rather unexpected effect of throwing monk into what looked like a very violent rage you tellin me you courtroom fop monk growled belligerently at ham dont get tough with me you missing link ham snapped ill make shark bait out of you monk pushed back from the radio apparatus and squared off threateningly before ham who says im wrong he demanded in a voice no longer mouselike i did you ape ham snapped youre a liar besides bein a shyster lawyer monk bellowed im right and you know darned well that im right pat said dryly i wonder if you know what youre quarreling over the two men pretended not to hear ham and monk seemed always on the point of taking each other apart violently the mildest word from one was likely to set the other off in a rage but it was only on rare occasions that their enmity extended beyond the talking stage patricia savage cast an idle glance around the horizon she started violently look she cried ahead there a bit to port green and red lights huh monk jerked around channel lights that sounds like ham stared intently forgot himself and his feud with monk channel lights they are but they were not there a minute ago monks small eyes blinked rapidly it aint possible some mistake ham muttered no lights are indicated on the chart pat pointed at them and said there they are with inescapable feminine logic ham and monk crowded forward for another inspection of the charts they offered a strange contrast in appearance these two men ham was meticulously attired in a blue marine uniform a blue cap with its insignia in gold set jauntily on his head he carried a slender black cane he was handsome lithe and wore his clothes like a fashion plate monk on the contrary wore a not too white pair of duck pants wrinkled across the thighs and bagged at the knees an enormous greenandwhitestriped undershirt fitted around his barrel chest like a circus tent slipped on over an elephant rusty hair stuck out on his bulletlike head like mashed bristles on a wire brush the hair grew low down on his forehead half burying his ears almost meeting his scrubby eyebrows his homely face was mostly mouth and flat nose his body was nearly as wide as it was long and his fists hung down almost to his knees in fact he did not look like a man he resembled an amiable ape it was a mistake to judge either of these two by appearances ham was no fop he was one of the most astute lawyers harvard had ever turned out and monk as lieutenant colonel andrew biodgett mayfair was recognized as one of the greatest living industrial chemists the greatest claim to distinction of these two men however was that they were members of doc savages group of five remarkable aids that alone made them unusual for each of the bronze mans five aids was a master of some particular profession pat went over now and disconnected the robot control which had been steering the ship shall i hold to the channel lights she asked swinging the wheel slightly over i dont like this ham said uneasily there should be no harbor at all near us least of all a lighted harbor even a lighted channel but there is nothing else to do why not monk demanded we dont have to go in that channel do we if there is a channel ham snapped its worth investigating that is what i mean it looked as if their perpetual quarrel were going to break out again pat solved the problem by turning the seven seas toward the channel markers the yacht was caught in a choppy crosscurrent now and the wind was rising it no longer sighed like men at deaths door it wailed and howled ham went to the end of the bridge and clung to the railing to keep from being pitched off the violently tilting craft into the boil of black water around them in spite of the wind the night was oppressive muggy with a faint sulphurous smell suddenly a flickering glow as of sheet lightning sprang into life tinging the lowhanging clouds ham made a mistake he dismissed it at first as ordinary lightning then he saw that there was something different about these luminous flashes they were weird unearthy they stained the lowhanging clouds a bloody red ham heard a rasped breath behind him and was startled into whirling it was monk red lightnin monk uttered hanging on against the fetid sulphurous wind at the deck tip thats funnylookin aint it again the gory light mushroomed out under the clouds it was more sustained brighter this time and it showed them things off to one side bulked a shore line but this did not strike them with terror pat called attention to the thing that did look she screamed look all around us hard alee monk squalled engines reversed the fantastic red light went out did you see ham gasped in the silence that followed there must be two dozen ships big and little wrecked all around us and the devil only knows where we are monk gulped im gonna back this boat turn around get outta here an wait for daylight a whole graveyard of wrecked ships pat gasped red lightning that smells of sulphur pats voice sounded it seemed rather cheerful you always did like trouble didnt you monk grunted at her and mystery pat added i eat it up there must have been a tide that carried the seven seas to one side or something they were in reverse exactly retracing the course they had been sailing when it happened a curling wave lifted the bow of the seven seas high in the water and hurled it down the yacht shuddered with a wrenching shock that knocked monk and ham sprawling on the wet deck there was a nightmare of grinding and scrapings as steel plates were wrenched from the hull by jagged coral caught fast on the submerged reef the craft did not rise with the next wave she heeled half over instead with a groaning of tortured steel and the wave washed in an avalanche of water over the deck ham and monk were battered against the anchor winch they staggered up half drowned to claw their way toward the bridge aid pat if she needs it monk bellowed me im goin for habeas corpus habeas corpus was monks cherished pet pig he never went anywhere without the animal much to hams disgust and frequent infuriation a streak of light bluewhite darted from the seven seas bridge knifed across the rockfanged water turn that searchlight off ham shouted to pat as he went down again under a drenching crosswave itll help us see to swim ashore pat protested itll draw sharks ham snapped as he caught the life preserver pat threw him so youre afraid of sharks pat said but she switched off the searchlight and joined ham at the submerged rail monk appeared on deck an instant later with the squealing kicking armful of razorback hog that was habeas corpus habeas corpus had a snout like a woodrasp flopping coalscuttle ears long ungainly legs the special life preserver which monk had previously fashioned for habeas did not improve his appearance it added to his buoyancy however monk jumped into the water with the wet pig that hogll draw sharks ham yelled habeas he fights sharks monk roared back come on pat and ham went overboard ham still holding tightly to his slim black cane which was almost as much a part of him as his shirt the cane was in reality a formidable weapon a sword cane its innocentappearing exterior sheathed a length of gleaming steel the point of which had been impregnated with a chemical capable of producing almost instant unconsciousness under the red lightning glare surf on all sides broke against hidden reefs churning the water to a bloody froth but pat and ham came through the barrage of wavedashed rocks and reeled half drowned and gasping onto a mangrovestudded beach monk swashed ashore close behind them holding the squirming habeas corpus under an arm with difficulty that hogll kick a rib out for you some day ham warned breathing hard lay off habeas corpus monk gasped or ill be kickin out some ribs on my own account the red luminance bloomed again against the clouds it crawled and writhed disappeared and blanketed out again like a bloody mist floating in air what is it pat demanded shivering in spite of the sultry night nothing supernatural ham explained you notice the color on the clouds does not seep through from above the light is reflected from underneath theres an active volcano somewhere on the island monk summed up pat pressed water out of her drenched hair do you suppose heres where johnny is well have to find out ham said grimly one thing id like to clear myself on pat said earnestly the shipwreck i was holding dead in the middle of the channel when it happened yeah monk agreed it wasnt your fault this shipwreck was arranged ham said ominously some one on this island set those lights so wed run slam on the reef you mean monk muttered ham said soberly some one drew us a hundred miles off our course and wrecked us were up against something really sinister kinda wish doc was here monk announced the next moment he was wishing it even more violently attracted perhaps by the bluewhite searchlight beam which had lanced out from the seven seas a moment after she had gone on the rocks shadowy manfigures loosened from the darkly entwined mangrove thicket and bore down upon the castaways brandishing short clubs and shrieking a harsh un intelligible gibberish chapter ii island of horror the dimly seen attackers twenty or more rushed out of the mangroves in a solid wave ham and monk thrust pat behind then met the attack ham with his sword cane monk with his graniteknuckled fists ham dropped two of the assailants with deft thrusts of the sword cane he was careful not to allow the valuable cane tipped with the unconsciousnessproducing chemical to be struck in fact ham was more regardful of the cane than of himself unexpectedly there was an uglysounding whack and ham staggered back groggily from a club which had bludgeoned past his guard dazedly he saw the club lift again but it did not descend not with any weight behind it there was a rap of knuckles against a jaw as monks long arm jabbed out and knocked the clubswinger off his feet ham recovered his balance and got his deadly sword cane into use again lets charge em monk squawled righto ham agreed well try to break through into the mangroves side by side they advanced into a rain of clubs monks pummeling fists working like locomotive driving rods hams sword cane darting in and out like an aroused snake pat pressing forward behind them scooped up rocks from the beach and threw them as fast as she could even habeas corpus did his part squealing and grunting and gouging his sharp tusks into every foot and ankle that came within reach of his woodrasp snout the varied strategy was too much for the attackers they thought hams sword cane was dealing out death and they broke suddenly with hideous yells to go crashing away and disappear in the black recesses of the mangrove sink monk picked up habeas corpus and swung him lustily by the long ears much to the pigs squealing delight monk grinned and the action lighted up his unbelievably homely face making it very pleasant to look at there was a little light now from the stars ham was making a quick examination of the anesthetized victims of his sword cane they were of different races and colors and all wore loin cloths their necks were encircled with copperstudded collars made seemingly out of lizard hide a great blast of noise riveted hams attention it was only monk laughing whats the matter you hairy ape ham demanded suspiciously i was thinkin how youd look in the costume of the country a loin cloth and a dog collar ham bristled and gripped his sword cane tighter you widemouthed macaw he began pat silenced him with tightlipped words if you want more fighting save your strength she said theyre coming back a loud plud sounded in the wet sand near hams feet in a second the air was filled with heavy missiles habeas corpus squealed theyre heaving rocks ham shouted they can throw more rocks than we can monk growled lets get outta here monk tucked one of the short thick clubs under his arm grabbed up habeas corpus by the ears and lunged into the shadowed thicket pat and ham followed closely pressing through the mangrove sink they came out upon a height of land that was nothing if not weird volcanic rock black lava sharp as broken glass swallowed them up in a welter of fantastically shaped hills and gullies much of the razoredged glass was in tilted sheets which were prone to slip and shatter under the weight of a footfall giant cactuses rooted in the crevices and dangled their spiny pads overhead like hooded cobras ready to strike they lost all sounds of pursuit the lowraking clouds lifted and the three pressed on under the pale white light of equatorial stars i hope we get somewhere quick pat said appalled they speak of the galapagos archipelago as the worlds end ham remarked they dont miss it much monk grumbled how were goin to find johnny in this volcanic scrap heap i dunno did either of you get the impression pat asked suddenly that our leagueofnations attackers were being careful not to kill us yeah monk admitted even those rocks were not thrown too hard they wanted us alive i guess ham supplied my guess too but why thats anybodys guess we could sure use doc savage about now climbing higher up the glassy slope they passed through a belt of cold volcanic pits and cones where ages before the molten rock had bubbled like mush and cooled in scabrous pockmarks they came out on a wide plateau where nothing grew not even the cobrahead cactus and where the pits were smaller clogged with earth and so close together that it was necessary to skirt the region to make any forward progress monk stopped suddenly these pits are all in geometric order he declared theyre not volcanic pits like the ones below theyre manmade ham stared on the plain the glassy rock had given way to a kind of reddish clay or hardpacked volcanic ash right he clipped the pits are crumbling away now and mostly buried under loose earth hard to tell but they must have been laid out originally with the regularity of cells in a honeycomb as they continued on the honeycomb pattern became more apparent as the pits were revealed in a less crumbling condition these were dug later ham observed yeah monk agreed the farther we go the fresher the pits look rut what are they for pat wondered say this all gets queerer and queerer whats it all about listen ham said tensely wafted on the miasmatic breeze came sharp cracking sounds there was unearthliness about the sounds as though they sprang from the air of their own volition what is it pat asked uneasily no animal ever made a sound like that monk blurted suddenly through and above the cracking sounds came a longdrawn wail which quavered up and down the scale in agony so appalling that a trickle of icy water seemed to be loosened on the back of each of the three listeners pat gasped i never heard anything like it horrible a dying animal of some kind ham said dying man monk corrected grimly come on ham said gripping his sword cane as they pressed forward the pits in the rocklike ash actually became as sharply delineated as the cells in a honeycomb a giant honeycomb these pits were about ten feet in diameter and some ten feet where they were not filled with loose earth the mysterious cracking noises sounded louder ahead there ham rapped under his breath look shadows pat gasped like men moving the three worked closer holding to the concealment of the fringing thicket whitepointed thorns tore at them viciously shredding their clothes and piercing flesh but they succeeded in approaching opposite the place where the shadows moved and from where the cracking cutting noises issued here the plain stretched on but the advancing line of pits came to an end they crouched down watching stars dripped pale light and suddenly a close bulking mountain disgorged a red glare into the sky bathed in the baleful light of volcanic fires hugemuscled men could be seen moving ceaselessly up and down at the edge of the honeycombed ground the men were clothed as those others had been in loin cloths and leather collars they carried long whips which they swung over their heads and cracked down into the row of pits hideous groans and jabberings issued from the unseen depths of the pits the whipcrackers their halfnaked bodies in the red volcanic glare sleek with glistening sweat looked like satanic apparitions come to earth back on the yacht i said maybe we were headed for hell monk muttered now i know it the cracking noises we heard were from the whips ham observed whats in the pits i wonder pat asked in a hushed tone monk was already edging forward crawling on his stomach hold habeas corpus he whispered back ill find out blast your hog ham complained but he held the pig as he muscled to a position where he could look down into the pits monk gasped with grim surprise in every one of the circular holes as far as he could see down the long line stakes were driven and to the stakes were attached chains and to the end of the chains were fastened men there was one man with a shovel in each pit digging the diggers wore loin cloths only lacking the lizardleather collars worn by the whipcracking overseers these collars monk correctly assumed to be emblems of authority each of the pitmen was digging a hole of a circumference allowed by the length of his chain the holes extending across the plain in a straight line were of uniform width about ten feet under the lash of the whips in the hellish red volcano glare the chained men were actually digging their way to death suddenly from behind monk sounded a fast thudding on the hardpacked ground something thrust hard against his back as he swerved around a shrill squeal sounded monk clamped his huge hands over habeas corpuss snout to smother the affectionate squeals of the pig which had burst away from ham and had run straight to monk he throttled the squeals but the damage was already done whipcracking overseers jabbered sharply at each other and clumped forward to investigate the disturbance monks squat bulk reared upward brandishing his stout club he lunged forward to meet the attack of the nearest man but before monk could close in a deadly swish sounded monks enemy was still six or eight paces away but monk felt his knees gripped as though by iron hands jerked tightly together and pulled out from under him he fell striking the ground with stunning force monk knew what had thrown him and his hands raked down to jerk away the leadtipped thong which had whipped out of the night murk and entwined his legs before he could free himself his assailant was standing over him the weighted whip handle raised high to crash against monks head hams sword cane slithered in that instant dropped the overseer and saved monk from the blow but another whip swished out of the night wrapped around hams legs and hurled him to the ground on top of monk clubs battered them both to unconsciousness before they could claw free from the kneebinding thongs when they came to a few minutes later they found themselves bound and lying on the ground at the edge of the line of pits ham focused his groggy glance at the nearest pit worker the man had sunk his hole about five feet down so that his face was practically on ground level that painracked face was almost within hands reach of ham ham started violently in a red volcanic flare he had recognized the man as being one of the members of johnnys expedition tony ham whispered hoarsely a shudder went over the man as his crazed eyes turned to hams his lips widened in startled recognition he said nothing but kept on digging ham shot a quick glance around saw that the nearest overseer was intently engaged in a bullying crossexamination of pat ham squirmed close to the edge of the hole so that his lips were almost at the diggers ear wheres the rest of the ships crew and johnny he whispered crews in the pits diggin the man answered in a kind of wrenching sob wheres johnny is he alive ham hung on the answer fearfully alive but he wont be long where is he a big guy with a black beard took him away i dont know where i only know theyre gonna kill johnny theyre gonna kill all of us the mans voice rose to hysterical rasp dont talk so loud ham cautioned fiercely what have we got into here tell me what you know quick while weve got the chance i cant tell you but i can then the mans voice rose in a choking shriek out of all control now it was an insane shriek plainly the fellow had broken under the tortures he had endured whatever it was he meant to tell or not to tell ham remained forever untold the overseer rushed forward mouthing unintelligible curses his arm reared up and down the leaded whip handle struck with gruesome thump against the crazed mans head it was a blow heavy enough to have dropped anything alive but the man in the pit was not exactly alive now he was a raving madman mercifully removed from all consciousness of pain his whitish eyes rolled madly crimson foam bubbled from his lips the leaded whip handle descended again this time the man slumped a slack weight in the pit he was dead before his body hit the bottom the overseer he was some unidentifiable asiatic type bawled orders in harsh gibberish two guards shoved forward one was a giant brownskinned man the other a paunchy caucasian of indeterminate race the brown man bent and commenced ripping the thongs from hams hands and feet the other guard jumped heavily down unlocked the iron cuff from the dead mans leg and heaved the limp body out of the pit the guard on top grunted and pushed ham roughly over the edge ham fell sprawling the guard in the pit was ready for him he jangled the chain against the stake grabbed ham by the foot and slapped on the iron cuff warm from the dead mans leg he picked up the dead mans shovel thrust it into hams hands the overseer above cracked down with the whip a thick welt bloomed on hams cheek he started digging overseers herded monk a short distance down the line of horror holes and put him similarly to work chapter iii prisoners of the pits pat experienced a somewhat different fate from that of the two men she was consigned to one of the pits but though she was chained to the stake she was not whipped nor was she compelled to dig she was greatly relieved at this concession to her womanhood until cutting through the harsh medley of groans whipcracks and guttural cries she heard the close voices of two guards conversing in english make her dig no the count will surely order her to be brought to the palace he will not want her worn out from digging but she could well stand a little bit of whipping no the other protested in this case the count will prefer to do his own whipping maybe youre right the overseer growled and moved away down the line of pits the other guard bent close over the edge of the hole pat shrank back all at once the pulse throbbed violently in her wrists and in her blue eyes sprang a look of desperate hope she was recognizing this guard he was another member of the expedition that had disappeared with johnny arent you she started to suggest al fredrickton first mate he supplied but you that whip i have to whip to keep from being whipped he whispered savagely im on top today tomorrow they may yank the collar off my neck and pitch me in a hole im just as much a prisoner as these poor devils digging but what is it all about pat questioned i dont know any more about it than you do i only know that men dig and die dig and die she echoed starkly what about johnny he was taken to the palace he may be alive listen redbeach road long island can you remember that redbeach road ive got it boris ramadanoff at that address ive got it what about it the mans breath came faster youre our only hope he rasped theyll take you to the palace try to contact johnny tell him the name and address theres a powerful shortwave radio sending set at the palace johnny must get a message to doc savage tell doc savage to contact boris ramadanoff yes but what good will that do ramadanoff can tell doc savage all he needs to know to effect our rescue ramadanoff is the brother of the big shot here on the island they quarreled the two brothers and boris left for new york how did you find out all this after our ship followed in the false harbor lights and was wrecked we were taken prisoners the steward and i were retained to work in the palace kitchen the steward heard the brothers quarreling he learned boriss new address and passed it on to me where is the steward pat asked dead said the man they suspected he knew something they killed him pat shuddered life isnt worth much here is it something happened the next moment to demonstrate anew the fiendish ruthlessness of the sinister genius in control of this island a drumming beat sounded against the ground and a huge horse ridden hard snorted to a stifflegged stop in front of the line of working pits the horse was a quivering black shadow under the wan starlight and the rider was a shadow proportionately huge and black with virulent curses the rider urged the plunging horse in among the cowering overseers he leaned far out of his saddle cracking heads right and left with a fearful instrument a knout fashioned somewhat on the order of those used in imperial russia again and again the knout descended its woven leather thongs reinforced with wire and hardened by a rosin treatment biting down deeply and forcing agonized yells one of the guards showed fight he dodged the blow of the knout flung in close against the plunging horse and reached up to pull the horseman from the saddle the man in the saddle only laughed a raw ghoulish clacking pulled a revolver from holster and shot the guard dead the horseman kept laughing and driving bullets into the guards body even after the fellow was slumped in a still dead heap on the ground after that no one offered resistance the horseman raised his voice in a bawled order guards scurried frenziedly into the pits where monk and ham and pat were shackled they unlocked the leg irons and motioned for the captives to climb out of their holes the three were brought before the man on the horse the man spoke in precise english his voice was suavely sinister he said it was a stupid blunder of my slaves to chain you to the pits it is only the asiatic immigrant ships sailing to south america that i intercept for my pit laborers those and occasional ecuadorian fishermen guano and moss hunters when upon rare occasions a yacht comes this way its occupants are received as welcome guests how does a guest get off this island after his ship is wrecked ham asked dryly my dear general brooks came the precise voice from the darklybulking figure on the horse none have ever gotten off this lug knows who we are monk muttered then aloud he said theyre all on here now the guests they are my dear colonel mayfair though a bit unrecognizable some of them doubtless you have reference to professor littlejohn the other murmured he is quite recognizable i shall take you to him but first permit me to introduce myself i am count alexander ramadanoff turning to the guards the count barked an order men padded forward with peculiar contrivances resembling wicker hammocks they deposited the litters on the ground and stood a little back the counts hand waved out his sardonic voice sounded there is one for each of you recline and i will conduct you in state to the palace monk hooted no hospital cot for mine ill walk recline the count ordered again and the knout swung menacingly in his hand they took their places on the wicker litters monk grumbling ham doubtful and pat frankly grateful for the convenience hey monk blurted were forgettin habeas corpus you have reference to the trained arabian pig the count questioned with suave politeness you know everything dont you monk growled yeah i mean my pig count ramadanoff exchanged a few guttural phrases with the overseers then addressed monk the pig must have escaped into the jungle he will find company more to his liking there wild swine overrun this island ham said well anyhow weve seen the last of that hog monk glowered at ham its your fault shyster you let him go if it wasnt for you and your pesky pig we wouldnt be in this fix ham retorted count ramadanoff cut short their quarrel by ordering the litter bearers to proceed through a narrow path hacked in the vinematted jungle growth they jogged along the count on his horse bringing up the rear they came out on a strip of rocky coastline and the guests stared with astonishment blazes monk gulped blazes look rising sheer washed by ocean spray on one side and bathed in the bloodred glare of volcanic light on the other a palace of medieval slavic type flung its black rock turrets high above the jungle growth through a drawbridge in the bastioned wall of twentyfoot thick volcanic rock they entered the bleak palace courtyard the drawbridge swung ponderously closed behind them pat shivered she felt as though she was locked out of the world an army couldnt get through these walls ham reflected uneasily some joint monk mumbled past the high buttressed towers the guests were carried and deposited in front of a lowarched doorway the count dismounted from his black horse and waved them inside some joint is right monk said emphatically as he stopped inside the stone threshold and stared around the room was huge highvaulted an oppressive cavern of black volcanic rock and wooden beams demoniacal blue flames leaped within a fireplace large enough to have engulfed a whole ox for roasting the fire shadows swooped on long curtains of somber ruby red which hung on brass hoops silver samovars glowed dully from shadowed recesses ancient icons looked down from the walls the only modern touch in the whole vast room was a grand piano draped with costly sea otter furs and brightly illuminated by crystal spangled candelabras which shed a yellow light from high overhead count ramadanoff indicated ornately gilded rubyplush chairs sit there before the fire he invited while your chambers are being prepared in the light the count was revealed as a magnificently proportioned man broadshouldered muscled well over six feet in height he was dressed in blackblack riding boots black breeches black coat black satin string tie his czarofrussia beard was black too and his black eyes smoldered with a sinister light which it was impossible for him to conceal pat sat on the edge of her highbacked chair and mentally chewed her finger nails because there had been no opportunity for her to divulge to monk or ham the information she had learned regarding the new york address of the counts brother monk pawed at his bargelike jaw wheres all the other guests you mentioned wheres johnny ham rapped pat also spilled questions what is the location of this island how did you know us why did you wreck us what are those horrible pits for the count stood with his back to the fireplace his fingers writhing before the blue flames which strangely gave off little light and almost no heat answering your questions in order he said in his suave precise voice you would not enjoy seeing the guests why monk demanded because my dear colonel mayfair most of them are in various stages of decomposition huh monk grunted the mortality rate among my guests has been regrettably high monk went directly to the point you mean you kill em nothing so crude as that the count denied there was a quality about the counts voice which gave a menacing bloodcrawling emphasis to his most casual words what then ham demanded they were shall we say liquidated sent to the pits many of them yes why fires flared deep in the counts fanatic eyes some of them for trying to escape some for becoming too curious the mans cruel glinting eyes fastened upon pat for becoming too curious he repeated that i think my dear young lady answers all four of your questions pats breath drew in sharply she glanced nervously around the oppressive room thats a beautiful piano she said it is indeed the count agreed four men were killed taking it off the boat do you play no said pat wont you play something count ramadanoff nodded i regret to say that later i most likely shall you regret yes when i play it is always a prelude of unpleasantness for somebody savages in the jungle are aroused to an animal frenzy through the beat of their own tomtoms in similar fashion i am impelled to unspeakable decisions when my fingers wander over the keys monk and ham playing a waiting game said nothing count ramadanoff spoke again i have now met all except two of doc savages worldfamed specialists it would give me the utmost pleasure to match wits and strength with this almost fabulous personage doc savage himself perhaps murmured pat enigmatically you shall a darkskinned man approached on soundless feet bowed low before count ramadanoff and motioned toward the broad stone steps disappearing upward in a sweeping spiral into a region of shadows and rubycolored velvet drapes the thin cruel line of the counts mouth seemed not to move but an abrupt hissing noise escaped his lips it seemed to be a signal of dismissal for the slave turned and padded swiftly up the stairway follow him the count said shortly he will conduct you to your chambers upstairs the three were shown to separate rooms ham had not been alone for more than forty seconds before he saw his door latch lift noiselessly he crouched the fingers of his right hand involuntarily clenched as though he gripped his deadly sword cane but the cane would have been of no use to him it was only pat who opened the door and eased into his room in a rush of whispered words she told him of her conversation with the pit guard who had been with johnnys expedition the logical place for the radio room is in the top of the tower ham said excitedly but theres a steel door barring the stairway to the tower let us go talk to monk ham suggested when he heard the news monk characteristically was all for immediate action we wont get a better chance than now he declared ham was inclined to agree but that steel door pat protested come on well go look at it monk eased out into the gloomy hall for all his simian bulk he moved with surprising agility on catlike feet pat and ham followed an army tank couldnt push it in monk muttered monk reached the door felt over the steel panels with his powerful hands the door was tight in its frame pat reached up and touched the latch the door swung open soundlessly unlocked monk blurted well im a bush ape didnt i always say so ham accorded readily you tailors dummy monk retorted shssh pat cautioned we may never get another chance at this come on the steps coiled upward like a circular stairway in a lighthouse they were fashioned out of blocks of untrimmed stone there was no railing no light a single misstep on the narrow flight would plunge a person down to unknown depths closing and bolting the door of ponderous steel behind them they mounted single file in the pitch blackness feeling with their hands hugging the damp side wall they came out at the top in the tower room without mishap a single alcohol lamp set in a wall niche burned with a small straight flame casting a glow over the rockgirt room the floor was constructed of steel plates this room was as weirdly unreal as the rest of the place but there was nothing unreal about the banked instrument which glinted softly in the light ham and monk pressed forward their hands touching familiarly the tubes condensers wirewound induction coils of a radio sending set as modern as any they had ever seen they switched on the juice and started tapping out doc savages call letters violet light flashed weirdly from the tubes pats face shone pale in the glare wont they hear this noise downstairs she questioned not a chance ham said couldnt hear a cannon through these walls monk confirmed ham sent the key dancing under his sensitive fingers as he spelled out the words of the message the message read prisoners on fantastic island in galapagos group stop contact boris ramadanoff thirty three redbeach road long island stop grave danger unexpectedly the harsh transmitter whining ceased the key continued its frantic dance under hams deft fingers but the electrical power had been cut off no further radio words were flung to the air and now a new sound flooded the room the sound came from everywhere yet from nowhere definitely it crept and crawled and writhed never loud but clear insidiously penetrating eerie freighted with menace and unseen death causing hair to tug at its roots and goose flesh to prickle out with a shuddering chill this sound which wafted with such horrible portent through the high tower room was music piano music the count is playing his piano pat said in a small voice he said he only played when somethin was goin to happen to somebody monk remembered aloud how can we hear it from this high place ham asked tensely this radio apparatus makes more noise than a piano pat said fearfully if we can hear him he must have heard us ham said grimly it must be because he heard us sending the radiogram that hes playing on his piano suddenly the music stopped but the notes continued to throb their eerie menace for seconds it seemed before quietness clamped down lets get out of here monk jerked breaking the ominous hush do not be in a hurry a suave voice interposed it was count ramadanoff who spoke no one having heard that sinister voice before could have mistaken it the prisoners stared helplessly trying to locate it then a huge slab of stone in the tower wall swung outward from within a hidden recess the count stepped forth he carried a modern automatic pistol in his hand i always plan my radio room with two entrances he purred and dictaphones are useful household articles to one such as i and now since you have violated my hospitality i must dispense with your valued company you are accordingly sentenced to labor in my pits strongbacked coolies sometimes last a month a big frenchman last year endured for two weeks monks hand thrust down and squashed out the feebly flaming alcohol lamp in the pitch darkness which flooded the tower room he hurled the glass lamp bowl at the spot where the count revolver in hand had been at the same instant all of monks great muscles acted to wrench his body to one side the action undoubtedly saved his life saffron gun flame and a bullet blasted out of the counts revolver the lead slammed so close to monk that it jerked a quick breath from his lips a loud curse from the count indicated that the man had been struck by the flung lamp both monk and ham leaped forward in the darkness to overpower him before he could recover from the blow but not more than a single step did they take then a blighting force seemed to rocket through their bodies pat also felt the enervating force it tingled from the feet to the tips of the fingers freezing the muscles into instant cramped immobility as firmly as though they were glued to their tracks their feet were fastened to that steelplate floor they could only tremble they could not cry out a white beam slashed from the counts flashlight he barked an order and out of the same secret entrance through which he had originally appeared a shadowy manfigure emerged the man moved silently and slapped handcuffs on the wrists of the three the count reached back and turned off an electrical switch the numbing force which held the prisoners fast to the floor flowed out of their bodies again and they were free to move as you must have deduced the counts suave voice sounded from beyond the flashlight these steel floor plates in alternate strips are wired to take charges of electricity you were rooted to the floor by the electrical current as efficiently as though you had sat on an electric railway track and grasped the third rail i myself as you see am wearing sandals insulated by thick rubber and so am immune to the shock he paused impressively i have just one thing more to say he continued in view of your belligerent attitude i have decided not to send you to the pits but to keep you here in the palace under my close observation kindly proceed down the stairs and we will join another member of your group professor william harper littlejohn johnny as i believe you refer to him near the bottom of the winding stairway the count requested his prisoners to halt he indicated a long slot in the tower wall which looked out upon an inner courtyard hemmed in as it was on all sides by starklyrearing palace walls the courtyard was in effect a dungeon pit a dozen feet above the flagstoned yard a balcony ran entirely around under the balcony the counts voice sounded in a silky purr observe your new quarters they looked thick iron bars extended from the balcony edge into the flagstoned floor below marking off a number of bare prison cells count ramadanoff spoke again do you observe that bundle of rags in the cell off to the left look closely while they strained their eyes in the courtyard gloom the interminable red lightning rippled out of the island volcano and sent its ghostly glare over the heavens cleverly arranged reflectors at the top of the courtyard dungeon directed the hellish glow downward to the flagstoned floor the still bundle of rags in the barred cell was bathed in the bloodred light johnny monk and ham jabbed fiercely and pat echoed it thats johnny in there you will be interested to know the counts odious voice continued that the cell bars are movable they are actuated electrically i have only to press a button and they rise out of the floor to allow a prisoner to step out into the courtyard or to allow the prisoner to be visited by an inhabitant of the courtyard what inhabitant pat asked quickly impelled by a foreboding curiosity i dont see any but the next instant she did a bulky shadow stirred from the flagstones propelled itself out into the red volcanic glare pat gave a little choked cry of sheer horror and started back ham leaned forward his fingers clutched so tightly on an imaginary sword cane that the knuckles were white splotches on his skin monk crouched his simian bulk frozen blazes he gulped the courtyard below had an incredible inhabitant monk ham and pat all three possessed what is commonly called an iron nerve yet the thing below aroused in them absolute horror a feeling of desperation they seemed hardly able to breathe as they stared at it it aint real monk choked at the same time knowing he was mistaken it is quite real murmured the count they stared as fascinated as birds suddenly confronted by a snake suddenly pat emitted a low strangled cry spun covered both eyes with her hands she trembled your chief this famous doc savage the count droned would no doubt be greatly interested by our little friend in the courtyard chapter iv radio trap as a matter of fact some very interesting things were at that moment on the point of happening to doc savage in the skyscraper section of midtown new york a man so thin that at first glance he seemed to be walking sidewise and who had a skin so white that it rivaled the pallid waxiness of a lily strode along with a briskness which belied his fragile physical appearance the man long tom or major thomas j roberts electrical wizard as he was known to the world at large was another of doc savages aids long toms specialty was electricity of which he had profound knowledge electrical patents recorded under his name were legion long tom looked like a man on his last legs but appearance in his case was a terrific lie his chalkwhite face did not indicate ill health he happened to be one of those rare individuals who no matter how much they expose themselves to the suns rays cannot get a tan there was incredible strength in his fragileappearing body long tom turned in at a building which towered a sheer mountain of gleaming stone and steel nearly a hundred stories into the sky the entire eightysixth floor of this building constituted the new york headquarters of doc savage past a phalanx of elevators in the skyscraper lobby long tom strode and paused before doc savages own private elevator shaft fishing in his pocket for a key this speed elevator was of doc savages own ingenious designing and it maintained lightning passage between that eightysixth floor and the main lobby as well as the basement where in a subterranean garage docs remarkably equipped motor vehicles were housed fitting the peculiar key to the hole long tom gained access to the speed elevator he jumped wildly just after he stepped into the lift there was blurred movement as something it appeared to be an amazingly elongated mouse scurried between his feet and disappeared around the corner in the lobby long tom popped his head out of the elevator to get a better view all he got was another impression of blurred motion the thing strangely did not seem to be running on legs nor did it writhe like a snake it flowed seemingly like a grayishblue streak it flowed against the shiny black oxford of a uniformed elevator starter and disappeared within the recesses of his trousers leg the elevator starter was an active young man who liked to practice tap steps when no one was around he was rather good at it but the dance routine he went into when that grayishblue streak flowed up his pants leg was like nothing executed on a stage or ballroom floor long tom grinned at first watching the young mans epileptic antics but suddenly he quit grinning and started forward with great strides he had caught a glimpse of the elevator starters face the young mans features were knotted in stark agony a shrill cry broke from his writhing lips his knees bent under him he fell arms gyrating wildly long tom caught him before he struck the floor and bent over the shuddering body his hands patting frenziedly over the young mans trousers leg attempting to crush that unseen thing responsible for the fellows tragic condition stand back long tom warned as men and women in the lobby surged close curious they paid no attention of course crowding in and staring asking aimless questions new yorkers invariably behave thus when one of their number acts in a manner slightly deviating from the normal get a doctor some one advised stand back long tom warned again sharply something bit him theres a poison snake or bug or rat or something loose in here youre all in danger even that did not move them with new recruits continuously pressing in from behind the crowd swelled closer curiosity was an emotion more rampant than fear then something happened which did move them they became all at once conscious of a man approaching he neither spoke nor shoved but there was such quiet mastery in his face and manner that instinctively they looked at him and then with a kind of awe pressed back to allow him free progress through the crowd the man was a giant his strong features kilned by tropic sun and arctic wind and held under superb emotional control seemed to be molded in bronze he topped by fully a head every man in the lobby and yet so perfectly was his huge frame developed prodigious muscles molded in perfect symmetry that it was only the manner in which he towered above the closepressed crowd that revealed him as the giant he really was his crisp hair seemed made of bronze only a shade darker than his skin his great neck sinews only slightly less hard than metal showed decidedly above his collar cables of the sinew ridged his hand the most remarkable feature of all about the bronze man was his eyes strange eyes they were hypnotically compelling like pools of flakegold stirred with restless life as though tiny whirlpools kept the fine gold flakes continually in boiling suspension for an instant after the bronze giant was discovered in their midst a hush settled over the lobby doc savage some one said others took up the name from lip to lip the murmur flew doc savage doc savage doc savage was bending over the unconscious form of the elevator starter cabled fingers which could without exaggeration twist a horseshoe into a straight line rolled up the trousers leg of his patient with gentle deftness on the calf of the leg two rows of blued holes were revealed there was no swelling no inflammation just that double row of tiny lacerations suddenly penetrating the manymouthed murmur in the lobby came a weird sound a kind of musical trilling which ran up and down the scale softly fantastically as though the sound emanated from the air itself it was suggestive of the sibilant slipping of an evening wind through palm fronds or of the call of some goldenwinged bird out of an arabian nights fairy tale this sound came from doc savage himself it was an unconscious part of the bronze man a thing he did in moments of stress or at times of great surprise doc savage spoke to his aid long tom the bronze mans voice was arresting deep pleasantly resonant he said with impressive simplicity we will take him upstairs doc lifted the unconscious man with noticeable ease the crowd made a path for them to the elevator on the eightysixth floor doc savage and long tom entered the headquarters reception room the room with its great comfortable chairs deeppiled oriental rug solid table exquisitely inlaid with ivory reflected the power and solid dignity of doc savage doc examined his patient more closely and administered a hypodermic long tom hovered close will he come out of it doc he will the bronze man said quietly doc listened then attentively while long tom related what he knew of the elevator starters injury did you identify the thing which attacked him the bronze man queried long tom shook his head i only glimpsed it it seemed to flow along the floor so fast i saw only a blur it didnt appear again after attacking this lad i think it must have been trampled under the feet of the crowd doc pointed to the parallel rows of lacerations on the patients leg only one thing could have left such marks centipede long tom hazarded correct doc said judging from the angle in which the anterior legs or modified fangs have dug into the flesh and the space between lacerations and the immediate effect of the creatures poisonous bites i should say one of a species of giant centipedes indigenous to the galapagos islands the galapagos thats where monk and ham and pat sailed looking for johnny they have arrived doc said grimly and they found trouble long tom stared how do you know this message came in over the shortwave set a few minutes ago doc handed long tom a copy of hams and monks message reading prisoners on fantastic island in galapagos group stop contact boris ramadanoff thirty three redbeach roadlong island stop grave danger long torn whistled im beginning to get it its a long arm that reaches from the galapagos to new york city this centipede was meant for you doc it was introduced into your elevator as an attempt upon your life perhaps doc savage admitted though the immediate intent was probably to render me unconscious as the first step in a kidnaping plot how do you figure that a centipedes bite is rarely fatal but we all seem to be tinder the thousandleggers shadow consider johnny was first apprehended now ham and pat and monk are taken and almost paralleling their message of distress comes this galapagos calling card in the form of a centipede long tom was silent for a moment as a result of their unceasing war upon the most ruthless and cunning forces of criminal adventurers doc and his aids lived always in the shadow of danger but at the moment they had no active case under investigation the developments of the last few minutes had struck with stunning suddenness what do you make of it doc long tom questioned uneasily frankly said doc i dont make anything its a complete mystery that address in the radiogram we ought to turn up a clue there doc nodded soberly i was on my way to redbeach road when i ran into the excitement downstairs let me suggest you see about getting this young man to his home then jump in your car and join me at the long island address doc descended in the private elevator to his subterranean garage the existence of which was known only to a few people outside the immediate circle of his five aids from among the number of specially built vehicles doc chose a lowswung coupe of gunmetal finish and expert streamlining the car was in reality a rolling fortress with bulletproof glass armored body chromesteel fenders and bulletproof tires of cellular rubber construction the garage doors actuated by photoelectric cells opened slightly as doc eased the car forward the doors closed automatically behind him as he rolled along the ramp into the stream of uptown traffic toward queensboro bridge and long island he headed the powerful motor under the beetlebacked hood propelling the car with silent flowing motion seeking redbeach road took doc savage to a semideserted tideflat region on long island sound he turned in at a brushgrown lane swirls of fog were rolling in from the sound an ancient brick house with sagging porch roof and rusted rain spouts loomed through the mist the place had evidently once been a fine estate but it gave every evidence of having been deserted for a long time doc parked under a draggingbranched elm which dripped water from leaves sodden with condensed fog he did not get out on the steeringwheel side of his car he slid over to the opposite side stepped to the ground and disappeared in a grove of wet birches doc had no reason to doubt the authenticity of the galapagos radiogram he was not expecting trouble but it was his policy never to take unnecessary chances after a few minutes of reconnoitering he approached a side entrance to the decaying mansion and knocked there was a long silence doc knocked again still nobody came doc savage through years of patient training had perfected his hearing to an animal keenness he could hear sounds above and below the scale audible to the average person within this house which appeared to be as deserted as a snatched grave he could hear movement hurried secretive manmovement docs bronzed features remained immobile he simply waited there by the door and after a while the knob turned from inside the curtained room and the door opened a foreignappearing man with shortcropped hair stood within the dimly lighted interior and invited him in you are doc savage he questioned in broken english i have been expecting you i am boris ramadanoff doc stepped inside but because he had been made wary the thing which happened next was no surprise to him with all his senses alert he caught the creak of shoe leather against the carpeted floor the virtually imperceptible movement behind a curtained alcove the bronze giant crouched and whirled as men flung in at him from three directions his cabled hands streaked out closing with a grip of iron on the shoulders of two of his attackers he lifted them both from the floor crashed them against each other and let them drop they fell stunned in an octopus tangle of arms and legs and doc with smoothly synchronized effort struck out with his appalling fists at two other of his attackers just once with each fist he struck one man went down wailing his face altered the other jarred into instant unconsciousness went down too and never knew until an hour later that his jaw was broken doc swerved as he caught a glint of the revolver drawn by the man with the cropped hair who had represented himself as being boris ramadanoff with a leap that in its force and precision could be compared only to that of a nepal tiger doc landed halfway across the room the shorthaired man smacked the floor with a solid thud and doc was standing there with a firm grip on the revolver he was absolute master of the situation there were ten men in the room besides himself most of them lay stunned as the result of docs rough handling the others cowered back afraid to try another move from outside the house in the direction of the roadway sounded a burst of machinegun fire echoes crashed flatly then a new noise broke with a harsh drumming it was a fearful sound doc savage recognized it as the bullfiddle bellow of one of the superfiring pistols carried by his aids the superfirer was one of docs inventions it resembled an overgrown automatic and pumped out a withering stream of socalled mercy bullets hollow shells filled with a drug which upon the slightest penetration of the skin produced instant unconsciousness it was docs code never to take a human life when he could in any way avoid it wafting on the hooting echoes of the superfirer came a sharp urgent sound of a man calling doc doc the bronze man recognized long toms voice he could guess what had happened long tom according to directions had driven up and he had run into a machinegun ambush as he stepped out of his car fierce fighter that he was long tom would never call for aid unless the emergency was dire the safety of his men was a thing that doc savage put before every other consideration on the instant doc gave up the advantage which he held over his enemies in the room he wheeled wrenched open the door and plunged out into the fog his great thewed legs carrying him in giant strides to long toms aid doc still held the automatic which he had taken from the man who had said he was boris ramadanoff doc savage carried no revolver or superfirer of his own it was the bronze mans contention that dependence upon such a weapon robbed a man of ingenuity made him helpless in the face of danger should he chance to be deprived of the accustomed weapon therefore doc depended upon his own strength and cunning to pull him out of desperate situations where strength did not suffice he resorted to some chemical or mechanical trick which was usually effective and always baffling doc did not scorn the use of a gun of course when emergency put one in his hands he used one now pushing out through the dripping birch leaves he came upon long tom who behind a meager rock shelter was caught in a threatened crossfire of submachine gun lead as the machine gun swiveled down to rake long tom the automatic in docs hand barked the single bullet damaged the hand of the gunner the man squalled and let his weapon clump to the ground the second machine gunner swung the snout of his deathdealing gun on doc holding down the trigger slicing a leaden pattern through the fogdrenched birches but the gun cut out before the leaden stream reached doc another coolly directed bullet from the bronze mans automatic took care of that the gunner cursed let his weapon drop and wrung his injured hand from behind the brick house now lost in the fog sounded the throaty roar of two automobile motors exploding into life there was a grinding of gears clashing shifts into second then a rapidly diminishing sound as the cars rammed into distance watch this pair doc called to long tom docs prodigious strides carried him in a matter of seconds back to the house as he had feared all ten of his attackers were gone he searched the house it was empty the uninjured men had loaded the unconscious members into the cars and decamped doc did find one thing a hastily scrawled note signed boris ramadanoff the note read next time it will be different we will use more than our fists long tom came up with two prisoners stay here and watch this place doc directed move your car up close to the house where we can keep in touch with each other through the short wave radio set while i tail those vanished cars but doc did not chase the autos the bronze mans coupe each car used by his aids and their eightysixth floor headquarters as well was fitted with shortwave telephone receivingandtransmitting apparatus as doc flung inside his car he clicked concealed switches under the dash static crackled from the radio loudspeaker and then the excited voice of colonel john renwick renowned engineer the fifth of docs five aids boomed out of the diaphragm renny was doubtless speaking from the skyscraper headquarters doc lifted a microphone from a concealed hook listening he said rennys voice roared better get back to headquarters quick doc theres the devil to payl chapter v russian tea party as the bronze man hurled his car down the driveway he spoke back through the microphone the radio apparatus functioned while the car was in motion of course what precisely has happened he asked over the air rennys voice bawled out of the loudspeaker that queer centipede that disappeared after clawin up the elevator starter well it showed up again did you manage to kill it yes but too late it attacked another man yes the man died doc are you positive the victim was killed by the centipedes bite except in the case of the aged or infirm death rarely results from nothing aged or infirm about this victim doc he was a thirtyyearold twohundredpound cop and he took about six breaths thats all after the bug got him and died in my arms that was too quick for a hypodermic to have done any good watch yourself renny doc spoke quietly but renny understood that the bronze man had delivered a warning that an ordinary man would have yelled is there anything else doc savage questioned no except theres a guy here waiting to see you who is he renny some russiansounding name boris ramadanoff from his radio speaker renny heard a weird note an almost soundless musical trilling he thought it was some static manifestation at first but almost instantly he identified the sound as that subtle emanation peculiar to doc savage in moments of stress or surprise doc renny thumped what is it the bronze man countered with a question of his own how long has boris ramadanoff been there long as i have anyhow ten minutes describe him oldfashioned little guy with a black cutaway coat and a black czarofrussia mush all over his map talks with an accent whats the excitement doc doc complied a man claiming to be boris ramadanoff sought to kill me a few moments ago sit tight renny we have good reason to believe that the lives of johnny and all those who went after him maybe our lives to depend upon what we do within the next few hours as doc stepped out of his elevator on the eightysixth floor and entered the headquarters reception room a remarkable man shifted his towering bulk out of a comfortable leather chair and lumbered forward alongside any one but doc savage this individual would have been considered enormous this man had a long puritanical face that was shrouded in gloom as though he had lately returned from a funeral and contemplated going to another as a matter of fact the expression was habitual whenever he was expecting action which was most of the time queerly enough it meant he was happy his fists swung restlessly at his sides huge fists they were larger than monks rivaling the flintpadded claws of a kodiak bear the bigfisted man was rennycolonel john renwick an engineer who had possibly built dams and bridges in more parts of the world than any man alive and knocked out more door panels with those appalling fists rennys hand waved toward a little man who had sprung up from a chair and was in the middle of a courtly bow this is boris ramadanoff renny announced the blackbearded little man continued to make bows i am prostrated he said in precise english from the colonel here i have just learned that you met with trouble from a man posing as myself do you have an address on redbeach road doc asked cryptically but yes the number is thirtythree within the last hour at that address several men one of whom claimed to be boris ramadanoff did try to trap me doc admitted the little mans eyes gleamed was he a bulletheaded fellow with closecropped hair the one who claimed to be ramadanoff correct i know of him j repeat it sir i am prostrate to think that you should be set upon by thugs in my own home the truth is i have many enemies doubtless they took possession of my house their intent being to apprehend you m the belief that you could furnish them with information regarding my whereabouts accept my most profuse apologies doc nodded you wished to see me he suggested from south america i have come to see you the little man bowed again and with a quick birdlike motion thrust a leather folder toward doc tins establishes your identity doc said to boris ramadanoff as he handed back the papers and now i seek your aid sir boris said earnestly i need it desperately lives hang in the balance i will come quickly to the point in the galapagos archipelago there is an unknown island upon which my brother the count ramadanoff has set himself up as master of life and death over every living thing causing ships to be wrecked and forcing the seamen to dig the circular pits why the pits doc questioned boris shrugged eloquently that is a profound mystery to me the count ramadanoff my brother transported all his worldly possessions from our native land to this island before the revolution he brought with him artisans who built a castle but of that original company i alone remain he has killed them all his real motive for such horrible deeds i do not know precisely what do you want of me i want you to go with me to that island in the galapagos and help free scores of poor devils shipwrecked seamen digging their way to death in the honeycomb pits purely an appeal in the name of humanity yes although in freeing those others you may also be in time to save one of your own men professor william harper littlejohn who is also a shipwreck victim of my mysterious brother the little man had meant this to be a smashing climax to his appeal but if he expected doc to show surprise over the information he was disappointed doc said merely how do you know about this i was on the island at the time my brother caused your aids boat to be wrecked since then i escaped you have come directly to me yes and thereby saved my life how do you explain the redbeach ambush i arranged for the house some time ago without seeing it expecting eventually to make it my permanent new york address the little mans eyes closed weakly a shudder coursed over him tremoring the very tip of his beard my fiendish brother anticipates every move i make his hand is long and ruthless he caused the trap to be set for me at redbeach road he caused the centipede trap to be set for me here thus bringing tragedy to those two the policeman and the elevator starter doc put another question to boris ramadanoff you have charts which will enable us to fly directly to the island but yes they are at your disposal how soon can we see them at your convenience immediately if you wish the sooner the better doc said ramadanoff bowed my thought exactly perhaps you will be moved to accompany me now to my hotel apartment we will go over the charts perhaps plan a course of action we will have tea doc assented as he and ramadanoff were leaving the bronze man advised renny best stay where you can keep in touch with long tom and myself in ramadanoffs apartment the apartment was like a thousand others in the metropolis doc sat studying charts while boris ramadanoff in the next room brewed tea soon the little man came out smiling the day for me is not complete without my tea you will join me no doc nodded shortly and fired questions relative to directional bearings on the unknown island the other answered concisely then excusing himself he left the room and returned with a silver tray bearing two crystal glasses twothirds filled with pale tea and a steaming chinalined silver pot please he said holding the tray before doc doc took one of the glasses and touched his lips to it there were two reasons why he did not drink more one reason was that he did not commonly indulge in stimulants of any kind reserving them only for their proper emergency use the other reason was that his acutely developed taste warned him of a foreign substance in the tea you do not care for it ramadanoff asked solicitously it is made in my own samovar which i carry with me always but perhaps you do not like the flavor of the galapagos herbs which i add to the tea to give it its unusual tang docs goldflecked eyes bored steadily at ramadanoff it is not the herbs to which i object it is the poison what the little mans hands holding the tray started shaking so that tea splashed from the spout of the silver pot poison doc repeated poison ramadanoff gasped incredulously he sat the tray on a low table and reached out for docs glass allow me he murmured he raised the glass to his nose sniffed cautiously his face went white to the roots of his beard the glass slipped from his trembling hand and crashed on the floor he slumped in a chair then roused himself to lean forward and sniff at his own glass he slumped back again weakly they are indeed poisoned he said hoarsely we have sir very narrowly escaped death do you recognize the active agent doc asked quietly yes since you have called my attention to it what is it a vegetable poison known to the best of my belief only to that galapagos madman my brother doc savage continued to hide his reactions behind a mask of bronze immobility you can explain he asked ramadanoff covered his face with trembling hands two gems on finger rings flashed a weird menace against his white hands one of the gems was an emerald thicker than a mans thumb the other was a ruby of equal size and fineness no the little man moaned i cannot explain as you yourself are aware i left the room where i was preparing the tea for only a moment a new voice sounded mockingly in the still room the moment was ample at sound of the voice ramadanoff stiffened in his chair as though an electric current had jolted through his body he jerked his head from side to side peering with a groan through spread fingers he saw nothing to explain the mocking voice his writhing lips wrenched words it is our doom the devils honeycomb he husked the meaningless phrase again the devils honeycomb his tortured voice trailed into silence only his long tapered fingers moved digging in agony into the flesh of his face and the gems on his fingers protruded from the whiteness of hands like baleful eyes chapter vi the platinum packet docs action when that mocking voice filled the room was in marked contradiction to ramadanoffs the bronze man sat perfectly still relaxed out of the dead hush his voice sounded controlled compelling come and join our tea party he suggested another crawling hush followed doc savages calm pronouncement then the closet door burst open a man shouldered out cuddling a submachine gun the man was the same bulletheaded hairclipped individual how had posed as boris ramadanoff at redbeach road while he kept doc under the machinegun muzzle the mans gutteral voice chopped orders and two men armed with automatics sidled in from the next room and two more machine gunners came in through the french windows from the fire escape the five guns covered doc and ramadanoff in a close deadly ring the bulletheaded mans blond face was a fiery red from the excitement of his triumph his blue eyes glittered with cold malignity as he looked at doc i promised you he gloated voice thick with his foreign accent that the next time we would use more than our fists and i promise you now that at the slightest sign of resistance you will eat lead from five guns interesting doc said quietly remaining relaxed in the chair what do you want of me the man with the closecropped hair scowled ill do the questioning you figured we were here didnt you doc nodded you made some slight sounds and there was your bodily odor which carefully trained nostrils could detect the other snarled nervously why didnt you do something about it if you knew you were on a spot doc started stretching his arms leisurely i intend to the devil you do the machine gun jerked the bullet head jerked too the thin lips barked an order rats the handcuffs get the big one first a thin man with ratty eyes one of those carrying an automatic wrestled handcuffs from his pocket and approached doc he walked warily his swarthy face apprehensive doc sitting in his chair continued his leisurely stretching until his arms were straightened out from his body in the form of a cross the rateyed man with the handcuffs stared helplessly with panic gripping him as he found himself so close to those great cabled fists dont go chicken rats the bulletheaded leader snarled we can put enough lead in him to sink through the floor to doc he ordered hold your wrists together for the cuffs all right doc said and when i do you watch what happens slowly like the wings of an eagle closing doc swept his arms to meet in front of him the eyes of every man in the room were on those closing arms doc meant that they should be there was purpose in his dramatics while he was centering their attention on his arms the toe of his right foot was deftly disengaging a novel metal packet from within his left trousers cuff it was a packet scientifically designed to withstand the utmost in internal pressure fashioned out of an alloy stronger than any other known metal the instant doc succeeded in releasing the packet from the cuff he kicked it away from him the bulletheaded leader alert for tricks caught the movement out of the tail of his eye watch his feet he snarled it was too late for anybody to watch anything a sharp cracking explosion blended with an unnameable sound a swoosh reminiscent of blanketing fire damp gas ignited in a coal mine almost instantaneously the room was choked with a yellowish smoke so dense that it appeared black for the space of a rasped breath there was silence then bedlam shrieked curses splintering wood and crashing glass as automatics barked and machine guns clattered in their panic at docs nerveracking maneuver the men butted blindly their guns making ruddy flashes in the smoke as they drove their bullets doc savage was in the clear at the instant of the smoke explosion he had rammed forward from his chair ducking low one thewed arm reaching for the spot where he knew boris ramadanoff to be the other arching upward like a scythe toward the bulletheaded leaders neck docs packet had contained an organic chemical held under pressure with the bursting of the packet the chemical had expanded instantly in a gaseous state moisture in the air had acted to cause partial combustion of the chemical thus generating the instantaneous cloud of smoke then the unexpected happened boris ramadanoff was not where he should have been in the chair and the shorthaired leader had shifted his position doc savage moved about very silently endeavoring to find ramadanoff open the windows and let this stuff out rapped the chief of the raiding party everybody be perfectly still so we can hear the bronze guy if he moves they could think quickly these men they had taken the one course which would most quickly result in disaster to the bronze man doc savage changed his position using the utmost stealth even his eyes could not penetrate the smoke some moments passed in utter silence then outside police sirens began to wail in the streets neighbors must have heard the shooting the excitement and summoned officers the cops ripped the man with the cropped head we gotta blow with that they made a concerted charge for the door doc savage moved swiftly but chanced to brush some one there was a pale burst of gunfire and deep crash of gun noise near his ear his hands streaked through the smoke knocking the gun out of the mans grasp and clamping a hold on the fellows neck there was more shooting in the room wild shots out the mobleader was howling the law is comin then amid a great rush of feet they were all out of the room they slammed the door a number of shots were driven into the panel from the hallway outside to discourage pursuit carrying the man he had captured under one arm doc savage hurriedly searched the rooms boris ramadanoff was gone doc savage carried his prisoner to the fire escape hurriedly descended his purpose was to watch the rear of the apartment building the police by now were around in front they would take care of the entrance doc savage noting that from the spot where he had parked his coupe he could watch the court that gave to the rear entrance of the apartment hurriedly carried his prisoner to the car it was just as well to get the fellow out of sight of the police thus avoiding the delay which explanations would necessarily cause the radio was still turned on in the coupe static crackled from its loudspeaker and mingled with that was the frantic crackle of words doc recognized the voice it was long tom no doubt speaking from the transmitter of his car at the redbeach road address where doc savage had left him on guard the electrical wizards voice came in frantic bursts almost inarticulate doc centipedes killing me the words suddenly ceased coming that changed doc savages whole plan of action any danger to long tom transcended in importance what might have happened to boris ramadanoff doc switched the coupes engine on with a squalling of tire rubber it got under way the car rocketed down the street siren squalling the use of the siren was permitted doc by the police department doc depended upon it of course only in dire emergencies while he wheeled along doc called through the coupes radio attempting to renew connection with long tom but he got no response he shifted his call back to renny at headquarters renny was listening in feverishly awaiting directions doc said better get over here to ninetyseventh street and stand by try to avoid trouble with the police leave your radio switched on in your car so we can keep in contact right doc renny answered doc replaced his microphone on the hook and turned his attention to the captive he had lugged into the car with him he was rats hanley the scrawnychested rateyed individual who had been going to clip the handcuffs on doc doc put pressure on him and learned from him that the bulletheaded man was jans bergman and that bergman worked for some one higher up gaining this information doc put rats to sleep by pressing on a hidden nerve later rats would be sent to docs crime college in upstate new york there by surgical means the crook would be cured of his criminal tendencies docs coupe crossed the queensboro bridge over the east river and continued along the sound sea fog still hung heavy over the rundown estate the decaying red brick house at redbeach road as doc swerved his car in at the gate and rolled silently up the brushgrown lane there was no sign of long tom the bronze man spent no time in reconnoitering with long toms life threatened even seconds were important he leaped from the car traversed the short distance to the house in great bounds he tried the door it was locked he used rennys pet method and one of his fists propelled by prodigious arm and shoulder muscles crashed through the solid oak panel like closing vises his hands caught the splintered wood and wrenched he tore the door half down then walked through the rest of it with forwardpressing force which shattered the entire door frame in the dim interior he moved around his footfalls sounded hollowly throughout the ghostly house the place seemed to be deserted he whipped out a flashlight snaked its searing rays over floor and walls black corners leaped into white life in one room he found evidence of a furious struggle furniture was overturned stillwet scarlet was on the carpet the crimson was not the most alarming thing scattered over the floor were the crushed bodies of fully a dozen centipedes hairy legs on some of the broken segments were still writhing while docs flashlight poked its white beam around the shambles of the room there came a sound from the hall of a floor board creaking doc whirled crouching a little the light from his flash snuffing out he glided to the wall and waited frozen close the creaking from outside the door sounded louder it paused started up again paused a second time within the doorway doc could hear the cautious breathing of the stalker the unknown took a wide step to clear the bare floor and land soundlessly on his feet on the carpet he got his foot on the carpet all right then his whole body left the floor with his feet as high as his head he fell heavily on his back doc had taken advantage of opportunity when the stalker took his wide step to pull the carpet from under him the mans trigger finger started jerking spasmodically plaster showered and the room rocked to gun thunder as orange flame stabbed the gray light suddenly the echoing uproar stopped there was a metallic clatter and a hollow thump doc with one leap had landed in the middle of the room knocked the gun to the floor with one hand and whacked the mans head down with the other he looked at the man he had knocked unconscious there was enough light to reveal features the man was no one doc had seen before but the next moment doc was looking upon a face which he had seen before it was one of the few times in docs life that an enemy succeeded in actually surprising him a floor board creaked in the doorway doc looked up to find himself covered at deadly range with a submachine gun the gunner had been able to advance without being heard because of the uproar the pistol shots had made the smooth skin of the man behind the submachine gun gleamed with pale menace in the half light the wide mouth opened thin lips writhed in triumphant grimace the gunner who stood there threatening quick death was jans bergman the man with the closecropped hair whom doc had left on ninetyseventh street manhattan in an apartment with a squad car of the police department closing there is only one way you could have gotten here so soon doc said quietly one way bergman agreed with his heavy foreign accent in the luggage compartment of your coupe you are clever doc said you had a lot on your mind bergman said grimly that helped stowed away in that compartment i heard the radio s o s that came through from here how did you leave everybody on ninetyseventh street pretty badly shot up it was a nice trick the smoke your last trick i think doc straightened hold your hands high bergman slashed keep them wide apart the fingers even keep them open doc complied and the feet step them wide apart doc moved to stand widelegged thats better bergman said you dont trick me this time doc stared with a certain grimness into the slitted eyes of his enemy he spoke what he was thinking but few men have opposed me before and risked another meeting i bergman bragged am a bold man perhaps only foolhardy you are the foolhardy one if you think you can outsmart jans bergman maybe youre wearing bulletproof clothes dont depend upon them my machinegun lead will push your face out the back of your skull doc shrugged asked evenly now that you have the bear by the tail what do you propose to do bergman stared slitted eyes glittering ill keep holding the bear by the tail until until a very few moments do you hear what i hear outside the house an auto was droning up the driveway the sound throbbed close died car doors slammed feet scraped across the wooden porch entered the house bergman yelled this way you guys foot scufflings muttered curses sounded closer inside here bergman ordered get a line on him from four angles if he moves a finger a quarter of an inch let him have it in the face four men black shadows in the gray gloom eased inside the room and took positions within a yard of doc machine guns poking for his face bergman bent placed his rapidfirer on the floor and approached doc with handcuffs in one hand and an automatic in the other he said hoarsely to cover his nervousness now you will see how we treat the bear we have caught by the tail something happened then and jans bergman was jolted by surprise greater than any which had come to him in his active life doc savage did not move his feet he did not move his hands he did not even move his fingers but suddenly there was a sound that might have been explosion in slow motion there was superwhite light too it was an undertone of blue and looking at it was something like looking at the arc of an electric welding operation it did things to the eye in fact it brought blindness that was momentarily complete doc savage had his own eyes closed tightly and thus escaped the blinding effect of the flash to a great degree he ducked for safety as lead spurted with earshattering clatter jans bergman began bellowing for his men to quit their suicidal shooting more than any of them bergman came near understanding what had happened he had caught the flash of docs wrist watch an instant before the flash came he had realized the bronze man had expanded wrist muscles so as to split the case and release the contents jans bergman of course knew nothing of the chemical composition of the powder which had been in the watch and when released into the air had ignited instantly by spontaneous combustion nor did he know that the powder was one which when burning it burned like ordinary flash light powder gave off those rays of light most destructive over a temporary period to the delicate nerve mechanism of the human eye while his enemies were milling about cursing shooting gradually getting vision back into their eyes doc savage plunged out into the hall he slammed the door behind him streaked through the shadowed house and outside into the sea fog which still rolled in from the sound the bronze man made for his coupe in the driveway got there in time to hear rennys frantic voice trying to raise doc through the loudspeaker there was no way of telling how long renny had been calling doc renny was rumbling urgently calling doc savage important doc grasped the microphone and said into the apparatus listening doc renny thumped i am shoving off in my car gonna join you ive learned something boris ramadanoff holy cow he a grinding crash blasted from the microphone it was a noise such as might have been made by two cars crashing together at high speed renny doc called in alarm are you all right all right doc sounded rennys voice faintly quick what did you find out a new voice jumped from the microphone harsh mocking the same thing youll find out savage after its too late chapter vii subway seizure doc trod the starter of his car but the great motor under its long hood did not throb into life it remained as cold and unresponsive as the waterdripping trees which loomed through the fog he dived out and lifted the hood he could see at a glance what was wrong wiring had been torn loose and ignition parts smashed jans bergman obviously had used a monkey wrench before entering the house the gunfire had ceased inside the house but it soon cracked from close outside lead skidded off the armor plate of the gunmetal coupe mushroomed against the bulletproof glass hoarse shouts sounded doc savage a bronze flash streaked from the other side of the car and melted into the fog bullets came hunting him chopping through wet branches doc twisted running low changed his course crashed on through fogdrenched trees and came out on the automobile highway a truck headed toward new york city pounded past the bronze man left the ground in a headlong leap and got a grip on the endgate of the wheeling truck he crawled over the gate and made his way forward from behind he had been sighted by his enemies machinegun slugs crashed out of the gray murk but fanned harmlessly past as the heavy truck swayed around a curve doc reached the truck driver faster he ordered the driver took one startled look and jammed the accelerator to the floor boards the truck stepped up to fiftyfive weaving ponderously on the wet pavement they covered a mile or two fiftyfive was not fast enough at that speed they could be overtaken by jans bergman a sleek sedan bored from behind doing a few miles more than the truck it was not bergman just a motorist as the motorist swung left to pass around the truck there was a thump on his sedan which gave the driver a badly startled moment a bigger moment followed for him when unceremoniously a door of his car opened doc savage had left the truck with a gauged leap landing on the speeding sedan let me have the wheel he ordered the bulgingeyed driver shot one gasping look at the bronze giant and complied doc took the wheel the speedometer needle went to eighty eightyfive ninety miles an hour they were out of the fog now doc looked behind there was a car tailing them doc recognized it jans bergmans the pursuing car was coming up fast they were running through traffic now doc did not want to subject pedestrians or his drafted driver to the dangers of speed and machinegun bullets he said to the man who had been driving slow down ahead there im going to the subway station im leaving you k ddoc savage the other stuttered he had recognized the bronze man he would brag about this experience for the rest of his life so would the truck driver the brakes squealed like stuck pigs tires slithered as the sedan buckled in toward the curb thanks doc flung and plunged down the subway stairs a second afterward jans bergmans car rubber smoking careened to the curb bergman stayed in the car but three of his men burst out and followed doc down the stairway the automatic steel doors of a manhattanbound express train were sliding shut as the bronze man flashed through the subway turnstile a splitsecond before the door hooks caught docs outstretched hand fastened on the rubbercushioned door edge and yanked the door open again he disappeared within the brightly lighted car and let the door slide shut at his heels the doors to cars in new york subway trains are connected by a safety mechanism to the motormans controls when doc stayed the closing of one door it delayed the starting of the train this gave jans bergmans men time to squeeze through the windows of another car the train started it roared its way through the black tube the train was crowded passengers were standing closely packed in the wide aisle some of them with hands reaching up to hold whiteenameled grabirons the cosmopolitan population of new york city is less observing perhaps than the citizenry of any other city in the united states people crowd the streets subways towering skyscrapers of the metropolis with blank looks on their faces immersed almost wholly in their own business it is doubtful if even as commanding a personality as doc savage would have been noticed in the closely packed subway except for the fact that the bronze man overtopped by a head the tallest man in the car people were beginning to murmur to point to gasp with recognition when suddenly there was a crash of sound a blinding swath of greenishblue light enveloping the train with an earpiercing shriek of brake shoes on wheeling metal the train bucked to a violent stop flinging many of the people in the car to the floor following the blinding greenish glare darkness shut down the darkness of underground places jet and utter acrid smoke fumes drifted through broken windows causing the panicstricken passengers to shriek and struggle in mad frenzy against each other a uniformed trainman switched on a flashlight and bawled at the top of his voice theres no danger short circuit thats all the light was knocked from his hand by somebodys thrashing arm but he kept on bawling to the milling passengers no danger take it easy no danger the new york underground is as safe as any railway in the world the passengers knew this gradually the panic subsided as the hoarsely repeated words no dangerno danger penetrated through the din to their consciousness for one person in that car there was danger however this had been no ordinary short circuit the unscheduled stop had been promoted by one of jans bergmans men as the subway went back and the cars lurched to a standstill docs great form was jostled to the floor with those others but it was not alone the jolting car which had taken doc off his feet in the darkness two hard swung blackjacks had thudded against his head before the lights went on under cover of the confusion it was a relatively simple matter for jans bergmans thugs to lift docs limp body through a window and carry it down the black passageway they cursed under their heavy burden and stumbled often being careful to feel their way by scuffing their shoes along the cold rail at the opposite side of the track from the hooded death of the live third rail they came to a place where a red light glowed marking an emergency exit in the massive expanse of dusty reenforced concrete onto the catwalk platform they lifted doc and carried him with effort up the steep steps out on the street with their limp burden they ran slam into a sticktwirling policeman one of the men cursed under his breath and his hand jerked toward his coat pocket before he could draw his automatic his quickerwitted companion had knocked his hand aside and blurted to the policeman subway accident train stalled this guy were carryin out overcome by gas lot more of them down there in the same fix sawful you better report it deceived conscious of his importance in being the first to turn in a report of a firstpage headline accident the copper rushed for a call box docs captors rushed for a taxi shoved the bronze man inside one of them clipped to the driver nearest hospital he spoke loudly for the benefit of spectators crowding close it was not in a hospital room that doc opened his eyes he was lying on his face on a brick floor his wrists handcuffed behind him he turned sidewise maneuvered his legs under him got to his feet light filtered wanly through a sidewalk grating illuminating the bare brickwalled room the place was damp mustysmelling a single steel fire door tightly closed was the only exit doc tried his weight against the door his ramming shoulder attack shuddered the rusty sheet steel with time he might break through then he heard voices outside and paused listening he could not catch the words at first while the muffled mumble of voices approached doc tried his strength on the handcuffs which bound him other times in his life he had broken the connecting link on a pair of handcuffs by utilization of sheer strength and wrist leverage muscles bulged and rippled now as he bent forward exerting a terrific tug on the steel cuffs he tried only once then he knew what he was up against his enemies were taking no chances with him his hands had been locked behind him with the most modern of tempered chrome handcuffs a sledge and chisel would not have sufficed to get the cuffs off his wrists it was work for a cutting torch another appalling feature was that the cuffs contracted took up slack when pressure was exerted against them forcing a saw edge into lacerating contact with the wrists crimson dripped from his skin where the steel points had gouged the bronze man bent his fingers upward till they could touch the end of his coat sleeve his fingers moved deftly unraveling a thread from a pocket in the coat sleeve his hands received a small metal envelope flexible as lead foil doc opened one end of the envelope with his finger nail and carefully maneuvered his hands to pour the liquid contents a few drops only on the handcuff links the talking men outside had now approached close enough to the door that doc could hear what they were saying he recognized one of the voices it was jans bergmans the blond bulletheaded leader with the skulltight skin had apparently just come in his glib pronouncements sounded strange when uttered with that foreign accent doc heard him saying you left his clothes on you fools a sullen voice answered we frisked him got everything he had you couldnt have gotten half of it savage has a thousand pockets you could yank out his teeth shave his head and pull out his nails and hed still have enough chemicals hidden on him to blow up a battleship the other curved nervously i dont like it monkeyin with this bronze guy youre getting your cut what goods heavy sugar if i croak before i can blow it there was a silence heavy oppressive then bergman asked has he come out of it yet look through and see for yourself the other snarled i aint even lookin at him any more hes like a poisonous snake to me there was a sharp metallic rasping as bergman slid back an eyeslit in the door and peered through he saw doc lying on his back feigning unconsciousness hes still out bergman said he ought to be we both of us give him a tap that would have busted a cable on brooklyn bridge there was another silence more ominous than the one before when bergman spoke again it was in a hoarse voice curiously hushed weve got to kill him he said maybe youre right the other muttered but how would we kill him a gunshot would bring one of them thousandlegged bugs crawlin down our necks a gunshot yes but a slit throat makes little noise get close enough to that bronze guy to cut his throat not for mine hes handcuffed suppose he skins out of them cuffs how can he how can he do a lot of things he does all right suppose he gets out of the cuffs he cant but if he does look at the knives we wont have to get so close to him as youre thinking bergman tiptoed aside from under a litter of boxes and excelsior packing he lifted two huge knives bonehandled with blades nearly half a foot in width and close to a yard long to docs ears came the gasped words sugar cane knives aint they right im going to cut savages head off the heavy door swung open with ponderous creaking and jans bergman followed closely by his companion advanced across the damp bricks toward docs prone form the assassins walked in a crouch their machetes raised high once in reach of doc they paused if i dont make a clean job with the first stroke bergman muttered dip your own knife in the blood then follow me out in a hurry the others teeth started chattering the massive knife wavered and he grasped it with both hands im practically out on the sidewalk now he husked bergmans knife lifted higher then down it chopped the wide blade glinting dully in the half light the first stroke was not enough it was not even a starter as the blade swished close doc whose muscles had been tensely braced against the floor wrenched head and shoulders forward it was too late for jans bergman to change his stroke the frightful blade slammed past docs head and sank inches deep in the mortar before bergman could pull the blade free before his companion could chop down with the other knife doc sprang an even greater surprise on them his arm free from the handcuffs struck out and down against the back of the mortarimprisoned blade knocking it forcibly from bergmans grasp at the same time his other hand streaked forward and grabbed the handle no handcuffs the other man shrieked in terror as he chopped down holding his knife in both hands doc parried the down stroke with the knife he had taken from bergman steel met steel with grinding clangor and the knife aimed at doc skittered in the air glinting like water heaved from a bucket and clattered on the bricks at the other side of the room no handcuffs bergman echoed and the skin was drawn so taut across his face in his terror at the spectacle of the bronze giant wielding that slab of razorblade steel that it seemed his cheek bones must poke through the explanation of docs handcuff escape was simple the liquid he had released from the flexible metal envelope had been an acid which made short shift of steel such as composed those handcuff links from outside the room sounded excited voices approaching footsteps doc bolted for the door brandishing his fearful weapon in the faces of the newcomers and scowling ferociously doc made no attack on these enemies he was looking for bigger game now he took the basement steps in a series of bounds from above he hurled the unwieldy cane knife down since he preferred to depend upon his own scientifically developed weapons locking the solid door at the top of the landing and bolting it against the aggregation below he stalked away in search of the master schemer he knew to be somewhere in the building in search too of renny and long tom whom he surmised must have been captured it was this last objective which had brought doc to this building back in the subway the bronze man had not been knocked out by those thudding blackjack blows he had only feigned unconsciousness reasoning that the quickest way to locate his aids if they were still alive was to maneuver to get himself taken to their place of imprisonment chapter viii the thumbhole death mounting from the basement flight after flight doc savage was not long in discovering the type of building he was in it was one of those ancient tenements condemned and abandoned on the upper west side of new york city near the hudson river it was a sore spot among the surrounding modern buildings its windows blanked out with timechipped whitewash as he raced upward his senses were alert to catch the faintest sign of human habitation his footfalls sounded hollowly against the worn splintery floor revealing wooden laths like the ribs of something long dead on the sixth floor doc paused here plaster on the hall floor had been ground under many feet doc went up another flight here too plaster had been crushed underfoot this building was several stones taller than most of its kind doc went up two more flights to the top floor the ninth there were signs of recent passage on the stairway leading to the roof doc went up at the top landing he had a mild surprise a fire door of modern steel construction had recently been built in it was solidly placed for the present doc contented himself with peering through a lookout slit in the door his almost inaudible trilling sound weirdly traversing the musical scale that small unconscious manifestation of doc savage in moments of stress or surprise tremored in the dead air of early evening as the man of bronze focused his eyes on the roof top he saw a plane a gyro of ultramodern design lashed down on the roof under a collapsible silkcloth shelter huge silencers were attached to motor exhaust stacks the roof had been leveled patched and reenforced and a raised apparatus a navy type catapult erected there was also a conventional cable device to kill landing speed that the roof had been used for landings was evident by the wheel marks the district was a mercantile one virtually empty after business hours surrounding buildings were low quite evidently the gyro did not operate from this base by municipal permit but it must have been able to go and come by night undetected luminous paint markings on the roof were commencing to glow in the twilight a clever scheme for night landings doc turned noiseless a shadow in the failing light and silently descended the stairs on the sixth floor he paused for a detailed search tracks in the plaster dust led to closed doors of several rooms before each door doc paused listening he made no sound he might have been a bronze floating cloud suddenly a screeching splintering noise crashed through the shadowed hallway a screeching of hinges rent from doors the splintering of the door itself under the terrific force of docs lunge doc listening in the ball had caught the sound of human breathing inside the room as he smashed through the door a man who had been bending over twirling the dials of a modern safe straightened up with a guttural curse from the crashedin door all that was visible of the man was a bulky body a blunt closecropped head jans bergman in the time it took for bergman to jerk his bullet head around to look doc savage had cleared the width of the room and locked a steelthewed arm around the man bergman struggled trying to get at the automatic in his pocket he was a big man during his youth in his native country he had won recognition as a wrestler but with docs arm holding tighter and tighter strength flowed out of bergmans body until if doc had not held him up he would have fallen to the floor doc appropriated bergmans automatic and tossed it clattering onto the writing surface of an oldfashioned rolltop desk then he allowed bergman to slump into a chair doc indicated the safe he said greed brings many men to ruin you did not leave when you had the chance you came back here to help yourself to more money yes lets get out of here while were alive jans bergman was staring up at doc with panic creeping into his slitted eyes sweat was beading his brow and glistening in the closecropped hair on his head who is your boss doc questioned bergmans thin lips pressed so tightly they disappeared in the stretched smoothness of his skin he shook his head doc shrugged all right but here is one you will answer where are my two men brought here before me bergmans lips writhed i have nothing to say doc settled himself on the large rolltop desk and said we will stay here until you talk savage youre nuts bergman jabbered its as dangerous for you in here as it is for me sometimes a man drops dead with nobody near him and what has killed him is a little hole in his temple about the size you could poke your thumb into what makes that hole doc queried curiously i dont know but ill tell you where your men are in the twilight murkiness of the room leaped a peculiar sound a kind of fleshy crunch bergmans words died in his throat his head flopped sidewise his shoulders followed it with flowing motion his head thumped hollowly against the floor his body lay there in a twisted huddle doc leaped from the desk made a quick examination his fingers encountered a bonecrushed depression in the left temple a smooth white wound in its size and contour the same as a mans thumb would have made if jabbed into white lard even as doc looked the wound commenced to ooze scarlet in red pin points which quickly built up an overflowing red puddle bergmans flat ear divided the two streams which ran onto the floor jans bergmans racketeering days were over he was a victim of what he had called the thumbhole death a voice sounded in the room precise the same thing could have happened to any one any one no one had come into the darkening room there was no one standing outside the doorway there was only that mocking voice rebounding from the walls doc turned fastened his gaze on the rolltop desk a laugh floated mockingly into the room congratulations my dear savage you have located my voice almost any second now you may look toward the doorway where you will be confronted by a second menace not so mysterious but fully as deadly as that thing which jans bergman so quaintly called the thumbhole death shoe scuffling sounded from down the hall doc turned to see two men loom inside the doorway they were clearly none of bergmans men they were squat mongol types massive of shoulder heavy of jowl they carried equally heavy squat weapons short guns with stubby barrels flared at the muzzle meet my personal bodyguard savage the voice sounded their weapons will interest you they are instruments of my own designing combing the features of a sawedoff shotgun and a blowgun each is loaded with slightly more than one hundred poisoned darts which can be released en masse by a trigger controlling an air pressure mechanism your face will be the target if you make it necessary for them to fire a faint whirring sounded and a stout oak panel in the side of the rolltop desk slid hack a man stepped out into the room and the panel closed behind him he stood there with black glittering eyes a little man with an old world manner and a black czarofrussia beard it was boris ramadanoff doc evinced no surprise ramadanoff said suavely why should you wish to be here to secure the release of my two men as he spoke the bronze man commenced sliding the toe of his right foot toward the cuff on his left trousers leg ramadanoffs beady eyes caught the movement hold it he slashed angrily and then in throaty asiatic speech barked an order to his bodyguard the two squat assassins mongol eyes closing to slanting penciled slits in their broad faces moved closer with their fantastic guns ramadanoff warned doc twice you have escaped with your tricks you will not do so a third time the movement of a single muscle will bring you death ramadanoff stepped forward stooped ran his fingers quickly around docs trouser cuff while the two mongols held a steady bead on docs head with those widelipped guns in the left cuff ramadanoffs fingers closed on a small metal packet he detached it with a quick movement and stepped back holding the article as gingerly in his fingers as though it were a nitroglycerine cap he deposited it upon the desk top being careful not to allow it the slightest jar he faced doc triumphantly now no more tricks the claws of the tiger are drawn the last words were spoken in a tone somewhat strange they were jumbled as if the tongue that made them was suddenly under the influence of an intoxicant then the little man with the beard demonstrated that be was an amazingly quick thinker as lightning strikes so did the realization of something wrong hit him and he acted simultaneously straight to the door he flung to literally fall through it doc savage had been slightly crouched waiting knowing what was to come the mechanism of the little packet was such that it would open shortly after being detached from his trousers cuff it held some of the anesthetic gas which he had developed long ago and which he used so frequently it was odorless colorless and its effects were almost instantaneous doc lunged through the invisible gas holding his breath had saved him from the anesthetic gas but where the door should have been there was something else doc collided with such force against an unyielding surface that he was flung back he kept his breath in his lungs as firmly set as concrete a smooth metallic surface was now mysteriously substituted for the wooden door which he had bashed in with his fists he heaved the full weight of his massive shoulders ramming with all the power of his remarkably developed body the surface did not budge from outside in the hallway sounded boris ramadanoffs sardonic if weak laugh his voice filtered in faintly he had not gotten enough of the anesthetic to overcome him just a trick savage he snarled i managed to press a button on my way out sliding the steel door into place from within the wall did you think i had no more protection for my safety than the wooden door you broke down you can stay in there and simmer in your own juice as the yankees say or perish in your own gas i will go hack and tell my brother it was a mistake for him to have sent me to new york for you you cannot be controlled very well then die chapter ix flaming fury while ramadanoffs voice droned from the hallway doc turned three great strides carried him to the window there was a grating sound that would have set a mans teeth on edge it was caused by doc savages finger tips scraping on smooth metal the same mechanism which had blocked the doorway with heavy sheet steel had similarly actuated a steel window barrier with both door and window barred to exit doc drove his metallic fist against the plaster of the wall it was a futile move he found that the walls had been reenforced with heavy metal back of the plaster still holding his breath against the anesthetic vapor doc hurled himself across the room he had one last hope the movable panel in the rolltop desk there was not time to look for the control key which would open the panel there was time only to crash it in swiftly doc felt out the boundaries of the stout oak with his sensitive fingers then his fists drummed a mighty tattoo fists were not enough his shoulders lunged he braced himself against the wall and kicked his hand drifted out and contacted a heavy chair swung it in a wide arc the chair splintered in a dozen places and the panel remained unmoved doc was trapped not from the gas however that would become harmless in a few seconds as it mingled more completely with the air faintly from an unidentifiable source voices sounded the words were not articulate but doc could recognize the tones it was renny and long tom shouting from some part of the building they had heard the noise and aware of docs presence in the building they were shouting in the frantic hope that their voices might direct him to their rescue they had no way of knowing that the bronze mans situation was as desperate as their own doc could breathe now the anesthetic gas had dissipated its powers due to chemical reaction with the oxygen in the air doc flung himself upon the massive rolltop desk his attack was not chaotic but planned so that he could use every muscle in his powerful body wedging himself on top of the writing surface with knees jackknifed in air feet braced against one end shoulders against the other he pushed muscles bunched and quivered and suddenly his jackknifed knees went straight there was a screeching of rent metal as he pried the desk apart doc parted the rest of the desk with his hands making an opening large enough to squeeze through he found that the sliding panel had given onto a secret upward passage converted from an old dumbwaiter shaft before plunging in doc leaped back into the room and examined the prone bodies of the two asiatics he found about what he had expected both men were senseless from the anesthetic gas and would remain so for some time turning doc bolted for the dumbwaiter shaft his hands closed on the rungs of a builtin ladder he streaked upward like an islander climbing a palm a partition had been roofed across the shaft at the next floor level in the side wall in front of him docs probing fingers found a wooden door his fists battered the blows ringing hollowly the door was as stout as the one built into the rolltop desk it did not yield but docs pounding occasioned an uproar from the other side of the door voices came through in wild clamor doc is it you that was long tom holy cow doc that would be renny stand back from this door doc called he jackknifed his body between the door and the opposite shaft wall using the same kind of bodily leverage he had utilized on the rolltop desk the door broke in with splintering crash and doc was catapulted inside the room beyond the palisades the sun had gone down already broadway was blazing under a sun of its own making a billion electric bulbs supplied scattered illumination for the rest of the city but the room in which doc stood reunited with renny and long tom was dark electrical connections had long since been cut off from the outside renny boomed the little squirt with the bush on his map yelled at us just before you came he said hes firing the building and leaving us to burn long tom cut in this trap would go up like a gasoline tank doc long tom added weve been trying to break down the door renny cracked his big fists together wailed ive nearly wore em out on that door doc she almost breaks but not quite it was evident to doc that renny considered his reputation at stake as well as his life renny had long boasted and backed up his boast that his bare fists could pound the panel out of any wooden door i smell smoke long tom gasped docs sensitive nostrils had already detected the acrid odor of the smoke this building has been fired he admitted listen long tom breathed a heartstopping sound the seething crackle of flames feeding through dry wooden floors wafted to them faintly we got to get out of here renny blared right long tom seconded come on renny doc directed we will try the door under the combined fist battering and shoulder lunging of doc and renny the door shuddered groaned then collapsed like a hut in a tornado smoke billowed in as all three men burst out it was slightly lighter in the hall in spite of the smoke stay close doc rapped and leaped for the stairway renny roared holy cow thats the wrong way the other way is down long tom added doc taking the steps several at a time did not pause to explain he disappeared in the smoke and darkness of the floor above and forged on up the next flight of stairs his flakegold eyes ever alert had seen something his aids had missed doc had glimpsed boris ramadanoff scuttling around the bend of the stair landing above the bronze mans giant strides slashed the distance between himself and the murderous little man at the top of the roof flight doc was only a little behind ramadanoff went out on the roof like an eel he got the door shut behind him a snap lock caught and held as doc rammed the panel with terrific force after doc had tried his strength on the door that once he did not waste time on it again from the roof boris ramadanoff shouted with raw gloating stay there and burn doc did not hear he had already vaulted the bannister and landed on the smokefilled floor below he met renny and long tom coming up down he ordered back into the room out of which we just came we cant doc renny thumped fires already cut us off from that floor long tom cried creating its own draft the fire funneled up the stairway below them a few flights down there was a crash as something collapsed down doc ordered and led the way unquestioning long tom and renny followed him shielding their eyes slapping at flames that caught their clothes this was our only chance doc threw out as they gained the room long toms eyes were seared shut with smoke doc where are you this way they followed his voice crowding into the shaft out of which doc had smashed his way a few minutes before to rescue them splintering wood showered down on their heads the buildings falling renny roared but it was only part of the building the overhead partition which had been built in to seal off the shaftway doc had torn it out doc said follow me up theres no ladder above we will have to brace ourselves feet and shoulders in the shaft and shove with our hands it is only two floors to the roof is the shaft open at the roof long tom gasped if it is not we will have to open it doc replied what goods it gonna do to get on the roof renny questioned hoarsely save your breath doc advised climb the shaft was not open at the roof while the fire roared and crackled behind them and smoke packed about them like black mortar doc struck and heaved against the roof surface which capped the shaftway the bronze mans metallic muscles were more enduring than the planks which opposed them his prodigious hands tore out a hole big enough for his body to follow from the roof a throbbing drone reached his ears it was boris ramadanoffs gyro plane it had taken ramadanoff a few minutes to clear the airplane of its silkcloth covering but now the machine its windmill revolving was wrenched along by the navytype catapult for a takeoff the gyro pitched dangerously to one side as it cleared the catapult the side pitch gave boris ramadanoff a nasty moment as the roof tops below tilted dizzily but the whirling windmill blades steadied the plane and ramadanoff snatched an easy breath he was totally unaware of the reason for that unexpected side pitch many curious persons crowding the street to watch the fire could have told him the cause gasps left many throats as watchers saw something they could hardly believe they saw the gyro float up from the roof glinting red in the lurid reflected light of flames that alone was exciting enough an escape by airplane from a burning building the gasps which sprang from a multitude of lips however was not occasioned alone by the rising gyro what brought the sound from throats was the figure of a man clinging to the tail skid of the gyro causing the windmill plane to pitch alarmingly and the mans dangling body to swing from side to side the spectacle was visible for only an unreal instant then the lifting gyro and the man dangling in thin air from the understructure were blotted out by smoke if the awed watchers could have seen what followed they would have received an even greater thrill climbing with an agility made possible only by tremendous muscles doc worked astride the fuselage and toward the open cockpit of the gyro boris ramadanoff uttered a hoarse yell when warned by the behavior of the plane he turned and saw the bronze man come into view the presence of doc on the plane after an iron door had slammed in his face locking him in a burning building smacked momentarily of the supernatural at least to ramadanoff the bearded man as though bitten by demons reared up and plunged overboard from the opposite side of the cockpit his body dropped he wore a parachute and this promptly bloomed snubbing his fall doc reached the cockpit and took the controls back to the burning building he headed the crowd in the streets got another thrill they saw the gyro float in through smoke bloodred in the reflections of the flame and like a gigantic humming bird settle out of sight on the roof top the excitement the street watchers experienced was not a fraction of the one long tom and renny felt there on the blistering roof the crowd yelled itself hoarse when the gyro arose again most of them thought they were witnessing a sensational fire department rescue although a few noisily expressed the opinion that the whole thing was a publicity stunt of some kind chapter x equatorial flight when boris ramadanoff bailed out of the gyro his parachute lowered him into a narrow strip of parkway between riverside drive and the hudson river there was but one person to witness his landing that individual being a bench derelict sodden with alcohol he merely stared wildeyed believing the spectacle of the man crashing into the underbrush with something like a bed sheet fluttering over his head to be a variation of the old pink elephant theme boris ramadanoff therefore was enabled to land virtually unseen skinning out of his chute harness and scrambling through the park shrubbery he scurried up the long flight of stone steps to the street level and caught a taxi on the drive on tenth avenue directly west of the times square district he directed the driver to the curb wait for me he called and leaped out and ducked into a grimy doorway he was back soon clutching a stiff object wrapped inside a trailing blanket west street he barked riding toward the river ramadanoff took the ends of the blanket and wrapped them more snugly about the object which he carried west street skirts the hudson river and is lined with docks when ramadanoff let his taxi go he walked a block down the dimly lit riverfront street till he came to a large roofedover pier the huge brick building was smokestained oldlooking there was nothing to distinguish it in appearance from any of a thousand other piers in new york accommodating the worlds shipping a sign over the corrugated metal door read hidalgo trading company as ramadanoff very well knew there was something unusual about this pier it was not practically speaking a pier at all it was doc savages waterfront hangar it housed an assortment of heavierthanair craft as remarkable as the ultramodern land vehicles garaged in the basement of docs skyscraper headquarters ramadanoff made no attempt to force an entrance into the sprawling bulk of the hangar he had scouted the locale before he knew that the hangar protected by photoelectric eyes and magnetic fields was as impossible of entrance as a bank vault would have been what he did was ridiculously simple on each side of the driveway door was headhigh rather scrawny shrubbery ramadanoff moved along the dim street until his dark figure merged with the shadows of the shrubbery any one watching could have observed that his figure did not show again on the other side of the shrubbery but there was no one watching the little man squirmed into the very center of the concealing branches and crouched down he pulled the blanket wrapping from his parcel exposing a submachine gun of nonglinting bluemetal finish when ramadanoff weaponless had ducked out of the taxi into the tenth avenue doorway it was to make a lightning quick call on one of jans bergmans men who had a room at the address bergmans demise was not yet known to his men so it had been no trouble for ramadanoff to arrange for the use of the machine gun doc savage ramadanoff knew would waste no time in arriving at the hangar to take off for the galapagos of course doc would go by plane but the bronze man ramadanoff was determined would never even enter that hangar he would drop before a withering blast of ambush lead after a while a sedan rolled down the street and nosed silently in the hidalgo trading companys driveway ramadanoffs pulse quickened then slowed he had expected doc to stop the car and get out and open the hangar door but the car ran on without slackening of speed pointing headon for the closed rolldown door at the instant ramadanoff expected a collision the door rolled silently upward actuated by a shortwave radio beam transmitted from within the car to a detectorrelay device connected to an electric dooropening mechanism docs car disappeared within the hangar and the door closed down ramadanoffs face was purpled from his rage at missing the last chance he would have to prevent doc from flying to the island he had a ferocious impulse to empty the machinegun drum against the corrugated metal door in sheer insane frustration a moment later he was glad that he had not wasted those bullets amazingly the door opened again ramadanoff could hear a scuffling of shoe leather against dusty concrete then a huge bronze figure became visible in the door the drowsy quiet of early evening was smashed by thunderous macabre rattle as ramadanoff held the trigger and swung his stream of leaden death back and forth mindful of bulletproof garments he aimed high for the face a great many bullets sprayed harmlessly against the corrugated metal surface of the hangar front but fully a score were direct face hits on the bronze mans figure in the doorway there might have been more hits but suddenly the machine gun silenced a crashing weight had descended into the shrubbery apparently from the clouds grinding the underbrush the assassin and the machine gun into the ground ramadanoffs finger was broken before he could clear it from the trigger but the finger was the least of his troubles he felt himself lifted and slammed he knew what had him doc savage doc had leaped from a hidden door high in the warehouse side directly on top of ramadanoff doc dragged ramadanoff inside the hangar door and said to long tom haul robbie in and get the door shut long tom chuckled robbie will be needin a new paint job on his face doc yeah renny boomed and a set of new teeth ramadanoff stared blearyeyed as long tom and renny pushed the huge bronze figure which had appeared in the doorway and taken the bullets inside and closed the hangar door a dummy he ejaculated sure long tom said a mechanical likeness of doc robbie the robot and can robbie take it renny rumbled had his face shot off him four times so far long tom added ramadanoff was muttering profanely to himself dont you get it whiskers long tom demanded ramadanoff scowled renny explained sardonically doc likes to cooperate so he provided the shrubbery outside for guys that want to pot him from cover doc ordered the bushes big so as to give plenty of room for a man with a gun to hide inside long tom continued and the bushes are wired so that any one crowding inside of em will cause a signal to flash doc was already penetrating deep within the hangar come on he called back dragging their prisoner renny and long tom hurried after doc savage the bronze man was swinging inside the cabin of his large speed ship a threemotor job with streamlined alloy hull the wings tapered into the fuselage for minimum wind resistance it was a combination landandsea plane and had a speed of nearly three hundred miles an hour we taking this one doc long tom queried hand waving out to indicate the plane before them right the bronze man said renny and long tom shoved their prisoner inside and piled in after him with the three supercharged motors delivering their full quota of power the big speed plane hurled south through the atlantic seaboard darkness they caught the slumberous twinkle of early morning lights in cuba and roared on doing better than three hundred miles an hour as they climbed high and rode the stratospheric air currents to the canal zone at colon they got a surprise they set down for refueling a darkskinned man in a white linen suit popped out of the directional radio station operated by the department of commerce and ran across the field toward docs plane the man was waving a radiogram for doc savage he called the darkskinned man leaned against the lowslung cabin with a hand resting on the ledge of an opened porthole and his black eyes were centered in rapt admiration on doc as the bronze giant opened the envelope and read the radiogram have discovered boris ramadanoff is working with his brother count ramadanoff stop disregard our other radiogram stop alive but may not be for long stop better do things monk doc handed the radiogram to his aids huh renny snorted we got boriss number before they did i guess theyre still alive long tom said tensely yeah and well be there in a few hours renny thumped watch the plane doc instructed renny do not let ramadanoff out or let anybody else come near doc with long tom the electrical wizard accompanied the darkskinned man back to the broadcasting station to try to get a line on what was the matter with the radio beam a ship carrying one of my aids while following your beam was recently thrown off its course and wrecked doc advised the trouble must have been with the receiving apparatus the darkskinned man said impossible interposed long tom who had made the boats radio installation and knew it was as perfect as was possible then examine my layout the radio station attendant invited doc and long tom made a careful examination then returned to the plane whatd you find out over there renny queried long tom answered everything was in perfect mechanical shape refueled the plane took off soared high over the feverish panama jungle then left the lush green for the sparkling blue of the pacific as engines throbbing it bored steadily southward toward the galapagos long tom was bending over the audiofrequency amplifier he jerked his head phones off and held one to docs ear a dotdash combination in sharp staccato sounded plainly the a wave is coming in too strongly long tom said are we off the course renny rumbled we are off the course as transmitted by the beam antenna back at the canal zone doc stated but thats the right course renny protested is it doc asked mildly its the beam the others were riding when their ship piled on the rocks renny rumbled we want to go where they were wrecked dont we yes doc said but this beam may not be directing us there i get it renny muttered if theres nothing the matter with the instruments the trouble must lie with that darkskinned baby at the canal zone who is transmitting the signals doc nodded he transmitted the beam so that it put johnny on the rocks it may be that now he is laying down a beam which if we follow it will land us in the pacific ocean with empty gas tanks renny snorted thinks hes sendin us on a oneway trip huh long tom was struck with an idea stop me if youve thought of this one doc but how does the course as broadcast to us by the radio beacon compare with the latitude and longitude of the island as given you by boris ramadanoff the two check perfectly doc said then ramadanoff gave us the wrong directions too it is almost certain that he did want me to bring him in doc renny asked eagerly yes doc said it is time ramadanoff talked renny hurried aft unlocked a small individual cabin roused boris ramadanoff out and trundled him forward to doc the bronze man turned the plane controls over to the sensitive mechanical arms of a robot pilot and faced boris ramadanoff i want the latitude and longitude of your brothers island doc announced i gave it to you i want the correct latitude and longitude doc interrupted severely the one i gave you is correct the little man insisted stubbornly doc fixed his goldflecked eyes on ramadanoff while he spoke in brittle tones to renny and long tom get out the rope renny and loop it over ramadanoffs right foot the bronze man said long tom open the side hatch renny looped the rope over ramadanoffs foot and pulled it tight renny hauled back so exuberantly that he pulled the bearded little man off his feet long tom threw open the side hatch revealing a patch of bluethe pacific ocean perhaps a mile below pull his chute off long tom doc directed long tom slipped the packchute from the little mans shoulders the packs contrivances developed by doc himself were not bulky and they could be worn with no more inconvenience than a heavy coat would have occasioned doc and his men when in the air were usually equipped with the safety devices and in this case they had provided one for their prisoner doc looked at ramadanoff and said renny here is going to lower you through the hole he will lower you down hand over hand slowly till he comes to the end of the rope then if you have not indicated that you will speak the truth he will let go the rope doc looked toward renny lower away ramadanoff had been lowered half of the ropes length when the bluff worked he looked up and squalled like a wild cat ill tell he screamed hold him there a minute renny doc ordered he looked down at the cringing prisoner the location ramadanoff screamed latitude and longitude down to minutes and seconds he had it on the tip of his tongue we will let him cool off now doc decided renny take charge of him will i doc renny boomed ramada noff was so giddy from being dangled on the rope that he could not stand when he was first drawn back within the plane long tom fitted the packchute back on the mans shoulders and renny dragged him ungently aft and locked him in the fuselage compartment again the plane ran into a fog bank as it droned southwest doc climbed the plane and came out on top in dazzling sunshine occasional rifts in the fog showed him the blue pacific below eventually a rent showed something else besides water land below renny announced a small island cocos island doc said we take our final bearings from here the next land we sight will be the galapagos that wont be long at the rate were traveling long tom said it was only a brief glimpse they got of cocos island then the fog closed in again like swaddling cotton seeming to wedge the hurtling plane against the sky bring out the prisoner renny doc suggested some time later we will try again to find out something more about this mysterious devils honeycomb renny grinned and went aft to unlock the compartment door well make him talk long tom affirmed grimly but they did not make boris ramadanoff talk renny threw open the prison compartment door and stared jaw sagging his generously proportioned mouth yawning wide like a tunnel opening whats the matter long tom called sharply matter renny howled dazedly he turned dived forward he busted a hole in the floor renny squalled hes jumped out how could he break out long tom demanded nobody can break through the alloy skin of this plane its even bulletproof how did he do it renny doc asked quietly that was the compartment where we had the floor ripped up the other day doc renny muttered it wasnt welded just small bolts set in temporarily doc looked at the chart it is too late to do anything about it now doubtless ramadanoff bailed out over cocos island it is entirely too large an island for us to waste time trying to locate him the great trimotored speed ship scudded on riding above the fog bank like a gigantic water bug skimming the surface of quiet depths howre we gonna locate anything in this fog renny wanted to know later we can get our latitude and longitude above then go down and land on the water to wait till the fog lifts doc explained that of course may not be necessary that logical plan it developed later was never to be put into execution at the present latitude and longitude given by boris ramadanoff under pressure the fog became strangely reddish in color over a considerable area this crimson glow was uneasy flickering brightening and dulling as though the leaping fires of hell itself strove to break through doc banked the speed plane in a wide spiral around the scarletstained sector what caused that renny rumbled awe making his voice somehow queer volcano doc decided active lets ease down long tom suggested they did go down but not easily an earsplitting crash sent a convulsion through the plane then tilted it in a mad dip accompanying the detonation flame sheeted out enveloping them they were stunned temporarily blinded whole back end blown off renny bawled lost half the fuselage long tom shouted the plane was plummeting weaving dizzily shuddering and bouncing in the air as against something solid jump doc ordered spill air to guide your chutes away from the red portion of the fog chapter xi shredded death the plane had been very high when the explosion occurred their parachutes were larger than the average so they went down slowly and because they pulled at shrouds on one side they skidded through the sky they left the domain of lurid red light behind in fact lost from everything but each other in the fog they overdid the skidding a little they came down in water close over the sea the fog was thin doc and renny releasing themselves from the parachute harnesses a few feet above the water plunged into the seething gray expanse within easy hailing distance of each other long tom plummeted down farther to the left where the plane hit they could not tell although it was probably nearer shore and off to the left treading water and trying to orient himself in the smother of waves renny bawled what caused that explosion doc a bomb obviously the bronze man shouted back but we searched ramadanoff before we brought him aboard renny pointed out ramadanoff did not do it doc returned it must have been done at the canal zone landing field the darkskinned guy renny roared the one who brought the radiogram out and stood by while we read it right doc agreed the fellow evidently had his orders in advance renny took water coughed it up and sputtered but what made the thing go off right when we were over the island probably a radio control detonator actuated by a transmitter below doc savage hazarded the mechanism would have been fairly simple for a good radio technician to construct the bronze man was treading water the water all about them seemed to be swirling like a furiously running stream there was a pronounced undercurrent that at times nearly took them under holy cow renny thumped some swimming pool a tide rip doc savage offered it seems to be carrying us offshore unexpectedly a streak of phosphorescence angled in toward the bronze man the streak was preceded by a waterslashing fin sharks long tom yelled from near by but doc had already seen the racing black fin make for the reef the bronze man shouted to long tom the black fin swerving close to doc went under in a boil of bubbles and phosphorescence doc went under too half a minute later long tom uttered a hoarse cry and kicked out with his feet he thought he was being attacked by the shark but it was only doc who had swum under water and come up alongside him with docs assistance long tom gained rapidly in his fight against the current nearing the coral reef and temporary safety a shark slashed in at them try to make it alone doc jerked and disappeared under water again almost under the chisel nose of the attacking shark the shark dove with the bronze man rolling long tom made it to the jagged reef and a moment later doc stroked up and muscled out of the water alongside him long tom coughed water playing tag with that maneater drawing him away you saved my life doc listen doc cautioned the putput of a motor launch sounded strongly whatll we do long tom gulped could you make it ashore swimming afraid not long tom puffed i was almost gone when you reached me renny might not make it either doc said thoughtfully the motor launch nosed around a wavelaced reef into close view men in the bucking launch waved doc answered their signals long tom growled tragically wrecked just when we could begin to do some good our superfirers all our weapons at the bottom of the ocean and now well be taken prisoners the same as johnny pat monk ham and the rest of em a bellow of distress reached them faintly through the whipping wind its renny long tom gasped sharks doc took the water in a shallow dive which bounced him to the surface and sent him streaking through the short steep waves toward rennys voice the motor launch came on picked up long tom and bore down upon doc and renny a boat hook snagged rennys collar and drew him alongside hands reached down and helped him aboard sharks some one exploded right alongside a boat hook probed at doc the shark reached the bronze man doc and the shark disappeared in a welter of churning water bubbles streamed up and broke whitely on the dark surface but only at first did they break whitely very soon they were breaking red the red stain spread over the water a gory blanket around the pitching launch renny and long tom stared at the water in dawning horror the half dozen men who had come out in the launch crowded the rails chattering in queer languages as they scanned the surface looking for visual evidence of the tragedy indicated as occurring below blood in the water brought more sharks closing in the launch threaded back and forth until the red stain was diffused but doc did not again appear the helmsman swung the launch around and started bucking the currents toward the shore all the crew were dressed in the same fashionsimple loin cloths and collars of lizard hide the launch docked at a pier running out from the palace of the ramadanoffs inside the palace in the huge room that highvaulted cavern fashioned from wooden beams and black volcanic rocks long tom and renny were welcomed by the count ramadanoff in the same suavely polite manner in which he had greeted monk ham and pat the heatless blue flames leaped as before within the mammoth fireplace causing shadows to dart and vanish throughout the luxuriantly furnished hall from high overhead the crystalspangled candelabra hanging from its massive chain and burning fully two hundred candles shed a yellow light which penetrated weirdly to the middle stair landing hung with the long curtains of somber ruby velvet long tom and renny grieftorn as they were by docs disappearance after the attack by the shark could not help but feel the menace which stalked through the dank air of the place the count ramadanoff himself appeared as some one not quite real he was a towering giant almost as large as doc this much they realized with his czarofrussia beard his courtly bearing he appeared to be a replica of his brother boris a replica fully twice as large the count bowed said precisely my guests have a predilection for arriving here in wet clothes i will have a change of dry garments laid out for you the counts thin lips writhed hack to emit a sharp cobralike hissing a wizened slave padded forward on bare feet in answer to the summons while the count issued orders for the preparation of a chamber for his guests long tom murmured an aside to rennyyou see what i do renny grunted the slave hes a member of johnnys expedition or was wasnt he long tom nodded weve got to put on an act until we get the lay of things here its all queer and we cant let this whiskered devil know we think doc is dead renny whispered the count looked sharply at renny so he murmured the bronze man is dead renny stared belligerently aware that the count must have read his lips long tom smoothed things over while rennys big fists started swinging nervously at his sides long tom said there seems to be a mistake its the shark thats dead the counts eyes glittered i hope you are right i am eager to meet personally this doc savage what we want to know renny put in bluntly is where are ham monk johnny and pat the count answered precisely you have reference doubtless to brigadier general theodore marley brooks lieutenant colonel yeah renny interrupted theyre the ones where are they the count shrugged how should i know this is an extremely remote island in the galapagos not an information booth rennys glance roved fiercely around the great hall and fastened for an instant upon the grand piano draped with rich seaotter furs the counts cruel eyes flashed i assure you my dear renwick the persons you mentioned are not concealed in my piano the slave in his loin cloth and lizardhide collar padded down the broad stone steps and prostrated himself before his master but his eyes for a flashing instant had caught long toms with a significant glance you may follow the slave the count announced when you have changed to dry clothing i will receive you down here as long tom and renny mounted the sweeping spiral of the stairs and passed beyond the rubycolored drape held back by the slave count ramadanoffs voice followed them with suave menace one thing remember ramadanoff intoned the shadow of the devils honeycomb lies everywhere upon this island inside the chamber assigned them the slave bent to take off long toms wet shoes renny reached down and poked a huge thumb and finger under the mans chin and tilted his head up dont you know us he asked the man squirmed looking at renny out of fearhaunted eyes not i he whispered i dont know you downstairs you did long tom suggested that was before he reminded me reminded you of what the mans voice rasped hoarsely that the devils honeycomb is a menace everywhere on the island wheres the rest of your party renny demanded i dont know anything the man mumbled you mean you wont talk the mans lips whitened anybody who tells anything on this island dies renny grunted with disgust at the display of fear it ought to be safe to talk here long tom urged its safe nowhere muttered the other you talk and you die how do you know the electrical wizard insisted mister ive been standin close when it happened the slave mumbled a little hole comes in your temple about the size you could jab your thumb into baloney renny summed it up suddenly flooding the room a weird strumming music vibrated fantastic melody it struck the ear with pulsations that seemed to raise goose flesh over the entire body and cause the hair to tug at its roots whats that renny demanded glaring about swinging his big fists the man who had become a slave was staring with panic bulged eyes he choked out words the count playin at the piano so what renny boomed so somebody dies nuts renny rumbled the man rasped stubbornly every time ive heard him play like that somebody has died right after why your own men and the girl he choked off his words with spasmodic effort both long tom and renny seized him and shook him simultaneously what about our men and the girl rennys great voice was thunder in the grand hall below the music had stopped though faint mocking echoes hung about like an exotic perfume all right the man gasped ill tell you i might die for it but if i dont tell you ill die anyway but first is it true that doc savage is dead a shark took doc renny said bleakly he didnt come up the man wilted then its no use without savage we cant talk long tom jabbed what were you going to tell us the man opened big mouth to speak but it was not his voice which long tom and renny heard there was a fleshcrawling sound a bony crunch and the man who would have talked plunged forward his head striking solidly on the floor his body flopping over and lying inert renny and long tom stared wildly there had been no visible movement within the room just that crunch then the man falling limply renny fists swinging went tearing around the room pulling aside curtains banging closet doors looking under the beds he found nothing with long tom he examined the limp body the man was dead from a wound in his temple a hole a birds egg might have dropped into or a mans thumb all at once welling with chill mockery music from the counts piano flowed through the room again renny jerked upright swerved for the door come on he barked at long tom come on where to punch the counts face out from between his pointed ears renny roared well settle all this mystery now its a good idea long tom agreed and plunged out after renny past the hanging ruby drapes on the middle landing and down the wide stone steps three at a time they rushed the count rose from his piano to confront them with suave dignity why do you hurry gentlemen he questioned dark eyebrows arched momentarily disarmed by the counts quiet manner they slowed their precipitous descent came forward slowly but you have still your wet clothes on gentlemen the count chided when we get through you wont worry about clothes renny threatened who killed the man in our room long tom demanded the count smiled thinly your bellicose manner becomes understandable a man has been killed you say in our room long tom grated the big bearded man queried there is perhaps a hole in big temple if you know that you did it renny howled starting his forward rush the count unperturbed lifted a hand one moment my dear renwick it is only natural that i should know about the thumbhole death such deaths occur with great frequency on this island while he talked the counts white tapering fingers toyed with a small object a slim thing of flashing gold long tom moved forward to look at the gold thing pat savages lipstick he clipped horrified long toms hand reached out let me see that with pleasure the count handed over the lipstick it is pats long tom muttered examining it he glared at the count whered you get it you said you hadnt seen pat where is she snappy brother before we give you what is known as the works ridiculous the count asserted in your united states lipsticks are massproduction articles there must be upward of half a million of this identical design there arent half a million of these rennys voice sounded in a bawl of hoarse triumph as he rushed to a corner and seized a slim black malacca cane held it up hams sword cane long tom echoed renny faced count ramadanoff heres hams cane i want to know where ham is you are making yourself utterly ridiculous the count asserted brother you asked for it renny roared and rushed the count striking out with his great fists the count made no attempt to dodge he stood and took it and in return laid his fist against rennys jaw in a blow which rocked the big engineer back on his heels renny blinked dazedly he had never met opposition like this in his life he could almost believe that it was doc savages powerful muscles that had just put those staggering blows across long tom was helpless to aid because at a nod from the count a slave a squat mongol had appeared from behind a wall drape and nudged long toms ribs with the flarelipped muzzle of a diabolical poison dart gun renny tried everything science brute force but he might as well have been fighting a shadow for all the impression he made finally the count grew weary of the sport eyes glinting thin lips drawn back to a thin line he put over a haymaker then he stood over renny callously kicking him back to consciousness i will always regret that i did not meet your doc savage the count said gloatingly and sighed it appears that i must live all my life without meeting a foe worthy of my efforts he hissed again and the slaves bound and dragged the two prisoners out of the main hall and part way up the tower steps before the same slot in the tower hall which docs other aids had been forced to look through renny and long tom were halted observe your playmates the count directed they looked through the slot and in that courtyard dungeon hemmed in by starkly rearing palace walls they saw the same unbelievable monster that monk ham and pat had witnessed holy cow renny breathed squatting in the middle of the flagstoned pit bathed in the red volcanic glare was a creature that had a ridge of toothlike horns running down his scabrous back and tail swinging its armored head upward it snorted two streams of vapor from its nostrils then it drew in air and its sides swelled out until to the horrified glance of renny and long tom the loathsome thing threatened to expand to such a bulk that it would fill the whole courtyard what is it long tom gulped i dont know renny said suddenly hoarse in observing this gargantuan monstrosity the counts odious voice broke in do not overlook the cells under the balcony your temporary abode i say temporary because the cell bars are movable actuated electrically at my desire my desire being dictated to a large extent by the humor of the creature you are observing again the count sounded his ghoulish hiss and long tom and renny were hustled down the stairs out onto the circular balcony which ran all the way around the courtyard dungeon and thrust unceremoniously through a trapdoor in the balcony floor they landed heavily ten feet below on the flagstoned floor of a cell through the heavy iron bars they could see clearly in the courtyard the monster had retreated out of sight into its den opposite them on the balcony the count looked down the creature has enjoyed itself for the day he informed he will sleep before he needs diversion and exercise again suddenly renny and long tom reached out and clutched each other trembling they had seen the same things almost at the same instant there almost under their feet were four shapeless mauled bodies the flags of the court were stained a ghastly red that did not come from the reflected volcanic light remnants of clothes clung to each torn body and long tom and renny were recognizing those remnants they were the clawandteethshredded garments of johnny and ham and monk and pat and the shark got doc savage the count remarked looking down from his balcony chapter xii the honeycomb horror the count ramadanoff was somewhat mistaken the shark did not get doc the red smudge which had bloomed on the water was not occasioned by the sharks flat pointed teeth tearing at the bronze man but came from wounds inflicted by docs slashing knife on the shark itself after beating off the sharks attack doc swam under water and came up out of sight of the launch behind a jutting coral reef he waited until the boat had churned away through chopping waves then struck out in the long hard swim for the island doc had touched shore on a lavastrewn beach waded through a belt of brown sea weed and plunged into the obscurity of shoreline vegetation windbent trees bleached white with ocean spray and dangling cobraheaded peruvian cactus doc drove on through the thornstudded undergrowth and came out on a broad welldefined game trail he recognized it as an ageold path used by the galapagos tortoises as they butted through the jungle between their feeding grounds and watering places it was evening and the volcano was blinking its red light over the island when doc reached the high plateau pocked by those mysterious manmade honeycomb pits he forged forward keeping to the jungle fringe until he arrived near the active workings from a cactus covert he watched goldflecked eyes weirdly alive while the overseers strode up and down before the long line of pits and cracked their whips over the backs of the chained slaves digging their way to death from exhaustion in the strange honeycomb pattern of circular holes the bronze man watched for a chance to maneuver closer and examine the pits but since the disturbance created by his aids on the day they had been wrecked on the island the guards had been doubled doc had no opportunity to get close enough to look down ahead of the advancing line of pits perhaps fifty yards distant on the high plateau floor loomed a small stockade containing surplus working tools it was guarded by four men beefyshouldered swarthy fellows their seminude bodies glistening with a hard burnish whenever the volcano lighted up the sky with its hellish red glare they talked among themselves in brittle asiatic gibberish one of them clacked suddenly in his native tongue that flat rock out there where did it come from the volcanic fire died down before his companions could look i remember no rock out there one of them said then look the next time the glow comes the other suggested momentarily the lurid lightning sheeted out again look the sharpeyed one exploded look where the other snapped i am looking a third said i see nothing are you trying to fool us the fourth remarked there is nothing there but before there was a rock the first guard growled stubbornly i am sure in the blanketing darkness the mans voice was cut off with a muffled gurgle whats wrong with you a companion asked sharply did you swallow a bug there was another muffled gurgle as this man ceased speaking in the same abrupt manner as the first together the other two men clacked in alarm what is the matter they never learned what it was two gurgles sounded simultaneously and after that came silence for all evidence to the contrary it might have been the equatorial darkness pressing malignantly close which had choked all four watchers into insensibility volcanic light gleamed again over the honeycomb pattern of pits on the high plain the light revealed the four guards sitting silently upright their backs to the stockade while inside the stockade a giant bronze man moved selecting a digging instrument a wedgepointed pick the light went out then flared again and revealed a lump that might have been a bronzehued rock on the plateau halfway between the stockade and fringing underbrush but the next time red light rippled out the stone had vanished and doc savage under cover of the thorny bush was creeping toward the line of pits with the wedgepointed pick in his hand he had silenced the guards by deft pressure exerted on nerve centers at the back of their necks with his cabled fingers it would be hours perhaps before the guards regained consciousness doc passed by the front line of pits in which the chained slaves were digging and watching his chance crawled over and dropped inside one of the workedout cells immediately behind the active front row doc crouched with pick in hand and commenced rapidly digging a hole in the circular walls the wall separating the cells was thin in a matter of minutes doc had picked a hole large enough to let him look through it had been docs intention to contact one slave after another in this manner until he came upon one who could furnish information regarding the fate of his aids as he looked through the fistsized hole he had dug his trilling sounded faintly the chained slave heard and stiffened visibly this slave was an astounding individual with a massive hairy torso neck nearly as thick as his broad head and long gorillalike arms extending almost to his knees there was such strength in that hairy body that the man could bite his shovel into the flintpacked volcanic ash without the necessity of loosening it first with the pick the gory glow of volcanic light illuminated the mans face briefly revealing a sprawled nose a huge gash of mouth and a forehead almost buried in bristling hair the man was so incredibly homely that be was rather pleasant to look at like a genial bulldog he kept digging but his keen little eyes had detected the hole doc had gouged in the pit wall he heaved close the chain rattling against his leg iron his voice was small childish jerky with emotion blazes doc howd you get here give me the story monk doc whispered guardedly were all alive but we wouldnt be much longer monk said making his small voice smaller the situation seemed desperate from that second radiogram you sent to intercept me at the canal zone doc said or did you send it monk we only sent one doc to new york monk grunted the second message sounded so legitimate that it deflected my attention enough for count ramadanoffs agent to get a timebomb in our plane doc said grimly which of course was why the radiogram was sent did you crash here doc monk demanded offshore renny and long tom are prisoners where are the others hams chained in the pit next to me and johnny is in the one beyond that monk advised doc breathed and pat as far as i know the counts got her cooped up in his palace we got to get her out the counts got a maneatin beast there as big as a mountain i know it doesnt sound sane but all of us saw the thing whew doc asked you were imprisoned for a time at the palace yeah but when old bushface saw how tough we were he sent us here to kill ourselves diggin instead of feedin us to his critter monk growled that maneatin thing has even got teeth on its back doc you wouldnt believe a monster like that was in the world a guard passed by and looked down lashed with his whip a red welt sprang out on monks shoulder quit mumblin to yourself the guard directed in english and dig faster after the guard continued on monk gritted through the hole to doc you see how it is most of the diggers die off quick why the pits doc queried youve got me monk grunted weve sure wondered about em im going to dig through into your pit monk doc informed stand so your back will hide me as much as possible after doc entered monks pit he dug his way quickly through into hams monk filled both the holes as best he could doc in the adjoining pit with ham kept close to the wall so that unless one of the overseers stepped close and looked directly down he would remain undetected ham stifled his amazement at docs appearance and doc reaching out with his pick gouged an entrance for himself into johnnys pit almost the instant he arrived alongside johnny things began to happen ill be superamalgamated the bony geologist exploded as doc squirmed into view say it louder doc directed what johnny blurted startled say it louder doc repeated johnny was so surprised at the whole business that he did not speak out in his accustomed verbose manner itll bring the guards down on us he protested that doc said is what we want ill be superamalgamated johnny blurted his favorite expression again louder the bronze man directed johnny gulped raised his voice with determination ill be superamalgamated superalgamated superalgerated aw nuts doc you say it the word for once had gotten him down but it was not necessary for doc to say it an overseer lunged toward the pit doc was back against the side the overseer did not observe him the whip cracked down at johnny docs hands reached out grasped the slashing rawhides gave a downward jerk the unexpected tug pulled the overseer off balance before he had time to brace himself or let go the whip he teetered on the brink of the pit then fell inward sprawling docs fist lanced out smacking against the fellows jaw while he was still in the air the man was unconscious before he hit the bottom doc bent flipped him over yanked loose a key dangling from a thong on the lizardhide collar he fitted the key to the lock of johnnys leg iron twisted briefly and johnny stood free doc grabbed up the whip he had wrested from the guard and swerving ducked through the hole into hams pit follow me johnny doc suggested cautiously and reached to unlock hams leg iron suddenly from all along the line of fantastic pits the groans and babblings the whipcracking ceased one note dominated the nightmare scene the deep echoing clangor of a brass gong one of the overseers had witnessed his fellow plunge mysteriously into the pit and he had sounded the warning gong while the dread hush spread over the pit overseers converged running toward the hole where johnny had been working well never make it doc johnny snapped they kill anybody caught trying to escape a cursing uproar burst out as the firstarriving overseers discovered johnnys pit to be empty more of the lizardcollared guards swarmed down a whip lashed into hams pit as one of the overseers discovered the three men there bellowed words brought the others crowding to the pit rim whips lashed down as doc lunged upright from unlocking ham the pit became a whistling storm of fleshcutting rawhide doc shoved the legiron key to johnny follow me through into the next pit and unlock monk he shouted above the swish and crack of flaying leather close at docs heels came johnny and ham while the two bent to the task of releasing monk doc stood upright taking the rain of whip lashes cutting back with the whip he had wrested from the first guard under the red volcanic glare docs face uplifted to the lightning of whips was a mask of emotionless bronze he did not use his left arm to fend off the searing strokes he had better use for that left arm it cooperated like a machine with his whipcracking arm doc was not whipping aimlessly holding his left arm in such a way that he could protect his eyes he sent his lash snaking upward from the pit with a twist of his cabled wrist a deft jerk at the precisely correct instant caused the long pliant rawhide to curl tightly about whatever object it struck sometimes it was a neck sometimes an arm or a leg but in every instance a quick backward jerk of docs arm brought his whiphooked victim toppling into the pit and then it was that docs left fist cooperated driving against the head of each falling victim pounding them into senselessness and after doc had dragged some half a dozen men into the pit with relentless precision the remaining overseers drew back cursing and shouting out of range of the appalling rawhide lash ok doc johnnys voice sounded monk kicked his loosened leg chain aside im clear doc lead the way monk doc ordered duck through the same hole i first entered by the rest of you follow i will hold them off with the whip and bring up the rear monk crowded closely by johnny and ham butted through into the next pit back of the active working line doc ceased slashing his whip and bent to follow them only to have his head rammed with a hollow thump against an object hurtling back through the hole from the other direction it was monks granite head that doc had bumped we cant get out that way doc monk roared in his frantic haste squirming past doc and whacking his head on the bottom of the pit as he fell in ham and johnny came piling through on top of monk carnivorous crabs johnny loudly shrieked maneating ones ham augmented big as dogs johnny insisted and millions of em monk finished holding his head chapter xiii bits of hell this way then doc said and whipped through the hole into the pit where ham had been chained there was a blur of movement on the pit floor accompanied by a fearful sound a metallic clacking then monk coming through the hole in the wake of doc found himself jammed into the pit he was trying to leave blazes monk protested whats the matter this route is barred too doc said crabs right the pit floor is covered with them they keep em in cages somewhere behind the working pits ham jerked they turn them loose to forestall escapes i saw one poor blighter go down under a wave of them last night they had his bones picked clean in a horribly short time the metallic clacking grew louder coming into the pit with a din like the croaking of thousands of tree frogs that noise is the crabs clackin their claws the academic johnny said ungrammatically but forcefully they can take a mans finger off with one snip they climb your legs all the time hacking you up as if two razors were working on you theyre land crabs too doc ham put in something like those recorded in parts of siberia only bigger not as big as dogs as johnny said but bigger than any i ever heard of before ferocious as tiger sharks there was a thumping sound on the pit sides them guys with the dog collars are heavin rocks monk roared hams shout blended with monks roar here come the crabs kick em back monk bawled kick them back yourself ham snapped i have no shoes on whadda you think im wearin monk growled im barefooted too block the hole with your head ham suggested sarcastically while they quarreled they were acting monk had picked up one of the large stones which had been heaved into the pit and was smashing crabs as they came in ham was slugging at another hole with the weighted butt of the whip which doc had dropped some of the clackclacking monsters got through johnny was dancing around on his bare feet trying to stamp on their backs before their fearful claws could nip off his toes or slice through the muscles of his legs doc monk yelled theyre comin through fastern i can pop em off let a few of them in the bronze man said suddenly puzzled but aware the bronze man must have some plan monk complied doc in the meantime was stripping off his outer garments he managed to get at the bulletproof chainmesh undergarment which he wore and removed it he used it to shield his hands grasped one of the crabs when an unusual brightness came into the unholy crimson sky and straightened he hurled the fearsome thing at the nearest overseer there was light enough for the cruel fellows to see it coming they emitted cries and crowded into the nearest of honeycomb pits in an effort to escape the wall of earth between the pits was not wide enough to permit quick mass acti on monk got the idea and admitted more crabs one at a time doc grabbed the things hurled them the overseers as a matter of safety withdrew all right doc rapped well make a break for it now let me heave you up monk ran jumped into the bronze mans clasped hands and doc gave a jerk hurtling the apish chemist up to the pit run head for the underbrush doc called ham and johnny ran at the bronze man and doc heaved them up in the same manner then he himself leaped caught the edge of the pit with one deft arm drew himself up and ran across the narrow walls of earth between the honeycomb pits to join his aids the overseers were already swarming upon them strangely enough the fellows seemed to have no weapons other than the vicious whips they were handicapped by their very numbers due to the scarcity of the footing on which they had to work make it faster doc called his aids were having trouble their feet were bare and the volcanic rock had many of the characteristics of broken glass stones began falling near them rattling on the brittle rock occasionally breaking off glassy fragments whips lashed popped go ahead doc directed they went on moving as rapidly as the tangled vegetation would allow lower down the jungle growth became more dense matted vines and thorny branches disputed their way gigantic orchids pale flowers of evil in the flickering volcanic light dangled fleshy petals from overhead docs huge frame often bored a way for the others whats the hurry doc demanded monk puffing renny and long tom and pat are prisoners at the palace doc said simply well why bust our necks in this jungle monk queried lets get on one of the turtle trails they were paralleling one of the wellbeaten trails at the moment the red volcanic light was flaring doc moved close to the trail and scanned the way ahead come he said and started on a trot down the ancient path this is better monk muttered lumbering close behind fifty yards ahead doc halted abruptly stand back he said look he stood well to the side of the trail his bronzed hand drifted out plucked at something invisible to the eyes of the others there was a swish of tree branches slicing through air a glint of metal a sharp thud doc bent and pulled out of the ground a knife buried to the hilt his hands moved unfastening the knife from the branch to which it was deftly attached by means of leather stringing an old malay trick he announced an animalhair trigger is strung across the trail practically invisible even in good light a sapling is bent back with the knife attached when the hair is broken by a man walking on the trail the sapling springs upright sinking the knife into the stomach of the trail walker monk rubbed apprehensively at his midriff said nothing these trails are possibly guarded by other traps also doc stated by daylight looking sharply they might be traversed safely but at night they had best be left alone doc banded the knife to ham perhaps you had better carry it till we locate your sword cane that reminds me of something else we lost doc monk burst in habeas corpus that porker getting lost is the only good thing thats happened to anybody on this blasted island ham snapped come doc said forestalling another resumption of the quarrel he plunged back into the tangled jungle growth the others followed they forged on working interminably through darkness slashed occasionally by the lurid volcanic light it was nearing morning when through the interstices of jungle vegetation the grim walls of count ramadanoffs palace loomed ahead on the side toward the sea the walls were glistening wetly black from highflung spray on the jungle side the towers and turrets of igneous stone were bathed in a bloody mist as the red volcanic light blanketed through miasmatic swamp vapor monk hunched his massive shoulders spookylookin joint aint it a habitation singularly minacious johnny murmured monk as johnnys selfappointed interpreter said he means full of threats everything is threatening on this island ham said doc those pits where we were digging whats it all about docs hand waved out toward the bastioned walls of twentyfeetthick volcanic rock surrounding the palace the secret of the pits lies behind those walls he stated you mean that whiskered devil the count ham queried with the count ramadanoff yes doc stepped a few paces aside bent over and straightened up holding a fallen palm trunk thicker than his body help with this fallen log he instructed if we are to climb that wall we will have to get it propped over the water in the moat by the wall all labored strenuously getting the log solidly against the wall doc tested it with his weight then standing with legs grimly planted and back braced against the wall he said tersely monk up on my shoulders monk stepped from docs cupped hands to the bronze mans shoulders with a balanced ease surprising for a man so heavily built with his feet on docs shoulders he braced his back against the wall next ham doc said ham mounted swiftly from docs hands to the top of his head from monks hands to monks shoulders standing there back to the wall his own upreached hand missed the top of the wall by only a few feet all right johnny doc called veritably an elevating proceeding johnny murmured herculean in concept but destined irrevocably for fructiferous termination save that until ham gets off my neck monk grumbled the professorial johnny stepped closer and then monocle loin cloth and all skinned up the threeman rope with the agility of an acrobat gaining the top of the wall he lay flat to hook his feet over the rear edge then reached over grasped hams upreaching hands supported by johnnys grasp ham swung free from monks shoulders monk in turn grasped hams legs doc climbed over the dangling human chain and got his hands atop the wall the wiry johnny for a moment had been sustaining the weight of all of them johnny might be an exprofessor and he might wear a monocle but he was about as toughly muscled an individual as could be found when all were on the wall doc eased over and hung by his hands from the other side and one after the other his aids climbed over his body hung from his feet and dropped into the palace courtyard below then doc dropped lightly to join them lateral peregrinations eminently successful johnny whispered doc led the way through inky shadows to a small stone structure which evidently had been intended as quarters for servants he forced the door and led his aids inside wait here he said wherell you be doc monk asked mystified going to climb the tower and enter the palace from above will open the door from the inside when you hear my whistle johnny asked does it percolate to this secretive assemblage that the sinister genius of the galapagos may be simulating nescience of our ensconcement behind his bastioned ramparts you mean the count might know were here and hes set a trap for us monk translated exactly johnny agreed possible doc admitted this count is diabolically clever and theres that beast that thing that monster monk muttered there aint rightly no name for it doc it is as large as a house ham corroborated assuredly yes johnny said with an infinitesimal exaggeration how close were you to the thing doc questioned too close monk gulped we saw it from the slitted window of the tower let us hope you hear my whistle doc said the bronze man took silent steps and was swallowed by crawling shadows his aids stared tensely in the direction where the palace loomed in the darkness and when next the red lightning flashed its lurid menace they saw doc flattened like a human fly on the sheer surface of the black tower climbing by the sheer fabulous strength of fingers and toes the almost nonexistent cracks between the stone blocks then the lightning died and blackness swooped down and when again the red lightning flickered doc had disappeared chapter xiv jungle palace doc had little difficulty effecting an entrance through one of the high tower windows for it had no fastening in the darkness he felt his way down unbannistered serpentine steps in the halfway room containing the long window slit overlooking the courtyard dungeon he paused and peered out below in the flagstoned enclosure the rippling volcanic light revealed to him the same incredible monster that the others had seen the fearful beast on its shapeless multiclawed legs was propelling its gross body around its sawtoothed tail lashing its armored head wagging foam dripped from its grisly jaws as it braced itself against a barred cell its claws scraping out in a frenzy of impotence at its failure to break through the bars the monster swelled its scabrous body to what appeared to be half again its original size doc savage watching made no sound his finger drifted out felt briefly over the glass of the slitted window then drummed softly as though the drumming on the window glass had been a signal there was a sound in the darkness behind doc a breath unwillingly expelled doc crouched jerked out of line of the window and listened through the weighting blackness came sounds of breaths jerkily taken plainly doc was sharing this room with some person attempting to conceal the noise of his breathing holding his breath moving with the utter silence of a jungle denizen doc eased toward the source of those bated breathing sounds his body was crouched his hand outstretched cabled fingers tensed to grip and choke then he stood stock still sensitive nostrils flaring a subtle odor a faint and familiar perfume wafted to him the tension went out of his clawed fingers and he straightened groping in front of him gently pat he whispered from out of the darkness sounded a smothered gasp and feminine hands grasped for him oh doc breathed pat pat savage was trembling but with docs presence strength seemed to come back to her she stopped shaking sighed and looked up trying to see the bronze mans face she shuddered another hour would have been too late renny and long tom were to be given to the thing at daybreak you mean the monster in the court yes pat said grimly the count locked me in here to watch the the feeding he says ill be the next one her voice became more grim hes been trying to scare me into agreeing to stay on the island he says hell make me a queen imagine queen of the honeycomb pits hes not human hes a fiend hes more of a monster than that that thing in the courtyard then pat went silent as the fateful piano music flooded the room bombarding their ears with weird vibrations the notes seeming to roll through the darkness with lethal menace as suddenly as it had begun the music stopped though as always before a ominous pulsing hung in the air some one is going to die pat gasped why do you say that doc asked sharply the count plays on his piano and some one always dies pat said rapidly i know it sounds mad but it is true usually it is the thumbhole death a hole appears in your temple about the size you could press your thumb into concealed lights flashed on then bathing the bare rockgirt room with white brilliance doc and pat blinked to accustom their eyes to the sudden glare pat gasped at what she saw in the light shuddered doc was equally surprised but his bronze features remained impassive standing there so close doc could reach him with a leap was the count ramadanoff in black evening clothes he loomed tall and sinister his czarofrussia beard an inkyblack against his long white face broader than his brother boris nearly two feet taller he was in other respects identical in appearance even to the rings on his tapering fingers a ruby and an emerald each as big as the end of a mans thumb doc watched the counts eyes as hard and glittering as the gems on his fingers doc had power that but few men had succeeded in developing down through the ages he could use his goldflake eyes upon another often to hypnotize against the others will but with the count doc got nowhere the brittle gemlike eyes glared back as though they did not see at all the counts lips twitched slightly he made a low and courtly bow his white hand waved out the jewels flashing he spoke suavely if you will be so gracious as to escort the lady early morning breakfast is served in the great hall pat said with her lips only he does the queerest things this is some kind of trap doc nodded without speaking rested his fingers against pats elbow and guided her through the opened door and down the winding stone steps the count followed closely as they pushed through the hanging drapes of ruby velvet on the stair landing and entered the cavernous maw which was the hall before the huge fireplace where the blue flames danced without sound without heat without appreciable light a breakfast table was set for three you see i have prepared for you the count said nodding them to chairs the breakfast table with its crisp damask and softly glowing silver service was the only fresh touch in the highraftered hall all else remained the same the grand piano swathed in sea otter the swinging candelabra burning in hundreds of flames the regal collection of samovars sending off dull metal glitters from velvetdraped recesses while slaves served the food the count leaned forward and said in a confiding manner you are a man of the world enough to know that things are not always as they appear and so doc said noncommittally it would appear that i have treated your aids badly the other murmured such is not the case three of your men i consigned to my pits the count continued strange as it may seem i did it to protect them from an island horror the thumbhole death doc suggested the bearded giant murmured ah you know of it i had occasion to observe its deadly effect in new york the counts eyes glittered it has long hovered over brother boris and what have you to say regarding my other two men doc questioned dryly their host drawled my dear fellow they are at this minute leading a searching party to recover your body supposedly mangled by sharks pat interposed hotly if that is true why was i locked in the tower room and told to watch their executions a proceeding later to be illumined the count said precisely the intended executions a myth there was no myth about that that monster i saw in the courtyard pat insisted she was not eating the count helped himself to food he leaned toward doc you have seen my pet the creature in the courtyard doc questioned the iguana the counts breath drew in raspingly so you were able to identify it he shrugged identifying it you must have been all the more impressed by its formidable size a galapagos or seagoing lizard attaining the length of six feet would normally be considered a monster you saw my pet in the courtyard how long would you estimate him to be it appeared doc admitted many times that size but how is it possible pat protested she was not eating she had no taste for food served in the sinister environment of the palace the blue flames in the fireplace instead of lighting up her lovely face threw it in ghastly bluish shadow pat shrank back as the counts tapering fingers reached out to touch her arm on this island are undreamed horrors he murmured and something else doc put in something you wish found for the first time something other than sinister evil seemed to come over the man before them he straightened visibly in his chair and put down his eating implements you have learned of that he asked it has become evident doc savage told him the big man leaned forward smiling eagerly in his black beard you know what it is the name yes the bronze man admitted the devils honeycomb you dont know more than that the other demanded no doc admitted the bearded man settled back and seemed relieved he began eating again glancing once at them curiously as if noting for the first time that they were consuming no food he did not urge them to eat i have need of your scientific abilities said the count casually i have tried the usual instruments for making subterranean surveys they are not sufficiently sensitive you can make more powerful ones more delicate ones doc savage said sharply in order to properly design the instruments it will be necessary to know what you want located that is impossible the other said abruptly then what you ask me to do is also impossible doc informed him the bearded man showed his teeth through his heavy whiskers you have the reputation of a man who does the impossible the count said grimly you will manage to do it now or take some very unpleasant consequences doc savage said nothing with your exhaustive knowledge of geology and cartography my dear savage it should not be too difficult for you to locate an object which i shall describe as having an atomic structure entirely different from the rest of the island the whiskered man said the count raised his napkin and blotted his thin lips he blotted carefully for a moment the whole lower half of his face was concealed by the stiff damask the blue flames which leaped in the fireplace commenced promptly to shorten they died down to half their height within the next few seconds doc savage spoke suddenly to pat in strange language words composed largely of guttural though curiously melodic sounds doc was using the language of the ancient mayans the remarkable people whose civilization flourished in the yucatan peninsula of mexico long before the egyptian pyramids were built it is doubtful if more than a dozen persons in the socalled civilized world were sufficiently conversant with the strangely syllabled speech to understand it even as doc talked the blue flames shortened farther until they became little more than crawling stubs within the massive fireplace what are you saying the count demanded his voice had a noticeable nasal quality now nothing pat answered tensely she sat back in her chair breathing deeply as doc speaking in mayan had directed her to do fill your lungs with fresh air doc had said and if the blue flame goes out do not take another breath until we can get outside to the count ramadanoff doc said in english before i do anything about locating your devils honeycomb the release of my two men held prisoners in your iguana pit will be necessary so the count said with nasal quality still predominantly in his voice you have finished with breakfast chatter you prefer to deal in realities then listen to this not only do i refuse to release your two men but i am pleased to inform you that your other three aids are prisoners of mine also securely locked in that same garden shelter where you left them when you scaled my tower this palace my dear savage is amply equipped with electrical safeguards much in the manner i should judge as your own skyscraper headquarters in new york is protected nothing can happen within these walls that i am not uimmediately informed about turning his head the count summoned a slave by means of that odious hissing noise he made through compressed lips throw open the outside door he ordered the slave swarthy of mixed blood padded across the hall swung wide the massive door and started back toward the breakfast table thirty feet from the door his body was gripped with spasmodic convulsions a choppedoff scream of agony passed his lips as his face contorted and his body grotesquely knotted thumped onto the floor early morning sunlight slanted through the open door bathing his heaped body with funereal benediction the counts eyes glittered if you doubt he is dead my dear savage you have my special permission to examine the body and anyone else who approaches within that thirty foot area in front of the door will be similarly electrocuted i arranged the exhibition to demonstrate to you the futility of attempting escape from the region of the fireplace sounded a metallic sigh as the blue flames flickered out out of the tail of her eye pat had been watching the flames she held her breath doc did the same as doc was aware the failing of the blue flames signaled the flooding of the room with an anesthetizing perhaps even a lethal gas as a flame in a gas stove burns blue giving off virtually no illumination so did the weird flames in the counts fireplace burn blue and lightlessly that they gave off no heat was accounted for by drafts mechanically arranged to conduct the heat up the chimney but the draft controlled by a concealed floor button within reach of the counts toe at the breakfast table could be closed and the flames extinguished throwing such a volume of unburned gas into the great hall that even with the outside door opened a few whiffs would rob a person of consciousness doc had been warned when his alert eyes had observed the count pressing the napkin to his lips under cover of the napkin the count had inserted no doubt wads of chemically treated gauze into his nostrils so that he could breath for a short time with safety in the gasladen atmosphere it was this gauze that had given his voice its pronounced nasal quality coincident with the failing of the blue flames a loud crash sounded it was the breakfast table going over propelled by a forcible kick from docs feet the table turned over in the direction of the count and with such appalling force that the count in his chair went over also in the moment that the bearded man was clearing himself of the table wreckage doc grabbed pat by the arm and propelled her violently across the room and up the sweeping flight of stone steps the count was on his feet and running forward by the time doc and pat had reached the stair landing hung with the velvet drapes the count looked very happy as he observed that the rubycolored drapes had tangled themselves about the fugitives and must certainly trip them up but doc and pat were not tripped by the hangings it was no accident that the drapes had become swathed about docs mounting figure doc was holding them in one metallic hand carrying them upward with him suddenly he stopped faced around hang onto my back he said in mayan to pat and hold your breath pat thrust arms about docs neck from behind from high overhead the brass hoops creaked on their rod and the ruby drapes became taut as a windbellied sail as doc lifting his feet and gripping the drape like a rope swung downward in a wide arc down he swung on that plunging curve passing high over the astonished face of the count and up up with pat clinging tightly around his neck at the very height of his swing he was dangling at a fearful distance above the highswung candelabra he let go his hold on the drape and hurtled forward and down the wind a hard rush in his ears his musclecorded hand outstretched caught the candelabra his momentum swinging it forward candles showered down their flames whipping like tiny comets tails letting go of the candelabra the man of bronze swooped through the air above that death stretch the thirty feet of flooring in front of the door charged with highamperage electricity through the lofty door his body shot down he landed easily taking the shock in a way that showed he had practiced jumping from great heights pat had managed to hang on throughout chapter xv mangrove murder safely outside that palace of death doc circled the tower running and pat ran with him it was docs intention to reach the tomblike structure in the garden where his aids were imprisoned and effect their release but doc did not reach the prison house he got close enough that monk ham and johnny all three could see him from the barred window ham even shrieked a warning but it was too late a black fury which had leaped down from a palace window landed with crushing weight on docs shoulders doc went down a hard fall to the flagstoned yard and on top of him riding him down was the figure of count ramadanoff the counts fists thudded on doc with vicious shortarm jabs delivered with the force of a piledriver his white hands that looked so soft were not soft at all on his short cut through the palace to intercept doc he had slipped his hands into gloves of basketweave wire as flexible as thin kid and knobbed on the knuckles with jagged slugs of lead with my own hands i will beat you to death the count raged three of your men at one time my fists have beaten and now you as docs head hit the flagstoned surface the counts right fist bludgeoned in there was nothing shortarm about this jab he had timed the blow his fist bashed in from far back with all the weight of his massive shoulders behind it he meant to crush docs skull between mailed fist and flagstone the fist drove down struck solidly but not on docs head doc jerked clear timing his movement so that the count could not pull his punch the list swished air in docs face and rammed flagstone holes had been fashioned in the backs of the leaded gloves so the finger rings could push through and serve as additional punishment factors under the drive of fist against flagstone the ruby as big as the end of a mans thumb crushed into a mound of reddish crystalline powder doc as he jerked clear drove his own fist upward to the point of the counts chin the madmans head rocked back till his bull neck creaked and doc doubled his knee and kicked himself clear up on their feet the two crashed in at each other doc took one fearful blow on the side of his head but he rolled with it thereby avoiding most of its effect and at the same time providing an opening for his own fists he hit three times in dazzling succession it was almost like a single blow a drilling onetwo punch over the heart and an uppercut to the jaw swung from down around his knees the blow would have dropped a rhinoceros it dropped count ramadanoff senseless he did not awaken until several minutes later and by that time his hands were tied doc guided by pat had found the generator room and turned off the electricity all over the palace also by the use of a tiny vestpocket grenade he had broken down the door of the garden prison and freed his three aids the count sat up groggily and doc ordered inside the palace free my two men locked in your dungeon cells and make it fast monk threatened with the count leading and the others following close they trooped through the great hall and up the winding stairs you have beaten me with your fists the count said very well but there is still the thumbhole death before the door to the balcony which surrounded the animal pit the count paused impressively what you will see beyond this door is something the like of which until today has never been observed by any living man except myself he announced dramatically i know what well see monk blazed the monster not the monster you have in mind doc interposed enigmatically the counts breath rasped so you have solved my mystery correct doc admitted the window which looks upon this courtyard from the tower room is in reality a powerful magnifying glass the beast we saw is not as large as it appears the counts lips writhed do not make the mistake of thinking the horror is diminished it is increased uncounted times pat shuddered what could be worse than that monster the count leered at her his answer was simple and devastating many monsters he said his foot must have touched a hidden lever actuated mechanically for the door to the balcony swung open docs aids crowded forward and stopped with ludicrous suddenness staring down into the pit with cold shock monk was the first one to get his voice not one monster he gasped but about a hundred of em all nearly six feet long the hundred was somewhat of an exaggeration because the iguanas the most hideous of beasts were so tightly packed on the dungeon floor that their scaly hides rubbed together and made it impossible for them to swell out their bodies in the loathsome habit they had in moments of excitement the mass of scabroushided monsters undulated on the flagstoned floor snorting armored heads without exception pointing toward the cell wherein renny and long tom were held captive they have been starved to hunger frenzy the counts odious voice sounded they are waiting for the bars to go up so that they may get inside the cell pat uttered a choked cry of dismay the counts silky voice thick with expected triumph continued iguanas inhabiting some of the galapagos islands are not particularly savage i believe these are different everything on this island is savage if i did not find it so when i came i made it so you will observe for one thing these brutes are a full foot longer than the average the strongest those fellows which have forged their way to the front and are grinding their teeth against the bars are half again larger than any other iguana reported on other islands tryin to throw a scare into us huh monk blustered secure in the realization that the electricity had been cut off and that the count could no longer control the bars by a touch of a hidden button if anything happens to my men doc began ominously your warning comes too late my dear savage the count rasped look before their horrified eyes the iron bars commenced to lift upward out of the floor there was a gobbling sound the counts weird laugh fools he raved what matters it if you have temporarily disrupted my electrical system there are a hundred places on this balcony where i can touch my toe and actuate the bars by mechanical control as the bars lifted upward the slaveryjawed iguanas surged like a wave inside the cell renny and long tom acting in a way they had planned for just that emergency leaped upward caught hold of the rising bars the bars ceased lifting and the two men hung sagweighted while the scabrous monsters with frenzied grunts and a bloodchilling grate of serrated teeth leaped up at them falling just short the count continued his gobbling laugh it is always the same he gloated the victims hang onto the bars until the weight of their bodies loosens their grip the monsters then have their fun observe how the iguanas crowd from behind the two men will not be enough to appease them so you my dear savage with your three other aids and your charming cousin will form a second course for my pets i confidently predict docs goldflecked eyes were lancing around the torture chamber he could not reach his aids by means of the circular balcony a sheer dividing wall cut off the way and by the time he could circle through the palace forcing doors it would be too late long tom and renny their bodies grown leaden would have lost their grips and fallen prey to rending jaws and claws there was but one way to the cell that way led directly through the pit where the monsters crowded together doc looked at johnny hold your knife at the counts neck if he makes a move monk you and ham stand by swerving doc gripped the balcony railing and vaulted down into the pit along with the swarming hungercrazed monsters doc ham shouted in horror hams voice was lost in the beastly chorus of grunts echoing up as the iguanas discovered the human in their midst pat suddenly hid her eyes had she watched she would have seen some interesting footwork doc landed on the scaled backs of one of the creatures as it lurched he leaped onto the back of another four opened mouths rushed him he leaped clear in rapid succession stepping from back to back of the closepressed animals much in the manner of a whitewater timberjack running over a log jam by virtue of expert eyetomuscle cob coordination never remaining more than a splitsecond in any one spot doc reached the middle of that nightmarish arena from then on progress was easier the animals were too closely packed to attack him successfully so long as he kept on his feet and moving doc reached the cell leaping from the back of the enraged iguanas to grip the iron bars he pulled himself up to a safe height then bracing his feet against one bar hands gripping another he exerted all his tremendous strength in an effort to pry them apart under the appalling force of his muscular pressure the loose ends of the bars shuddered then bent can you squeeze through now he demanded long tom did not have to answer his beanpole body had already writhed through holding to the bars he added his own strength to that of docs the bars bent enough more to permit renny also to squirm through hand over hand the three climbed the bars and pulled themselves over the railing to the balcony floor looking back across that frightful pit of frustrated monsters doc called to his aids wait till we come to you doc used a vestpocket bombtiny things they were no bigger than medicinal capsules but loaded with a powerful explosive and blew down a door which separated the balcony from the rest of the palace where necessary he used more of the capsule bombs to force other doors and reached his aids united now for the first time since the devils honeycomb mystery had flung malignant shadows across them doc his five aids and pat with ramadanoff their prisoner went on a quick triumphant tour of the palace they found the palace empty the slaves having decamped into the jungle at the first opportunity were all together at last pat said joyfully yeah all but habeas corpus monk amended a dour look on his homely face i favor leaving the island quickly ham snapped before that hog finds us you shyster monk growled habeas corpus is a good hog good to eat maybe but i doubt even that after providing themselves with firearms docs aids donned some of the counts clothes the count wore nothing apparently but black long tom pointed at rennys long puritanical face protruding from a black waistcoat doubling with laughter long tom said you look like frankenstein anyhow they fit renny growled and i dont look like a scarecrow in a garden patch like you monk and ham made acrid comments on each others appearance holy cow renny rumbled its sure swell to hear you two guys scrappin again this lug that calls himself a count fixed up some skeletons with some of your clothes hangin bloody on em and we thought you had all been killed as they were all in the act of leaving the palace ham pounced upon the blade of his sword cane where it had been concealed beneath the seaotter robes on the piano he examined the tip found it still coated with the sleepproducing chemical and shifted the blade back into the malacca cane handle monk sighed now absolutely everything is found but habeas and he wont be found ham said hopefully didnt you hear the count say the island is infected by fierce things monk insisted habeasll never be devoured by anything on account of hell do the devourin himself if any volcanic smoke hung over the island in a black pall dimming the equatorial sun as pat doc his aids and their prisoner hurried from the palace courtyard now what long tom muttered doc savage studied the volcano for a time its glow seemed to have acquired additional brilliance that volcano is not behaving in a manner calculated to inspire peace of mind doc said however there are two things requiring our immediate attention one is to rescue those poor devils digging those honeycomb pits ham offered right doc admitted and the other johnny said tensely for once using small words is to find out what this devils honeycomb business is all about right again doc agreed as the party plunged into a grove of mangroves doc and the scholarly johnny conversed in lowered tones no doubt you have already reached the conclusions that i am going to outline johnny said first ramadanoff insisted you could locate this devils honeycomb whatever it is with instruments that means the devils honeycomb is composed of substance different from the island and volcanic ash exactly doc savage agreed and the fact that those pits are being dug close together indicates that the devils honeycomb whatever it is is not large if it was a large object they would have dug the pits farther apart i had not thought of that but it bears out my theory johnny declared now have you noticed the geologic structure of this island that coastal plateau is really a ridge along the shore that is where they are digging i am positive the plateau was thrown up as a deposit of volcanic ash this occurred not many years ago judging from the lack of vegetation beyond the plateau inland is a small swamp section heavily jungled doc savage put in there are indications that the swamp was originally the seashore johnny chuckled i see you have reached the same conclusions as myself are we going to look the place over we are doc savage told him we are going to examine that swamp quite thoroughly monk dropped back to grumble i wish somebodyd tell me what all of those honeycomb pits are for did the overseers examine the volcanic ash you excavated from the pits doc savage queried sure monk said but not very closely the purpose of those pits may prove to be somewhat of a surprise doc savage said and offered no more as the party proceeded the mangroves grew more dense the coiled roots were headhigh in places causing frequent stumbles in the spongy waterlogged soil the volcanic smoke grew blacker the red flashes became more lurid a fine ash of volcanic pumice sifted down through the maze of weirdly curved tree branches above uttering raucous alarms frigate birds and fantail gulls skimmed over the tops of the giant mangroves redfooted boobies perched on their nests and squawked continually these birds would drive a guy nuts monk rumbled theyre sure to give us away in case anybodys looking for us long tom added snipers in these mangroves is one thing we dont have to worry about monk mumbled the count was afraid to let any one else on the island have a gun down doc rapped unexcitedly everybody get down monk with the others instantly dropped on all fours a moment later there was a crash of rifles lead snarled through the mangroves chipping bark tearing at boughs over their heads my mistake about the snipers monk said grimly chapter xvi portuguese freebooter doc and his men returned the fire with the guns they had confiscated from the palace with the sifting volcanic ash turning the shadowed mangroves into a place of perpetual night the enemy guns flared in saffron bursts echoes crashed flatly holy cow renny boomed sounds like an army doc savage said my guess is that brother boris has flown here from cocos island and rounded up the slaves renny groaned we should have let boris drop when he was on the end of that rope hanging from the airplane monk fired a burst of three shots answering bullets chopped mangrove branches about his head trouble with firing at their gun flashes is they shoot back at yours monk growled the battle went on the mangroves rocking to gun thunder and the black volcanic dust sifting down as though trying to blot out the livid bloom of guns lead whined and smacked driving the combatants to seek additional protection by burrowing deeper in the mud monks pig would love this the fastidious ham gritted bogged almost to his eyebrows bigfisted renny growled lets charge em suddenly the enemy firing increased coming noticeably closer theyre charging us renny boomed keep down doc ordered doc spoke calmly hiding the alarm he must have felt as a matter of fact they were on as deadly a spot as any they had run against on the island with lead slapping around them like hail there was a good chance of none of them escaping lets charge em renny roared again johnnys scholastic voice said sharply exsiccate and attune auditory faculties huh renny gulped startled whatcha say he means for you to dry up and listen monk interpreted listening they heard clearly above the whooping gun thunder a new sound a massed grunting as though perhaps a hundred or more of the counts hungercrazed iguanas had escaped from the palace and were butting through the mangroves on a manhunt the count ramadanoff himself was first to name correctly the sound he did so with considerable excitement climb trees he bawled abruptly concerned over his own safety i will call at our enemies to cease shooting whats comin monk demanded the little wild hogs the count gasped they run in droves like peccaries in sufficient numbers they can bring down anything that lives they listened it was a herd of the ferocious little animals undoubtedly there was a good deal of noise in the mud the count was screaming at the enemy riflemen beseeching them not to shoot to climb trees themselves and seek safety the response was interesting for it seemed that doc savages party had taken shelter in the only large trees immediately convenient and that those where the besiegers lay although thick enough for excellent concealment were only bushes which would hardly support human weight in a mudslogging wave the herd of wild pigs approached the trees doc savage directed and they hauled themselves out of the mud and climbed boosting the big bearded count up into the branches helping pat the rest of them following hastily ham always concerned with his appearance paused to scrape some of the mud off with the result that he was slow in reaching a tree in fact before he gained his tree a lean ungainly shote with long legs and flapping saillike ears popped out of the brush and headed straight for ham the mudsmeared lawyer unlimbered his sword cane as he retreated hastily hey monk bawled be careful thats habeas what of it ham snapped if i dont get him that pack of wild hogs chasing him will chasing him nothing monk bellowed habeas hes leadin that gang of hogs monks prediction proved to be optimistic he had based it no doubt on habeass previous accomplishments in fighting which had been considerable but habeas in these wild peccarylike island hogs had encountered if not singly at least in numbers his match he could outrun them however and he was engaged in doing it ham went up his tree and habeas promptly tried to climb after him but failed scat ham yelled go away take your friends with you an idea seized monk he hung down at risk of falling out of his own leafy retreat and waved an arm whooping to get habeass attention monk had long ago taught his pet shote to move in response to hand gestures take em away habeas monk yelled indicating the shote should go in the direction of the enemy attacking party habeas corpus acquitted himself royally promptly setting off at a wild pace he took his troubles in the shape of a grunting snorting tuskflashing horde of wild pigs in his wake among the enemy there was much excited shouting shooting and an enraged squealing from the pigs doc savage waited until the peccary stragglers joined what sounded like a considerable warfare ahead come on the bronze man said sharply now is our chance to get clear they scrambled down out of the boughs making their escape did not prove to be difficult because the men who had been besieging them were involved for the time being with the herd of wild hogs doc savages party pressed for considerable time through the tangled growth and finally came out in what amounted to a valley before the last volcanic eruption if johnnys geologic observations were as accurate as they should be the valley had been the shores of a bay doc savage listened for some time he heard no sounds of enemies wait here he directed the party the next moment he was gone into the lurid gloom he traveled swiftly setting a course for a definite spot the beach near where his plane had crashed once there he stripped off his outer garments and entered the surf the tide fortunately had changed and the rips were not bad as he swam out to the spot where his plane had sunk it was impossible more than to approximate the location which meant that doc had to make a number of dives before he located the craft in some four fathoms of water in truth a film of oil on the surface coming up from the crashed plane led the bronze man to the location of the ship he dived to it a number of times and when he swam back to shore he was heavily burdened holy cow renny exploded when doc joined them in the valley that had formerly been a bay whatcha got our devices for locating metals underground doc savage told him long tom johnny you can help with this the apparatus was sensitive but was unimpaired by submersion its case had been waterproof they worked with it for three hours then doc savage went and stood on a particular spot here he said it was near the beginning rise of the coastal ridge and was in volcanic ash they dug in using sticks for implements working as quietly as possible it was monk whose stick first hit buried wood he scraped madly and uncovered a porthole pirate treasure he gulped excitedly doc savage held a match close to the porthole to examine it then said look and pointed at an inscription on the porthole rim the inscription read patented june pirates doc savage said were put out of business before the porthole was large and after they had broken out the glass and worked the rim free they could by squeezing get inside doc posted renny and monk as guards doc with the others managed to get inside they searched carefully and at length and found nothing to indicate this was anything but an old tramp steamer the boat had a metal hull most of the bulkheads were of steel and there were no skeletons about the hull was mutilated enough to show the ship had been wreckedprobably driven high on the shore in the course of a storm or by a tidal wave this has turned out to be a bust long tom complained only the count registered no disappointment doc observing the bearded man covertly noted that strangely enough the fellow could not keep from his face a look of feverish triumph shortly after this the count approached doc complaining that the ropes hurt his wrists and he might as well be freed since the only exit from the wreck the porthole was guarded by renny and monk doc removed the bonds at the same time remarking if you try to escape the results may not be pleasant the count bowed narrowing his eyes to hide a gleam of triumph he moved to one side and johnny and pat promptly assailed doc with misgivings why did you do it pat demanded he was lying about his wrists hurting him docs expression was enigmatic pretend not to notice him doc savage himself pretended to be occupied in another part of the wreck the count when he judged himself to he unobserved slunk from sight entering a portion of the wrecked hull formerly used as the captains cabin the count found the spot for which his fingers were feeling his tapering fingers pressed a small panel slid open he thrust his hand through the hole felt behind the bulkhead and drew his hand out quickly holding something give it to me doc ordered and advanced on the bearded man the count snarled his bearded face contorted in baffled rage then quickly he controlled himself forced a grim smile take it he growled but i warn you it means death he placed the article in docs outstretched hand outside doc ordered and the count walked out tie him up again doc directed johnny only after the counts arms were again bound did the bronze man allow his attention to be distracted to the object in his hand it was a mariners emergency hand compass studded on the back with two superb stones much like those which had graced the counts linger rings an emerald and a ruby unexpectedly wafting on the pumicefogged air the bronze mans trilling note came causing pat and johnny to flash startled looks doc held the compass out for pat to see what is it pat asked she frowned i dont get it the engraving doc suggested its in russian pat decided im not so good at russian it says merely that the compass was presented to the count ramadanoff by the czar of imperial russia doc told her it is the date which is important ill be superamalgamatedl johnny exploded the date is chapter xvii the red ring right doc said the date is his words were echoed by a rumbling sound like caged thunder no wind blew the noise seemed to press down with the sifting black pumice and at the same time to ooze up through the ground it was everywhere as though tortured rocks far below the earths surface were vibrating throughout the globe what is it pat gasped the volcano doc said the exordium of the termination johnny remarked i get that one pat said tensely the beginning of the end we must drop everything doc said and hurry ahead to rescue those poor devils in the pits doc led off his aids and pat trailing after him bringing big bearded ramadanoff out of the jungle tangle forging ahead through jagged lava beds docs party was within close view of the squat volcanic cone the mountains mouth was wreathed in lurid light and smoke belched upward in a twisting spiral to mushroom against high clouds and sift its pumice over the entire island it wont be long now ham yelled shes been buildin for a bust ever since weve been here monk agreed loudly doc slowed his giant strides to fall back alongside pat when no one was observing he placed the jeweled compass in her hands keep it where it will be safe he admonished you must be expecting violent action pat gasped doc said nothing possibly because ahead from out of gloom created by the black ash gun flashes stabbed redly like tiny erupting volcanoes down doc shouted bullets slammed whining past brother boris again monk squawked the volcanic rock afforded innumerable crevices concealing themselves doc and his aids returned enough fire to keep the enemies at a distance of even greater danger than the smashing lead was the brittle volcanic slag which broke into thousands of pieces under impact of bullets showering the slivered rock around like glassy needles doc issued strict orders against reckless exposure on the part of any of his aids then leaving monk and ham and pat in charge of the prisoner he took the others with him to stage a flanking movement taking advantage of lava gullies and dead gas craters docs flanking party worked up close once they were sighted and a burst of bullets hunted them one slug felled a high torch thistle and slapped the frightful plant across rennys shoulders which meant renny would spend weeks picking the barbs from his skin bullets splattered volcanic glass drove splinters doc left them merging away into the gloom the volcanic ash was falling thicker now and the squat volcano cone was bathed in a perpetual rose glow appearing to ooze from the rock under foot that fearful rumble like caged thunder came again then came a crashing roar different sound it sent echoes ricocheting through the lava canyons like a dynamite blast docs little capsule grenades renny boomed piercing the ashladen air on the heels of the explosion echoes stabbed frantic shouts a ragged burst of gunfire came from boris ramadanoffs men these noises receded until there was only silence and the sifting black snow and the mountain top gleaming a fiery red rock crunched and doc loomed toward them from out of the murk foray was eminently successful johnny suggested doc nodded theyre on the run we better be too renny grumbled the whole top of that mountains about due to blow off if you ask me it is becoming more threatening every minute doc admitted gravely come on well join the others but docs flanking party did not join the others the others joined them that is part of the others did doc monk and ham roared together as they came plunging out of the gloom here doc called sharply the counts gone ham squalled with pat monk bellowed he cut his hands free on this glassy rock i guess ham gasped and he grabbed pat monk howled in rage we couldnt shoot on account he held her in front of him and in this dust and murk he was out of sight in about six steps ham finished we tried to find him but no luck go on to the pits doc directed let me hunt pat with a parting wave of his hand the bronze man moved quickly away he was out of sight in a few long strides while docs aids raced for the honeycomb pits the underground thunder sounded again and the rosy light glowing above the volcano crater expanded violently flinging fiery streaks through the ashy gloom and disgorging a torrent of lava which cascaded in red streams down the blunt mountainside i said she was ready to blow renny grunted johnny the geologist reassured them it would be excessively rare for the initial eruption to be of sufficient volume to inundate the plateau where the honeycomb pits are long tom gasped look blazes monk blurted run the warning was hardly necessary oozing down a defile upon them came a mass of red liquid lava it was a moving serpent of liquid superheated rock which disgorged from the gutted earth had cascaded down the outside of the squat volcanic cone and was now seething forward heat in gaseous billows fanned out ahead of the molten avalanche docs aids felt the withering blast as they climbed in a frenzy toward higher ground holy cow renny gulped that was close and how are we gonna get back across that strip of melted hells monk wanted to know were only cut off on one side long tom pointed out nearing the pits docs aids fired warning shots the overseers having no firearms did not contest their advance already filled with dread at sight of the volcanic activity the overseers shouting in panic surrendered docs men scattering over the entire front forced the lizardcollared men into the pits to unlock the diggers so furiously the rescue work proceeded so intent were docs aides in effecting the release of of every last one of the miserable fellows chained in the pits that they were unaware for a time of a frightful trap closing in on them it was monk who first became aware of their predicament blazes he roared theres lava on both sides of us it was true the seething lava flood had swelled curled out in a broad path on each side of the plateau straddling it the only escape from the plateau of the honeycomb pits was by the sea renny cracked his huge fists together helplessly the sharks he gulped brothers were really jammed even as he spoke the lava rivulets seemed to grow like a doughnut swelling in a cauldron of boiling fat the red ropes fed by a continuous fiery flow from the spewing volcano mouth swelled and swelled pressing inward threatening to engulf the entire honeycombed plateau chapter xviii the mountain makers when doc savage took the trail of the count and pat his goldflecked eyes ferreted out minute clues a bit of shoecrunched volcanic glass a bruised leaf missing barbs from a form of jumping cactus which grew rankly in the lava crevices mounting upward toward the smokebelching crater doc came shortly across in the crushed volcano glass indisputable evidence that the count ramadanoff had met brother boriss party and joined forces with them trails of the brothers ramadanoff led up and up the squat cone of the smoking volcano headed directly for the fiery crater the trail grew fresher doc was high on the stubby cone of the mountain when the lava burst from the crater in an especially violent eruption flowing down in a mountainhigh waterfall of fire in broad channels to the left of docs position the liquid rock like the spawn of many glass furnaces dumped together sprayed heat and light through the sooty air then above him doc glimpsed those he trailed a yellowish pall of smoke smudged them from view but the glimpse had been enough the bronze man left the trail and lunged upward on a shortcut which would allow him to intercept his enemies it was hard going over old lavaflow formation the stuff was deceptive twice the ground gave way beneath docs plunging feet and precipitated him into headhigh ruts needlepoint lava showered down upon him the ground under his feet became hotter as he proceeded noxious gases oozing from fumaroles made breathing a hazard nearing his quarry doc to avoid being detected half slid half climbed into one of the fuming cinder caves and groped his way across the bottom between smoking boles gleaming a raw red color and noisily horrible with the suck and gurgle of fluid rock below the cinder crust with lids slitted to prevent his eyeballs from being scorched he waded through that withering heat and climbed the opposite slope of the clinker pit maneuvering for a position which would bring him out above his enemies doc gained the position and then lost everything in the moment which should have been his greatest triumph the air in the deep fumarole he had just traversed was impregnated with an insidious gas carbon monoxide colorless odorless making its presence felt only by its sudden sapping of a mans strength doc had been aware of the possibility of this gas in the smoky atmosphere making his painful way across the scoria or metallic rock froth he had breathed no more than was imperative but even this little was too much he felt a giddiness settle upon him his legs grew leaden taxing his reserve strength to the utmost he reeled to the top of the pit and then plunged down an avalanche of needlepointed clinkers sliding in a brittle wash behind him with his eyes momentarily sealed shut from the stinging reek of volcanic gases his reeling steps had carried him onto a bubbleglass surface which had crashed under his weight plunging him down a tortuous slope almost on the heads of his enemies he was half buried in the downsurge of the metallic rock before he could extricate himself boris ramadanoffs revolver muzzle was a burning coldness against the back of his neck the count stood in front of doc his bearded head thrown back ghoulish mirth issuing in loud gobblings from his mouth everything it is perfect ramadanoff roared better even than we could have planned it is it not so brother boris boris ramadanoff nodded emphatically pat savage imprisoned between two of the lizardcollared slaves stared speechlessly her face taut the count pointed a tapering finger at her even in the tenseness of the moment doc noted that the emerald was missing from the mans hand we have the girl the count rasped and we have you and your other friends are trapped on the plateau doc looked at the count spoke in a composed voice no lava flow will flood the plateau of the honeycomb pits the counts eyes glittered one thing you have not taken into consideration brother boris and i have long been prepared for this eventuality he pointed with spasmodic eagerness do you see that volcano crater doc said nothing no one could have seen the crater through the smoke it is mined with nitro charges the count growled that is why brother boris and i have climbed this slope to explode those charges with a new vent blown out for the lava the plain of the pits will be covered with molten lava doc shook his head you would not blow those charges and why not the count asked it is dangerous business tampering with the normal flow of volcanic lava the bronze man reminded if it were not for the fact that brother boris is going to pull the trigger on the revolver which he is holding against your neck you would see us dare it the count said ominously doc ignoring the threat said there is still another reason why you would not flood the plain that devils honeycomb for which you have so long looked digging your pits you would hardly care to have it buried under a hundred feet of lava so the count purred dangerously you have deduced where the devils honeycomb lies since the bronze man knows so much boris sneered why not tell him the rest of it brother perhaps in the world to which my trigger finger will send him he will meet the real count ramadanoff whose interest in this bit of unrecorded history will be vast agreed brother boris the madman answered he fixed his gaze upon doc know then that i am not the real count ramadanoff the real count ramadanoff came to this island to escape the horrors of the russian revolution his vessel was that tramp steamer which you my dear savage so kindly located for us today escaping the revolutionists the original count brought with him to this island a hundred people artisans and noblemen of that hundred people brother boris and myself alone remain alive today the thumbhole death doubtless accounted for the others doc remarked some of them died by the thumbhole death the madman admitted readily others went by the way of the pits but you interrupt my story among the articles which the count brought with him was well the devils honeycomb among other things this he cunningly hid brother boris and i bungled badly when we killed the original count ramadanoff he died before we had wrested from him the secret of his hiding place some things we knew however we knew that the devils honeycomb is concealed on that plateau now encircled by red running rock so brother boris and i caused ships to wreck and in that way procured men to dig for us the pits were dug to a system it was our intention to honeycomb the honeycomb part is humor eh the whole plateau if it was necessary doc savage put in the tramp steamer how did it happen that you failed to know its location it was wrecked in a tidal wave when the volcano erupted and covered with volcanic ash replied the other neither boris nor myself knew its location but you knew about the compass that it was the key to the whereabouts of the devils honeycomb doc said boris ramadanoff started violently peered at his brother you found the key no the brother lied quite calmly this man savage is prevaricating trying to turn your hand against me for his own gain he knew the nature of the key boris snarled how did he know it was a compass if he did not see it when you found it i tell you its all a lie brother barked the other somewhat desperately pull the trigger that will send a bullet crashing through his brain we will end this boris scowled i would hear more about this compass key fool the bogus count hissed promptly following the hateful exclamation in the smoky haze there was a sound which might have been made by fingers snapping very hard boris slumped ominously to the ground scarlet commencing to ooze through a depressed fracture in his temple the thumbhole death had struck again as a safetyfirst move doc savage went into action all during the bogus counts revelations doc had been surreptitiously working his knees and hips against the volcanic slag which had avalanched down and half submerged him holding him to a degree he had succeeded in loosening appreciably the hold of the stuff now he lunged forward clinkers washed in a wave as his body heaved free he felt something close to his temple the exact nature of it was hard to define it must have shaved him very close for his temple seemed to burn it must have been the thumbhole death the bogus count suddenly lost his nerve he lunged backward spun around and started running doc savage shouted at pat in the mayan tongue she twisted lunged frantically only her wrists were bound so stunned were her captors at what had just occurred that she managed to get free lunging doc savage reached he side together they went over the edge of one of the smokeringed clinker pits they ran furiously doc helped pat up to the right somewhere hidden by the smoke doc savage could hear the bogus count scrambling through the metallic clinkers judging from the strenuous sound the fellows main thought was to get away from the vicinity immediately his nerve had cracked finally chapter xix honeycomb of the devil pat demanded grimly shall we follow the count we will doc savage agreed but do not get too close to him make sure he hears us this combination of suggested action seemed to puzzle pat to remain behind the count and follow him furtively she could have understood but to follow him at a distance and still let the man know they were doing so that bewildered her whats the idea she demanded instead of answering her doc savage paused and dislodged a heavy rock letting it roll down a declivity the man ahead had been traveling fast but now he cursed his speed became that of a madman he knew they were behind him the earth had cracked in spots probably under the force of expanding gases they passed a stream of lava which had been diverted somewhere above and was already beginning to solidify in irregular waves some of these headhigh in other spots rivulets of the superheated stone twisted sinuously along they came to a region where imprisoned gases had long ago hollowed out the volcanic structure to form fantastic underground pits it was as if monsters had dug dens in the sloping side of the cone they waded through groundglasslike clinkers in which they sank to the knees it cuts like razor blades pat groaned my boots wont stand much more of this unexpectedly they came out on a level area beyond which there was a sharp slope down to a cove the wind was in their faces and it swept the dust back to the other side of the island accordingly they could see a little better docs flakegold eyes scrutinized the terrain intently follow me be directed pat and was suddenly gone pat tagged after him as best she could she was about exhausted it seemed days since she had eaten slept had a peaceful moment or drawn a breath of air that was fit to breathe a shout came from ahead shots she heard the count scream then pat came on the scene it was at the edge of the little cove the water was comparatively calm doc savage was standing on the coves edge sheltered by a high boulder fully two hundred yards away the count was retreating warily along the beach revolver in hand he shot at pat she got undercover crawled forward and joined doc she looked at the bay a seaplane floated there a highwinged twinmotored amphibian each motor being equipped with a threebladed propeller this ship was moored close to the shore and on its fuselage a painted legend could be read cocos island treasure hunters inc you headed the count away from the plane pat gasped suddenly understanding why doc wanted their quarry to know he was being followed it had kept the fellow frightened had made him flee toward the plane and it had worked right doc savage waved at the plane that explains how the other brother got here the must have been a treasurehunting expedition on cocos island there usually is as a matter of fact this plane was probably stolen from them this theory upon later investigation proved to be true they waded out to the plane and climbed aboard the big plane had a stout fuselage one made for heavy work which was fortunate because the landing on the other side of the island although doc savage made it expertly was not easy on the hull no plane could land easily in that chopping riptide monk ham and the others howling their delight met the ship on the beach wading out and seizing the hull to keep it from being damaged on the rocky shore we cant clear outta here too soon for me monk yelled i gotta find habeas corpus hes somewhere on the other side of the island probably with that herd of wild hogs still after him ham offered doc savage issued abrupt directions monk the rest of you use this plane to ferry these poor prisoners of the counts to safety better take them out to the reef not to the island the reefs are not submerged even at high tide they would be safe there what about you doc monk demanded the devils honeycomb is here on this plateau doc savage advised pat had been thinking apparently now she said sharply doc that compass there must have been a map in it or something undoubtedly doc savage assured her but the count took it away from me pat gasped we havent got it for answer the bronze man brought from within his clothing the jeweled compass it left the counts person when he took part in the struggle attending my capture i picked his pocket pat elected to stay so did renny the others being armed felt able to take care of the prisoners carrying them to one of the reefs near where the fake channel lights had decoyed ships to disaster there was light about them now burning jungle ignited by lava and lurid flashes from the cone took care of that doc savage worked at the compass got the glass out lifted the card off its jeweled bearing beneath tied to the bearing pin with silken cord was a bit of parchment doc unwrapped this it was a simple chart showing landmarks and paced distances they were lucky the principal landmark it developed was a boulder of extraordinary size which reposed near one end of the plateau they ran to this pausing only to gather digging implements from some of the honeycomb pits doc savage paced off the distances they began to dig doc savage and renny in the hole pat keeping the slag tossed back they hit the leaden lid of a small chest some six feet down prying the chest out they could tell that there were many other similar chests below lets have a look at the inside renny rumbled and struck with his shovel the lead was soft it split huge globules of green and red glittered before their sweatsmarted eyes holy cow renny breathed the contents of the lead box was an affair of gold probably a part of an ancient breastplate of armor in this were set the jewels the design of the mounting was orderly and laid out in such a fashion that it somewhat resembled a honeycomb there were diamonds rabies emeralds every one a stone that looked valuable i can see why they called it the devils honeycomb renny boomed what about getting the rest out pat demanded they began to dig for the additional chests the sides of the bole promptly caved in delaying them somewhat a moment later there was another misfortune which entirely overshadowed this minor one there came a crashing detonation the very earth itself seemed to convulse leap upward then shake as if trying to split itself wide open a great thump queerly hollow followed that it was such a sound as characterizes the detonation of an extremely powerful explosive pat looked appalled the counts nitro charge she gasped they looked toward the high volcanic cone saw a sight which was probably the most spectacular and at the same time the most menacing they had ever witnessed a rumble had started and was growing and growing but that was almost unnoticed it was the thing happening to the top of the cone that held their eyes niagara falls seemed to have become molten fire and was flowing upside down out of the great cone holy cow renny rumbled thats what i call a fourth of july celebration doc savage straightened glanced about rapidly he was calculating the size of the eruption and appraising their distance from the beach run for it the bronze man said abruptly renny protested but these lead boxes nothing like that is worth dying for doc savage said grimly if you stay to dig them out you will not have a chance to get away renny did not have to think it over long youre right he thumped they ran for it renny pausing only to scoop up the cluster of mounted jewels which so strangely resembled honeycomb a honeycomb the cells capped not with wax but with scintillating brilliance the plane picked them up without much more difficulty than they had expected they got away none too soon as the ship lifted from the water and circled toward the more peaceful end of the island they studied the scene under a sky hellred to the far horizon the cone was spitting lava boulders some of the latter as huge as small buildings a few of these great chunks felll into the sea or rolled there and sent up unbelievable quantities of billowing steam with the roar in their ears of a world coming to an end and the light of an inferno before their eyes doc himself took the controls of the plane and landed it on the comparatively calm water inside the little cove they did not beach the ship but kept it off with the motors running ready for a quick takeoff should an earthquake start the latter was a possibility monk ignoring all arguments went ashore he wanted his hog habeas strangely enough the dapper ham not at all dapper nowaccompanied the homely chemist they were back unexpectedly soon running and they had habeas corpus we found the other brother the count the one who was alive monk yelled what do you think happened to him no one made a guess those wild hogs ham said grimly they had finished with him by the time we got there i habeas corpus monks pet never a sartorially inclined porker at the best now looked very bedraggled that he had spent a hectic time on the fantastic island was evident he took every opportunity to lie down he had been thin before as thin as it had seemed possible for a porcine specimen to get but now he was even thinner renny jumped suddenly squawled and grabbed his side he looked somewhat foolish examined a small spot which rapidly grew livid what did that he roared monk made a quick movement with his wrist and something thudded against rennys ribs again hey renny said startled what is that thing monk glanced at doc savage had you decided what that darn thing was doc the bronze man nodded the brothers must have spent much time practicing to acquire such proficiency yeah they sure must of monk agreed holy cow renny grunted examining the object which monk held its that big emerald ring the count wore its tied to a tiny thread but you cant hardly see it and the thread is stronger than blazes monk told him you see this is the thumbhole death but it seemed so mysterious pat said so sinister it was both doc savage interpolated if you recall the thumbhole death struck only when the light was not strong enough to reveal the almost colorless cord they threw the ring with great force both brothers were well muscled you will recall they must have practiced a great deal then they jerked the ring back with the cord we found it on the count monk announced the wild hogs well they left it they fell silent after that watching the scene before them the rumble and roar of it the leap and flash of gory light the rumble of descending boulders it was a fabulous spectacle still watching the volcano they knew they were free to depart in the plane at any time and ferry the late prisoners of the brothers ramadanoff to other and larger islands in the galapagos where sailors could call for them as they later did monk was exhibiting the honeycombed jeweled breastplate not much compared to what we probably left behind he said but my guess is itll sell for a million anyway divided up among the prisoners we rescued that oughta help a little if ham heard that he showed no interest ham had plenty of money anyway he was eying the pig habeas corpus ham suddenly emitted several loud grunts he shuffled his feet noisily wild hogs he yelled habeas corpus never looked back he hit the water swimming and made for the safety of the plane boy oh boy ham grinned for years i have been trying to find a way to make that hog keep out of my sight the end
