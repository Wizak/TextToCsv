published and without a similar condition including this condition being imposed on the subsequent purchaser prologue there are three distinct but inevitably interlinked elements in this story the merchant navy and the men who served in it liberty ships and the units of the german forces underseas on the seas and in the air whose sole mission was to seek out and destroy the vessels and crews of the merchant navy i at the outbreak of war in september the british merchant navy was in a parlous state indeed pitiable would probably be a more accurate term most of the ships were old a considerable number unseaworthy and some no more than rusting hulks plagued by interminable mechanical breakdowns even so those vessels were in comparatively good shape compared to the appalling living conditions of those whose misfortune it was to serve aboard those ships the reason for the savage neglect of both ships and men could be summed up in one word greed the fleet owners of yesteryear and there are more than a few around today were grasping avaricious and wholly dedicated to their high priestess profits at all costs provided that the cost did not fall on them centralization was the watchword of the day the gathering in of overlapping monopolies into a few rapacious hands while crews wages were cut and living conditions reduced to barely subsistence levels the owners grew fat as did some of the less desirable directors of those companies and a considerable number of carefully handpicked and favoured shareholders the dictatorial powers of the owners discreetly exercised of course were little short of absolute their fleets were their satrap their feudal fiefdom and the crews were their serfs if a serf chose to revolt against the established order that was his misfortune his only recourse was to leave his ship to exchange it for virtual oblivion for apart from the fact that he was automatically blackballed unemployment was high in the merchant navy and the few vacancies available were for willing serfs only ashore unemployment was even higher and even if it had not been so seamen find it notoriously difficult to adapt to a landlubbers way of life the rebel serf had no place left to go rebel serfs were very few and far between the vast majority knew their station in life and kept to it official histories tend to gloss over this state of affairs or more commonly ignore it altogether an understandable myopia the treatment of the merchant seamen between the wars and indeed during the second world war does not form one of the more glorious chapters in british naval annals successive governments between the wars were perfectly aware of the conditions of life in the merchant navy they would have had to be more than ordinarily stupid not to be so aware so successive governments in largely hypocritical facesaving exercises passed a series of regulations laying down minimum specifications regarding accommodation food hygiene and safety both governments and owners were perfectly aware in the case of the shipowners no doubt cheerfully aware that regulations are not laws and that a regulation is not legally enforceable the recommendations for they amounted to no more than that were almost wholly ignored a conscientious captain who tried to enforce them was liable to find himself without a command recorded eyewitness reports of the living conditions aboard merchant navy ships in the years immediately prior to the second world war there is no reason to question those reports especially as they are all so depressingly unanimous in tone describe the crews living quarters as being so primitive and atrocious as to beggar description medical inspectors stated that in some instances the crews living quarters were unfit for animal far less human habitation the quarters were invariably cramped and bereft of any form of comfort the decks were wet the mens clothes were wet and the mattresses and blankets where such luxuries were available were usually sodden hygiene and toilet facilities ranged from the primitive to the nonexistent cold was pervasive and heating of any form except for smoking and evilsmelling coal stoves was rare as indeed was any form of ventilation and the food which as one writer said would not have been tolerated in a home for the utterly destitute was even worse than the living quarters the foregoing may strain the bounds of credulity or at least seem farfetched but respectively they should not and are not charges of imprecision and exaggeration have never been laid at the doors of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine or the registrar general the former in a prewar report categorically stated that the mortality rate below the age of fiftyfive was twice as high for seamen as it was for the rest of the male population and statistics issued by the latter showed that the death rate for seamen of all ages was in excess of the national average the killers were tuberculosis cerebral haemorrhage and gastric or duodenal ulcers the incidence of the first and last of those is all too understandable and there can be little doubt that the combination of those contributed heavily to the abnormal occurrence of strokes the prime agent of death was unquestionably tuberculosis when one looks around western europe today where tb sanatoria are a happily and rapidly vanishing species it is difficult to imagine just how terrible a scourge tuberculosis was just over a generation ago it is not that tuberculosis worldwide has been eliminated in many underdeveloped countries it still remains that same terrible scourge and the chief cause of death and as recently as the early years of this century tb was still the number one killer in western europe and north america such is no longer the case since scientists came up with the agents to tame and destroy the tubercle bacillus but in it was still very much the case the discovery of the chemotherapeutic agents rifampin paraaminosalicylic acid isoniazid and especially streptomycin still lay far beyond a distant horizon it was upon those tuberculosisridden seamen illhoused and abominably fed that britain depended to bring food oil arms and ammunition to its shores and those of its allies it was the sine qua non conduit the artery the lifeline upon which britain was absolutely dependent without those ships and men britain would assuredly have gone under it is worth noting that those mens contracts ended when the torpedo mine or bomb struck in wartime as in peacetime the owners protected their profits to the bitter end the seamans wages were abruptly terminated when his ship was sunk no matter where how or in what unimaginable circumstances when an owners ship went down he shed no salt tears for his ships were insured as often as not grossly overinsured when a seamans ship went down he was fired the government admiralty and shipowners of that time should have been deeply ashamed of themselves if they were they manfully concealed their distress compared to prestige glory and profits the conditions of life and the horrors of death of the men of the merchant navy were a very secondary consideration indeed the people of britain cannot be condemned with the exception of the families and friends of the merchant navy and the splendid volunteer charitable organizations that were set up to help survivors such humanitarian trifles were of no concern to owners or whitehall very few knew or even suspected what was going on as a lifeline a conduit and an artery the liberty ships were on a par with the british merchant navy without them britain would have assuredly gone down in defeat all the food oil arms and ammunition which overseas countries especially the united states were eager and willing to supply were useless without the ships in which to transport them after less than two years of war it was bleakly apparent that because of the deadly attrition of the british merchant fleets there must soon and inevitably be no ships left to carry anything and that britain would inexorably and not slowly be starved into surrender in even the indomitable winston churchill despaired of survival far less ultimate victory typically the period of despair was brief but heaven only knew that he had cause for it in nine hundred years britain of all the countries in the world had never been invaded but in the darkest days of the war such invasion seemed not only perilously close but inevitable looking back today over a span of forty and more years it seems inconceivable and impossible that the country survived had the facts been made public which they werent it almost certainly would not british shipping losses were appalling beyond belief and beggar even the most active imagination in the first eleven months of the war britain lost i tons of shipping in some of the early months of losses averaged close on tons in the darkest period of the war at sea tons of shipping went to the bottom even working at full stretch british shipyards could replace only a small fraction of those enormous losses that together with the fact that the number of operational uboats in that same grim year rose from to made it certain that by the law of diminishing returns the british merchant navy would eventually cease to exist unless a miracle occurred the name of the miracle was liberty ships to anyone who can recall those days the term liberty ships was automatically and immediately linked with henry kaiser kaiser in the circumstances it was ironic that he should bear the same name as the title of the late german emperor was an american engineer of unquestioned genius his career until then had been a remarkably impressive one he had been a key figure in the construction of the hoover and coulee dams and the san francisco bridge it is questionable whether henry kaiser could have designed a rowingboat but that was of no matter he almost certainly had a better understanding of prefabrication based on a standard and repeatable design than any other person in the world at the time and did not hesitate to send out contracts for partconstruction to factories in the united states that lay hundreds of miles from the sea those sections were transmitted to shipyards for assembly originally to richmond california where kaiser directed the permanente cement co and eventually to other shipyards under kaisers control kaisers turnover and speed of production stopped just short of the incredible he did for the production of merchant vessels what henry fords assembly lines had done for the model t ford until then as far as oceangoing vessels were concerned mass production had been an alien concept mistakenly but understandably there existed a widelyheld belief that the liberty ships originated in the design offices of the kaiser shipyards the design and prototypes were in fact english and were conceived by the design staff of the shipbuilders jl thompson of north sands sunderland the first of what was to become a very long line indeed the embassage was completed in the prefix liberty did not come into existence for another seven years and only for some of the kaiserbuilt vessels the embassage tons with a raked stem and rounded stern and three tripleexpansion coalburning engines was a nonstarter in the aesthetic stakes but then jl thompson were not interested in aesthetics what they had aimed at was a modern practical and economical cargo vessel and in this they succeeded admirably twentyfour more similar vessels were built before the outbreak of war those ships were built in britain the united states and canada the great preponderance in the kaiser yards hull designs remained identical but the americans and only the americans introduced two changes which they regarded as refinements one of those changes using oil instead of coal as fuel may well have been the other which concerned the accommodation of officers and crew was not while the canadians and british retained the original concept of having the living quarters both fore and aft the americans elected to have all the crew officers and men and the navigating bridge in a superstructure surrounding the funnel in retrospect hindsight and bitter experience make for a splendid conductor to belated wisdom it was a blunder the americans had all their eggs in one basket those vessels were armed after a fashion they had fourinch lowangle and twelvepounder antiaircraft guns neither of which was particularly effective together with bofors and rapidfiring oerlikons the oerlikons were deadly in trained hands but there were few trained hands around they also had weird devices such as rocketfired parachutes and cables carrying coils of wire and grenades these were as dangerous to those using them as the aircraft they were supposed to bring down some few of these ships had catapultlaunched hurricane fighters the nearest equivalent to the suicidal japanese kamikaze planes that britain ever had the pilots could not of course return to their ships they had the uncomfortable option of either baling out or ditching in the arctic in winter their survival rate was not high from the air on the sea and under the sea the germans often with brilliance always with tenacity and ruthlessness used every means in their power to destroy the merchant navy convoys basically they used five main types of aircraft their standard or conventional bomber was the dornier which flew at predetermined heights and released their bombs in predetermined patterns they were useful planes and had their successes but were not particularly effective much more feared in ascending order were the heinkel the heinkel iii and the stuka the heinkel was a torpedobomber which attacked at wavetop level its pilot releasing the torpedo at the last possible moment then using the lightened weight of his aircraft to lift over the ship it was attacking those planes had an unusual degree of immunity from destruction when the antiaircraft gunners on the merchant ships peered over the sights of their oerlikons bofors or pompoms twopounders the thought that he gets me or i get him didnt make for the degree of cool detachment which would have been helpful in the circumstances in the arctic winter those torpedobombers were not infrequently at a disadvantage especially for the gallant but unfortunate pilots who flew them ice could freeze up their torpedo release mechanisms and their burdened aircraft were unable to lift off over their targets this made little difference to the equally unfortunate crews of the merchant vessels whether the torpedo was running free or still attached to the aircraft when it crashed into the ship the results were equally devastating the heinkel used glider bombers these werehighly effective exposed their pilots to a much lesser degree of risk and the bombs once released were virtually impossible to shoot down fortunately for the merchant navy the germans did not have too many of these highly specialized planes the stuka the dihedral gullwinged junker divebomber was the most feared of all it was their customary practice to fly at high altitude in level formation then peel off successively in nearvertical dives forty years later the seamen and soldiers the germans used the junker in every theatre of war who survived those attacks and are still alive will never forget the sound of the banshee shrieking as the stuka pilots switched on their sirens in their plummeting dive the sound to say the least was unnerving and considerably reduced the effectiveness of antiaircraft gunners the royal navy used searchlights customarily of the inch variety in an attempt to blind the stuka pilots until it was pointed out to them that the pilots who were well aware of this tactic used dark glasses to reduce the blinding glare to mere pinpoints of light which enabled them to home in even more accurately on their targets from the german point of view the stukas had only one drawback they were essentially shortrange planes and could operate effectively only against convoys moving to the north of norway en route to murmansk and archangel but oddly enough the most effective air weapon the germans had was the essentially noncombative fockewulf condor true it could and did carry kilo bombs and had a fairly formidable array of machineguns but with bombs removed and extra fuel tanks fitted in their place it became an invaluable reconnaissance plane for that comparatively early flying era in the early forties its flying range was quite remarkable condors flew almost daily from trondheim in germanoccupied norway round the western coast of the british isles to germanoccupied france more importantly they were capable of patrolling the barents sea the greenland sea and most damagingly of all the justly dreaded denmark strait between iceland and greenland for it was through that strait that the russianbound convoys from canada and the united states passed for such a convoy the sight of a condor was the guarantee of inevitable disaster flying high and safely out of reach of antiaircraft fire the condor would literally circle the convoy its crew noting down the number of ships the convoys speed course and precise latitude and longitude this information was radioed to alta fjord or trondheim and then transmitted to lorient the french hq of admiral karl doenitz almost certainly the best submarine cinc of his time or any time from there the information was retransmitted to the growing submarine wolfpack or packs instructing them when and where exactly to position themselves to intercept the convoy as far as surface warships were concerned the germans were more than adequately prepared at the outbreak of war by the anglogerman agreement of germany could build of the british equivalent of submarines but only of surface ships in fact they built twice as many submarines and completely ignored the other restriction the deutschland admiral grafspee and admiral scheer were nominally ton cruisers they were in fact fast and powerful commerce raiders in effect pocket battleships of afar greater tonnage than purported the scharnhorst and gneisenau ton battlecruisers were completed in and it was in that year that the bismarck and tirpitz were laid down in the blohm and voess shipyards in hamburg those were the best and most powerful battleships ever built a statement that remains true to this day by treaty limitations they were restricted to tons they were in fact tons the bismarck had a brief but spectacular career the tirpitz no career at all it spent its war holed up in northern norway where it none the less performed the invaluable function of tying up major units of the british home fleet which feared that the giant battleship might slip its moorings in alta fjord and break out into the atlantic it was at those moorings that the tirpitz was ultimately destroyed by tenton bombs from raf lancasters although the british had a very considerable advantage in battleships they were individually no match for those of the germans as was tragically proved when the bismarck sank the battlecruiser hood pride and darling of the royal navy with a single salvo underwater the germans used mines and submarines less than three months after the outbreak of war the germans had come up with a rather unpleasant device the magnetic mine unlike the standard type which had to come into physical contact with a vessel before being activated the magnetic mine was set off by the electrical current generated by the ships hull those mines could be laid by either ships or aircraft and in the first four days after their introduction no fewer than fifteen ships were sent to the bottom the fact that they were nearly all neutrals seemed of no great concern to the germans magnetic mines are very clever devices but not clever enough to discriminate between a neutral and an enemy the british managed to retrieve one intact took it to pieces not without considerable danger to those engaged in the dismantling and came up with electronic countermeasures which enabled minesweepers to detonate the magnetic mine at a respectful distance submarines of course were the most deadly enemies the merchant navy had to face the toll taken in the first three and a half years of war was savage beyond belief it wasnt until the early summer of that the menace was brought under some form of control but it wasnt until the end of during the two years o german submarines were destroyed that those stealthy pursuers and silent killers ceased to be a factor of consequence it was inevitable that the uboats should be selected as the target for hatred and their crews depicted both during the war and subsequently as cunning treacherous and icecold murderers fanatical nazis to a man who hunted down unsuspecting innocents closed in unheard and unseen destroyed their victims without mercy or compunction then moved on again still unheard and unseen to a limited extent this view was valid the pattern for this belief was set on the very first day of the war when the liner athenia was torpedoed in no way could the athenia have been mistaken for anything other than what it was a peaceful passenger vessel crammed with civilians men women and children this must have been known to the far from gallant oberleutnant fritzjulius lemp commander of the german uboat that sent the athenia to the bottom there is no record that lemp was ever reprimanded for his action the same charge of ruthlessness of course could have been levelled against allied submariners to a lesser extent admittedly it is true but that was only because they had a much more limited choice of targets the overall uboat picture is false ruthless nazis there may have been among the crews but they were a tiny minority the men were motivated principally by an intense pride in the traditions of the imperial german navy certainly there were acts of brutality by individual uboat commanders but there were also acts of humanity gallantry and compassion what was undeniable was the immense personal courage and spirit of selfsacrifice of those men it has to be remembered that out of a total of uboat submariners died the most shocking casualty rate in the history of naval warfare while the actions of those men are not to be condoned the men themselves are not to be condemned ruthless they were the nature of their job demanded it but they were brave beyond belief such then were the conditions in which the men of the merchant navy had to live and die such too were their enemies who sought implacably to destroy them the odds against the health and lives of the merchantmen surviving respectively their living conditions and the attentions of the enemy were high indeed theirs was a classic nowin situation in the circumstances it was an astonishing and commonplace fact that men who had survived two or three torpedoings and sinkings would immediately on their return to britain seek out another ship to take them to sea again by definition those men were noncombatants but their endurance tenacity and determination they would have laughed at words like gallantry and courage matched those of the men who hunted them down one silently undramatically without any forewarning as in any abrupt and unexpected power cut in a city the lights aboard the san andreas died in the hour before the dawn such blackouts were rare but not unknown and gave rise to no particular alarm as far as the handling and navigation of the vessel were concerned on the bridge the binnacle light that illuminated the compass the chart light and the essential telephone line to the engineroom remained unaffected because operating as they did on a lower voltage they had their own separate generator the overhead lights were on the main generator but this was of no consequence as those lights were switched off the bridge any bridge was always darkened at night the only item on the bridge that did fail was the kent screen an inset circular plate of glass directly ahead of the helmsman which spun at high speed and offered a clear view in all conditions third officer batesman the officer of the watch was unworried to the best of his belief there were neither land nor ships within a hundred miles of him with the exception of the frigate hms andover he had no idea where the frigate was and it didnt matter the frigate always knew where he was for it was equipped with highly sophisticated radar in the operating theatre and recovery room it was a case of business as usual although the surrounding sea and sky were still dark as midnight the hour was not early in those high latitudes and at that time of year daylight or what passed for daylight arrived about am in those two rooms the most important in a hospital ship for that was what the san andreas was batterypowered lights came on automatically when the main power failed throughout the rest of the ship emergency lighting was provided by handhung nickelcadmium lamps a twist of the base of such a lamp provided at least a bare minimum of illumination what did give rise to concern was the complete failure of the upper deck lights the hull of the san andreas was painted white more correctly it had been white but time and the sleet hail snow and ice spicules of arctic storms had eroded the original to something between a dingy offwhite and an equally dingy light grey a green band ran all the way around the hull very big red crosses had been painted on both her sides as well as on the fore and afterdecks during nighttime those red crosses were illuminated by powerful floodlights at that time darkness accounted for twenty hours out of the twentyfour opinion as to the value of those lights was fairly evenly divided according to the geneva convention those red crosses guaranteed immunity against enemy attacks and as the san andreas had so far been reassuringly immune those aboard her who had never been subjected to an enemy attack of any kind tended to believe in the validity of the geneva convention but the crew members who had served aboard before her conversion from a liberty cargo carrier to her present status regarded the convention with a very leery eye to sail at night lit up like a christmas tree went against all the instincts of men who for years had been conditioned to believe rightly that to light a cigarette on the upper deck was to attract the attention of a wandering uboat they didnt trust the lights they didnt trust the red crosses above all they didnt trust the uboats there was justification for their cynicism other hospital boats they knew had been less fortunate than they had been but whether those attacks had been deliberate or accidental had never been established there are no courts of law on the high seas and no independent witnesses either from reasons of delicacy or because they thought it pointless the crew never discussed the matter with those who lived in what they regarded as a fools paradise the doctors the sisters the nurses and the ward orderlies the starboard screen door on the bridge opened and a figure torch in hand entered batesman said captain indeed one of these days ill get to finish my breakfast in peace some lamps will you third captain bowen was of medium height running to fat wellbuilt was his preferred term with a cheerful whitebearded face and periwinkleblue eyes he was also well past retirement age but had never asked to retire and never been asked to in both ships and men the merchant navy had suffered crippling losses and a new ship could be made in a tiny fraction of the time it took to make a new captain there werent too many captain bowens left around the three emergency lamps didnt give much more light than a similar number of candles would have done but it was enough to see just how quickly the captains coat had been covered in snow in the brief seconds it had taken him to cover the distance from the saloon he removed the coat shook it out through the doorway and hurriedly closed the door bloody generator having one of its fits again bowen said he didnt seem particularly upset about it but then no one had ever seen the captain upset about anything kent screen on the blink of course no odds useless anyway heavy snow thirty knot wind and visibility zero there was a certain satisfaction in bowens voice and neither batesman nor hudson the helmsman had to ask why all three belonged to the group of thought that had minimal belief in the geneva convention no plane ship or submarine could hope to locate them in those conditions been through to the engineroom i have not batesman spoke with some feeling and bowen smiled chief engineer patterson a northeasterner from the newcastle area had a high pride in his undoubted skill a temper with a notoriously short fuse and a rooted aversion to being questioned about his activities by anyone as lowly as a third officer ill get the chief sir he got the chief bowen took the phone and said ah john not having much luck this trip are we overload coil brushes fuse ah the standby then i do hope were not out of fuel again captain bowen spoke in tones of grave concern and batesman smiled every member of the crew down even to the pantryboy knew that chief patterson was totally devoid of any sense of humour bowens reference to fuel referred to the occasion when with chief patterson off duty the main generator had failed and the young engineer in charge had forgotten to turn the cock on the fuel line to the auxiliary pattersons comments were predictable with a pained expression on his face bowen held the phone a foot from his ear until the crackling in the earpiece had ceased spoke briefly again then hung up and said diplomatically i think chief patterson is having rather more trouble than usual in locating electrical faults ten minutes he says only two minutes later the phone rang bad news for a fiver bowen lifted the phone listened briefly then said you want a word with me john but you are having a word with me ah i see very well he hung up the chief wants to show me something bowen did not as batesman might have assumed go to the engineroom he went instead to his cabin where he was joined within a minute by the chief engineer a tall lean man with an unremarkable face and a permanent five oclock shadow he was like a number of men who are humourless and unaware of it given to smiling at frequent intervals and usually at inappropriate moments he was not however smiling at that particular moment he produced three pieces of what appeared to be black carbon and arranged them on the captains table until they formed an oblong shape what do you make of that then you know me john just a simple seaman an armature brush for a dynamo or generator or whatever exactly patterson was much better at being grim than he was at smiling hence the power failure nothing to do with the power failure overload coil thrown short somewhere jamiesons taken a bridgemegger and gone off to locate it shouldnt take him long to locate it this bowen was prepared to believe jamieson the second engineer was a very bright young man with the unusual distinction of being an amiee an associate member of the institute of electrical engineers he said so this brush comes from the auxiliary generator its broken you seem unhappy about it so i take it this is unusual unusual its unknown at least ive never known of it the brush is under constant springloaded pressure against the face of the armature there is no way it could have broken in this particular fashion well it did happen first time for everything bowen touched the broken pieces with his finger a oneoff job flaw in manufacture patterson didnt answer he dug into an overall pocket brought out a small metal box removed the lid and placed the box on the table beside the broken brush the two brushes inside were identical in shape and size to the one that patterson had reassembled bowen looked at them pursed his lips then looked at patterson spares patterson nodded bowen picked one up but only one half came away in his hand the other half remained in the bottom of the box our only two spares patterson said no point in examining the other none both generators were examined and in good shape when we were in halifax and weve used the auxiliary twice since leaving there one broken brush could be an extraordinary fluke three broken ones dont even make for a ludicrous coincidence doesnt even call for thoughtful chinrubbing john we have an illintentioned crank in our midst crank saboteur you mean well yes i suppose at least someone who is illdisposed to us or towards the san andreas but saboteur i wonder saboteurs go in for varied forms of wholesale destruction breaking three generator brushes can hardly be classified as wholesale destruction and unless the character responsible is deranged hes not going to send the san andreas to the bottom not with him inside it why john why they were still sitting there darkly pondering why when a knock came at the door and jamieson entered young redheaded and with an ebullient and carefree attitude to life he was being anything but ebullient and carefree at that moment he had about him an air of gravity and anxiety both quite alien to his nature engineroom told me id find you here i thought i should come at once as the bearer of bad news captain bowen said you have discovered two things the location of the short and evidence of shall we say sabotage how the hell im sorry sir but how could you possibly tell him john bowen said i dont have to those broken brushes are enough what did you find peter forard carpenters shop lead cable passing through a bulkhead clips on either side seemed to have worked loose where it passed through the hole in the bulkhead bowen said normal ships vibration weather movement doesnt take much to chafe through soft lead leads tougher than you think sir in this case a pair of hands helped the normal chafing along not that that matters inside the lead sheathing the rubber round the power cable has been scorched away which one would expect in a short yes sir only i know the smell of electrically burnt rubber and it doesnt smell like sulphur some bright lad had used an igniting matchhead or heads to do the trick ive left ellis on the repair job its simple and he should be about through now well well so its as easy as that to knock out a ships electrical power almost sir hed one other little job to do theres a fusebox just outside the carpenters shop and he removed the appropriate fuse before starting work then he returned to the fusebox and shorted out the line insulated pliers ditto screwdriver almost anything would do then replaced the fuse if hed replaced the fuse before shorting out the line it would have blown leaving the rest of the electrical system intact theoretically that is on very rare occasions the fuse is not so obliging and doesnt go jamieson smiled faintly fact of the matter is if id had a cold in the nose he might have got away with it the phone rang captain bowen lifted it and handed it over to patterson who listened said sure now and handed the phone back engineroom power coming on perhaps half a minute passed then captain bowen said mildly you know i dont think the power is coming on jamieson rose and bowen said where are you going i dont know sir well first of all to the engineroom to pick up ellis and the bridgemegger and then i dont know it would seem that old flannelfoot has more than one string to his bow the phone rang again and bowen without answering handed it over to patterson who listened briefly said thank you mr jamieson is coming down and handed the phone back same again i wonder how many places our friend has jinxed and is just waiting for the opportunity to activate them jamieson hesitated at the door do we keep this to ourselves we do not bowen was positive we broadcast it far and wide granted flannelfoot as you call him will be forewarned and forearmed but the knowledge that a saboteur is at large will make everyone look at his neighbour and wonder what a saboteur looks like if nothing else it will make this lad a great deal more circumspect and with any luck may restrict his activities quite a bit jamieson nodded and left bowen said i think john you might double the watch in the engineroom or at least bring two or three extra men not you understand for engineroom duties i understand you think perhaps if you wanted to sabotage incapacitate a ship where would you go patterson rose went to the door and as jamieson had done stopped there and turned why he said why why why i dont know why but i have an unpleasant feeling about the where and the when here or hereabouts and sooner than we think quicker than we want somebody captain bowen said as if by way of explanation has just walked over my grave patterson gave him a long look and closed the door quietly behind him bowen picked up the phone dialled a single number and said archie my cabin he had no sooner replaced the receiver when it rang again it was the bridge batesman didnt sound too happy snowstorms blowing itself out sir andover can see us now wants to know why were not showing any lights i told them we had a power failure then another message just now why the hell are we taking so long to fix it sabotage i beg your pardon sir sabotage s for sally a for arthur b for bobby o for good god whatever i mean why i do not know why captain bowen spoke with a certain restraint tell them that ill tell you what i know which is practically nothing when i come up to the bridge five minutes maybe ten archie mckinnon the bosun came in captain bowen regarded the bosun as indeed many other captains regarded their bosuns as the most important crew member aboard he was a shetlander about six feet two in height and built accordingly perhaps forty years of age with a brickcoloured complexion bluegrey eyes and flaxen hair the last two almost certainly inheritances from viking ancestors who had passed by or through his native island a millennium previously sit down sit down bowen said he sighed archie we have a saboteur aboard have we now he raised eyebrows no startled oaths from the bosun not ever and what has he been up to captain bowen told him what he had been up to and said can you make any more of it than i can which is zero if you cant captain i cant the regard in which the captain held the bosun was wholly reciprocated he doesnt want to sink the ship not with him aboard and the water temperature below freezing he doesnt want to stop the ship theres half a dozen ways a clever man could do that im thinking myself that all he wanted to do is to douse the lights which at nighttime anyway identify us as a hospital ship and why would he want to do that archie it was part of their unspoken understanding that the captain always called him bosun except when they were alone well the bosun pondered you know im not a highlander or a western islander so i cant claim to be fey or have the second sight there was just the faintest suggestion of an amalgam of disapproval and superiority in the bosuns voice but the captain refrained from smiling essentially he knew shetlanders did not regard themselves as scots and restricted their primary allegiance to the shetlands but like yourself captain i have a nose for trouble and i cant say im very much liking what i can smell half an hour well maybe forty minutes anybody will be able to see that we are a hospital ship he paused and looked at the captain with what might possibly have been a hint of surprise which was the nearest the bosun ever came to registering emotion i cant imagine why but i have the feeling that someone is going to have a go at us before dawn at dawn most likely i cant imagine why either archie but i have the same feeling myself alert the crew will you ready for emergency stations spread the word that theres an illegal electrician in our midst the bosun smiled so that they can keep an eye on each other i dont think captain that well find the man among the crew theyve been with us for a long time now i hope not and i think not thats to say id like to think not but it was someone who knew his way around their wages are not exactly on a princely scale youd be surprised what a bag of gold can do to a mans loyalty after twentyfive years at sea there isnt a great deal that can surprise me those survivors we took off that tanker last night well i wouldnt care to call any of them my bloodbrother come come bosun a little of the spirit of christian charity if you please it was a greek tanker greece is supposed to be an ally if you remember and the crew would be greek well greek cypriot lebanese hottentot if you like cant expect them all to look like shetlanders i didnt see any of them carrying a pot of gold no but some of them the uninjured ones i mean were carrying suitcases and some of them were carrying overcoats and at least three of them were wearing ties and why not the argos spent six hours there wallowing around after being mined time and enough for anyone to pack his worldly possessions or such few possessions as greek seamen appear to have it would be a bit much i think archie to expect a crippled greek tanker in the barents sea to have aboard a crewman with a bag of gold who just happened to be a trained saboteur aye its not a combination that one would expect to find every day do we alert the hospital yes whats the latest down there the bosun invariably knew the state of everything aboard the san andreas whether it concerned his department or not i dr singh and dr sinclair have just finished operating one man with a broken pelvis the other with extensive burns theyre in the recovery room now and should be okay nurse magnusson is with them my word archie you do appear to be singularly wellinformed nurse magnusson is a shetlander the bosun said as if that explained everything seven patients in ward a not fit to be moved worst is the chief officer of the argos but not in danger janet says janet nurse magnusson the bosun was a difficult man to put off his stride ten in recuperating ward b the argos survivors are in the bunks on the port side ill go down there now go and alert the crew when youve finished come along to the sickbay and bring a couple of your men with you sickbay the bosun regarded the deckhead youd better not let sister morrison hear you call it that bowen smiled ah the formidable sister morrison all right hospital twenty sick men down there not to mention sisters nurses and ward orderlies who and doctors and doctors who have never heard a shot fired in their lives a close eye archie you are expecting the worst captain i am not bowen said heavily expecting the best the hospital area of the san andreas was remarkably airy and roomy remarkably but not surprisingly for the san andreas was primarily a hospital and not a ship and well over half of the lower deck space had been given over to its medical facilities the breaching of watertight bulkheads a hospital ship theoretically did not require watertight bulkheads increased both the sense and the actuality of the spaciousness the area was taken up by two wards an operating theatre recovery room medical store dispensary galley quite separate from and independent of the crews galley cabins for the medical staff two messes one for the staff the other for recuperating patients and a small lounge it was towards the last of these that captain bowen now made his way he found three people there having tea dr singh dr sinclair and sister morrison dr singh was an amiable man of pakistan descent middleaged and wearing a pincenez he was one of the few people who looked perfectly at home with such glasses he was a qualified and competent surgeon who disliked being called mister dr sinclair sandyhaired and every bit as amiable as his colleague was twentysix years old and had quit in his second year as an intern in a big teaching hospital to volunteer for service in the merchant navy nobody could ever have accused sister morrison of being amiable about the same age as sinclair she had auburn hair big brown eyes and a generous mouth all three of which accorded ill with her habitually prim expression the steelrimmed glasses which she occasionally affected and a faint but unmistakable aura of aristocratic hauteur captain bowen wondered what she looked like when she smiled he wondered if she ever smiled he explained briefly why he had come their reactions were predictable sister morrison pursed her lips dr sinclair raised his eyebrows and dr singh halfsmiling said dear me dear me saboteur or saboteurs spy or spies aboard a british vessel quite unthinkable he meditated briefly but then not everybody aboard is strictly british im not for one your passport says you are bowen smiled as you were operating in the theatre at the time that our saboteur was operating elsewhere that automatically removes you from the list of potential suspects unfortunately we dont have a list of suspects potential or otherwise we do indeed dr singh have a fair number of people who were not born in britain we have two indians lascars two goanese two singhalese two poles a puerto rican a southern irishman and for some odd reason an italian who as an official enemy ought to be a prisonerofwar or in an internment camp somewhere and of course the survivors of the argos are nonbritish to a man and dont forget me sister morrison said coldly im half german you are with a name like margaret morrison she pursed her lips an exercise which seemed to come naturally to her how do you know that my name is margaret a captain holds the crew lists like it or not you are a member of the crew not that any of this matters spies saboteurs can be of any nationality and the more unlikely they are in this case being british the more efficiently they can operate as i say thats at the moment irrelevant what is relevant is that the bosun and two of his men will be here very shortly should an emergency arise he will assume complete charge except of course for the handling of the very ill i assume you all know the bosun an admirable man dr singh said very reassuring very competent couldnt imagine anyone id rather have around in times of need we all know him sister morrison was as good with her cold tones as she was with her pursed lips heaven knows hes here often enough visiting the sick visiting the sick i dont like the idea of an ordinary seaman pestering one of my nurses mr mckinnon is not an ordinary seaman hes an extraordinary seaman and hes never pestered anyone in his life lets have janet along here to see if she bears out your preposterous allegations you you know her name of course i know her name bowen sounded weary it was net the moment he thought to mention the fact that until five minutes ago he had never heard of anyone called janet they come from the same island and have much to talk about it would help miss morrison if you took as much interest in your staff as i do in mine it was a good exit line bowen thought but he wasnt particularly proud of himself in spite of the way she spoke he rather liked the girl because he suspected that the image she projected was not the real one and that there might be some very good reason for this but she was not archie mckinnon the chief officer one geraint kennet an unusual name but one that he maintained came from an ancient aristocratic lineage was awaiting bowens arrival on the bridge kennet was a welshman lean of figure and of countenance very dark and very irreverent you are lost mr kennet bowen said bowen had long ago abandoned the old habit of addressing a chief officer as mister when the hour strikes sir kennet is there i hear of i alarms and excursions from young jamie here young jamie was third officer batesman something sinister afoot i gather you gather rightly just how sinister i dont know he described what little had happened so two electrical breakdowns if you could call them that and a third in the process of being investigated and it would be naive to think that the third is not connected with the other two very naive this presages something ominous dont they teach you english in those welsh schools no sir i mean yes sir you have reached a conclusion not perhaps a very nice one the phone rang batesman took it and handed the phone to bowen who listened briefly thanked the caller and hung up jamieson in the cold room this time how could anyone get into the cold room cooks got the only key easily kennet said if a man was a saboteur trained in his art if thats the word i want one would expect him to be an expert picklock or at least to carry a set of skeleton keys around with him with respect sir i hardly think thats the point when will this villain strike again when indeed flannelfoot thats jamiesons term for him seems to be a villain of some resource and foresight it is more than likely that he has some further surprises jamieson is of the same mind if theres another power failure when they switch on again he says hes going to go over every inch of wiring with his bridgemegger whatever that is some sort of instrument for detecting voltage leaks you know breaks in a circuit its occurred to me chief radio officer spenser appeared at the hatchway of his wireless office paper in hand message from the andover sir bowen read out continued absence of lights very serious essential expedite matters has saboteur been apprehended kennet said cue i think for angry spluttering mans a fool bowen said commander warrington i mean captain of the frigate spenser send if you have any members of the special branch or cid with you they are welcome aboard if not kindly refrain from sending pointless signals what the hell do you think were trying to do kennet said in the circumstances sir a very restrained signal as i was about to say the phone rang again batesman took the call listened acknowledged hung up and turned to the captain engineroom sir another malfunction both jamieson and third engineer ralson are on their way up with meggers bowen brought out his pipe and said nothing he gave the impression of a man temporarily bereft of words kennet wasnt but then kennet never was man never gets to finish a sentence on this bridge have you arrived at any conclusion sir however unpleasant conclusion no hunch suspicion yes unpleasant yes i would take odds that by or at dawn someone is going to have a go at us fortunately kennet said i am not a betting man in any event i wouldnt bet against my own convictions which are the same as yours sir were a hospital ship sir batesman said he didnt even sound hopeful bowen favoured him with a morose glance if you are immune to the sufferings of the sick and dying and care to exercise a certain coldblooded and twisted logic then we are a manofwar even though we are completely defenceless for what do we do we take our sick and wounded home fix them up and send them off again to the front or to the sea to fight the germans once more if you were to stretch your conscience far enough you could make a good case out of maintaining that to allow a hospital ship to reach its homeland is tantamount to aiding and abetting the enemy oberleutnant lemp would have torpedoed us without a second thought oberleutnant who lemp chap who sent the athenia to the bottom and lemp knew that the athenia carried only civilians as passengers men women and children who r he knew this well would never be used to fight against the germans the athenia was a case much more deserving of compassion than we are dont you think third i wish you wouldnt talk like that sir batesman was now not only as morose as the captain had been but positively mournful how do we know that this fellow lemp is not lurking out there just over the horizon fear not kennet said oberleutnant lemp has long since been gathered to his ancestors for whom one can feel only a certain degree of sympathy however he may have a twin brother or some kindred souls out there as the captain so rightly infers we live in troubled and uncertain times batesman looked at bowen is it permitted captain to ask the chief officer to shut up kennet smiled broadly then stopped smiling as the phone rang again batesman reached for the phone but bowen forestalled him masters privilege third the news may be too heavy for a young man like you to bear he listened cursed by way of acknowledgment and hung up when he turned round he looked and sounded disgusted bloody officers toilet kennet said flannelfoot who do you think it was santa claus a sound choice kennet said judiciously very sound where else could a man work in such peace privacy and for an undetermined period of time blissfully immune one might say from any fear of interruption might even have time to read a chapter of his favourite thriller as is the habit of one young officer aboard this ship who shall remain nameless the third officer has the right of it bowen said will you kindly shut up yes sir was that jamieson yes we should be hearing from ralson any time now jamieson has already heard from him seamens toilet this time port side for once kennet had no observation to make and for almost a minute there was silence on the bridge for the sufficient reason that there didnt seem to be any comment worth making when the silence was broken it was inevitably by kennet a few more minutes and our worthy engineers might as well cease and desist or am i the only person who has noticed that the dawn is in the sky the dawn indeed was in the sky already to the southeast off the port beam the sky had changed from black or as black as it ever becomes in northern waters to a dark grey and was steadily lightening the snow had completely stopped now the wind had dropped to twenty knots and the san andreas was pitching not heavily in the head seas coming up from the northwest kennet said shall i post a couple of extra lookouts sir one on either wing and what can those lookouts do make faces at the enemy they cant do a great deal more and thats a fact but if anyone is going to have a go at us its going to be now a highflying condor for instance you can almost see the bombs leaving the bay and theres an even chance in evasive action kennet didnt sound particularly enthusiastic or convinced and if its a submarine divebomber gliderbomber or torpedobomber they can still give us warning and time for a prayer mind you probably a very short prayer but still a prayer as you wish mr kennet kennet made a call and within three minutes his lookouts arrived on the bridge duffelcoated and scarfed to the eyebrows as kennet had instructed mcguigan and jones a southern irishman and a welshman they were boys only neither of them a day over eighteen kennet issued them with binoculars and posted them on the bridge wings jones to port mcguigan to starboard seconds only after closing the port door jones opened it again ship sir port quarter his voice was excited urgent warship i think relax kennet said i doubt whether its the tirpitz less than half a dozen people aboard knew that the andover had accompanied them during the night he stepped out on to the wing and returned almost immediately the good shepherd he said three miles its almost halflight now captain bowen said we could be wrong mr kennet the radio room hatchway panel banged open and spensers face appeared andover sir bandit bandit one bandit ten miles five thousand there now kennet said i knew we werent wrong full power sir bowen nodded and kennet gave the necessary instructions to the engineroom evasive action bowen was halfsmiling knowledge however unwelcome that knowledge always comes as a relief after uncertainty a condor you would guess no guess sir in those waters only the condor flies alone kennet slid back the port wing door and gazed skywards cloud covers pretty thin now we should be able to see our friend coming up he should be practically dead astern shall we go out on the wing sir in a minute mr kennet two minutes gather flowers while we may or at least keep warm as long as possible if fate has abandoned us we shall be freezing to death all too soon tell me mr kennet has any profound thought occurred to you a lot of thoughts have occurred to me but i wouldnt say any of them are profound how on earth do you think that condor located us submarine it could have surfaced and radioed alta fjord no submarine the andovers sonar would have picked him up no plane no surface ships thats a certainty kennet frowned for a few seconds then smiled flannelfoot he said with certainty a radio not necessarily even that a small electrical device probably powered by our own mains system that transmits a continuous homing signal so if we survive this lot its out with the finetooth comb indeed its out with andover sir it was spenser again four bandits repeat four bandits eight miles three thousand i wonder what weve done to deserve this kennet sounded almost mournful we were even more right than we thought sir torpedobombers or gliderbombers thats for sure attacking out of the darkness to the northwest and us silhouetted against the dawn the two men moved out on the port wing the andover was still on the port quarter but had closed in until it was less than two miles distant a low bank of cloud at about the same distance obscured the view aft hear anything mr kennet see anything nothing nothing damn that cloud yes i do i hear it its a condor its a condor once heard the desynchronized clamour of a fockewulf s engine is not readily forgotten and im afraid mr kennet that youll have to postpone your evasive action practice for another time this lad sounds as if he is coming in very low yes hes coming in low and i know why most unusually for kennet he sounded very bitter he intends to do some pinpoint precision bombing hes under orders to stop us or cripple us but not sink us ill bet that bastard flannelfoot feels as safe as houses you have it to rights mr kennet he could stop us by bombing the engineroom but doing that is a practical guarantee that we go to the bottom there he comes now the fockewulf condor had broken through the cloud and was heading directly for the stern of the san andreas every gun on the andover that could be brought to bear had opened up as soon as the fockewulf had cleared the cloudbank and within seconds the starboard side of the andover was wreathed in smoke for a frigate its antiaircraft firepower was formidable lowangle main armament pompoms oerlikons and the equally deadly boultonpaul defiant turrets which loosed off a devastating rounds a minute the fockewulf must have been hit many times but the big condors capacity to absorb punishment was legendary still it came on now no more than two hundred feet above the waves the sound of the engines had risen from the clamorous to the thunderous this is no place for a couple of honest seamen to be mr kennet captain bowen had to shout to make himself heard but i think its too late now i rather think it is sir two bombs just two arced lazily down from the now smoking condor two had the americans retained the original british design concept for accommodation aboard the liberty ships the tragedy while still remaining such would at least have been minimized the original sunderland plans had the accommodation both fore and aft henry kaisers designers in their wisdom blind folly as it turned out had all their accommodation for both officers and men including also the navigating bridge grouped in a single superstructure surrounding the funnel the bosun dr sinclair by his side had reached the upper deck before the condor reached the san andreas they were almost immediately joined by patterson for whom the andovers barrage had sounded like a series of heavy metallic blows on the side of his engineroom down the bosun shouted two powerful arms around their shoulders bore them to the deck for the fockewulf had reached the san andreas before the bombs did and the bosun was well aware that the fockewulf carried a fairly lethal array of machine guns which it did not hesitate to use when the occasion demanded on this occasion however the guns remained silent possibly because the gunners were under instructions not to fire more probably because the gunners were already dead for it was plain that the condor trailing a huge plume of black smoke whether from fuselage or engines it was impossible to say and veering sharply to starboard was itself about to die the two bombs contact and not armourpiercing struck fore and aft of the funnel exploded simultaneously and just immediately after passing through the unprotected deckheads of the living quarters blowing the shattered bulkheads outwards and filling the air with screaming shards of metal and broken glass none of which reached the three pronemen the bosun cautiously lifted his head and stared in disbelief as the funnel seemingly intact but sheared off at its base toppled slowly over the port side and into the sea any sound of a splash that there may have been was drowned out by the swelling roar of more aero engines stay down stay down flat on the deck the bosun twisted his head to the right there were four of them in line abreast formation heinkel torpedobombers half a mile away no more than twenty feet above the water and headed directly for the starboard side of the san andreas ten seconds he thought twelve at the most and the dead men in the charnel house of that shattered superstructure would have company and to spare why had the guns of the andover fallen silent he twisted his head to the left to look at the frigate and immediately realized why it was impossible that the gunners on the andover could not hear the sound of the approaching heinkels but it was equally impossible that they could see them the san andreas was directly in line between the frigate and the approaching bombers which were flying below the height of their upper deck he twisted his head to the right again and to his momentary astonishment saw that this was no longer the case the heinkels were lifting clear of the water with the intention of flying over the san andreas which they did seconds later not much more than ten feet above the deck two on each side of the twisted superstructure the san andreas had not been the target only the shield for the heinkels the frigate was the target and the bombers were half way between the san andreas and the frigate before the bemused defenders aboard the andover understood what was happening when they did understand their reaction was sharp and violent the main armament was virtually useless it takes time to train and elevate a gun of any size and against a closein and fastmoving target there just isnt time the antiaircraft guns the twopounders the oerlikons and the defiants did indeed mount a heavy barrage but torpedobombers were notoriously difficult targets not least because the gunners were acutely aware that death was only seconds away a realization that made for less than a controlled degree of accuracy the bombers were less than three hundred yards away when the plane on the lefthand side of the formation pulled up and banked to its left to clear the stern of the andover almost certainly neither the plane nor the pilot had been damaged as was not unknown the torpedo release mechanism had iced up freezing the torpedo in place at about the same instant the plane on the right descended in a shallow dive until it touched the water almost certainly the pilot had been shot a victory but a pyrrhic one the other two heinkels released their torpedoes and lifted clear of the andover three torpedoes hit the andover almost simultaneously the two that had been cleanly released and the one that was still attached to the plane that had crashed into the water all three torpedoes detonated but there was little enough in the way of thunderclaps of sound or shock waves water always has this same muffling effect on an underwater explosion what they did produce however was a great sheet of water and spray which rose to two hundred feet into the sky and then slowly subsided when it finally disappeared the andover was on its beam ends and deep in the water within twenty seconds with only a faint hissing as the water flooded the engineroom and with curiously little in the way of bubbles the andover slid beneath the surface of the sea my god my god my god dr sinclair swaying slightly was on his feet as a doctor he was acquainted with death but not in this shocking form he was still dazed not quite aware of what was going on around him good god that big plane is coming back again the big plane the condor was indeed coming back again but it offered no threat to them dense smoke pouring from all four engines it completed a half circle and was approaching the san andreas less than half a mile away it touched the surface of the sea momentarily dipped beneath it then came into sight again there was no more smoke god rest them patterson said he was almost abnormally calm damage control party first see if were making water although i shouldnt have thought so yes sir the bosun looked at what was left of the superstructure perhaps a firecontrol party lots of blankets mattresses clothes papers in there god only knows whats smouldering away already do you think there will be any survivors in there i wouldnt even guess sir if there are thank heavens were a hospital ship patterson turned to dr sinclair and shook him gently doctor we need your help he nodded towards the superstructure you and dr singh and the ward orderlies ill send some men with sledges and crowbars an oxyacetylene torch said the bosun of course weve got enough medical equipment and stores aboard to equip a small town hospital sinclair said if there are any survivors all well require is a few hypodermic syringes he seemed back on balance again we dont take in the nurses good god no patterson shook his head vehemently i tell you wouldnt like to go in there if there are any survivors theyll have their share of horrors later mckinnon said permission to take away the lifeboat sir whatever for there could be survivors from the andover survivors she went down in thirty seconds the hood blew apart in one second there were three survivors of course of course im not a seaman bosun you dont need permission from me yes i do sir the bosun gestured towards the superstructure all the deck officers are there youre in command good god the thought the realization had never struck patterson what a way to assume command and speaking of command sir the san andreas is no longer under command shes slewing rapidly to port steering mechanism on the bridge must have been wrecked steering can wait ill stop the engines three minutes later the bosun eased the throttle and edged the lifeboat towards an inflatable life raft which was rollercoasting heavily near the spot where the now vanished condor had been there were only two men in the raft the rest of the aircrew the bosun assumed had gone to the bottom with the fockewulf they had probably been dead anyway one of the men no more than a youngster very seasick and looking highly apprehensive he had every right the bosun thought to be apprehensive was sitting upright and clinging to a lifeline the other lay on his back in the bottom of the raft in the regions of his left upper chest left upper arm and right thigh his flying overalls were saturated with blood his eyes were closed jesus sake able seaman ferguson who had a powerful liverpool accent and whose scarred face spoke eloquently of battles lost and won mainly in barrooms looked at the bosun with a mixture of disbelief and outrage jesus bosun youre not going to pick those bastards up they just tried to send us to the bottom us a hospital ship wouldnt you like to know why they bombed a hospital ship theres that theres that ferguson reached out with a boat hook and brought the raft alongside either of you speak english the wounded man opened his eyes they too seemed to be filled with blood i do you look badly hurt i want to know where before we try to bring you aboard left arm left shoulder i think right thigh and i believe theres something wrong with my right foot his english was completely fluent and if there was any accent at all it was a hint of southern standard english not german youre the condor captain of course yes still want to bring me aboard the bosun nodded to ferguson and the two other seamen he had along with him the three men brought the injured pilot aboard as carefully as they could but with both lifeboat and raft rolling heavily in the beam seas it was impossible to be too careful they laid him in the thwarts close to where the bosun was sitting by the controls the other survivor huddled miserably amidships the bosun opened the throttle and headed for the position where he estimated the andover had gone down ferguson looked down at the injured man who was lying motionless on his back arms spreadeagled the red stains were spreading it could have been that he was still bleeding quite heavily but it could have been the effect of seawater reckon hes a goner bosun mckinnon reached down and touched the side of the pilots neck and after a few seconds he located the pulse fast faint and erratic but still a pulse unconscious fainted couldnt have been an easy passage for him ferguson regarded the pilot with a certain grudging respect he may be a bloody murderer but hes a bloody tough bloody murderer must have been in agony but never a squawk shouldnt we take him back to the ship first give him a chance like i thought of it no there just may be survivors from the andover and if there are they wont last long sea temperature is about freezing or just below it a mans usually dead inside a minute if theres anyone at all a minutes delay may be a minute too late we owe them that chance besides its going to be a very quick trip back to the ship the san andreas slewing to port had come around in a full halfcircle and under reverse thrust was slowing to a stop patterson had almost certainly done this so as to manoeuvre the temporarily rudderless ship as near as possible to the spot where the andover had been torpedoed only a pathetic scattering of flotsam and jetsam showed where the frigate had gone down baulks of timber a few drums carley floats lifebuoys and life jackets all empty and four men three of the men were together one of them a man with what appeared to be a grey stocking hat was keeping the head of another man either unconscious or dead out of the water with his other hand he waved at the approaching lifeboat all three men were wearing life jackets and much more importantly all three were wearing wet suits which was the only reason they were still alive after fifteen minutes in the icecold waters of an arctic winter all three were hauled inboard the young bareheaded man who had been supported by the man with the grey stocking hat was unconscious not dead he had every reason the bosun thought to be unconscious there was a great swelling bruise still oozing blood just above the right temple the third man it seemed most incongruous in the circumstances wore the peaked braided cap of a naval commander the cap was completely saturated the bosun made to remove it then changed his mind when he saw the blood at the back of the cap the cap was probably stuck to his head the commander was quite conscious he had courteously thanked the bosun for being pulled out of the sea but his eyes were vacant glazed and sightless mckinnon passed a hand before his eyes but there was no reaction for the moment at any rate the commander was quite blind although he knew he was wasting his time the bosun headed towards the fourth man in the water but he backed off when he was still five yards away although his face was deep in the water he hadnt died from drowning but from freezing he wasnt wearing a wet suit the bosun turned the lifeboat back to the san andreas and touched the commander gently on the shoulder how do you feel commander warrington what how do i feel how do you know im commander warrington youre still wearing your cap sir the commander made as if to touch the peak of his cap but the bosun restrained him leave it sir youve cut your head and your hats sticking to it well have you in hospital inside fifteen minutes plenty of doctors and nurses there for that sort of thing sir hospital warrington shook his head as if trying to clear it ah of course the san andreas you must be from her yes sir im the bosun what happened bosun the andover i mean warrington touched the side of his head im a bit foggy up here no bloody wonder three torpedoes sir almost simultaneously you must have been blown off the bridge or fell off it or most likely been washed off it when your ship went down she was on her beam ends then sir and it took only just over twenty seconds how many of us well how many have you found just three sir im sorry god above just three are you sure bosun im afraid im quite sure sir my yeoman of signals im here sir ah hedges thank heavens for that whos the third navigating officer sir hes taken a pretty nasty clout on the head and the first lieutenant hedges didnt answer he had his head buried in his hands and was shaking it from side to side im afraid hedges is a bit upset commander was the first lieutenant wearing a red kapok jacket warrington nodded then we found him sir im afraid he just froze to death he would wouldnt he freeze to death i mean warrington smiled faintly always used to laugh at us and our wet suits carried a rabbits foot around with him and used to say that was all the wet suit hed ever need dr singh was the first man to meet the bosun when he stepped out of the lifeboat patterson was with him as were two orderlies and two stokers the bosun looked at the stokers and wondered briefly what they were doing on deck but only very briefly they were almost certainly doing a seamans job because there were very few seamen left to do it ferguson and his two fellow seamen had been in the forard firecontrol party and might well be the only three left all the other seamen had been in the superstructure at the time of the attack five dr singh said just five from the frigate and the plane just five yes doctor and even they had the devils own luck three of them are pretty wobbly commander looks all right but i think hes in the worst condition he seems to have gone blind and the back of his head has been damaged theres a connection isnt there doctor oh dear yes theres a connection well do what we can patterson said a moment bosun if you will he walked to one side and mckinnon followed him they were halfway towards the twisted superstructure when patterson stopped as bad as that is it sir the bosun said no eavesdroppers i mean we have to trust someone i suppose patterson looked and sounded tired but damned few not after what ive seen inside that superstructure not after one or two things ive found out first things first the hull is still structurally sound no leaks i didnt think there would be were fixing up a temporary rudder control in the engineroom well probably be able to reconnect to the bridge which is the least damaged part of the superstructure there was a small fire in the crews mess but we got that under control he nodded to the sadly twisted mass of metal ahead of them lets pray for cairn weather to come jamieson says the structural supports are so weakened that the whole lot is liable to go over the side if we hit heavy seas would you like to go inside like not like but i have to the bosun hesitated reluctant to hear the answer to the question he had to ask whats the score so far sir up to now weve come across thirteen dead he grimaced and bits and pieces ive decided to leave them where they were meantime there may be more people left alive more you have found some five theyre in a pretty bad way some of them theyre in the hospital he led the way inside the twisted entrance at the after end of the superstructure there are two oxyacetylene teams in there its slow work no fallen beams no wreckage as such just twisted and buckled doors some of them of course the doors i mean were just blown off like this one here the cold room well at least there would have been nobody in there but there were three weeks supply of beef all kinds of meat fish and other perishables in there in a couple of days time well have to start heaving them over the side they moved slowly along the passageway cool room intact sir although i dont suppose a steady diet of fruit and veg will have much appeal oh god the bosun stared into the galley which lay across the passage from the cool room the surfaces of the cooking stoves were at a peculiar angle but all the cupboards and the two work tables were intact but what had caught the bosuns horrified attention was not the furniture but the two men who lay spreadeagled on the floor they seemed unharmed except for a little trickle of blood from the ears and noses netley and spicer the bosun whispered they dont seem theyre dead concussion instantaneous dr patterson said the bosun shook his head and moved on tinned food store he said intact it would be and the liquor store here not a can dented or a bottle broken he paused with your permission sir i think this is a very good time to breach the liquor store a hefty tot of rum all round or at least for the men working in here pretty grim work and its the custom in the royal navy when theres grim work to be done patterson smiled slightly a smile that did not touch the eyes i didnt know you were in the royal navy bosun twelve years for my sins an excellent idea patterson said ill be your first customer they made their way up a twisted but still serviceable companionway to the next deck the bosun with a bottle of rum and half a dozen mugs strung on a wire in the other this was the crew accommodation deck and it was not a pretty sight the passageway had a distinct sbend to it the deck was warped so that it formed a series of undulations at the forard end of the passageway two oxyacetylene teams were at work each attacking a buckled door in the short space between the head of the companionway and where the men were working were eight doors four of them hanging drunkenly on their hinges four that had been cut open by torches seven of those had been occupied and the occupants were still there twelve of them in all in the eighth cabin they found dr sinclair stooping over and administering a morphine injection to a prone but fully conscious patient a consciousness that was testified to by the fact that he was addressing nobody in particular in an unprintable monologue the bosun said how do you feel chips chips was rafferty the ships carpenter im dying he caught sight of the rum bottle in the bosuns hand and his stricken expression vanished but i could made a rapid recovery this man is not dying dr sinclair said he has a simple fracture of the tibia thats all no rum morphine and alcohol make for bad bedfellows later he straightened and tried to smile but i could do with a tot if you would bosun a generous one i feel in need of it with his strained face and pale complexion he unquestionably looked in need of it nothing in dr sinclairs brief medical experience had even remotely begun to prepare him for the experience he was undergoing the bosun poured him the requisite generous measure did the same for patterson and himself then passed the bottle and mugs to the men with the torches and the two ward orderlies who were standing unhappily by strapped stretcher at the ready they looked in no better case than dr sinclair but cheered up noticeably at the sight of the rum the deck above held the officers accommodation it too had been heavily damaged but not so devastatingly so as the deck below patterson stopped at the first cabin they came to its door had been blown inwards and the contents of the cabin looked as if a maniac had been let loose there with a sledgehammer the bosun knew it was chief pattersons cabin the bosun said i dont much care for being in an engineroom sir but there are times when it has its advantages he looked at the empty and almost as badly damaged second engineers cabin opposite at least ralson is not here where is he sir hes dead hes dead the bosun repeated slowly when the bombs struck he was still in the seamens toilet fixing that shortcircuit im most damnably sorry sir he knew that ralson had been pattersons only close friend aboard the ship yes patterson said vaguely he had a young wife and two kids babies really the bosun shook his head and looked into the next cabin that belonging to the second officer at least mr rawlings is not here no hes not here hes up on the bridge the bosun looked at him then turned away and went into the captains cabin which was directly opposite and which oddly enough seemed almost undamaged the bosun went directly to a small wooden cupboard on the bulkhead produced his knife opened up the marlin spike and inserted its point just below the cupboard lock breaking and entering bosun the chief engineers voice held puzzlement but no reproof he knew mckinnon well enough to know that the bosun never did anything without a sound reason breaking and entering is for locked doors and windows sir just call this vandalism the door sprang open and the bosun reached inside bringing out two guns navy colt you know about guns sir ive never held a gun in my hand in my life you know about guns as well as rum i know about guns this little switch here you press it so then the safetycatch is off thats really all you require to know about guns he looked at the broken cupboard and then the guns and shook his head again i dont think captain bowen would have minded wont not wouldnt wont the bosun carefully laid the guns on the captains table youre telling me that the captain is not dead hes not dead neither is the chief officer the bosun smiled for the first time that morning then looked accusingly at the chief engineer you might have told me this sir i suppose i might have told you a dozen things you would agree bosun that we both have a great deal on our minds theyre both in the sick bay both pretty savagely burnt about the face but not in any danger not at least according to dr singh it was being far out on the port wing of the bridge that saved them they were away from the direct effects of the blast how come they got so badly burnt sir i dont know they can hardly speak their faces are completely wrapped in bandages they look more like egyptian mummies than anything else i asked the captain and he kept mumbling something like essex or wessex or something like that the bosun nodded wessex sir rockets distress flares two lots kept on the bridge the shock must have triggered some firing mechanism and it went off prematurely damnable ill luck damnably lucky if you ask me bosun compared to practically everybody else in the superstructure does he does he know yet it hardly seemed the time to tell him another thing he kept repeating as if it was urgent home signal home signal something like that over and over again maybe his mind was wandering maybe i couldnt make him out their mouths are the only part of their faces that arent covered with bandages but even their lips are pretty badly burnt and of course theyre loaded with morphine home signal mean anything to you at the moment no a young and rather diminutive stoker appeared in the doorway mccrimmon in his middle twenties was a less than lovable person his primary and permanent characteristics being the interminable mastication of chewing gum truculence a fixed scowl and a filthy tongue at that moment the first three were in abeyance bloody awful so it is down there just like a bloody cemetery morgue mccrimmon morgue patterson said what do you want me nothing sir jamieson sent me he said something about the phones no working and you would be wanting a runner maybe second engineer to you mccrimmon patterson looked at the bosun very thoughtful of the second engineer nothing we require in the engineroom except to get that jury rudder fixed deckside bosun two lookouts although god knows what theyll be looking out for two of your men sir the two ward orderlies below able seaman ferguson and curran curran is used to be a sailmaker dont envy him his job but ill give him a hand curran will know what to bring i suggest sir we have the crews messdeck cleared our mortuary yes sir you heard mccrimmon how many men eight sir eight two lookouts the two seamen to bring up the canvas and whatever required the other four to clear the crews mess dont you try to tell them theyd probably throw you overboard tell the second engineer and hell tell them when theyve finished have them report to me here or on the bridge you too off you go mccrimmon left the bosun indicated the two colts lying on the table i wonder what mccrimmon thought of those probably old hat to him jamieson picked the right man mccrimmons tough and hasnt much in the way of finer feelings irishscots from some glasgow slum been in prison in fact if it wasnt for the war thats probably where hed be now the bosun nodded and opened another small wall locker this one had a key to it it was a small liquor cupboard and from a padded velvet retainer mckinnon removed a rum bottle and laid it on the captains bunk i dont suppose the captain will mind that either patterson said for the stretcherbearers yes sir the bosun started opening drawers in the captains table and found what he was looking for in the third drawer two leatherbound folders which he handed to patterson prayer book and burial service sir but i should think the burial service would be enough somebodys got to read it good god im not a preacher bosun no sir but youre the officer commanding good god patterson repeated he placed the folders reverently on the captains table ill look at those later home signal the bosun said slowly thats what the captain said wasnt it home signal yes homing signal is what he was trying to say homing signal should have thought of it before but i suppose thats why captain bowen is a captain and im not how do you think the condor managed to locate us in the darkness all right it was half dawn when he attacked but he must have been on the course when it was still night how did he know where we were uboat no uboat the andovers sonar would have picked him up the bosun was repeating the words that captain bowen had used ah patterson nodded homing signal our saboteur friend flannelfoot as mr jamieson calls him not only was he busy fiddling around with our electrical circuits he was transmitting a continuous signal a directional signal the condor knew where we were to the inch i dont know whether the condor was equipped to receive such signals i know nothing about planes but it wouldnt have mattered some place like alta fjord could have picked up the signal and transmitted our bearing to the condor you have it of course bosun you have it to rights patterson looked at the two guns one for me and one for you if you say so sir dont be daft who else would have it patterson picked up a gun ive never even held one of these things in my hand far less fired one but you know bosun i dont really think i would mind firing a shot once just one neither would i sir second officer rawlings was lying beside the wheel and there was no mystery as to how he had died what must have been a flying shard of metal had all but decapitated him wheres the helmsman the bosun asked was he a survivor then i dont know i dont know who was on maybe rawlings had sent him to get something but there were two survivors up here apart from the captain and chief officer mcguigan and jones mcguigan and jones what were they doing up here it seems mr kennet had called them up and posted them as lookouts one on either wing i suppose thats why they survived just as captain bowen and mr kennel survived theyre in the hospital too badly hurt unharmed i believe shock thats all the bosun moved out to the port wing and patterson followed the wing was wholly undamaged no signs of metal buckling anywhere the bosun indicated a once grey but now badly scorched metal box which was attached just below the windbreaker its top and one side had been blown off thats where they kept the wessex rockets the bosun said they went back inside and the bosun moved towards the wireless office hatchway the sliding wooden door was no longer there i wouldnt look if i were you patterson said the men have got to havent they chief radio officer spenser was lying on the deck but he was no longer recognizable as such he was just an amorphous mass of bone and flesh and torn bloodsaturated clothing had it not been for the clothing it could have been the shattered remnants of any animal lying there when mckinnon looked away patterson could see that some colour had drained from the deeplytanned face the first bomb must have gone off directly beneath him the bosun said god ive never seen anything like it ill attend to him myself third officer batesman i know he was the officer of the watch any idea where he is sir in the chart room i dont advise you to go there either batesman was recognizable but only just he was still on his chair halfleaning halflying on the table what was left of his head pillowed on a bloodstained chart mckinnon returned to the bridge i dont suppose it will be any comfort to their relatives to know that they died without knowing ill fix him up myself too i couldnt ask the men he looked ahead through the totally shattered windscreens at least he thought they wouldnt be needing a kent clearview screen any more winds backing to the east he said absently bound to bring more snow at least it might help to hide us from the wolves if there are any wolves around you think perhaps they might come back to finish us off the chief was shivering violently but that was only because he was accustomed to the warmth of the engineroom the temperature on the bridge was about єf twentysix degrees of frost and the wind held steady at twenty knots who can be sure sir but i really dont think so even one of those heinkel torpedobombers could have finished us off if they had had a mind to come to that the condor could have done the same thing it did pretty well as it was if you ask me not nearly as well as it could have done i know that a condor normally carries kilo bombs thats about ibs a stick of those bombs say three or four would have sent us to the bottom even two might have been enough theyd have certainly blown the superstructure out of existence not just crippled it the royal navy again is that it bosun i know explosives sir those bombs couldnt have been any more than fifty kilos each dont you think sir that we might have some interesting questions to ask that condor captain when he regains consciousness in the hope of getting some interesting answers is that it including the answer to the question why he bombed a hospital ship in the first place well yes perhaps what do you mean perhaps theres just a chance a faint one i admit that he didnt know he was bombing a hospital ship dont be ridiculous bosun of course he knew he was attacking a hospital ship how big does a red cross have to be before you see it im not trying to make any excuses for him sir there was a touch of asperity in mckinnons voice and patterson frowned not at the bosun but because it was most unlike the bosun to adopt such a tone without reason it was still only halfdawn sir looking down things look much darker than they do at sea level youve only got to go up to a crows nest to appreciate that as patterson had never been in a crows nest in his life he probably fell illequipped to comment on the bosuns observation as he was approaching from dead astern he couldnt possibly have seen the markings on the ships sides and as he was flying very low he couldnt have seen the red cross on the foredeck the superstructure would have blocked off his view that still leaves the red cross on the afterdeck even though it might have been only half light he must have seen that not with the amount of smoke you were putting up under full power theres that there is a possibility he was unconvinced and watched with some impatience as the bosun spun the now useless wheel and examined the binnacle compass and the standby compass now smashed beyond any hope of repair do we have to remain up here patterson said theres nothing we can do here at the moment and im freezing to death i suggest the captains cabin i was about to suggest the same sir the temperature in the cabin was no more than freezing point but that was considerably warmer than it had been on the bridge and more importantly there was no wind there patterson went straight to the liquor cabinet and extracted a bottle of scotch if you can do it i can do it well explain to the captain later i dont really like rum and i need it a specific against pneumonia something like that you will join me yes sir the cold doesnt worry me but i think im going to need it in the next hour or so do you think the steering can be fixed sir its possible have to be a jury job ill get jamieson on to it its not terribly important i know all the phones are out but it shouldnt take too long to reconnect them and youre fixing up a temporary rudder control in the engineroom same with the electrics it wont take long to run a few rubber cables here and there but we cant start on any of those things until we get this area well cleared patterson lowered the contents of his glass by half you cant run the san andreas from the bridge two minutes up there was enough for me fifteen minutes and anyone would be frozen to death you cant run it from any other place cold is the problem i agree so well board it up plenty of plywood in the carpenters shop you cant see through plywood could always pop our heads through the wing doors from time to time but that wont be necessary well let some windows into the plywood fine fine patterson said the scotch had apparently restored his circulation all we need is a glazier and some windows and we havent got either aglazier we dont need we dont need to have cut glass or fitted windows you must have rolls and rolls of insulating tape in your electrical department ive got a hundred miles of it and i still dont have any windows windows we wont need glass thats all i know where the best glass is and plate glass at that the tops of all those lovely trolleys and trays in the hospital ah i do believe you have it bosun yes sir i suppose sister morrison will let you have them patterson smiled one of his rare smiles i believe im the officer commanding however temporary indeed sir just dont let me be around when you put her into irons those are all small things there are three matters that give a bit more concern first the radio is just a heap of scrap metal we cant contact anyone and no one can contact us secondly the compasses are useless i know you had a gyro installed but it never worked did it but worst of all is the problem of navigation navigation navigation how can that be a problem if you want to get from a to b its the biggest problem of all we have we had four navigating officers aboard this ship two of those are dead and the other two are swathed in bandages in your own words like egyptian mummies commander warrington could have navigated i know but hes blind and from the look in dr singhs eyes i should think the blindness is permanent the bosun paused for a moment then shook his head and just to make our cup overflowing sir we have the andovers navigating officer aboard and hes either concussed or in some sort of coma well have to ask dr singh if a pokerplayer got dealt this kind of hand of cards hed shoot himself four navigating officers who cant see and if you cant see you cant navigate thats why the loss of the radio is so damned unfortunate there must be a british warship within a hundred or two miles which could have lent us a navigating officer can you navigate sir me navigate patterson seemed positively affronted im an engineer officer but you mckinnon youre a seaman and twelve years in the royal navy it doesnt matter if i had been a hundred years in the royal navy sir i still cant navigate i was a torpedo petty officer if you want to fire a torpedo drop a depth charge blow up a mine or do some elementary electrics im your man but id barely recognize a sextant if i saw one such things as sunsights moonsights if there is such a thing and starsights are just words to me ive also heard of words like deviation and variation and declination and i know more about greek than i do about those we do have a little handheld compass aboard the motor lifeboat the one i took out today but thats useless its a magnetic compass of course and thats useless because i do know the magnetic north pole is nowhere near the geographical north pole i believe its about a thousand miles away from it canada baffin island or some such place anyway in the latitudes were in now the magnetic pole is more west than north the bosun sipped some scotch and looked at patterson over the rim of his glass chief patterson were lost jobs comforter patterson stared moodily at his glass then said without much hope wouldnt it be possible to get the sun at noon that way wed know where the south was the way the weather is shaping up we wont be able to see the sun at noon anyway whats noon suntime its certainly not twelve oclock on our watches supposing we were in the middle of the atlantic where we might as well be and knew where south was would that help us find aberdeen which is where i believe we are going the chronometer incidentally is kaput which doesnt matter at all i still wouldnt be able to relate the chronometer to longitude and even if we did get a bearing on due south its dark up here twenty hours out of the twentyfour and the autopilot is as wrecked as everything else on the bridge we wouldnt of course be going around in circles the hand compass would stop us from doing that but we still wouldnt know in what direction we were heading if i want to find some optimism bosun ill know where not to look would it help at all if we knew approximately where we were it would help but all we know approximately is that were somewhere north or northwest of norway anywhere say in twenty thousand square miles of sea there are only two possibilities sir the captain and chief officer must have known where we were if theyre able to tell us im sure they will good god of course not very bright are we at least im not what do you mean if captain bowen was able to talk about twenty minutes ago that was twenty minutes ago you know how painful burns can be dr singh is sure to have given them painkillers and sometimes the only way they can work is by knocking you out and the other possibility the chart house mr batesman was working on a chart he still had a pencil in his hand ill go patterson grimaced sooner you than me dont forget flannelfoot sir patterson touched his overalls where he had concealed his gun or the burial service patterson looked at the leathercovered folder in distaste and where am i supposed to leave that on the operating table there are four empty cabins in the hospital sir for recuperating vips we dont have any at the moment ah ten minutes then the bosun was back in five minutes the chief engineer in fifteen an air of almost palpable gloom hung over patterson no luck sir no dammit you guessed right theyre under heavy sedation may be hours before they come to and if they do start coming to dr singh says hes going to sedate them again apparently they were trying to tear the bandages off their faces hes got their hands swathed in bandages even an unconscious man the doctor says will try to scratch away at whatever irritates him anyway their hands were burnt not badly but enough to justify the bandages theyve got straps for tying wrists to the bedframes dr singh did mention that he said he didnt think captain bowen would take too kindly to waking up and finding himself virtually in irons on his own ship by the way the missing helmsman was hudson broken ribs and one pierced his lung doctor says hes very ill what luck did you have same as you sir zero there was a pair of parallel rules lying beside mr batesman so i assume he must have been pencilling out a course you couldnt gather anything from the chart it wasnt a chart any more it was just a bloodstained rag three it was snowing heavily and a bitter wind blew from the east as they buried their dead in the nearstygian darkness of the early afternoon a form of illumination they did have for the saboteur probably more than satisfied with the results of his mornings activities was now resting on his laurels and the deck floodlights were working again but in that swirling blizzard the light given off was weak fitful and almost ineffectual serving only to intensify the ghoulish effect of the burial party hastening about their macabre task and the ghostlike appearance of the bare dozen of snowcovered mourners flashlight in hand chief engineer patterson read out the burial service but he might as well have been quoting the latest prices on the stock exchange for not a word could be heard one by one the dead in their weighted canvas shrouds slipped down the tilted plank out from under the union flag and vanished silently into the freezing water of the barents sea no bugle calls no last post for the merchant navy not ever the only requiem was the lost and lonely keening of the wind through the frozen rigging and the jagged gaps that had been torn in the superstructure shivering violently and mottled blue and white with the cold the burial party and mourners returned to the only reasonably warm congregating space left on the san andreas the dining and recreational area in the hospital between the wards and the cabins we owe you a very great debt mr mckinnon dr singh said he had been one of the mourners and his teeth were still chattering very swift very efficient it must have been a gruesome task i had six willing pairs of hands the bosun said it was worse for them than it was for me the bosun did not have to explain what he meant everybody knew that anything would always be worse for anybody than for that virtually indestructible shetlander he looked at patterson i have a suggestion sir a royal naval one no sir deepsea fishermans anyway its close enough these are the waters of the arctic trawlers a toast to the departed i endorse that and not for traditional or sentimental reasons dr singhs teeth still sounded like castanets medicinal i dont know about the rest of you but my red corpuscles are in need of some assistance the bosun looked at patterson who nodded his approval mckinnon turned and looked at an undersized frecklefaced youth who was hovering at a respectful distance wayland wayland came hurrying forward yes mr mckinnon sir go with mario to the liquor store bring back some refreshments yes mr mckinnon sir right away mr mckinnon sir the bosun had long given up trying to get wayland day to address him in any other fashion dr singh said that wont be necessary mr mckinnon we have supplies here medicinal of course of course dr singh watched as wayland went into the galley how old is that boy he claims to be seventeen or eighteen says hes not sure which in either case hes fibbing i dont believe hes ever seen a razor hes supposed to be working for you isnt he pantry boy i understand he spends nearly all his day here i dont mind doctor if you dont no not at all hes an eager lad willing and helpful hes all yours besides we havent a pantry left hes making eyes at one of the nurses you underestimate the boy sister morrison no less at a worshipful distance of course good god the bosun said mario entered bearing onehanded and a few inches above his head a rather splendid silver salver laden with bottles and glasses which in the circumstances was no mean feat as the san andreas was rolling quite noticeably with a deft twirling movement mario had the tray on the table without so much as the clink of glass against glass where the salver had come from was unexplained and marios business as became the popular conception of an italian mario was darkly and magnificently mustachioed but whether he possessed the traditional flashing eyes was impossible to say as he invariably wore dark glasses there were those who purported to see in those glasses a connection with the sicilian mafia an assertion that was always goodhumouredly made as he was wellliked mario was overweight of indeterminate age and claimed to have served in the savoy grill which may have been true what was beyond dispute was that there lay behind mario a man whose rightful home captain bowen considered to be either a prisonerofwar or internment camp a more than usually chequered career after no more than two fingers of scotch but evidently considering that his red corpuscles were back on the job dr singh said and now mr patterson lunch doctor a very belated lunch but starving ourselves isnt going to help anyone im afraid it will have to be cooked in your galley and served here already under way and then and then we get under way he looked at the bosun we could temporarily have the lifeboats compass in the engineroom we already have rudder control there it wouldnt work sir theres so much metal in your engineroom that any magnetic compass would have fits he pushed back his chair and rose i think ill pass up lunch i think you will agree mr patterson that a telephone line from the bridge to the engineroom and electric power on the bridge so that we can see what we are doing are the two first priorities jamieson said thats already being attended to bosun thank you sir but the lunch can still wait he was speaking now to patterson board up the bridge and let some light in after that sir we might try to clear up some of the cabins in the superstructure find out which of them is habitable and try to get power and heating back on a little heating on the bridge wouldnt come amiss either leave all that other stuff to the engineroom staff after weve had a bite that is youll be requiring some assistance ferguson and curran will be enough well that leaves only one thing patterson regarded the deckhead the plate glass for your bridge windows indeed sir i thought you a trifle patterson waved a hand to indicate how much of a trifle it was you have only to ask bosun but i thought you perhaps i was mistaken we have a problem dr singh said i wanted some plate glass from the trolleys or trays in the wards perhaps dr singh you would care oh no dr singhs reply was as quick as it was decisive dr sinclair and i run the operating theatre and look after our surgical patients but the running of the wards has nothing to do with us isnt that so doctor indeed it is sir dr sinclair also knew how to sound decisive the bosun surveyed the two doctors and patterson with an impassive face that was much more expressive than any expression could have been and passed through the doorway into ward b there were ten patients in this ward and two nurses one very much a brunette the other very much a blonde the brunette nurse irene was barely in her twenties hailed from northern ireland was pretty darkeyed and of such a warm and happy disposition that no one would have dreamed of calling her by her surname which no one seemed to know anyway she looked up as the bosun entered and for the first time since shed joined she failed to give him a welcoming smile he patted her shoulder gently and walked to the other end of the ward where nurse magnusson was rebandaging a seamans arm janet magnusson was a few years older than irene and taller but not much she had a more than faintly windswept viking look about her and was unquestionably goodlooking she shared the bosuns flaxen hair and bluegrey eyes but not fortunately his burntbrick complexion like the younger nurse she was much given to smiling like her the smile was in temporary abeyance she straightened as the bosun approached reached out and touched his arm it was terrible wasnt it archie not a thing i would care to do again im glad you werent there janet i didnt mean that the burial i mean it was you who sewed up the worst of them they say that the radio officer was well all bits and pieces an exaggeration who told you that johnny holbrook you know the young orderly the one thats scared of you theres nobody scared of me the bosun said absently he looked around the ward been quite some changes here we had to turf some of the socalled recuperating patients out youd have thought they were being sent to their deaths siberia at least nothing the matter with them not malingerers really they just liked soft beds and being spoiled and who was spoiling them if not you and irene they just couldnt bear to be parted from you wheres the lioness janet gave him a disapproving look are you referring to sister morrison thats the lioness i mean i have to beard her in her den you dont know her archie shes very nice really maggies my friend truly maggie when were off duty always shes in the next ward maggie good lord i thought she disapproved of you because she disapproves of me because she disapproves of me talking to you fiddlesticks and archie yes a lioness doesnt have a beard the bosun didnt deign to answer he moved into the adjacent ward sister morrison wasnt there of the eight patients only two mcguigan and jones were visibly conscious the bosun approached their adjacent beds and said hows it going boys ach were fine bosun mcguigan said we shouldnt be here at all youll stay here until youre told to leave eighteen years old he was wondering how long it would take them to recover from the sight of the almost decapitated rawlings lying by the wheel when sister morrison entered by the far door good afternoon sister morrison good afternoon mr mckinnon making your medical rounds i see the bosun felt the stirrings of anger but contented himself with looking thoughtful he was probably unaware that his thoughtful expression in certain circumstances could have a disquieting effect on people i just came to have a word with you sister he looked around the ward not a very lively bunch are they i hardly think this is the time or place for levity mr mckinnon the lips were not as compressed as they might have been but there was an appreciable lack of warmth behind the steelrimmed spectacles the bosun looked at her for long seconds during which time she began to show distinct signs of uneasiness like most people with the exception of the timorous johnny holbrook she regarded the bosun as being cheerful and easygoing with the rider in her case that he was probably a bit simple it required only one glance at that cold hard bleak face to realize how totally wrong she had been it was an unsettling experience the bosun spoke in a slow voice i am not in the mood for levity sister ive just buried fifteen men before i buried them i had to sew them up in their sheets of canvas before i did that i had to gather up their bits and pieces and stick their guts back inside then i sewed them up then i buried them i didnt see you among the mourners sister the bosun was more than aware that he shouldnt have spoken to her like that and he was also aware that what he had gone through had affected him more than he had thought under normal circumstances it was impossible that he should have been so easily provoked but the circumstances were abnormal and the provocation too great ive come for some plate glass such as you have on the tops of your trolleys and trays i need them urgently and i dont need them for any lighthearted purposes or do you require an explanation she didnt say whether she required an explanation or not she didnt do anything dramatic like sinking into a chair reaching out for the nearest support or even putting a hand to her mouth only her colour changed sister morrison had the kind of complexion that like her eyes and lips was in marked contrast to her habitually severe expression and steelrimmed glasses the kind of complexion that would have had the cosmetic tycoons sending their scientists back to the bench at that moment however the peaches had faded from the traditional if rarely seen peaches and cream of the traditional if equally rarely seen english rose the bosun removed the glass top from a table by joness bedside looked around for trays saw none nodded to sister morrison and went back to ward b janet magnusson looked at him in surprise is that what you went for the bosun nodded maggie sister morrison had no objection nary an objection have you any glasstopped trays chief patterson and the others had already begun lunch when the bosun returned five sheets of plate glass under his arm patterson looked faintly surprised no trouble then bosun one only has to ask ill need some tools for the bridge fixed jamieson said ive just been to the engineroom theres a box gone up to the bridge all the tools youll require nuts bolts screws insulating tape a power drill and a power saw ah thank you but ill need power power you have only a temporary cable mind you but the power is there and lights of course the phone will take some time thats fine thank you mr jamieson he looked at patterson one other thing sir we have a fair number of nationalities in our crew the captain of the greek tanker andropolous isnt it might have a mixed crew too i should think theres a fair chance sir that one of our men and one of the greek crew might have a common language perhaps you could make enquiries sir and how would that help bosun captain andropolous can navigate of course of course always the navigation isnt it bosun theres nothing without it sir do you think you could get hold of naseby and trent theyre the two men who were with me here when we were attacked weathersworsening sir and we have ice forming on the deck would you have them rig up lifelines between here and the superstructure worsening dr singh said how much worse mr mckinnon quite a bit im afraid bridge barometer is smashed but i think the one in the captains cabin is intact ill check he brought out the hand compass which hed removed from the lifeboat this things virtually useless but at least it does show changes in direction were wallowing in the troughs port side to so that means the wind and the sea are coming at us on the port beam wind direction is changing rapidly weve backed at least five degrees since we came down here winds roughly northeast if experience is any guide that means heavy snow heavy seas and a steadily dropping temperature no slightest light in the gloom is that it mr mckinnon dr singh said where every prospect pleases and only man is vile except this is the other way round a tiny speck of light doctor if the temperature keeps falling like this the cold room is going to stay cold and the frozen meat and fish should stay that way and we do have a vile man or men aboard or we shouldnt be in the state we are youre worried about your patients arent you doctor especially the ones in ward a telepathy mr mckinnon if conditions deteriorate much more theyre going to start falling out of their beds and the last thing i want to do is to start strapping wounded men to their beds and the last thing i want is for the superstructure to topple over the side jamieson had pushed back his chair and was on his feet i have my priorities right no bosun indeed mr jamieson thank you very much dr singh halfsmiled not more telepathy the bosun smiled back dr singh appeared to be very much the right man in the right place i think hes gone to have a word with the men rigging up the telephone line from the bridge to the engineroom and then i press the button patterson said yes sir and then southwest i dont have to tell you why you might tell a landlubber why dr singh said of course two things heading southwest will mean that the wind and the seas from the northeast are dead astern that should eliminate all rolling so that you dont have to put your patients in straitjackets or whatever therell be some pitching of course but not much and even then mr patterson can smooth that out by adjusting the ships speed to the wave speed the other big advantage is that by heading southwest theres no land we can bump into for hundreds of miles to come if you will excuse me gentlemen the bosun left together with his sheets of plate glass and hand compass doesnt miss much does he dr singh said competent you would say mr patterson competent hes more than that certainly the best bosun ive ever sailed with and ive never known a bad bosun yet if we ever get to aberdeen and with mckinnon around i rate our chances better than even i wont be the man youll have to thank the bosun arrived on the bridge a bridge now overilluminated with two garish arc lamps to find ferguson and curran already there with enough plywood of various shapes and sizes to build a modest hut neither of the two men could be said to be able to walk not in the proper sense of the term muffled to the ears and with balaclavas and hoods pulled low over their foreheads they were so swaddled in layers of jerseys trousers and coats that they were barely able to waddle given a couple of white fur coats they would have resembled nothing so much as a pair of polar bears that had given up on their diet years ago as it was they were practically white already the snow driving almost horizontally swept without let or hindrance through the yawning gaps where the port forard screens and the upper wing door screen had once been conditions werent improved by the fact that at a height of some forty feet above the hospital the effects of the rolling were markedly worse than they had been down below so bad in fact that it was very difficult to keep ones footing and that only by hanging on to something the bosun carefully laid the plate glass in a corner and wedged it so that it wouldnt slide all over the deck the rolling didnt bother him but the creaking and groaning of the superstructure supports and the occasional juddering vibration that shook the bridge bothered him a very great deal curran quickly chief engineer patterson youll find him in the hospital tell him to start up and turn the ship either into the wind or away from the wind away is better that means hard astarboard tell him the superstructure is going to fall over the side any minute for a man usually slow to obey any order and handicapped though he was by his constricted lower limbs curran made off with remarkable alacrity it could have been that he was a good man in an emergency but more likely he didnt fancy being on the bridge when it vanished into the barents sea ferguson eased two layers of scarf from his mouth difficult working conditions bosun impossible a man might say and have you seen the temperature the bosun glanced at the bulkhead thermometer which was about the only thing still working on the bridge two above he said ah two above but two above what fahrenheit thats what its above that means thirty degrees of frost he looked at the bosun in what he probably regarded as a meaningful fashion have you ever heard of the chill factor eh the bosun spoke with commendable restraint yes ferguson i have heard of the chill factor for every knot of wind the temperature as far as the skin is concerned falls by one degree ferguson had something on his mind and as far as he was concerned the bosun had never heard of the chill factor winds at least thirty knots that means its sixty below on this bridge sixty at that moment at the end of an especially alarming roll the superstructure gave a very loud creak indeed more of a screech than a creak and it didnt require any kind of imagination to visualize metal tearing under lateral stress if you want to leave the bridge the bosun said im not ordering you to stay trying to shame me into staying eh trying to appeal to my better nature well i got news for you i aint got no better feelings mate the bosun said mildly nobody aboard this ship calls me mate bosun ferguson made no move to carry out his implied threat and he wasnt even showing any signs of irresolution do i get danger money for this overtime perhaps a couple of tots of captain bowens special malt scotch lets spend our last moments usefully ferguson well start with some measuring already done ferguson showed the springloaded steel measuring tape in his hand and tried hard not to smile in smug selfsatisfaction me and curran have already measured the front and side screens written down on that bit of plywood there fine fine the bosun tested both the electric drill and electric saw both worked no problem well cut the plywood three inches wider and higher than your measurements to get the overlap we need then well drill holes top bottom and sides threequarters of an inch in face the plywood up to the screen bearers mark the metal and drill the holes through the steel that steel is threeeighths of an inch take to next week to drill all those holes the bosun looked through the tool box and came up with three packets of drills the first he discarded the drills in the second all with blue tips he showed to ferguson tungsten goes through steel like butter mr jamieson doesnt miss much he paused and cocked his head as if listening though it was a purely automatic reaction any sound from the after end of the ship was carried away by the wind but there was no mistaking the throbbing that pulsed through the superstructure he looked at ferguson whose face cracked into what might almost have been a smile the bosun moved to the starboard wing door the sheltered side of the ship and peered through the gap where the screen had been in the upper half of the door the snow was so heavy that the seas moving away from the san andreas were as much imagined as seen the ship was still rolling in the troughs a vessel of any size that has been lying dead in the water can take an unconscionable time depending of course on the circumstances to gather enough momentum to have steerage way on but after about another minute the bosun became aware that the ship was sluggishly answering to the helm he couldnt see this but he could feel it a definite quartering motion had entered into the rolling to which they had been accustomed for some hours mckinnon moved away from the wing door were turning to starboard mr patterson has decided to go with the wind well soon have both sea and snow behind us fine fine fine fine ferguson said this was about twenty seconds later and the tone of his voice indicated that everything was all but fine he was indeed acutely uneasy and with reason the san andreas was heading almost due south the heavy seas bearing down on her port quarter were making her corkscrew violently and the markedly increased creaking and groaning of the superstructure was doing little enough for his morale gods sake why couldnt we have stayed where we were a minutes time and youll see why and in a minutes time he did see why the corkscrewing and rolling gradually eased and ceased altogether so did the creaking in the superstructure and the san andreas on an approximately southwest course was almost rocksteady in the water there was a slight pitching but compared to what they had just experienced it was so negligible as not to be worth the mentioning ferguson with a stable deck beneath his feet the fear of imminent drowning removed and the snowstorm so squarely behind them that not a flake reached the bridge had about him an air of profound relief shortly after the bosun and ferguson had started sawing out the rectangles of plywood four men arrived on the bridge jamieson curran mccrimmon and another stoker called stephen stephen was a pole and was called always by his first name nobody had ever been heard to attempt the surname of przynyszewski jamieson carried a telephone curran two black heaters mccrimmon two radiant heaters and stephen two spools of rubberinsulated cable one thick one thin both of which he unreeled as he went well this is more like it bosun jamieson said a millpond one might almost call it done a power of good for the morale down below some people have even rediscovered their appetites speaking of appetites hows yours you must be the only person aboard who hasnt had lunch today itll keep the bosun looked to where mccrimmon and stephen were already attaching wires from the heaters to the heavy cable thanks for those theyll come in handy in an hour or two when weve managed to keep all this fresh air out more than handy i should have thought jamieson shivered my word it is fresh up here whats the temperature the bosun looked at the thermometer zero thats two degrees its dropped in a few minutes im afraid mr jamieson that were going to be very cold tonight not in the engineroom jamieson said he unscrewed the back of the telephone and started connecting it to the slender cable mr patterson thinks this is an unnecessary luxury and that you just want it so that you can talk to someone when you feel lonely says that keeping the stern on to wind and seas is childs play and that he could do it for hours without deviating more than two or three degrees off course ive no doubt he could that way well never see aberdeen you can tell mr patterson that the wind is backing and that if it backs far enough and he still keeps stern on to the wind and sea well end up by making a small hole in the north of norway and a large hole in ourselves jamieson smiled ill explain that to the chief i dont think the possibility has occurred to him it certainly didnt to me and when you go below sir would you send up naseby hes an experienced helmsman ill do that need any more help up here no sir the three of us are enough as you say jamieson screwed the back of the telephone in place pressed the callup button spoke briefly and hung up satisfaction guaranteed are you through mccrimmon stephen both men nodded and jamieson called the engineroom again asked for power to be switched on and told mccrimmon and stephen to switch on one heater apiece one black one radiant still require mccrimmon as a runner bosun the bosun nodded towards the telephone thanks to you ive got my runner one of mccrimmons radiant heaters had started to glow a dim red stephen removed a hand from the black heater and nodded fine switch off it would seem bosun that flannelfoot has knocked off for the day well go below now see what cabins we can make habitable im afraid there wont be many the only way we can make a cabin habitable the clearing up wont take long ive already got a couple of our boys working on that is to replace defective heating systems thats all that matters unfortunately most of the doors have been blasted off their hinges or cut away by the oxyacetylene torches and theres no point in replacing heating if we cant replace the doors well do what we can he spun the useless wheel when weve finished below and youve finished here and when the temperature is appropriate for myself and other hothouse plants from the engineroom well come and have a go at this steering big job sir depends upon what damage in the decks below dont hold me to it bosun but theres a fair chance that well have it operational in what youll no doubt regard as our customary crude fashion some time this evening to give me some leeway i wont specify what time the temperature on the bridge continued to drop steadily and because numbing cold slows up a man both physically and mentally it took mckinnon and his two men well over two hours to complete their task had the temperature been anything like normal they could probably have done it in less than half the time about threequarters of the way through the repairs they had switched on all four heaters and the temperature had begun to rise albeit very slowly mckinnon was well enough satisfied with their end product five sheets of hardboard had been bolted into position each panel fitted with an inlet oblong of plate glass one large the other four identical in shape about half the size the large one was fitted in the centre directly ahead of where the helmsman normally stood two of the others were fitted on either side of this and the remaining two on the upper sections of the wing doors the inevitable gaps between the glass and the plywood and between the plywood and the metal to which they had been bonded had been sealed off with hartleys compound a yellow plastic material normally used for waterproofing external electrical fittings the bridgewas as draughtproof as it was possible to make it ferguson put away the last of the tools and coughed there was some mention of a couple of tots of captain bowens special malt mckinnon looked at him and at curran their faces were mottled blue and white with cold and both men were shivering violently chronic complainers neither had complained once youve earned it he turned to naseby hows she bearing naseby looked at his handheld compass in distaste if you can trust this thing twotwenty give or take so the winds backed five degrees in the past couple of hours we dont bother the engineroom for five degrees george naseby a solid taciturn darkhaired and swarthy yorkshireman he hailed from whitby captain cooks home town was mckinnons alter ego and closest friend a bosun himself on his two previous ships he had elected to sail on the san andreas simply because of the mutual regard that he and mckinnon shared although he held no official ranking he was regarded by everyone from the captain down as the number two on the deckside we dont bother them another five perhaps ten degrees off then we bother them lets go below ship can look after itself for a few minutes then ill have trent relieve you the level of scotch in the captains bottle of malt had fallen quite rapidly ferguson and curran had their own ideas as to what constituted a reasonably sized tot mckinnon in between rather more frugal sips examined the captains sextant thermometer and barometer the sextant as far as the bosun could tell was undamaged the felt lining of its wooden box would have cushioned it from the effects of the blast the thermometer too appeared to be working the mercury registered єf which was about what mckinnon reckoned the cabin temperature to be the captains cabin was one of the few with its door still intact and jamieson had already had a black heater installed he gave the thermometer to naseby asking that it be placed on one of the bridge wings then turned his attention to the barometer this was functioning normally for when he tapped the glass the black needle fell sharply to the left twentynine point five the bosun said nine nine nine millibars and falling v not good eh ferguson said no not that we need a barometer to tell us that mckinnon left and went down from deck to the officers quarters he found jamieson at the end of the passageway hows it coming sir were about through should be five cabins fit for human habitation depending of course upon what your definition of human is the bosun tapped the bulkhead beside him how stable do you reckon this structure is sir highly unstable safe enough in those conditions but i gather you think those conditions are about to change if the wind keeps backing and we keep holding to this course then were going to have the seas on the starboard quarter and a lot of nasty corkscrewing i was thinking perhaps i know what you were thinking im a ships engineer bosun not a constructive engineer ill have a look maybe we can bolt or weld a few strengthening steel plates at the weakest points i dont know theres no guarantee first of ail well go have a look at the steering on the bridge how are things up top draughtfree four heaters ideal working conditions temperature fifteen i above freezing or below below ideal thank you very much mckinnon found four people in the staff dining area chief engineer patterson dr singh and nurses janet magnusson and irene the nurses were offduty the san andreas as did all hospital ships carried an alternate nursing staff the bosun went to the galley asked for coffee and sandwiches sat at the table and made his report to the chief engineer when he was finished he said and how did you get on sir finding a translator i mean patterson scowled with our luck well i didnt really have any hope sir not as you say with our luck he looked at janet magnusson where s sister morrison in the lounge neither her voice nor her eyes held much in the way of warmth shes upset you upset her she upset me he made an impatient dismissive gesture with his hand tantrums this is neither the time nor the place if ever there is a time and a place oh come now dr singh was smiling i dont think either of you is being quite fair sister morrison is not as you suggest mr mckinnon sulking in her tent and nurse if shes feeling rather unhappy its not primarily the bosuns fault she and mr ulbricht are not quite seeing eye to eye ulbricht the bosun said flightlieutenant karl ulbricht i understand the captain of the condor hes conscious very much so not only conscious but wanting out of bed quite remarkable powers of recuperation three bullet wounds all flesh all superficial bled a great deal mind you but hes had a transfusion one hopes that the best british blood goes well with his own native aryan stock anyway sister morrison was with me when he came to she called him a filthy nazi murderer hardly makes for the ideal nursepatient relationship not very tactful i agree patterson said a wounded man recovering consciousness might expect to be entitled to a little more sympathy how did he react very calmly mild you might say said he wasnt a nazi and had never murdered anyone in his life she just stood and glared at him if you can imagine sister morrison glaring at anybody and i can imagine it very easily the bosun said with some feeling she glares at me frequently perhaps nurse magnusson said you and lieutenant ulbricht have a lot in common please dr singh held up a hand lieutenant ulbricht expressed deep regrets said something about the fortunes of war but didnt exactly call for sackcloth and ashes i stopped it there it didnt look like being a very profitable discussion dont be too hard on the sister bosun shes no battleaxe far less a termagant she feels deeply and has her own way of expressing her feelings mckinnon made to reply caught janets still far from friendly eye and changed his mind how are your other patients doctor the other aircrew member a gunner it seems by the name of helmut winterman is okay just a scared kid who expects to be shot at dawn commander warrington as you guessed mr mckinnon is badly hurt how badly i dont know his occiput is fractured but only surgery can tell us how serious it is im a surgeon but not a brain surgeon well have to wait until we get to a mainland hospital to ease the pressure on the sight centre and find out when if ever hell see again the andovers navigator lieutenant cunningham dr singh shook his head im sorry in more ways than one im afraid this may be your last hope gone that the young man wont be doing any more navigating for some time to come hes in a coma xray shows a fracture of the skull and not a hairline fracture either pulse respiration temperature show no sign of organic damage hell live any idea when he might come to doctor dr singh sighed if i were a firstyear intern id hazard a fairly confident guess alas its twentyfive years since i was a firstyear intern two days two weeks two months i simply dont know as for the others the captain and chief officer are still under sedation and when they wake up im going to put them to sleep again hudson the one with the punctured lung seems to have stabilized at least the internal bleeding has stopped raffertys fractured tibia is no problem the two injured crewmen from the argos one with a broken pelvis the other with multiple burns are still in the recovery room not because theyre in any danger but because ward a was full and it was the best place to keep them and ive discharged two young seamen i dont know their names jones and mcguigan thats the two shock nothing more i understand theyre lucky to be alive were all lucky to be alive mckinnon nodded his thanks as mario put coffee and sandwiches before him then looked at patterson do you think it might help sir if we had a word with lieutenant ulbricht if youre halfway right on your way of thinking bosun it might be of some help at least it can be of no harm im afraid youll have to wait a bit dr singh said the lieutenant was getting a little bit too active or beginning to feel too active for his own good itll be an hour perhaps two a matter of urgency mr mckinnon it could be or a matter of some importance at least he might be able to tell us why were all so lucky as to be still alive and if we knew then we might have some idea or a guess at least as to what lies in store for us you think the enemy is not yet finished with us i should be surprised if they are doctor mckinnon alone now in the dining area had just finished his third cup of coffee when jamieson and three of his men entered to the accompaniment of much armflapping and teethchattering jamieson went to the galley ordered coffee for himself and his men and sat beside mckinnon ideal working conditions you said bosun snug as a bug in a rug one might say temperatures soaring its almost ten degrees up there minus sorry about that sir hows the steering fixed for the moment at least not too big a job quite a bit of play on the wheel but trent says its manageable fine thank you we have bridge control yes i told the engineroom to cease and desist chief patterson seemed quite disappointed seems to think that he can do a better job than the bridge whats next on the agenda nothing not for me that is ah i take your point our idle hands is that it well have a look at the chances of bracing the superstructure in a moment a moment depending on how long it takes us to get defrosted of course sir the bosun looked over his shoulder i have noticed that dr singh doesnt bother to keep the hospitals private liquor cabinet locked well now a little something in our coffee perhaps i would recommend it sir might help to speed up the defrosting process jamieson gave him an oldfashioned look rose and crossed towards the cabinet jamieson drained his second cup of reinforced coffee and looked at mckinnon something bothering you bosun yes mckinnon had both hands on the table as if preparing to rise motions changed a few minutes back the ship started quartering a little not too much as if trent was making a slight course adjustment but now shes quartering too damn much it could be that the steering has failed again mckinnon left at speed jamieson close behind him reaching the now smoothly icecoated deck mckinnon grabbed a lifeline and stopped corkscrewing he shouted he had to shout to make himself heard above the near galeforce wind twenty degrees off course maybe thirty something far wrong up there and indeed when they arrived on the bridge there was something far wrong both men paused momentarily and mckinnon said my apologies mr jamieson it wasnt the steering after all trent was lying face up just behind the wheel which was mindlessly jerking from side to side in response to the erratic seas striking against the rudder trent was breathing no doubt about that his chest rising and falling in a slow rhythmic fashion mckinnon bent over to examine his face looked more closely sniffed wrinkled his nose in distaste and straightened chloroform he reached out for the wheel and began to bring the san andreas back on course again and this jamieson stooped picked up the fallen compass and showed it to mckinnon the glass was smashed the needle irremediably twisted out of position flanneifoot strikes again so it would appear sir ah you dont seem particularly surprised bosun i saw it lying there i didnt have to look there are quite a few other helmsmen aboard that was our only compass four whoever was responsible for this must have had access to the dispensary patterson said he was with jamieson and mckinnon in the hospitals small lounge that wont help sir mckinnon said since ten oclock this morning everybody aboard this ship except of course the wounded the unconscious and those under sedation have had access to the dispensary theres not a single person who hasnt been in the hospital area either to eat sleep or just rest maybe were not looking at it in the right way jamieson said why should anyone want to smash the compass it cant just be to stop us from following whatever course we were following or that we might outrun someone the chances are high that flannelfoot is still transmitting his homing signal and that the germans know exactly where we are maybe hes hoping to panic us mckinnon said maybe hes hoping well slow down rather than travel around in circles which could easily happen if the weather deteriorates the sea becomes confused and if we have no compass perhaps theres a german submarine in the vicinity and he doesnt want us to get too far away theres an even worse possibility weve been assuming that flannelfoot has only a transmitter maybe he has a transceiver what if hes in radio contact with alta fjord or a uboat or even a reconnaissance condor there could be a british warship in the vicinity and the last thing they would want is that we make contact with it well we couldnt contact it but its radar could pick us up ten fifteen miles away too many ifs maybes and perhaps this and perhaps that pattersons voice was decisive that of a man who has made up his mind how many men do you trust aboard this ship bosun how many mckinnon broke off in speculation the three of us here and naseby and the medical staff not that i have any particular reason to trust them nor do i have any particular reason to distrust them but we know that they were here all present and accounted for when trent was attacked so that rules them out two doctors six nursing staff three orderlies and the four of us that makes fifteen jamieson said he smiled apart from that everyone is a suspect the bosun permitted himself a slight smile in return its difficult to see kids like jones mcguigan and wayland day as master spies those apart i wouldnt put my hand in the fire for any of them thats to say ive no reason to trust them in a matter of life and death patterson said the crew of the argos survivors guests by happenstance ridiculous i know sir but whos to say the nigger is not in the most unlikely woodpile i just dont trust anyone the bosun paused am i wrong in thinking that it is your intention to search through the quarters and possessions of everyone aboard you are not wrong bosun with respect sir well be wasting our time anyone as smart as flannelfoot is too smart to leave anything lying around or at least to leave it in any place where it might be remotely associated with him there are hundreds of places aboard where you can hide things and we are not trained rummagers on the other hand its better than doing nothing but im afraid thats what well find mr patterson nothing they found nothing they searched every living quarter every wardrobe and cupboard every case and duffel bag every nook and cranny and they found nothing a rather awkward moment had arisen when captain andropolous a burly darkbearded and seemingly intemperate character who had been given one of the empty cabins normally reserved for recuperating patients objected violently and physically to having his quarters searched mckinnon who had no greek resolved this impasse by pointing his colt at the captains temple after which probably realizing that mckinnon wasnt acting for his own amusement the captain had been cooperation itself even to going to the extent of accompanying the bosun and ordering his crew to open up their possessions for scrutiny the two singhalese cooks in the hospital galleys were more than competent and dr singh who appeared to be something of a connoisseur in such matters produced some bordeaux that would not have been found wanting in a michelin restaurant but poor justice was done to the food arid more surprisingly the wine at dinner that evening the atmosphere was sombre there was an uneasiness about even a faint air of furtiveness it is one thing to be told that there is a saboteur at large it is quite another to have your luggage and possessions searched on the basis of the possibility that you might be the saboteur in question even or perhaps especially the hospital staff seemed unduly uncomfortable their possessions had not been searched so they were not officially in the clear an irrational reaction it may have been but in the circumstances understandable patterson pushed back his unfinished plate and said to dr singh this lieutenant ulbricht is he awake hes more than awake dr singh sounded almost testy remarkable recuperative powers wanted to join us for dinner forbade it of course why the bosun and i would like to have a word with him no reason why not he pondered briefly two possible minor complications sister morrison is there shes just relieved sister maria for dinner he nodded towards the end of the table where a fairhaired highcheekboned girl in a sisters uniform was having dinner apart from stephen przybyszewski she was the only polish national aboard and as people found her surname of szarzynski like stephens rather difficult she was invariably and affectionately referred to as sister maria well survive patterson said the other complication captain bowen like lieutenant ulbricht he has a high tolerance to sedatives keeps surfacing longer and longer spells of consciousness and when he is awake hes in a very bad humour who has ever seen captain bowen in ill humour patterson rose if i were the captain i wouldnt be very much in the mood for singing and dancing come on bosun they found the captain awake very much so and indeed in a more than irritable frame of mind sister morrison was seated on a stool by his bedside she made to rise but patterson waved to her to remain where she was lieutenant ulbricht was halfsitting halflying in the next bed his right hand behind his neck lieutenant ulbricht was very wide awake how do you feel captain how do i feel chief briefly and forcefully bowen told him how he felt he would no doubt have expressed himself even more forcefully had he not been aware that sister morrison was sitting by his side he raised a bandaged hand to cover a cough alls gone to hell and breakfast isnt it chief well yes things could be better things couldnt be worse captain bowens words were blurred and indistinct speaking through those blistered lips had to be agonizing sister has told me even the boat compass smashed flannelfoot flannelfoot hes still around flannelfoot flannelfeet mckinnon said archie it said much for the captains state of mind that for the first time ever he had in company addressed the bosun by his first name youre here bad pennies sir whos on watch bosun naseby sir thats all right flannelfeet theres more than one sir there has to be i know i dont know how i know but i know you never mentioned this to me patterson said thats because i didnt think about it until now and theres another thing i didnt think about until now captain andropolous the greek master bowen said what about him well sir you know were having a little trouble with the navigation a little thats not how sister morrison tells it well then a lot we thought captain andropolous might give us a hand if we could communicate with him but we cant maybe we dont have to maybe if we just show him your sextant captain and give him a chart that might be enough trouble is the charts ruined blood no problem bowen said we always carry duplicates itll be under the table or in the drawers at the after end of the chart room i should be back in fifteen minutes the bosun said it took him considerably longer and when he did return his set face and the fact that he was carrying with him the sextant in its box and a chart bespoke a man who had come to report the failure of a mission patterson said no cooperation or flannelfoot flannelfoot captain andropolous was lying on his bunk snoring his head off i tried to shake him but i might as well have shaken a sack of potatoes my first thought was that the same person who had been to attend to trent had also been to see the captain but there was no smell of chloroform fetched dr singh who said he had been heavily drugged drugged bowen tried to express astonishment but his voice came out as a croak gods sake is there no end to it drugged how in heavens name could he have been drugged quite easily it would seem sir dr singh didnt know what drug it was but he said he must have taken it with something hed eaten or drunk we asked achmed the head cook if the captain had had anything different to eat from the rest of us and he said he hadnt but also said that he had coffee afterwards captain andropolous had his own idea as to how coffee should be made half coffee half brandy dr singh said that that amount of brandy would have disguised the taste of any drug he knows of there was a cup and saucer by the captains bunkside table it was empty ah patterson looked thoughtful there must have been dregs i know nothing about those things of course but couldnt dr singh have analysed those dregs there were none the captain could have done it himself washed the cup i mean more likely think it was flannelfoot covering his tracks there was no point in making enquiries about who might or might not have been seen going into or leaving the captains cabin no communication is that it patterson said thats it only his own crew were around at the time patterson said assuming that our saboteur has been at work again and i dont think we can assume anything else where the hell would he have got hold of powerful drugs like this where did he get hold of the chloroform i would think that flannelfoot is wellstocked with what he considers essentials maybe hes not only a bit of a chemist too maybe he knows what to look for in the dispensary no bowen said i asked dr singh the dispensary is kept locked yes sir mckinnon said but if this person is a professional a trained saboteur then among what he rates essentials i would think that a set of skeleton keys comes pretty high on his list my cup overfloweth bowen mumbled as i said all gone to hell and breakfast if the weather breaks down much more and i understand its doing just that we can end up any place coast of norway most like may i speak captain it was lieutenant ulbricht bowen twisted his head to one side an illadvised move that made him grunt in pain is that lieutenant ulbricht there was little encouragement in his voice andhad his eyes not been bandaged it was quite certain that there would have been none there either yes sir i can navigate you are very kind lieutenant bowen tried to sound icy but his blistered mouth wasnt up to it youre the last person in the world i would ever turn to for help you have committed a crime against humanity he paused for some seconds but it was no pause for reflection a combination of anger and pain was making speech very difficult if we get back to britain you will be shot you god mckinnon said i can understand how you feel sir because of his bombs fifteen men are dead because of his bombs you are the way you are so are the chief officer hudson and rafferty but i still think you should listen to him the captain was silent for what seemed an unconscionably long time it said much for the regard in which he held the bosun that probably no other man could have given him pause for so long when he spoke his voice was thick with bitterness beggars cant be choosers thats it isnt it mckinnon made no reply anyway navigating a plane is quite different from navigating a ship i can navigate a ship ulbricht said in peacetime i was at a marine schule a marine school i have a marine navigation certificate he smiled briefly not on me of course but i have one besides i have many times taken starsights from a plane that is much more difficult than taking sight from the bridge of a ship i repeat i can navigate him that monster sister morrison sounded even more bitter than the captain but maybe that was because her lips werent blistered im quite sure he can navigate captain bowen im also sure that he would navigate us straight to alta fjord or trondheim or bergen some place in norway anyway ulbricht said thats a very silly statement sister mr mckinnon may not be a navigator but he must be a very experienced seaman and it would require only one glimpse of the sun or the pole star to let him know whether we were steering roughly southeast instead of roughly southwest i still dont trust him an inch sister morrison said if what he says is true then i trust him even less her eyes were coldly appraising her lips firmly compressed one could see that she had missed out on her profession she was well on the way to being the headmistress of roedean with ulbricht cast in the unlikely role of a trembling and errant pigtailed thirdformer look what happened to trent look what happened to that greek captain why shouldnt the same thing happen to mr mckinnon with respect sister mckinnon said in a voice notably lacking in respect i have to repeat what lieutenant ulbricht said thats a very silly statement indeed its silly for two reasons the first is naseby is also a bosun and a very fine one too not that i would expect you to know that the bosun put an unnecessary emphasis on the word you trent ferguson and curran can also tell the difference between north and south so im sure can chief patterson and mr jamieson there could be halfadozen others among the crew are you suggesting that by some mysterious means that passes my comprehension but not it would seem yours lieutenant ulbricht is going to have us all immobilised sister morrison parted lips that had been tightly even whitely compressed and the second reason if you think that lieutenant ulbricht is in cahoots with the persons who were responsible for the destruction of his plane and near as a whisker the loss of his own life well if you believe that youll believe anything if it is possible to clear a throat in a soothing fashion patterson did just that i think captain that the lieutenant here might not be quite as black a villain as you and sister think not a villain the blackhearted bowen broke off and when he spoke again his voice was quiet and almost thoughtful you would not say that without a reason chief what makes you think so it was the bosun who first came up with the suggestion i think i agree with him bosun tell the captain what you told me ive had time to think about this mckinnon said apologetically you havent from what dr singh tells me about the pain you must be suffering it must be a damn hard job to think at all its my belief sir that the lieutenants luftwaffe have sold him down the river sold him down what the devil is that meant to mean i dont think he knew he was attacking a hospital ship sure he knows now but he didnt when he dropped the bombs he didnt know bomber pilots i would remind you bosun are supposed to have excellent eyesight all those red crosses i dont think he saw them sir the lights were off it was half dark as he was approaching from dead astern he certainly couldnt have seen the crosses on the sides and he was so low the superstructure would have blocked off any view of the forard cross as for the cross aft we were making so much smoke at the time that it might have been obscured and i cant imagine for a moment that lieutenant ulbricht would have made so suicidal an approach so suicidal an attack on the san andreas if he had known there was a british frigate only a couple of miles away i wouldnt have put his chances of survival very high neither did i lieutenant ulbricht spoke with feeling and the clincher sir those four heinkel torpedobombers i know you didnt see them sir even hear them you were unconscious at the time but chief patterson and i saw them they deliberately avoided us lifted over us and headed straight for the andover so what do you make of it sir a condor attacks us im sure it must have been with lowpower bombs and the heinkels who could have sent us to the bottom didnt the heinkel pilots knew the andover was there lieutenant ulbricht did not the luftwaffe captain would seem to have two hands with the left hand not telling the right hand what it was doing im more than ever convinced that the lieutenant was sold down the river sold by his own high command and the saboteur who blacked out our red cross lights besides he doesnt look like a man who would bomb a hospital ship how the hell can i tell what he looks like bowen spoke with understandably some irritation a baby face with a harp can be no less of a murderer no matter what he lookslike but yes i agree bosun it does raise some very odd questions questions that seem to call for some very odd answers dont you agree sister well yes perhaps her tone was doubtful grudging mr mckinnon could be right he is right the voice was kennets and it was very firm mr kennet bowen turned to the bed on the other side of him and cursed not too sotto voce as his neck and head reminded him that sudden movements were not advisable i thought you were asleep never more awake sir just that i dont feel too much like talking of course the bosuns right has to be ah well more carefully this time bowen turned back to face ulbricht no apologies for what you have done but maybe youre not the blackhearted murderer we thought you were bosun chief tells me that youve been smashing furniture in my cabin x no more than i had to sir couldnt find the keys the keys are in the back lefthand corner of the left drawer in my desk look in the righthand locker under my bunk theres a chronometer there see if its working a spare chronometer sir many captains carry one i always have done if the sextant has survived the blast maybe the chronometer has too the sextant is functioning isnt it as far as i can tell may i see it lieutenant ulbricht said he examined it briefly it works mckinnon left taking the sextant and chart with him when he returned he was smiling chronometer is intact sir ive put trent back on the wheel and naseby in your cabin there he can see anybody who tries to go up the bridge ladder and more important clobber any unauthorised person who tries to come into your cabin ive told him the only authorised people are mr patterson mr jamieson and myself excellent bowen said lieutenant ulbricht we may yet call upon your services he paused you are aware of course that you will be navigating yourself into captivity not a firing squad that would be a poor return for your ah professional services no better a live prisonerofwar than floating around and frozen to death in a rubber raft which i would have been but for mr mckinnon here ulbricht propped himself up in his bed well no time like the present mckinnon placed a restraining hand on his shoulder sorry lieutenant itll have to wait you mean dr singh he wouldnt be too happy but its not that blizzard zero visibility no stars and therell be none tonight ah ulbricht lay back in bed i wasnt feeling all that energetic anyway it was then that for the third time that day the lights failed mckinnon switched on his torch located and switched on four nickelcadmium emergency lights and looked thoughtfully at patterson bowen said something up sorry sir patterson said he had momentarily forgotten that the captain couldnt see another blasted powercut another jesus the captain sounded less concerned and angry than just disgusted no sooner do we think we have cleared up one problem than we have another flannelfoot ill be bound maybe sir mckinnon said maybe not i dont imagine the lights have failed because someone has been drugged or chloroformed i dont imagine theyve failed because someone wanted to douse our topside red cross lights because visibility is zero and it would serve no point if its sabotage its sabotage for some other reason ill go see if they can tell me anything in the engineroom patterson said looks like another job for mr jamieson hes working in the superstructure mckinnon said i was going there anyway ill get him for you meet you back here sir patterson nodded and hurried from the ward on the now relatively stable upper deck the lifelines were no longer needed as such but were invaluable as guidelines for with the absence of decklights and the driving snow mckinnon literally could not see an inch before his face he brought up short as he bumped into someone whos that his voice was sharp mckinnon jamieson not flannelfoot hes been at it again looks like it sir mr patterson would like to see you in the engineroom on the deck level of the superstructure the bosun found three of the engineroom crew welding a crossplate to two beams the harsh glare of the oxyacetylene flame contrasting eerily with the utter blackness around two decks up he came across naseby in the captains cabin a marlinspike butt end clothwrapped in his hand and a purposeful expression on his face no visitors george nary a visitor archie but it looks as if someone has been visiting somewhere the bosun nodded and went up to the bridge checked with trent and descended the ladder again he stopped outside the captains cabin and looked at naseby notice anything yes i notice something i notice that the engine revs have dropped were slowing this time perhaps a bomb in the engineroom no wed have heard it in the hospital a gas grenade would have done just as well youre getting as bad as i am mckinnon said he found patterson and jamieson in the hospital dining area they were accompanied to mckinnons momentary surprise by ferguson but the surprise was only momentary enginerooms okay then mckinnon said patterson said yes reduced speed as a precaution how did you know ferguson here is holed up with curran in the carpenters shop which is as far forard as you can get in this ship so the trouble is up near the bows nothing short of an earthquake would normally get ferguson out of his bunk or whatever hes using for a bunk up there ferguson looked and sounded aggrieved just dropping off i was when curran and me heard this explosion felt it too directly beneath us not so much an explosion as a bang or a clang something metallic anyway curran shouted that wed been mined or torpedoed but i told him not to be daft if a mine or torpedo had gone off beneath us we wouldnt have been alive to talk about it so i came running aft well as fast as you can run on that deck its like a skating rink mckinnon said to patterson so you think the ships hull is open to the sea i dont know what to think but if it is then the slower we go the less chance of increasing the damage to the hull not too slow of course if we lose steerage way then well start rolling or corkscrewing or whatever and that would only increase the strain on the hull i suppose captain bowen has the structural plans in his cabin i dont know i suppose he has but it doesnt matter i know the layout im sure mr jamieson does as well oh dear that means i dont didnt say that sir let me put it this way next time i see a chief engineer crawling around the bilges will be the first time besides you have to stay up top sir if an urgent decision has to be taken the bilges are no place for the commanding officer to be patterson sighed i often wonder bosun where one draws a line between commonsense and diplomacy this is it you think bosun it has to be sir jamieson and the bosun together with ferguson and mccrimmon were in the paint store a lowermost deck compartment on the port side forard facing them was an eightclamped door set in a watertight bulkhead mckinnon placed the palm of his hand against the top of the door and then against the bottom normal temperatures above well almost normal and cold almost freezing below seawater on the other side sir not more than eighteen inches i would think figures jamieson said were not more than a few feet below the waterline here and thats as much as the compressed air will let in thats one of the ballast rooms of course thats the ballast room sir and this is the paint store jamieson gestured at the irregularly welded patch of metal on the ships side chief engineer never did have any faith in what he called those russkie shipwrights thats as maybe sir but i dont see any russian shipwrights leaving a timebomb in the ballast room russian shipwrights had indeed been aboard the san andreas which had sailed from halifax nova scotia as the freighter ocean belle ocean being a common prefix for americanbuilt liberty ships at the time of sailing the ocean belle was neither fish nor fowl but was in fact a threeparts completed hospital ship its armament at that stage had been removed its magazines emptied all but the essential watertight bulkheads breached or partially cut away the operating theatre completed as were the cabins for the medical staff and the dispensary already fully stocked the medical store was almost finished the galley partially so whereas work had not yet begun on the wards the recovery room and messes the medical staff which had come from britain were already on board orders were received from the admiralty that the ocean belle was to join the next fast convoy to northern russia which had already assembled at halifax captain bowen had not refused refusal of an admiralty order was not permitted but he had objected in a fashion so strongly as to be tantamount to refusal he was damned he said if he was going to sail to russia with a shipload of civilians aboard he was referring to the medical staff aboard and as they constituted only a round dozen they could hardly have been called a shipload he was also conveniently overlooking the fact that every member of the crew from himself downwards was also technically a civilian the medical staff bowen had maintained were a different kind of civilian dr singh had pointed out to him that ninety per cent of the medical staff of the armed forces were civilians only they wore different kinds of uniforms the staff on board the san andreas wore different kinds of uniforms too which happened to be white captain bowen had then fallen back on his last defence he was not he said going to take women through a war zone he was referring to the six nursing staff aboard a by now thoroughly irritated escort commander forcefully made three points that had forcefully been made to him by the admiralty thousands of women and children had been in war zones while being transported as refugees to the united states and canada in the current year as compared to the previous two years uboat losses had quadrupled while mercantile marine losses had been cut by eighty per cent and the russians had requested or rather insisted that as many wounded allied personnel as possible be removed from their overcrowded archangel hospitals captain bowen as he should have done at the beginning had capitulated and the ocean belle still painted in its wartime grey but carrying adequate supplies of white red and green paint had sailed with the convoy as convoys to northern russia went it had been an exceptionally uneventful one not one merchant ship and not one escort vessel had been lost only two incidents had occurred and both had involved the ocean belle some way south of jan mayen island they had come across a venerable v and w class destroyer stopped in the water with an engine breakdown this destroyer had been a unit of the destroyer screen escorting a previous convoy and had stopped to pick up survivors from a sinking cargo vessel which had been heavily on fire the time had been about pm well after sunset and the rescue operation had been interrupted by a brief air attack the attacker had not been seen but had obviously no difficulty in seeing the destroyer silhouetted as it was against the blazing cargo ship it had been assumed that the attacker was a reconnaissance condor for it had dropped no bombs and contented itself with raking the bridge with machine gun fire which had effectively destroyed the radio office thus when the engines had broken down some hours later the breakdown had nothing to do with the condor the v and ws were superannuated overworked and much plagued by mechanical troubles they had been unable to contact the vanished convoy the wounded survivors were taken aboard the ocean belle the destroyer itself together with its crew and unwounded survivors were taken in tow by an sclass destroyer it was later learnt that both vessels had reached scapa flow intact three days afterwards somewhere off north cape they had come across an equally ancient kingfisher corvette which had no business whatever in those distant waters it too was stopped and so deep in the water astern that its poop was already awash it too had survivors aboard the survivors of the crew of a russian submarine that had been picked up from a burning oilcovered sea the russians for the most part badly burned had been transferred inevitably to the ocean belle the crew being transferred to an escort destroyer the corvette was sunk by gunfire it was during this transfer that the ocean belle had been holed twice just below the water line on the port side in the paint store and ballast room the reason for the damage had never been established throughout the wartime convoy sailings to murmansk and archangel the use of rescue ships remained a bone of contention between the royal navy at sea and the royal navy on land the latter being the londonbased admiralty which acquitted itself with something less than distinction during the long years of the russian convoys in the earlier days the use of rescue ships was the rule not the exception after the loss of the zafaaran and the stockport which was lost with all hands including the many survivors that had been picked up from other sunken vessels the admiralty forbade the further use of rescue ships this was a rule that was observed in the breach in certain convoys a selfselected member of the escort group usually a destroyer or smaller would assign to itself the role of rescue ship an assignment in which the force commander would acquiesce or to which he turned a blind eye the task of the rescue ships was a hazardous one indeed there was never any question of a convoy stopping or of their escorts leaving the convoy so that almost invariably the rescue ship was left alone and unprotected the sight of a royal naval vessel stopped in the water alongside a sinking vessel was an irresistible target for many uboat commanders the convoy had gone to archangel but the ocean belle had put in to murmansk neither captain bowen nor the escort commander had thought it wise that the ocean belle should proceed any further than necessary in its then present condition slightly down by the head and with a list to port there were no dry dock facilities available but the russians were masters of improvisation the rigours of war had forced them to be they topped up the after tanks drained the forard tanks and removed the forard slabs of concrete ballast until the holes in the paint store and ballast room were just clear of the water after which it had taken them only a few hours to weld plates in position over the holes the equalization of the tanks and the replacement of ballast had then brought the ocean belle back to an even keel while those repairs were being effected a small army of russian carpenters had worked three shifts in every twentyfour hours in the hospital section of the ship fitting out the wards recovery room messes galley and medical store captain bowen was astonished beyond measure on his previous visits to the two russian ports he had encountercd from his allies blood brothers who should have been in tears of gratitude for the dearlybought and vital supplies being ferried to their stricken country nothing but sullen ness indifference a marked lack of cooperation and not occasionally downright hostility the baffling seachange he could only attribute to the fact that the russians were only showing their heartfelt appreciation for the ocean belle having brought their wounded submariners back home when they sailed it was as a hospital ship bowens crew paintbrushes in hands had worked with a will during their brief stay in murmansk they did not as everyone had expected proceed through the white sea to pick up the wounded servicemen in archangel the admiraltys orders had been explicit they were to proceed and at all speed to the port of aberdeen in scotland jamieson replaced the cover of the small electrical junction box having effectively isolated the ballast room from the main power system he tapped the watertight door short in there could have been caused by the blast or seawater it doesnt matter should have blown a fuse somewhere it didnt somewhere or other theres a fuse thats been tampered with fusewire replaced by a nail or some such that doesnt matter either im not going to look for it mccrimmon go ask the engineroom to try the generator mckinnon tapped the same door and what do we do here what indeed jamieson sat on a paint drum and thought three choices i would say we can get an air compressor down here drill a hole through the bulkhead at about shoulder level and force the water out which would be fine if we knew where the level of the hole in the hull is we dont besides the chances are that the compressed air in the ballast room would escape before we could get the nozzle of the compressed air hose into the hole we drilled which could only mean that more water would pour into the ballast room or we could reinforce the bulkhead the third choice is to do nothing im for the third choice its a pretty solid bulkhead wed have to reduce speed of course no bulkhead is going to stand up to the pressure at full speed if theres a hole the size of a barn door in the hull a barn door would not be convenient mckinnon said i think ill go and have a look it was a very cold and rather bruised mckinnon who halfclimbed and was halfpulled up to the foredeck of the san andreas which engines stopped was wallowing heavily in quartering seas in the pale halflight given by the again functioning deck arc lamps they presented a strange quartet jamieson ferguson and mccrimmon wraithlike figures completely shrouded in snow mckinnon a weirdlygleaming creature the sea water on his rubber suit aqualung and waterproof torch already in that є below temperature beginning to harden into ice at a gesture from jamieson mccrimmon left for the engineroom while ferguson pulled in the ropeladder jamieson took mckinnons arm and led him the newlyformed ice on the rubber suit crackling as he stumbled along towards the shelter of the superstructurewhere mckinnon pulled off his aqualung his teeth were chattering uncontrollably pretty bad down there bosun not that sir this damned rubber suit he fingered a waisthigh gash in the material tore it on a jagged piece of metal from here down the suit is filled with water good god youll freeze to death man hurry hurrry in what was left of his cabin mckinnon began to strip off his rubber suit you located the damage no problem and no barn door just a ragged hole about the size of my fist jamieson smiled worth risking pneumonia to find that out im going to the bridge see you in the captains cabin when mckinnon in dry clothing but still shivering violently joined jamieson and naseby in the captains cabin the san andreas was back on course and steadily picking up speed jamieson pushed a glass of scotch across to him im afraid the captains supplies are taking a fearful beating bosun this shouldnt increase the risk of pneumonia ive left the water out ive been speaking to mr patterson and the captain weve got a line through to the hospital now when i told him youd been over the side in this weather he didnt say thankyou or anything like that just said to tell you that youre mad captain bowen is not often wrong and thats a fact mckinnons hands were shaking so badly that he spilt liquid from his admittedly brimming glass any instructions from the captain or mr patterson none both say theyre quite happy to leave the topside to you thats kind of them what they really mean is that they have no option theres only george and myself george sorry sir naseby here hes a bosun too weve been shipmates on and off friends for twenty years i didnt know jamieson looked thoughtfully at naseby i can see it now youve made arrangements for up here bosun about to sir george and i will take turns here looking after the family jewels so to speak ill have trent ferguson and curran spell one another on the wheel ill tell them to give me a shake if im asleep when or if the weather clears cue for lieutenant ulbricht indeed i would like to make a suggestion sir if i may i would like to have some people keeping watch at the fore and aft exits of the hospital just to make absolutely certain that nobodys going to start sleepwalking during the night whos going to watch the watchers a point sir the watchers i would suggest are jones mcguigan mccrimmon and stephen unless theyre wonderful actors the first two are too young and innocent to be criminals mccrimmon may indeed have a criminal bent but i think hes an honest criminal and stephen strikes me as being a fairly trustworthy lad more important hes not likely to forget that it was a naval minesweeper that picked him up out of the north sea i didnt know that either you seem to be better informed about my own department than i am ill arrange for stephen and mccrimmon you look after the others our resident saboteur is not about to give up all that easily i would be surprised if he did wouldnt you very much i wonder what form of sabotage his next attempt to nobble us will take i just have no idea but another thought occurs sir the person you have keeping an eye on the aft exit from the hospital might also keep an eye on the entrance to a ward a ward that bunch of crooks whatever for the person or persons who are trying to slow us and are doing their best to get us lost might think it a rather good idea to nobble lieutenant ulbricht indeed they might ill stay in the ward myself tonight theres a spare bed if i do drop off the duty nurse can always give me a shake if anyone comes in who shouldnt be coming in jamieson was silent for a few moments whats behind it all bosun i think you know as well as i do sir somebody somewhere wants to take over the san andreas although why anyone should want to take over a hospital ship i cant even begin to imagine no more can i a uboat you think it would have to be wouldnt it i mean you cant capture a ship from the air and theyre hardly likely to send the tirpitz after us mckinnon shook his head a uboat any fishing boat with a few armed and determined men could take us over whenever they felt like it five mckinnon deep in sleep though he was was instantly awake at nasebys shake and swung his legs over the edge of captain bowens bunk whats the time george six am currans just been down from the bridge says the blizzard has blown itself out stars he didnt say the bosun pulled on an extra jersey duffel coat and seaboots made his way up to the bridge spoke briefly to curran and went out on the starboard wing within only a second or two bent double and with his back to the galeforce wind coughing and gasping as the icechilled air reached down into his lungs he was beginning to wish himself anywhere except where he was he switched on his torch and picked up the thermometer it showed є є of frost on the fahrenheit scale combined with the strong wind the temperature expressed in terms of the chill factor on exposed skin was in the region of oєf he straightened slowly and looked out towards the bows in the light of the red cross arc lamps on the foredeck it was at once clear as curran had said that the blizzard had blown itself out against the deep indigo of the sky the stars were preternaturally bright and clear breathing through a mittened hand that covered both mouth and nose mckinnon turned into the wind and looked aft at first he could see nothing for the bitter wind brought instantaneous tears to his eyes he ducked below the shelter of the canvas windbreaker fumbled a pair of goggles from his coat pocket strapped them under his duffel hood straightened again and by dint of wiping the back of his free mitten against the glasses was able to see intermittently what was going on astern the waves the weather had not yet worsened to the extent that the seas had become broken and confused were between twelve and fifteen feet in height their lee sides whitely streaked with spume and halfhidden in flying spray as the wind tore their tops away the stars were as brilliant as they had been in the other direction and mckinnon soon located the pole star off the starboard quarter the wind was no longer backing to the north and the san andreas as far as he could judge was still heading roughly between southwest and southsouthwest mckinnon moved back into the bridge thankfully closed the door and pondered briefly their present course it was safe to assume offered no danger on the other hand it was not safe to assume that they would or could maintain their present course the weather in this grey and undefined area between the barents and norwegian seas was notoriously fickle he had not for instance expected and had said as much that the skies would clear that night there was equally no guarantee that they would remain clear and that the wind would not back further to the north he descended two decks selected an armful of warm clothing from the now mostly abandoned crews quarters and made for the hospital area crossing the dangerously slippery upper deck and guided only by the lifeline he became acutely and painfully aware that a change was already under way a factor that he had not experienced on the starboard wing only a few minutes ago needlepointed ice spicules were beginning to lance into the unprotected areas of his skin it augured ill in the hospital messdeck he came across both jones and mcguigan both of whom assured him that no one was or had been abroad he passed into b ward at the far end of which janet magnusson was seated at her desk her elbows propped on it her chin propped on her hands and her eyes closed aha mckinnon said asleep on the job nurse magnusson she looked up startled blinked and tried to sound indignant asleep of course not she peered at his armful of clothing what on earth is that for have you moved into the old rags trade archie no dont tell me its for that poor man in there maggies in there too she wont be pleased as far as your precious maggie is concerned i would have thought that a little suffering for lieutenant ulbricht would be preferable to none no salt tears for either sister morrison or the lieutenant archie she was on her feet your face blood as far as the lieutenant and myself are both concerned that should please your friend he wiped the blood off his face its not nice up top archie she looked at him uncertainly concern in the tired eyes its all right janet he touched her shoulder and passed into a ward sister morrison and lieutenant ulbricht were both awake and drinking tea the sister at her desk ulbricht sitting up in bed cleareyed and rested the german pilot as dr singh had said unquestionably had quite remarkable recuperative powers jamieson fully clothed and stretched out on the top of a bed opened an eye as mckinnon passed by morning bosun it is morning isnt it sixtwenty sir good lord selfishness thats what it is ive been asleep for seven hours how are things a quiet night up top here too must have been no one gave me a shake he looked at the bundle of clothing that mckinnon was carrying then at ulbricht stars yes sir at the moment that is i dont think theyll be there for long mr mckinnon sister morrisons voice was cold with a touch of asperity as it usually was when addressing the bosun do you intend to drag that poor man out of bed on a night like this hes been shot several times i know hes been shot several times or have you forgotten who picked him out of the water the bosun was an innately courteous man but never at his best when dealing with sister morrison so hes a poor man now well its better than being a filthy nazi murderer what do you mean on a night like this i mean the weather of course her fists were actually clenched jamieson surveyed the ward deckhead what do you know about the weather you havent been out of here all night if you had been i would have known he turned a dismissive back on her and looked at ulbricht how do you feel lieutenant i have an option ulbricht smiled i feel well enough even if i didnt im still coming dont be too hard on the ward sister bosun even your lady with a lamp in the crimea had a pretty short way with difficult patients but shes overlooking my natural selfishness im on this ship too he climbed stiffly out of bed and with the assistance of mckinnon and jamieson started to pull clothing on over his pyjamas while sister morrison looked on in frigid disapproval the disapproval finally culminated in the drumming of fingertips on the table i think she said that we should have dr singh in here mckinnon turned slowly and looked at her and when he spoke his voice was as expressionless as his face i dont think it matters very much what you think sister i suggest you just give a shake to captain bowen there and find out just how much your thinking matters the captain is under heavy sedation when he regains consciousness i shall report you for insolence insolence mckinnon looked at her with indifference i think he would prefer that to stupidity the stupidity of a person who is trying to endanger the san andreas and all those aboard her its a pity we dont have any irons on this ship she glared at him made to speak then turned as dr sinclair came into the ward sleepyeyed and touslehaired he looked in mild astonishment at the spectacle before him dr sinclair thank heavens youre here rapidly and urgently she began to explain the situation to him those those men want starsights or navigation or something and in spite of all my protests they insist on dragging a seriously ill man up to the bridge or wherever and i can see whats happening sinclair said mildly but if the lieutenant is being dragged hes not putting up much in the way of resistance is he and by no stretch of the imagination can you describe him as being seriously ill but i do take your point sister he should be under constant medical supervision ah thank you doctor sister morrison came very close to permitting herself a smile so its back to bed for him well no not quite a duffel coat a pair of sea boots my bag of tricks and ill go up with them that way the lieutenant will be under constant medical supervision even with three men lending what assistance they could it look twice as long as expected to help lieutenant ulbricht as far as the captains cabin once there he sank heavily into the chair behind the table thank you very much gentlemen he was very pale his breathing shallow and abnormally rapid sorry about that it would seem that i am not as fit as i thought i was nonsense dr sinclair was brisk you did splendidly its that inferior english blood that we had to give you this morning thats all he made free with captain bowens supplies superior scotch blood effects guaranteed ulbricht smiled faintly isnt there something about opening pores you wont be out in the open long enough to give your pores a chance to protest up on the bridge mckinnon adjusted ulbrichts goggles then scarfed him so heavily above and below the goggles that not a square millimetre of skin was left exposed when he was finished lieutenant ulbricht was as immune to the weather as it was possible for anyone to be two balaclavas and a tightly strung duffel hood made sure of that mckinnon went out on the starboard wing hung a trailing lamp from the canvas windbreaker went back inside picked up the sextant took ulbricht by his right arm the undamaged one and led him outside even although he was so cocooned against the elements even though the bosun had warned him and even though he had already had an ominous foretaste of what lay in store in their brief journey across the upper deck he was totally unprepared for the power and savagery of the wind that caught him as soon as he stepped out on the wing his weakened limbs were similarly unprepared he took two short sharp steps forward and though he managed to clutch the top of the windbreaker would probably have fallen but for mckinnons sustaining hand had he been carrying the sextant he would almost certainly have dropped it with mckinnons arm around him ulbricht took three starsights to the south west and north clumsily noting down the results as he did so the first two sights were comparatively quick and simple the third to the north took much longer and was far more difficult for ulbricht had to keep clearing away the ice spicules from his goggles and the sextant when he had finished he handed the sextant back to mckinnon leant his elbows on the after edge of the wing and stared out towards the stern occasionally and mechanically wiping his goggles with the back of his hand after almost twenty seconds of this mckinnon took his good arm and almost literally dragged him back into the shelter of the bridge banging the door to behind him handing the sextant to jamieson he quickly removed ulbrichts duffel hood balaclavas and goggles sorry about that lieutenant but theres a time and a place for everything and daydreaming or sightseeing out on that wing is not one of them the funnel ulbricht looked slightly dazed whats happened to your funnel it fell off i see it fell off you mean whats done is done jamieson said philosophically he handed a glass to the lieutenant to help you with your calculations thank you yes ulbricht shook his head as if to clear it yes my calculations weak though he was and shivering constantly this despite the fact that the bridge temperature was already over єf ulbricht left no doubt that as a navigator he knew precisely what he was about working from starsights he had no need to worry about the vagaries of deviation and variation with a chart dividers parallel rules pencils and chronometer he completed his calculations in remarkably short order and made a tiny cross on the chart after having consulted navigational tables were here well near enough north east more or less due west of the lofotens our course is is one permitted to ask our destination jamieson smiled quite frankly lieutenant ulbricht you wouldnt be much use to us if you didnt aberdeen ah aberdeen they have a rather famous prison there do they not peterhead isnt it i wonder what the cells are like v its a prison for civilians of the more intractable kind i should hardly think youd end up there or in any prison jamieson looked at him with some curiosity how do you know about peterhead lieutenant i know scotland well i know england even better ulbricht did not seek to elaborate so aberdeen well stay on this course until we get to the latitude of trondheim then south until we get to the latitude of bergen or if you like mr mckinnon the latitude of your home islands how did you know im a shetlander some members of the nursing staff dont seem to mind talking to me then on a more westerly course thats speaking roughly well work out the details as we go along its a very simple exercise and theres no problem of course its no problem jamieson said neither is playing rachmaninoff not as long as you are a concert pianist ulbricht smiled you overrate my simple skills the only problem that will arise is when we make our landfall which of course will have to be in daylight at this time of year north sea fogs are as common as not and theres no way i can navigate in a fog without a radio and compass with any luck there shouldnt be all that much of a problem mckinnon said war or no war theres still pretty heavy traffic on the east coast and theres more than an even chance that we can pick up a ship and be guided into harbour agreed ulbricht said a red cross ship is not easily overlooked especially one with its funnel missing he sipped his drink pondered briefly then said is it your intention to return me to the hospital naturally sinclair said thats where you belong why do you ask ulbricht looked at jamieson i would of course be expected to do some more navigating expecting lieutenant depending is the word youre after and at frequent intervals if cloud or snow conditions permit we never know when the set of the sea and the wind may change without our being aware of it point is i dont much fancy dragging myself back down to the hospital then coming back up here again every time i have to take starsights couldnt i just lie down in the captains cabin no objections jamieson said dr sinclair makes sense lieutenant ulbricht is hardly on the critical list and it could only help his recuperation ill pop up every two or three hours to see how hes getting on bosun fine by me fine by sister morrison too i should imagine i shall have company of course company sinclair said you mean a nurse lieutenant i dont mean a nurse with all respect to your charming young ladies dr sinclair i dont think any of them would be much use if this fellow you call flannelfoot came up to remove or destroy the sextant and chronometer and the way im feeling i couldnt fight off a determined fly also of course hed have to dispose of witnesses and i dont much fancy that no problem lieutenant the bosun said hell have to try to dispose of either naseby or myself and i dont much think he would fancy that we would though sinclair shook his head sadly sister morrison isnt going to like this one little bit further usurpment of her authority after all the lieutenant is her patient not mine again no problem mckinnon said just tell her the lieutenant fell over the side and how are your patients this morning sir mckinnon was having breakfast with dr singh no dramatic changes bosun the two argos crewmen in the recovery room are much of a muchness as well as can be expected when one has a fractured pelvis and the other massive burns the condition of commander warrington and his navigating officer is unchanged cunningham is still in deep coma and is being fed intravenously hudson is stabilized the lung bleeding has stopped chief officer kennet is definitely on the mend although heaven knows how long it will be before we can take those bandages off his face the only one that gives some cause for worry is the captain its nothing critical not even serious just worrisome you saw how he was when you last saw him breathing hellfire and brimstone in all directions hes gone strangely quiet now almost lethargic or maybe hes just more calm and relaxed now that he knows the ships position and course that was a fine job you did there bosun no credit to me sir it was lieutenant ulbricht who did the fine job be that as it may captain bowen appears to be in at least a more philosophical mood i suggest you come along and see him when a mans face is completely obscured by bandages it is difficult to say what kind of mood he is in he had the stem of a rather evilsmelling briar stuck between his burnt lips and again it was impossible to say whether he was enjoying it or not when he heard mckinnons voice he removed the pipe we are still afloat bosun the enunciation was clearer than it had been and was costing him less effort well sir lets say were no longer all gone to hell and breakfast no more alarms and excursions either as far as i can tell lieutenant ulbricht is very much of an expert i dont think youd hesitate to have him as your navigating officer hes lying down on the bunk in your cabin sir but you will have been told that and the reasons why broaching my rapidly dwindling supplies i have no doubt he did have a couple of tots sir he needed it hes still a pretty sick man and very weak and the cold out there on the wing bridge was vicious i dont think ive ever known it worse in the arctic anyway he wasnt doing any broaching when i left him he was sound asleep as long as he keeps on acting in this fashion he can do as much broaching as he likes give him my sincere thanks ill do that have you any instructions sir instructions bosun instructions how can i give any instructions i wouldnt know sir ive never been a captain you bloody well are now im in no position to give anyone instructions just do what you think best and from what ive heard to date your best seems to be very good indeed not bowen added deprecatingly that i would have expected anything else of archie mckinnon thank you sir ill try mckinnon turned to leave the ward but was stopped by sister morrison for once she was looking at him as if he might even belong to the human race how is he mr mckinnon the lieutenant resting hes a lot weaker than he says he is but hed never admit it a very brave man and a fine navigator and a gentleman when he says he didnt know the san andreas was a hospital ship i believe him absolutely i dont believe many people absolutely im quite sure you dont the return to the old asperity proved to be momentary i dont think i believe he knew it either in fact i dont believe it thats nice mckinnon smiled at her the first time he reflected with some astonishment that hed ever smiled at her janet nurse magnusson tells me you come from the east coast would it be impertinent to ask where exactly of course not she smiled and mckinnon realized with an even greater sense of shock that this was the first time shed ever smiled at him aberdeen why odd lieutenant ulbricht seems to know aberdeen rather well he certainly seems to know about peterhead prison and isnt all that keen on ending up there a brief flicker of what could have been concern registered on her face will he not a chance if he brings this ship back to aberdeen theyll probably give him a medal both your parents from aberdeen sister my father is my mothers from kiel kiel yes germany didnt you know of course not how should i have known now that i do know is that supposed to make a difference im half german she smiled again arent you surprised mr mckinnon shocked perhaps no im not shocked mckinnon looked gloomy i have troubles of my own in that direction my sister jean is married to an italian i have a niece and a nephew two bambinos who cant or couldnt before the war speak a word of english to their old uncle it must make must have made communication a bit difficult luckily no i speak italian she removed her glasses as if to examine them more closely you speak italian mr mckinnon yes and spanish and german you must be able to speak german you can try me any time surprised sister shocked no she shook her head slowly and smiled a third time it was borne in upon mckinnon that a smiling margaret morrison with her warm friendly brown eyes was a totally different creature from the sister morrison he thought he had come to know no im not really you come from seafaring people sister yes this time she was surprised how did you know i didnt but it was a fair guess its the kiel connection many british sailors know kiel well i do myself and it has or did have the finest regatta in europe your fathers from aberdeen a fisherman a seaman of some sort a seaman of some sort what sort well she hesitated well what hes a captain in the royal navy good lord mckinnon looked at her in mild astonishment then rubbed an unshaven chin i shall have to treat you with more respect in future sister morrison i hardly think that will be necessary mr mckinnon the voice was formal but the smile that followed was not not now you sound almost as if you were ashamed of being the daughter of a royal navy captain i am not im very proud of my father but it can be difficult do you understand yes i think i do well now mr mckinnon the glasses were back in position and sister morrison was back in business youll be seeing lieutenant ulbricht up top mckinnon nodded tell him ill be up to see him in an hour maybe two mckinnon blinked which was about as far as he ever permitted himself to go in the way of emotional expression you yes me if bridling hadnt gone out of fashion she would have bridled but dr sinclair said he would come dr sinclair is a doctor not a nurse sister morrison made it sound as if there was something faintly discreditable in being a doctor im the lieutenants sisterincharge hell probably require to have his bandages changed when exactly will you be coming does it matter i can find my own way no sister you wont you dont know what its like up top theres a full gale blowing its forty below black as the earl of hells waistcoat and the decks like a skating rink no one goes up top without my permission and most certainly not nurses you will phone and i will come for you yes mr mckinnon she said primly she gave a slight smile the way you put it it doesnt leave much room for argument im sorry no offence before you come up put on as much warm clothing as you think you will need then double the amount janet magnusson was in b ward when he passed through it she took one quick look at his face and said whats the matter with you prepare thyself nurse magnusson the end is nigh what on earth do you mean archie the dragon next door he jerked a thumb towards a ward she has just dragon maggie yesterday she was a lioness dragon shes stopped breathing fire she smiled at me first time since leaving halifax smiled four times unsettles a man well she shook his shoulders i am pleased so you admit you misjudged her i admit it mind you i think she may have misjudged me a bit too i told you she was nice archie remember indeed i remember and indeed she is very nice very mckinnon regarded her with suspicion whats that meant to mean she smiled at you the bosun gave her a cold look and left lieutenant ulbricht was awake when mckinnon returned to the captains cabin duty calls mr mckinnon another fix rest easy lieutenant no stars overcast more snow im thinking how do you feel well enough at least when im lying down thats physically i mean he tapped his head up here not so well ive been doing a lot of wondering and thinking wondering and thinking why youre lying here exactly havent we all at least ive been doing nothing else but wondering about it havent got very far though in fact i havent got anywhere im not saying it would help any just call it curiosity if you like but would you mind very much telling me whats been happening to the san andreas since you left halifax not of course if it means telling me naval secrets mckinnon smiled i dont have any besides even if i did have and told you what would you do with them you have a point what indeed mckinnon gave a brief resume of what had happened to the ship since leaving nova scotia and when he had finished ulbricht said well now let me see if i can count as far as i can make out there were seven different parties involved in the movements of the san andreas actually aboard it that is to begin with there was your own crew then there were the wounded survivors picked up from this crippled destroyer after that came the russian submarine survivors you took from this corvette you had to sink then you picked up some wounded servicemen in murmansk since leaving there youve picked up survivors from the argos the andover and helmut and myself that makes seven that makes seven we can eliminate the survivors from the brokendown destroyer and the sinking frigate their presence aboard your ship could only have been due to sheer happenstance nothing else we can equally forget commander warrington and his two men and helmut winterman and myself that leaves just your crew the survivors from the argos and the sick men you picked up in murmansk i couldnt imagine a more unlikely trio of suspects neither could i bosun but its notimagination were concerned with here its logic it has to be one of those three take the sick men you picked up in murmansk one of them could have been suborned i know it sounds preposterous but war itself is preposterous the most unbelievable things happen in preposterous circumstances and if there is one thing that is for certain it is that we are not going to find the answer to this enigma in the realms of the obvious how many sick men are you repatriating from russia seventeen do you happen to know the nature of their injuries mckinnon regarded the lieutenant speculatively i have a fair idea all seriously wounded there are no seriously wounded far less critically injured patients aboard if they were they wouldnt be here poorly you might call them i suppose but bedridden immobile the wounded are they are not all wounded only eight good god eight you mean to tell me that there are nine who are not injured it all depends upon what you mean by injured three are suffering from advanced cases of exposure frostbite if you like then there are three with tuberculosis and the remaining three have suffered mental breakdowns those russian convoys take a pretty vicious toll lieutenant in more ways than one you have no cause to love our uboats our luftwaffe mr mckinnon the bosun shrugged we do send the occasional thousand bombers over hamburg ulbricht sighed i suppose this is no time for philosophizing about how two wrongs can never make a right so we have nine unwounded all of them mobile the three exposure cases are virtually immobile youve never seen so many bandages the other six well they can get around as well as you and i well thats not quite accurate as well as i can and a damned sight better than you can so six mobiles i know little enough of medicine but i do know just how difficult it is to gauge how severe a case of tb is i also know that a man in a pretty advanced stage can get around well enough as for mental breakdowns those are easy enough to simulate one of those three may be as rational as we are or think we are come to that all three of them may be i dont have to tell you mr mckinnon that there are those who are so sick of the mindlessness the hellishness of war that they will resort to any means to escape from it malingerers as they are commonly and quite often unfairly called many of them have quite simply had enough and can take no more during the first world war quite a number of british soldiers were affected by an incurable disease that was a surefire guarantee for a oneway ticket to blighty dah it was called disorder affecting the heart the more unfeeling of the british doctors commonly referred to it as desperate affection for home ive heard of itlieutenant im not by nature an inquisitive person but may i ask you a personal question of course your english so much better than mine thing is you dont sound like a foreigner talking english you sound like an englishman talking english an englishman whos been at an english public school funny not really you dont miss much mr mckinnon and thats a fact i was educated in an english public school my mother is english my father was for many years an attache in the german embassy in london well well mckinnon shook his head and smiled its too much its really too much two shocks like this inside twenty minutes if you were to tell me what you are talking about sister morrison you and she should get together ive just learnt that shes halfgerman good god goodness gracious me ulbricht could hardly be said to be dumbfounded but he was taken aback german mother of course how extraordinary i tell you bosun this could be a serious matter her being my nurse i mean wartime international complications you know i dont know and i dont see it youre both just doing your job anyway shes coming up to see you shortly coming to see me that ruthless nazi killer maybe shes had a change of heart under duress of course its her idea and she insists on it itll be a hypodermic syringe lethal dose of morphine or some such to get back to our six walking unwounded widens the field a bit doesnt it a suborned malingerer or ditto tb patient how do you like it i dont like it at all how many suborned men spies saboteurs do you think weve picked up among the survivors from the argos another daft thought i know but as youve more or less said yourself were looking for daft answers to daft questions and speaking of daft questions heres another one how do we know the argos really was mined we know that tankers are extremely tough heavily compartmented and that this one was returning with empty tanks tankers dont die easily and even laden tankers have been torpedoed and survived we dont even know the argos was mined how do we know it wasnt sabotaged so as to provide the opportunity to introduce a saboteur or saboteurs aboard the san andreas how do you like that like yourself i dont like it at all but youre not seriously suggesting that captain andropolous would deliberately im not suggesting anything about captain andropolous for all i know he may be as doubledyed a villain as is sailing the seas these days although im willing to consider almost any crazy solution to our questions i cant go along with the idea that any captain would sacrifice his ship for any imaginable purpose but a person or persons to whom the argos meant nothing might quite happily do just that it would be interesting to know whether andropolous had taken on any extra crew members in murmansk such as fellow nationals who had survived a previous sinking unfortunately andropolous and his crew speak nothing but greek and nobody else aboard speaks greek i speak a little greek very little schoolboy stuff english public schools are high on greek and ive forgotten most of that not that i can see that it would do much good anyway even if we were to find out that a person or x number of persons joined the argos at murmansk they would only assume expressions of injured innocence say they dont know what we are talking about and what could we do then ulbricht was silent for almost a minute then suddenly said the russian shipwrights what russian shipwrights the ones that fixed the damage to the hull of your ship and finished off your sickbay but especially the hull repairers what about them moment ulbricht thought some more i dont know just how many niggers in the woodpile there may be aboard the san andreas but im all at once certain that the original one was a member of your own crew how on earth do you figure that out not mind you that anything would surprise me you sustained this hull damage to the san andreas while you were alongside the sinking corvette before vou sunk her by gunfire that is correct correct how did it happen i told you we dont know no torpedoes no mines nothing of that nature a destroyer was along one side of the corvette taking off her crew while we were on the other taking off the survivors of the sunken russian submarine there was a series of explosions inside the corvette before we could get clear one was a boiler going off the others could have been guncotton twopounders anything there was some sort of fire inside it was at that time that the damage must have happened i suggest it didnt happen that way at all i suggest instead that it was then that a trusty member of your crew detonated a charge in the port ballast room i suggest that it was someone who knew precisely how much explosive to use to ensure that it didnt sink the ship but enough to inflict sufficiently serious damage for it to have to make for the nearest port where repair facilities were available which in this case was murmansk it makes sense it could have happened that way but im not convinced in murmansk did anyone see the size or type of hole that had been blown in the hull no did anyone try to see yes mr rennet and i but surprise surprise you didnt you didnt because you werent allowed to see it thats how it was how did you know they had tarpaulins rigged all around and above the area under repair they had mckinnon was beginning to look rather thoughtful did they give any reasons to keep out the wind and snow was there much in the way of those very little did you ask to get behind the tarpaulins see behind them we did they wouldnt let us said it was too dangerous and would only hold up the work of the shipwrights we didnt argue because we didnt think it was all that important there was no reason why we should have thought so if you know the russians at all you must know how mulish they can be about the most ridiculous things besides they were doing us a favour and there was no reason why we should have been suspicious all right all right lieutenant theres no reason to beat me over the head with a twobyfour you dont have to be an engineer or a metallurgist to recognize a hole that has been blown from the inside out and does it now strike you as strange that the second damage to the hull should have occurred in precisely the same ballast compartment not now it doesnt our gallant ours not yours our gallant allies almost certainly left the charge in the ballast room with a suitable length of fuse conveniently attached you have the right of it lieutenant so all we have to do now is to find some member of your crew with a working knowledge of explosives you know of any such mr mckinnon yes what ulbricht propped himself up on an elbow who mckinnon raised his eyes to the deckhead me thats a help ulbricht lowered himself to his bunk again thats a great help six it was shortly after ten oclock in the morning that the snow came again mckinnon had spent another fifteen minutes in the captains cabin leaving only when he saw the lieutenant was having difficulty in keeping his eyes open then had spoken in turn with naseby patterson and jamieson who was again supervising the strengthening of the superstructure all three had agreed that ulbricht was almost certainly correct in the assessment he had made and all three agreed with the bosun that this fresh knowledge if knowledge it were served no useful purpose whatsoever mckinnon had returned to the bridge when the snow came he opened a wing door in a duly circumspect fashion but for all his caution had it torn from his grasp to crash against the leading edge of the bridge such was the power of the wind the snow light as yet was driving along as nearly horizontally as made no difference it was quite impossible to look into it but with his back to it and looking out over the bows he could see that the wave pattern had changed the dawn was in the sky now and in its light he could see that the last semblance of serried ranks had vanished and that the whiteveined whitespumed seas were now broken walls of water tending this way and that in unpredictable formless confusion even without the evidence of his eyes he would have known that this was so the deck beneath his feet was beginning to shake and shudder in a rather disconcerting manner the cold was intense even with his very considerable weight and strength mckinnon found it no easy task to heave the wing door shut behind him as he stepped back into the bridge he was in desultory conversation with trent who had the helm when the phone rang it was sister morrison she said she was ready to come up to the captains cabin i wouldnt recommend it sister things are pretty unpleasant up top i would remind you that you gave me your promise she was speaking in her best sisters voice i know its just that conditions have worsened quite a bit really mr mckinnon im coming on your own head in ward b janet magnusson looked at him with disapproval a hospital is no place for a snowman just passing through on a mission of mercy at least your muleheaded friend imagines she is she kept her expression in place lieutenant ulbricht who else ive just seen him looks fair enough to me i think shes daft the trouble with you archie mckinnon is that you have no finer feelings not as far as caring for the sick is concerned in other ways too like as not and if shes daft its only because shes been saying nice things about you about me she doesnt know me true archie true she smiled sweetly but captain bowen does mckinnon sought briefly for a suitable comment about captains who gossiped to ward sisters found none and moved into ward a sister morrison suitably bundled up was waiting there was a small medical case on a table by her side mckinnon nodded at her would you take those glasses off sister why its the lothario in him kennet said he sounded almost his old cheerful self again he probably thinks you look nicer without them its no morning for a polar bear mr kennet far less a lothario if the lady doesnt remove her glasses the wind will do the job for her whats the wind like bosun it was captain bowen force eleven sir blizzard eight below nineninety millibars and the seas breaking up even in the hospital the shuddering of the vessel was unmistakable they are a bit sir any problems apart from sister here seeming bent on suicide none not he thought as long as the superstructure stayed in place sister morrison gasped in shock as they emerged on to the upper deck however much she had mentally prepared herself she could not have anticipated the savage power of that near hurricane force wind and the driving blizzard that accompanied it could not even have imagined the lungsearing effect of the abrupt oєf drop in temperature mckinnon wasted no time he grabbed sister morrison with one hand the lifeline with the other and allowed the two of them to be literally blown across the treacherous icesheathed deck into the shelter of the superstructure once under cover she removed her duffel hood and stood there panting tenderly massaging her ribs next time mr mckinnon if there is a next time ill listen to you my word i never dreamt well i just never dreamt and my ribs she felt carefully as if to check they were still there ive got ordinary ribs just like anyone else i think youve broken them im sorry about that mckinnon said gravely but i dont think youd have much fancied going over the side and there will be a next time im afraid weve got to go back again and against the wind and that will be a great deal worse at the moment im in no hurry to go back thank you very much mckinnon led her up the companionway to the crews quarters she stopped and looked at the twisted passageway the buckled bulkheads the shattered doors so this is where they died her voice was husky when you see it its all too easy to understand how they died but you have to see it first to understand ghastly well ghastly couldnt have been the word for it thank god i never saw it and you had to clear it all up i had help i know you did all the horrible bits mr spenser mr rawlings mr batesman those were the really shocking cases werent they i know you wouldnt let anyone else touch them johnny holbrook told janet and she told me she shuddered i dont like this place wheres the lieutenant mckinnon led her up to the captains cabin where naseby was keeping an eye on the recumbent lieutenant good morning again lieutenant ive just had a taste of the kind of weather mr mckinnon has been exposing you to it was awful how do you feel low sister very low i think im in need of care and attention she removed oilskins and duffel coat you dont look very ill to me appearances appearances i feel very weak far be it from me to prescribe for myself but what i need is a tonic a restorative he stretched out a languid hand do you know whats in that wall cupboard there no her tone was severe i dont know i can guess though well i thought perhaps in the circumstances you understand those are captain bowens private supplies may i repeat what the captain told me mckinnon said as long as lieutenant ulbricht keeps navigating he can keep on broaching my supplies words to that effect i dont see him doing any navigating at the moment but very well a small one mckinnon poured and handed him a glass of scotch the expression on sister morrisons face was indication enough she and the bosun placed different interpretations on the word small come on george mckinnon said this is no place for us sister morrison looked faintly surprised you dont have to go we cant stand the sight of blood or suffering come to that ulbricht lowered his glass you would leave us to the mercy of flannelfoot george if you wait outside ill go and give trent a spell on the wheel when youre ready to go back sister youll know where to find me mckinnon would have expected that her ministrations might have taken ten minutes fifteen at the most instead almost forty minutes elapsed before she put in an appearance on the bridge mckinnon looked at her sympathetically more trouble than you expected sister he wasnt just joking when he said he felt pretty low theres very little the matter with him especially not with his tongue how that man can talk he wasnt talking to an empty bulkhead was he what do you mean well mckinnon said reasonably he wouldnt have kept on talking if you hadnt kept on listening sister morrison seemed to be in no hurry to depart she was silent for some time then said with a slight trace of a smile i find this well not infuriating but annoying most people would be interested in what we were saying i am interested im just not inquisitive if you wanted to tell me then youd tell me if i asked you to tell me and you didnt want to then you wouldnt tell me but fine id like you to tell me i dont know whether thats infuriating or not she paused why did you tell lieutenant ulbricht that im half german its not a secret is it no and youre not ashamed of it you told me so yourself so why ah why didnt i tell you that id told him thats what youre asking just never occurred to me you might at least have told me that he was half english that didnt occur to me either its unimportant i dont care what nationality a person is i told you about my brotherinlaw like the lieutenant hes a pilot hes also a lieutenant if he thought it his duty to drop a bomb on me hed do it like a shot but you couldnt meet a finer man youre a very forgiving man mr mckinnon forgiving he looked at her in surprise ive nothing to forgive i mean he hasnt dropped a bomb on me yet i didnt mean that even if he did it wouldnt make any difference how do you know i know mckinnon didnt pursue the matter doesnt sound like a very interesting conversation to me not forty minutes worth anyway he also took great pleasure in pointing out that hes more british than i am from the point of view of blood i mean fifty per cent british to start with plus two more british pints yesterday mckinnon was polite indeed all right so statistics arent interesting either he also says that his father knows mine ah that ts interesting wait a minute he mentioned that his father had been an attache at the german embassy in london he didnt mention whether he was a commercial or cultural attache or whatever he didnt just happen to mention to you that his father had been the naval attache there he was dont tell me that his old man is a captain in the german navy he is that makes you practically blood brothers or brother and sister mark my words sister mckinnon said solemnly i see the hand of fate here something preordained you might say pfui are they both on active service yes she sounded forlorn dont you find it funny that your respective parents should be prowling the high seas figuring out ways of doing each other in i dont find it at all funny i didnt mean funny in that sense if anyone had ever suggested to mckinnon that margaret morrison would one day strike him as a woebegone figure he would have questioned his sanity but not any longer he found her sudden dejection inexplicable not to worry lassie itll never happen he wasnt at all sure what he meant by that of course not her voice carried a total lack of conviction she made to speak hesitated looked down at the deck then slowly lifted her head her face was in shadow but he felt almost certain that he saw the sheen of tears i heard things about you today oh nothing to my credit im sure you cant believe a word anyone says these days what things sister i wish you wouldnt call me that the irritation was as unaccustomed as the dejection mckinnon raised a polite eyebrow sister but you are a sister not the way you make it sound sorry i didnt mean that you dont make it sound different from anyone else its like those cheap american films where the man with the gun goes around calling everyone sister he smiled i wouldnt like you to confuse me with a hoodlum miss morrison you know my name yes i also know that you started out to say something changed your mind and are trying to stall no yes well not really its difficult im not very good at those things i heard about your family this morning just before we came up im sorry i am terribly sorry janet yes its no secret it was a german bomber pilot who killed them she looked at him for a long moment then shook her head along comes another german bomber pilot again attacking innocent civilians and youre the first person to come to his defence dont go pinning any haloes or wings on me besides im not so sure thats a compliment what did you expect me to do lash out in revenge at an innocent man you dont be silly well no maybe i was silly to say it but you know very well what i mean i also heard petty officer mckinnon bem dsm and goodness knows what else was in a malta hospital with a broken back when he heard the news an italian air force bomber got your submarine you seem to have an affinity for enemy bombers janet didnt know that she smiled captain bowen and i have become quite friendly captain bowen mckinnon said without heat is a gossipy old woman captain bowen is a gossipy old woman mr kennet is a gossipy old woman mr patterson is a gossipy old woman mr jamieson is a gossipy old woman theyre all gossipy old women goodness me thats a very serious allegation sister sorry margaret gossipy old women speak in low voices or whispers whenever any two of them or three of them or indeed all four are together they speak in low voices or whispers you can feel the tension almost smell the fear well no thats the wrong word apprehension i should say why do they whisper maybe theyve got secrets i deserve better than that weve got saboteurs aboard i know that we all know that the whispers know that we all know that she gave him a long steady look i still deserve better than that dont you trust me i trust you were being hunted somebody aboard the san andreas has a transmitter radio that is sending out a continuous location signal the luftwaffe the uboats know exactly where we are somebody wants us somebody wants to take over the san andreas for long moments she looked at his eyes as if searching for an answer to a question she couldnt formulate mckinnon shook his head and said im sorry thats all i know you must believe me i do believe you who could be sending out this signal anybody my guess is that it is a member of our own crew could be a survivor from the argos could be any of the sick men we picked up in murmansk each idea is quite ridiculous but one has to be less ridiculous than the others which i have no idea why would anyone want us if i knew that id know the answer to a lot of things once again i have no idea how would they take us over submarine uboat no other way they have no surface ships and an aircraft is out of the question praying thats what your whispers are probably at praying praying that the snow will never end our only hope lies in concealment praying as the old divines used to say that we will not be abandoned by fortune and if we are then thats it youre not going to do anything she seemed more than faintly incredulous youre not even going to try to do anything it was quite some hours since mckinnon had made up his mind where his course of action would lie but it seemed hardly the time or the place to elaborate on his decision what on earth do you expect me to do send them to the bottom with a salvo of stale bread and old potatoes you forget this is a hospital ship sick wounded and all civilians surely theres something you can do there was a strange note in her voice one almost of desperation she went on bitterly the muchbemedalled petty officer mckinnon the muchbemedalled petty officer mckinnon he said mildly would live to fight another day fight them now her voice had a break in it fight them fight them fight them she buried her face in her hands mckinnon put his arm round her shaking shoulders and regarded her with total astonishment a man of almost infinite resource and more than capable of dealing with anything that came his way he was at an utter loss to account for her weird conduct he sought for words of comfort and consolation but as he didnt know what he was supposed to be comforting or consoling about he found none nor did repeating phrases like now now then seem to meet the case either so he finally contented himself with saying ill get trent up and take you below when they had arrived below after a particularly harrowing trip across the upper deck between superstructure and hospital they had to battle their way against the great wind and the driving blizzard he led her to the little lounge and went in search of janet magnusson when he found her he said i think youd better go and see your pal maggie shes very upset he raised a hand no janet not guilty i did not upset her she said accusingly but you were with her when she became upset shes disappointed with me thats all disappointed she wants me to commit suicide i dont see it her way she tapped her head one of you is touched i dont much doubt who it is mckinnon sat down on a stool by a mess table while she went into the lounge she emerged some five minutes later and sat down opposite him her face was troubled sorry archie not guilty and neither of you is touched shes got this ambivalent feeling towards the germans ambi what mixed up it doesnt help that her mother is german shes had rather a bad time a very rough time oh i know you have too but youre different of course im different i have no finer feelings oh do be quiet you werent to know in fact i think im the only person who does know about five months ago she lost both her only brother and her fiance both died over hamburg not in the same plane not even in the same raid but within weeks of each other oh jesus mckinnon shook his head slowly and was silent for some moments poor bloody kid explains a lot he rose crossed to dr singhs private source of supplies and returned with a glass the legendary mckinnon willpower you were with maggie when this happened janet yes you knew her before then of course weve been friends for years so you must have known those two boys she said nothing known them well i mean still she said nothing just sat there with her flaxen head bowed apparently gazing down at her clasped hands on the table as much in exasperation as anything mckinnon reached out took one of her wrists and shook it gently janet she looked up yes archie her eyes were bright with unshed tears oh dear oh dear mckinnon sighed you too again he shook his head again he remained silent for some time look janet those boys knew what they were doing they knew the risks they knew that if they could at all the german antiaircraft batteries and nightfighter pilots would shoot them down and so they did and so they had every right to do and i would remind you that those were no mere pinpoint raids it was saturation bombing and you know what that means so while you and maggie are crying for yourselves you might as well cry for the relatives of all the thousands of innocent dead that the raf left behind in hamburg you might as well cry for all mankind two tears trickled down her cheeks you mckinnon are a heartless fiend im all that he rose if anyone wants me ill be on the bridge noon came and went and as the day lengthened the wind strengthened until it reached the screaming intensity commonly found in the hurricanes and typhoons of the more tropical parts of the world by two oclock in the afternoon when the light which at best had never been more than a grey halflight was beginning to fade what little could be seen of the mountainous seas abeam and ahead of the san andreas the blizzard made it quite impossible to see anything abaft of the bridge were as white as the driving snow itself the shapeless troughs between the towering walls of water big enough to drown a suburban house or to the more apprehensive eye big enough to drown a suburban church including a fair part of its steeple the san andreas was in trouble at tons it was not a small vessel and the bosun had had engine revolutions reduced until the ship had barely steerage way on but still she was in trouble and the causes for this lay neither in the size of the ship nor the size of the seas for normally the san andreas could have ridden out the storm without much difficulty the two main reasons for concern lay elsewhere the first of these was ice a ship in a seaway can be said to be either stiff or tender if it is stiff it is resistant to roll and when it does roll recovers sharply when it is tender it rolls easily and recovers slowly and reluctantly tenderness arises when a vessel becomes topheavy raising the centre of gravity the prime cause of this is ice as the thickness of ice on the upper decks increases so does the degree of tenderness when the ice becomes sufficiently thick the vessel will fail to recover from its roll turn turtle and founder even splendidly seaworthy oceangoing trawlers specially built for arctic operations have succumbed to the stealthily insidious and deadly onslaught of ice and for aircraft carriers operating in the far north ice on their vast areas of open upper decks provided a constant threat to stability mckinnon was deeply worried by the accumulation of ice on the decks of the san andreas compacted snow from the blizzard had formed a certain thickness of ice but not much for apart from the area abaft of the superstructure most of the snow had simply been blown away by the powerful wind but for hours now according to the everchanging direction of the constantly shifting masses of water the san andreas had been shipping copious amounts of water and spray water and spray that turned to ice even before it hit the decks the vessel occasionally rode on an even keel but more and more frequently it lurched into a sudden roll and each time recovered from it more and more slowly the critical limit he was well aware was still some time away but without some amelioration in the conditions it would inevitably be reached there was nothing that could be done sledgehammers and crowbars would have had but a minimal effect and the chances were high that people wielding those would have ended up in very short order over the side on those lurching icerink decks footing would have been impossible to maintain for once mckinnon regretted that he was aboard an americanbuilt oilburning ship instead of a britishbuilt coalburning one boiler ashes spread on the deck would have given a reasonably secure footing and helped considerably towards melting the ice there was nothing that one could do with diesel oil of even more immediate worry was the superstructure except when on even keel the overstressed metal shaking and shuddering creaked and groaned its protesting torture and when it fell into the depths of a trough the entire structure shifted quite perceptibly at the highest point the bridge on which he was standing mckinnon estimated the lateral movement to be between four and six inches at a time it was an acutely uncomfortable sensation and a thoughtprovoking one how much of a drop and how acute an angle would be required before the shear factor came into operation and the superstructure parted company with the san andreas with this in mind mckinnon went below to see lieutenant ulbricht ulbricht who had lunched on sandwiches and scotch and slept a couple of hours thereafter was propped up in the captains bunk and was in a reasonably philosophical mood whoever named this ship the san andreas he said named it well you know of course that the san andreas is a famous or notorious earthquake fault he grabbed the side of his bunk as the ship fell into a trough and juddered in a most alarming fashion at the present moment i feel im living through an earthquake it was mr rennets idea mr kennet has at times a rather peculiar sense of humour a week ago this was still the ocean belle when we changed our paint from grey to the red cross colours of white green and red mr kennet thought we should change the name too this ship was built in richmond california richmond is on the haywards fault which is a branch of the san andreas he was of the opinion that san andreas was much more of a romantic name than haywards fault he also thought it was an amusing idea to name it after a potential disaster area mckinnon smiled i wonder if he still thinks it was an amusing idea well hes had plenty of time for reflection since i dropped those bombs on him yesterday morning i should rather think hes had second thoughts on the matter ulbricht tightened his grip on the side of his bunk as the san andreas fell heavily into another trough the weather does not improve mr mckinnon the weather does not improve thats what i came to talk about lieutenant force twelve wind with the darkness and the blizzard its as strong as ever visibility is absolutely zero not a chance of a starsight for hours i think youd be far better off in the hospital certainly not id have to fight my way against a hurricane not to say a blizzard to reach the hospital a man in my weakened condition not to be thought of its warmer down there lieutenant more comfortable and the motion naturally is much less dear me mr mckinnon how could you overlook the most important inducement all those pretty nurses no thank you i prefer the captains cabin not to mention the captains scotch the truth of the matter is of course that you suspect that the superstructure may go over the side at any moment and that you want me out of here before that happens isnt that so well mckinnon touched the outer bulkhead it is a bit unstable while you remain of course i have a job to do unthinkable the honour of the luftwaffe is at stake you stay i stay mckinnon didnt argue if anything he felt obscurely pleased by ulbrichts decision he tapped the barometer and lifted an eyebrow three millibars up up help is at hand theres hope yet take hours for the weather to moderate if it does superstructure could still go at any time even if it doesnt our only real hope lies with the snow and when the snow goes then your uboats come youre convinced of that yes arent you im afraid i am rather three hours later shortly after five oclock in the afternoon and quite some time before mckinnon had expected it the weather began to moderate almost imperceptibly at first then with increasing speed the wind speed dropped to a relatively benign force six the broken and confused seas of the early afternoon resolved themselves once again into a recognizable wave pattern the san andreas rode on a comparatively even keel the sheeted ice on the decks no longer offered a threat and the superstructure had quite ceased its creaking and groaning but best of all from mckinnons point of view the snow though driving much less horizontally than it had earlier on still fell as heavily as ever he was reasonably certain that when an attack did come it would come during the brief hours of daylight but was well aware that a determined uboat captain would not hesitate to press home an attack in moonlight in his experience most uboat captains were very determined indeed and there would be a moon later that night snow would avail them nothing in daytime but during the hours of darkness it was a virtual guarantee of safety he went to the captains cabin where he found lieutenant ulbricht smoking an expensive havana captain bowen a pipe man permitted himself one cigar a day and sipping an equally expensive malt both of which no doubt helped to contribute to his comparatively relaxed mood ah mr mckinnon this is more like it the weather i mean moderating by the minute still snowing heavily a mixed blessing i suppose no chance of starsights but at least it keeps your friends out of our hair friends yes i spend quite some time wondering who my friends are he waved a dismissive hand which was no easy thing to do with a glass of malt in one and a cigar in the other is sister morrison ill i shouldnt think so im supposed to be her patient one could almost term this savage neglect a man could easily bleed to death we cant have that mckinnon smiled ill get her for you he phoned the hospital and by the time he arrived there sister morrison was ready she said something wrong is he unwell he feels cruelly neglected and says something about bleeding to death he is in fact in good spirits smoking a cigar drinking malt whisky and appears to be in excellent health hes just bored or lonely or both and wants to talk to someone he can always talk to you when i said someone i didnt mean anyone i am not margaret morrison crafty those luftwaffe pilots he can always have you up for dereliction of duty he took her to the captains cabin told her to call him at the hospital when she was through took the crew lists from the captains desk left and went in search of jamieson together they spent almost half an hour going over the papers of every member of the deck and engineroom crews trying to recall every detail they knew of their past histories and what other members of the crew had said about any particular individual when they had finished consulting both the lists and their memories jamieson pushed away the lists leaned back in his chair and sighed what do you make of it bosun same as you do sir nothing i wouldnt even begin to know where to point the finger of suspicion not only are there no suitable candidates for the role of saboteur theres nobody whos even remotely likely i think wed both go into court and testify as character witnesses for the lot of them but if we accept lieutenant ulbrichts theory and you mr patterson naseby and i do accept it that it must have been one of the original crew that set off that charge in the ballast room when we were alongside that corvette then it must have been one of them or failing them one of the hospital staff the hospital staff jamieson shook his head the hospital staff sister morrison as a seagoing mata hari i have as much imagination as the next man bosun but not that kind of imagination neither have i wed both go to court for them too but it has to be someone who was aboard this ship when we left halifax when we retire mr jamieson i think wed better not be applying for a job with scotland yards cid then theres the possibility that whoever it is may be in cahoots with someone from the argos or one of the nine invalids we picked up in murmansk about all of whom we know absolutely nothing which is a great help as far as the crew of the argos is concerned thats true as for the invalids we have of course their names ranks and numbers one of the tb cases man by the name of hartley is an era engineroom artificer he would know about electrics another simons a mental breakdown case or an alleged mental breakdown case is an lto leading torpedo operator he would know about explosives too obvious bosun far too obvious maybe were meant to overlook the far too obvious have you seen those two spoken to them i mean yes i should imagine you also have theyre the two with the red hair ah those two bluff honest sailormen dont look like criminal types at all but then i suppose the best criminals never do look that way i mean he sighed i agree with you bosun the cid are in no danger from us no indeed mckinnon rose i think ill go and rescue sister morrison from lieutenant ulbrichts clutches sister morrison was not in the lieutenants clutches nor did she show any signs of wanting to be rescued time to go she said of course not just to let you know ill be on the bridge when you want me he looked at ulbricht then at sister morrison you managed to save him then compared to what it had been only a few hours previously the starboard wing of the bridge was now almost a haven of peace and quiet the wind had dropped to not more than force four and the seas while far from being a millpond had quietened to the extent that the san andreas rarely rolled more than a few degrees when it did at all that was on the credit side on the debit side was the fact that the snow had thinned to the extent that mckinnon had no difficulty in making out the arclit shape of the red cross on the foredeck reflecting palely under its sheathing of ice he went back inside the bridge and called up patterson in the engineroom bosun here sir snows lightening looks as if its going to stop altogether pretty soon id like permission to switch off all exterior lights seas are still too high for any uboat to see us from periscope depth but if its on the surface if the snow has stopped and we still have the red cross lights on we can be seen miles away from its conningtower we wouldnt want that would we no lights one other thing could you have some men clear a pathway sledges crowbars whatever in the ice between the hospital and the superstructure two feet should be wide enough consider it done fifteen minutes later still without any sign of margaret morrison the bosun moved out on the wing again the snow had stopped completely there were isolated patches of clear sky above and some stars shone although the pole star was hidden the darkness was still pretty complete mckinnon couldnt even see as far as the focsle with the deck lights extinguished he returned inside and went below to the captains cabin the snows stopped lieutenant and there are a few stars around not many and certainly not at the moment the pole but a few i dont know how long those conditions might last so i thought you might like to have a look now i assume that sister morrison has staunched the flow of blood there never was any flow of blood she said as you know perfectly well mr mckinnon yes sister she winced then smiled archie mckinnon winds dropped a lot mckinnon said he helped ulbricht on with outer clothing but those are just as necessary as they were before the temperature is still below zero fahrenheit sorry you dont use that its about twenty degrees below centigrade may his nurse come with him after all dr sinclair went with him last time of course wouldnt advise you to come on the wing bridge though mckinnon gathered up sextant and chronometer and accompanied them up to the bridge this time ulbricht made it unaided he went out on both wing bridges in turn and chose the starboard from which to make his observations it took him longer than it had on the previous occasion for he found it necessary to take more sights presumably because the pole star was hidden he came back inside worked on the chart for some time and finally looked up satisfactory in the circumstances very satisfactory not my navigation the course weve been holding no idea if weve been holding it all the time of course and that doesnt matter were south of the arctic circle now near enough north east course which seems to indicate that the winds backed only five degrees in the past twelve hours were fine as we are mr mckinnon keeping the sea and the wind to the stern should see us through the night and even if we do wander off course were not going to bump into anything this time tomorrow morning well lay off a more southerly course thank you very much lieutenant mckinnon said as the saying goes youve earned your supper incidentally ill have that sent up inside half an hour youve also earned a good nights sleep i wont be troubling you any more tonight havent i earned something else too it was mighty cold out there mr mckinnon im sure the captain would approve as he said so long as youre navigating he turned to the girl you coming below yes yes of course she must ulbricht said ive been most remiss most if remorse were gnawing it didnt show too much all your other patients all my other patients are fine sister maria is looking after them im off duty off duty that makes me feel even worse you should be resting my dear girl that or sleeping im wide awake thank you areyou coming below its no trouble now ships like a rock and youve just been told you wont be required any more tonight well now ulbricht paused judiciously on balance i think i should remain unforeseeable emergencies you understand luftwaffe officers shouldnt tell fibs of course i understand i understand that the only foreseeable emergency is that you run short of supplies and the only reason youre not coming below is that we dont serve malt whisky with ward dinners the lieutenant shook his head in sadness i am deeply wounded wounded she said they had returned to the hospital mess deck wounded i think he is mckinnon looked at her in speculative amusement and you too me oh really yes really youre hurt because you think he prefers scotch to your company isnt that so she made no reply if you believe that then youve got a very low opinion of both yourself and the lieutenant you were with him for about an hour tonight what did he drink in that time nothing her voice was quiet nothing hes not a drinker and hes a sensitive lad hes sensitive because hes an enemy because hes a captive a prisoner of war and of course hes sensitive above all because hes now got to live all his life with the knowledge that he killed fifteen innocent people you asked him if he was coming down he didnt want to be asked if he wanted to be persuaded even ordered it implies indifference and the way hes feeling it could be taken for a rejection so what happens the ward sister tells her feminine sympathy and intuition to take a holiday and delivers herself of some cutting remarks that margaret morrison would never have made a mistake but easy enough to put right how the question was a tacit admission that a mistake had indeed been made ninny you take his hand and say sorry or are you too proud too proud she seemed uncertain confused i dont know too proud because hes a german look i know about your fiance and brother and im terribly sorry but that doesnt janet shouldnt have told you dont be daft you didnt object to her telling you about my family and thats not all she sounded almost angry you said they went around killing thousands of innocent people and that those were not my words janet did not say that youre doing what you accused the lieutenant of doing fibbing also youre dodging the issue okay so the nasty germans killed two people you knew and loved i wonder how many thousands they killed before they were shot down but that doesnt matter really does it you never knew them or their names how can you weep over people youve never met husbands and wives sweethearts and children without faces or names its quite ridiculous isnt it and statistics are so boring tell me did your brother ever tell you how he felt when he went out in his lancaster bomber and slaughtered his mothers fellow countrymen but of course hed never met them so that made it all right didnt it she said in a whisper i think youre horrible you think im horrible janet thinks im a heartless fiend i think youre a pair of splendid hypocrites hypocrites you know dr jekyll and mr hyde the ward sister and margaret morrison janets just as bad at least i dont deal in double standards mckinnon made to leave but she caught him by the arm and indulged not for the first time in the rather disconcerting practice of examining each of his eyes in turn you didnt really mean that did you about janet and myself being hypocrites no you are devious all right all right ill make it right with him i knew you would margaret morrison not ward sister morrison you dont look like mrs hyde he paused when were you to have been married last september janet janet and your brother they were pretty friendly werent they yes she told you that no she didnt have to yes they were pretty friendly she was silent for a few moments it was to have been a double wedding oh hell mckinnon said and walked away he checked ail the scuttles in the hospital area even from the relatively low altitude of a submarine conningtower the light from an uncovered porthole can be seen for several miles went down to the engineroom spoke briefly to patterson returned to the messdeck had dinner then went into the wards janet magnusson in ward b watched his approach without enthusiasm so youve been at it again yes do you know what im talking about no i dont know and i dont care i suppose youre talking about your friend maggie and yourself of course im sorry for you both terribly sorry and maybe tomorrow or when we get to aberdeen ill break my heart for yesterday but not now janet now i have one or two more important things on my mind such as say getting to aberdeen archie she put a hand on his arm i wont even say sorry im just whistling in the dark dont you know that you clown i dont want to think about tomorrow she gave a shiver which could have been mock or not i feel funny ive been talking to maggie its going to happen tomorrow isnt it archie if by tomorrow you mean when daylight comes then yes could even be tonight if the moon breaks through maggie says it has to be a submarine so you said has to be how do you fancy being taken a prisoner i dont fancy it at all but you will be wont you i hope not how can you hope not maggie says youre going to surrender she didnt say so outright because she knows were friends we are friends mr mckinnon we are friends miss magnusson well she didnt say so but i think she thinks youre a bit of a coward really a very whats the word perspicacious a very perspicacious girl is our maggie shes not as perspicacious as i am you really think theres a chance well reach aberdeen theres a chance and after that aha clever clever janet magnusson if i havent got any plans for the future then i dont see any future isnt that it well i do see a future and i do have plans im going to take my first break since nineteen thirtynine and have a couple of weeks back home in the shetlands when were you last back home in the shetlands not for years will you come with me janet of course mckinnon went into ward a and passed up the aisle to where sister morrison was sitting at her table hows the captain well enough i suppose bit dull and quiet but why ask me ask him i have to ask the ward sisters permission to take him out of the ward take him out whatever for i want to talk to him you can talk to him here i can just see the nasty suspicious looks id be getting from you if we started whispering together and the nasty suspicious questions id be getting afterwards my dear margaret we have matters of state to discuss you dont trust me is that it thats the second time youve asked me that silly question same answer i do trust you totally i trust mr kennet there but there are five others i dont know whether to trust or not mckinnon took the captain from the ward and returned with him inside two minutes after shed tucked him back in bed margaret morrison said that must rank as the shortest state conference in history we are men of few words and thats the only communique ill be getting well thats the way highlevel diplomacy is conducted secrecy is the watchword as he entered ward b he was stopped by janet magnusson what was all that about then you and captain bowen i mean i have not had a private talk with the captain in order to tell all the patients in ward b about it i am under an oath of silence margaret morrison came in looked from one to the other then said well janet has he been more forthcoming with you than with me forthcoming under an oath of silence he claims his own oath i have no doubt no doubt what have you been doing to the captain doing ive been doing nothing saying then hes changed since he came back seems positively cheerful cheerful how can you tell with all those bandages you cant see a square inch of his face there are more ways than one of telling hes sitting up in bed rubbing his hands from time to time and twice hes said aha im not surprised it takes a special kind of talent to reach the hearts and minds of the ill and depressed its a gift some of us have it he looked at each in turn and some of us havent he left them looking at each other mckinnon was woken by trent at am the moons out bosun the moon as mckinnon bleakly appreciated when he arrived on the port wing of the bridge was very much out a threequarter moon and preternaturally bright or so it seemed to him at least half the sky was clear the visibility out over the now almost calm seas was remarkable so much so that he had no difficulty in picking out the line of the horizon and if he could see the horizon the bosun all too clearly realized then a submarine could pick them up ten miles away especially if the san andreas were silhouetted against the light of the moon mckinnon felt naked and very vulnerable he went below roused curran told him to take up lookout on the starboard wing of the bridge found naseby asked him to check that the falls and davits of the motor lifeboats were clear of ice and working freely and then returned to the port wing where every minute or two he swept the horizon with his binoculars but the sea between the san andreas and the horizon remained providentially empty the san andreas itself was a remarkable sight wholly covered in ice and snow it glittered and shone and sparkled in the bright moonlight except for a narrow central area abaft of the superstructure where wisping smoke from the shattered funnel had laid a brown smear all the way to the stern post the fore and aft derricks were huge glistening christmas trees festooned with thickribbed woolly halliards and stays and the anchor chains on the focsle had been transformed into great fluffy ropes of the softest cotton wool it was a strange and beautiful world with an almost magical quality about it ethereal almost but one had only to think of the lethal dangers that lay under the surrounding waters and the beauty and the magic ceased to exist an hour passed by and everything remained quiet and peaceful another hour came and went nothing untoward happened and mckinnon could scarcely believe their great good fortune and before the third uneventful hour was up the clouds had covered the moon and it had begun to snow again a gentle snowfall only but enough with the hidden moon to shroud them in blessed anonymity again telling ferguson who now had the watch to shake him if the snow stopped he went below in search of some more sleep it was nine oclock when he awoke it was an unusually late awakening for him but he wasnt unduly perturbed dawn was still an hour distant as he crossed the upper deck he noted that the conditions were just as they had been four hours previously moderate seas a wind no stronger than force three and still the same gently falling snow mckinnon had no belief in the second sight but he felt in his bones that this peace and calm would have gone before the morning was out down below he talked in turn with jones mcguigan stephen and johnny holbrook they had taken it in turn and in pairs to monitor the comings and goings of everybody in the hospital all four swore that nobody had stirred aboard during the night and that most certainly no one had at any time left the hospital area he had breakfast with dr singh dr sinclair patterson and jamieson dr singh he thought looked unusually tired and strained then went to ward b where he found janet magnusson she looked pale and there were shadows under her eyes mckinnon looked at her with concern whats wrong janet i couldnt sleep i didnt sleep a wink last night its all your fault of course its always my fault cardinal rule number one when anything goes wrong blame the bosun what am i supposed to have done this time you said the submarine the uboat would attack if the moon broke through i said it could not would same thing i spent most of the night looking out through the porthole no mr mckinnon i did not have my cabin light switched on and when the moon came out at about two oclock i was sure the attack must come any time and when the moon went i was sure it would come again moon uboat your fault a certain logic i must admit twisted logic of course but not more than one would expect of the feminine mind still im sorry but youre looking fine fresh relaxed and youre very late on the road this morning our trusty guardian sleeping on the job your trusty guardian lost a little sleep himself last night mckinnon said back shortly must see the captain it was sister maria not sister morrison who was in charge in a ward mckinnon spoke briefly with both the captain and first officer then said to bowen still sure sir more sure than ever archie whens dawn fifteen minutes i wish you well i think you better wish us all well he returned to ward b and said to janet wheres your pal visiting the sick shes with lieutenant ulbricht she shouldnt have gone alone she didnt you were asleep so your friend george naseby came for her mckinnon looked at her with suspicion you find something amusing thats her second time up there this morning is he dying or something i hardly think she would smile so much if a patient was slipping away ah mending fences you would say she called him karl twice she smiled id call that mending fences wouldnt you good lord karl that wellknown filthy nazi murderer well she said you asked her to make it right no you told her so now youll be taking all the credit i suppose credit where credit is due mckinnon said absently but she must come below at once its too exposed up there dawn her voice had gone very quiet this time youre sure archie this time im sure the uboat will come at dawn the uboat came at dawn seven it was little more than halflight when the uboat in broken camouflage paint of various shades of grey and at a distance of less than half a mile suddenly appeared from behind a passing snowsquall it was running fully on the surface with three figures clearly distinguishable on the conningtower and another three manning the deck gun just forard of that the submarine was on a course exactly paralleling that of the san andreas and could well have been for many hours the uboat was on their starboard hand so that the san andreas lay between it and the gradually lightening sky to the south both bridge wing doors were latched back in the fully open position mckinnon reached for the phone called the engineroom for full power nudged the wheel to starboard and began to edge imperceptibly closer to the uboat he and naseby were alone on the bridge they were in fact the only two people left in the superstructure because mckinnon had ordered everyone including a bitterly protesting lieutenant ulbricht to go below to the hospital only ten minutes previously naseby he required and for two reasons naseby unlike himself was an adept morse signaller and had a signalling lamp ready at hand more importantly mckinnon was more than reasonably certain that the bridge would be coming under attack in a very short space of time indeed and he wanted a competent helmsman to hand in case he himself were incapacitated keep out of sight george mckinnon said but try to keep an eye on them theyre bound to start sending any minute now they can see you naseby said maybe they can see my head and shoulders over the wing of the bridge maybe not it doesnt matter the point is that they will believe i cant see them dont forget that theyre in the dark quadrant of the sea and have no reason to think that were expecting trouble besides a helmsmans job is to keep an eye on the compass and look ahead no reason on earth why i should be scanning the seas around he felt the superstructure begin to shudder as patterson increased the engine revolutions gave the wheel another nudge to starboard picked up a tin mug from the shattered binnacle and pretended to drink from it its like a law of nature george nothing more reassuring than the sight of an unsuspecting innocent enjoying a morning cup of tea for a full minute which seemed like a large number of full minutes nothing happened the superstructure was beginning to vibrate quite strongly now and mckinnon knew that the san andreas was under maximum power they were now at least a hundred yards closer to the uboat than they had been when it had first been sighted but the uboat captain gave no indication that he was aware of this had mckinnon maintained his earlier speed his acute angling in towards the uboat would have caused him to drop slightly astern of the submarine but the increase in speed had enabled him to maintain his relative position the uboat captain had no cause to be suspicious and no one in his right mind was going to harbour suspicions about a harmless and defenceless hospital ship hes sending george mckinnon said i see him stop he says stop engines or i will sink you what do i send archie nothing mckinnon edged the san andreas another three degrees to starboard reached again for his tin mug and pretended to drink from it ignore him ignore him naseby sounded aggrieved you heard what the man said hes going to sink us hes lying he hasnt stalked us all this way just to send us to the bottom he wants us alive not only is he not going to torpedo us he cant not unless theyve invented torpedoes that can turn corners so how else is he going to stop us with that little itsybitsy gun hes got on the foredeck its not all that much bigger than a pompom i have to warn you archie the mans going to get very annoyed hes got nothing to be annoyed about we havent seen his signal naseby lowered his binoculars i also have to warn you that hes about to use that little itsybitsy gun sure he is the classic warning shot over the bows to attract our attention if he really wants to attract our attention it may be into the bows for all i know the two shells when they came entered the sea just yards ahead of the san andreas one disappearing silently below the waves the other exploding on impact the sound of the explosion and the sharp flat crack of the uboats gun made it impossible any longer to ignore the submarines existence show yourself george mckinnon said tell him to stop firing and ask him what he wants naseby moved out on the starboard wing and transmitted the message the reply came immediately he has a onetrack mind naseby said message reads stop or be sunk one of those laconic characters tell him were a hospital ship you think hes blind perhaps its still only halflight and the starboard side is our dark side maybe hell think that we think he cant see tell him were a neutral mention the geneva convention maybe hes got a better side to his nature naseby clacked out his message waited for the reply then turned gloomily to mckinnon he hasnt got a better side to his nature not many uboat captains have what does he say geneva conventions do not apply in the norwegian sea theres little decency left on the high seas these days lets try for his sense of patriotism tell him we have german survivors aboard while naseby sent the message mckinnon rang down for slow ahead naseby turned in the doorway and shook his head sadly his patriotism is on a par with his decency he says will check nationals when we board we commence firing in twenty seconds send no need to fire we are stopping check wake naseby sent the message then said well he got that all right hes already got his glasses trained on our stern you know i do believe hes angling in towards us very little mind you but its there i do believe youre right mckinnon gave the wheel another slight nudge to starboard if he notices anything hell probably think its because hes closing in on us and not vice versa is he still examining our wake yes turbulence aft must have died away quite a lot by this time that should make him happy hes lowered his glasses naseby said message coming the message didnt say whether the uboat captain was happy or not but it did hold a certain degree of satisfaction man says we are very wise naseby said also orders us to lower our gangway immediately acknowledge tell ferguson to start lowering the gangway immediately but to stop it about say eight feet above the water then tell curran and trent to swing out the lifeboat and lower it to the same height naseby relayed both messages then said you think were going to need the lifeboat i quite honestly have no idea but if we do were going to need it in a hurry he called the engineroom and asked for patterson chief bosun here were slowing a bit as you know but thats only for the moment the uboat is closing in on us were lowering both the gangway and the lifeboat the gangway on the uboats instructions the lifeboat on mine no they cant see the lifeboat its on our port side their blind side as soon as they are in position im going to ask for full power a request sir if i do have to use the boat id appreciate it if youd permit mr jamieson to come with me with your gun he listened for a few moments while the receiver crackled in his ear then said two things sir i want mr jamieson because apart from yourself and naseby hes the only member of the crew i can trust show him where the safetycatch is and no sir you know damn well you cant come along instead of mr jamieson youre the officer commanding and you cant leave the san andreas mckinnon replaced the receiver and naseby said plaintive reproach in his voice you might have asked me mckinnon looked at him coldly and whos going to steer this damned ship when im gone naseby sighed theres that of course theres that they seem to be preparing some kind of boarding party across there archie three more men on the conningtower now theyre armed with submachineguns or machinepistols or whatever you call those things something nasty anyway we didnt expect roses hows ferguson coming along if that gangway doesnt start moving soon the uboat captain is going to start getting suspicious worse hes going to start getting impatient i dont think so at least not yet awhile i can see ferguson so im certain the uboat captain can too fergusons having difficulty of some kind hes banging away at the lowering drum with a hammer icing trouble for a certainty see how the boats getting on will you naseby crossed the bridge moved out on to the port wing and was back in seconds its down about eight feet above the water as you asked he crossed to the starboard wing examining the uboat through his binoculars lowered them and turned back to mckinnon thats bloody funny all those characters seem to be wearing some kind of gasmasks gasmasks are you all right certainly im all right theyre all wearing a horseshoeshaped kind of lifejacket around their necks with a corrugated hose attached to the top theyre not wearing it at the moment its dangling down in front but theres a mouthpiece and goggles attached to the end of the tube when did german submariners start using gas they dont what good on earth would gas be to a uboat he took nasebys binoculars examined the uboat briefly and handed the glasses back tauchretter george tauchretter otherwise known as the drager lung its fitted with an oxygen cylinder and a carbon dioxide canister and its sole purpose is to help people escape from a sunken submarine no gas naseby sounded vaguely disappointed no gas that doesnt look like a sunken submarine to me some uboat commanders make their crews wear them all the time theyre submerged bit pointless in these waters i would have thought at least six hundred feet deep here maybe a thousand theres no way you can escape from those depths drager set or not hows ferguson coming along as far as i can tell hes not still hammering away no wait a minute wait a minute hes put the hammer down and is trying the release lever its moving archie its coming down ah mckinnon rang for full power some seconds passed then naseby said half way a similar length of time elapsed then naseby said in the same matteroffact voice its down archie eight feet give or take fergusons secured it mckinnon nodded and spun the wheel to starboard until he had maximum rudder on slowly ponderously at first then with increasing speed the san andreas began to come round do you want to get your head blown off george well no naseby stepped inside closed the wing door behind him and peered out through the little window in the door the san andreas no longer riding with the sea was beginning to corkscrew although only gently so but the entire superstructure was beginning to vibrate in a rather alarming fashion as the engines built up to maximum power and dont you think you ought to lie down in a minute archie in a minute do you think theyve gone to sleep aboard that uboat some trouble with their eyes thats for sure i think theyre rubbing them and not believing what theyre seeing except that there was no actual eyerubbing going on aboard the uboat mckinnons guess was very close to the mark the reactions of both the submarine commander and his crew were extraordinarily slow extraordinarily but in the circumstances understandably the uboats crew had made both the forgivable and unforgivable mistake of relaxing of lowering their guard at the precise moment when their alertness and sense of danger should have been honed to its keenest edge but the sight of the gangway being lowered in strict compliance with their orders must have convinced them that there was no thought or possibility of any resistance being offered and that the taking over of the san andreas was no more than a token formality besides no one in the history of warfare had ever heard of a hospital ship being used as an offensive weapon it was unthinkable it takes time to rethink the unthinkable the saw andreas was so far round now that the uboat was no more than є off the starboard bow naseby moved from the starboard wing door to the nearest small window let into the front of the bridge theyre lining up what it pleases you t call that little itsybitsy gun archie then maybe wed both better be getting down no theyre not lining up on the bridge theyre lining up on the hull aft i dont know what they intend to he broke off and shouted no no get down get down and flung himself at mckinnon bringing both men crashing heavily to the deck of the bridge even as they landed hundreds of bullets to the accompaniment of the staccato chattering of several machineguns smashed into the fore end and starboard side of the bridge none of the bullets succeeded in penetrating the metal but all four windows were smashed the fusillade lasted no more than three seconds and had no sooner ceased when the uboats deck gun fired three times in rapid succession on each occasion causing the san andreas to shudder as the shells exploded somewhere in the after hull mckinnon hauled himself to his feet and took the wheel if id been standing there id have been very much the late archie mckinnon ill thank you tomorrow he looked at the central window before him it was holed cracked starred abraded and completely opaque george but naseby needed no telling fireextinguisher in hand he smashed away the entire window in just two blows he hitched a cautious eye over the bottom of where the window had been saw that the san andreas was narrowing in on the bows of the uboat then abruptly straightened in the instinctive reaction of a man who realises that all danger is past conningtowers empty archie theyve all gone bloody funny isnt it nothing funny about it the bosuns tone was dry if he was in any way moved or shaken by the narrowness of his recent escape he showed no signs of it its customary george to go below and pull down the hatch after you when youre going to dive in this case crash dive crash dive captain has no option he knows he hasnt the firepower to stop us and he cant possibly bring his torpedoes to bear right now hes blowing all main ballast see those bubbles thats water being blown from the ballast tanks by high pressure air something like three thousand pounds per square inch but but hes left his gun crew on deck indeed he has again no option a uboat is much more valuable than the lives of three men see those valves theyre twisting on the righthand side of their suits oxygen valves theyre turning their drager lungs into life jackets much good it will do them if they run into a propeller will you go out on the wings george and see if theres any flame or smoke aft you could phone mckinnon pointed to the phone in front of the wheel a phone that had been shattered by a machine gun bullet naseby nodded and went out on both wings in turn nothing nothing you can see from the outside he looked ahead towards the uboat not much more than a hundred yards distant shes going down archie fore and aft decks are awash i can see that and shes turning away to her starboard i can see that too counsel of desperation hes hoping that if he can turn his sub at an acute enough angle to us hell be struck only a glancing blow a glancing blow he could survive i think hulls submerged now is he going to make it hes left it too late mckinnon rang down for full astern and eased the wheel slightly to port five seconds later with the top of the conning tower barely awash the forefoot of the san andreas tore into the hull of the uboat some thirty feet forard of the conning tower the san andreas juddered throughout its length but the overall effect of the impact was curiously small for a period of not more than three seconds they felt rather than heard the sensation of steel grinding over steel then all contact was abruptly lost well naseby said so thats how its done is it he paused theres going to be a lot of jagged metal on that uboat if a prop hits that no chance the uboats been driven down deep down and theyll still be blowing main ballast lets just hope we havent damaged ourselves too badly you said the uboat captain had no option we didnt either you think therell be any survivors i dont know if there are any well find out soon enough i question very much whether they would even have had time to close watertight doors if they didnt then that uboat is on its way to the bottom if anyone is going to escape theyre going to have to do it before it reaches the twohundred andfiftyfoot mark ive never heard of anyone escaping from a submarine at a depth greater than that theyd have to use the conningtower i suppose there is a forard escape hatch its really an access hatch to the deck gun but the chances are high that the fore part of the uboat is completely flooded so thats useless there may be an after escape hatch i dont know the conningtower is probably their best bet or would have been if we hadnt rammed their vessel we didnt hit anywhere near the conningtower we didnt have to the compressive power of something like ten thousand tons dead weight has to be pretty fierce the conningtower hatch may have been jammed solid whether it would be possible to ease it or not i wouldnt know worse still it may have sprung open and with a hundred gallons of water a second pouring down into the control room there is no way anyone is going to get out theyd probably be battered unconscious in the first few seconds im going down on deck now keep going round to starboard and keep her astern till you stop then heave to ill take the motorboat out as soon as youve lost enough way whats the point in taking the boat out if there are going to be no survivors mckinnon led him out on to the port wing and astern to where three men were floundering about in the water those three characters the gun crew as far as i could tell they were only wearing overalls and oilskins maybe the odd jersey or two but that would make no difference leave them out there another ten fifteen minutes and theyll just freeze to death let them those three bastards hit us aft three times for all we can tell some of those shells may have exploded inside the hospital i know george i know but i dare say theres something in the geneva convention about it mckinnon clapped him lightly on the shoulder and went below just outside the deck entrance to the hospital mckinnon found half a dozen people waiting for him patterson jamieson curran trent mccrimmon and stephen patterson said i believe weve been in some sort of collision bosun yes sir uboat and mckinnon pointed downwards i just hope we dont go the same way forard watertight bulkheads sir of course at once he looked at mccrimmon and stephen who left without a word and next bosun we were hit three times aft sir any damage in the hospital some all three hit the hospital area one appears to have exploded when it passed through the bulkhead between a and b wards some injuries no fatalities dr sinclair is attending to them not dr singh he was in the recovery room with the two injured seamen from the argos doors jammed and we cant get inside shell explode in there nobody seems to know nobody seems but thats the next compartment to a ward are they all deaf in there they were it was the first shell that exploded between the two wards that deafened them all right ah well the recovery room will just have to wait what happened to the third shell didnt explode where is it in the dining area rolling about quite a bit rolling about quite a bit mckinnon repeated slowly thats handy just because it didnt go off on impact he broke off and said to curran a couple of heaving lines in the motorboat dont forget your knives he went inside and reappeared within twenty seconds carrying a very small very innocuouslooking shell threw it over the side and said to jamieson you have your gun sir i have my gun what do you want the heaving lines for bosun same reason as your gun sir to discourage people tie them up if we have to if there are any survivors theyre not going to feel very kindly disposed because of what weve done to their boat and their shipmates but those people arent armed theyre submariners dont you believe it sir many officers carry hand guns petty officers too for all i know even if they had guns what could they do take us hostage thats what they could do and if they could take us hostage they could still take over the ship jamieson said almost admiringly you dont trust many people do you some i just dont believe in taking chances the motorboat was less than fifty yards away from the spot where the uboats gun crew were still floundering about in the water when jamieson touched mckinnon on the arm and pointed out over the starboard side bubbles lots of little bubbles i see them could be theres someone coming up i thought they always came up in a great big air bubble never big air bubble when they leave the submarine perhaps but that collapses at once mckinnon eased back on the throttle as he approached the group in the water someones just broken the surface jamieson said no by god two of them yes theyve got inflatable life jackets on theyll keep mckinnon stopped the engines and waited while curran trent and jamieson literally hauled the gun crew aboard they seemed incapable of helping themselves the trio were young hardly more than boys teeth chattering shivering violently and trying hard not to look terrified we search this lot jamieson said tie them up good lord no look at their hands theyre blue and frozen stiff if they couldnt even hang on to the gunwale and they couldnt how could they press the trigger of a gun even if they could unbutton their oilskins which they cant mckinnon opened the throttle and headed for the two men who had surfaced from the submarine as he did a third figure bobbed to the surface some two hundred yards beyond the two men they hauled aboard seemed well enough one of them was a darkhaired darkeyed man in his late twenties his face was lean intelligent and watchful the other was very young very blond and very apprehensive mckinnon addressed the older man in german what is your name and rank obersteuermann doenitz doenitz very appropriate admiral doenitz was the brilliant cinc of the german submarine fleet do you have a gun doenitz if you say you havent and i find one i shall have to shoot you because you are not to be trusted do you have a gun doenitz shrugged reached under his blouse and produced a rubberwrapped pistol your friend here young hans is an assistant cook doenitz spoke in fluent english he sighed hans is not to be trusted with a fryingpan far less a gun mckinnon believed him and headed for the third survivor as they approached mckinnon could see that the man was at least unconscious for his neck was bent forward and he was face down in the water the reason for this was not far to seek his drager apparatus was only partially inflated and the excess oxygen had gone to the highest point of the bag at the back of the neck forcing his head down mckinnon drew alongside caught the man by his life jacket put his hand under his chin and lifted the head from the water he studied the face for only a second or two then said to doenitz you know him of course heissmann our first lieutenant mckinnon let the face fall back into the water doenitz looked at him with a mixture of astonishment and anger arent you going to bring him aboard he may just be unconscious just halfdrowned perhaps your first lieutenant is dead mckinnons voice carried total conviction his mouth is full of blood ruptured lungs he forgot to breathe out oxygen on the way up doenitz nodded perhaps he didnt know that he had to do that i didnt know im afraid we dont have much time for escape training these days he looked curiously at mckinnon how did you know youre not a submariner i was twelve years curran called from the bows theres one more bosun just surfaced dead ahead mckinnon had the motorboat alongside the struggling man in less than a minute and had him brought aboard and laid on the thwarts he lay there in a peculiar position knees against his chest his hands hugging both knees and trying to roll from side to side he was obviously in considerable pain mckinnon forced open the mouth glanced briefly inside then gently closed it again well this man knew enough to exhale oxygen on the way up he looked at doenitz you know this man of course of course oberleutnant klaussen your captain doenitz nodded well hes obviously in considerable pain but i wouldnt think hes in any danger you can see hes been cut on the forehead possibly banged his head on the escape hatch on the way out but thats not enough to account for his condition for he must have been conscious all the way up or he wouldnt have got rid of the oxygen in his lungs were you travelling underwater or on the surface during the night on the surface all the time that rules out carbon dioxide which can be poisonous but you cant build up carbon dioxide when the conningtower is open from the way hes holding his chest and legs it would seem to be caisson disease for thats where the effects hurt most but it cant be that either caisson disease divers bends when theres too rapid a buildup of nitrogen bubbles in the blood when youre making a very fast ascent mckinnon with the motor boat under full throttle was heading directly for the san andreas which was stopped in the water at not much more than half a miles distance but for that you have to be breathing in a high pressure atmosphere for quite some time and your captain certainly wasnt below long enough for that perhaps he escaped from a very great depth perhaps a greater depth than anyone has ever escaped from a submarine and then i wouldnt know what the effects might be we have a doctor aboard i dont suppose hell know either the average doctor can spend a lifetime and not come across a case like this but at least he can stop the pain the motor boat passed close by the bows of the san andreas which remarkably appeared to be quite undamaged but that damage had been done was unquestionable the san andreas was at least three feet down by the head which was no more than was to be expected if the forard compartments had been flooded as inevitably they must have been mckinnon secured alongside and halfhelped halfcarried the semiconscious uboat captain to the head of the gangway patterson was waiting for him there as was dr sinclair and three other members of the engineroom staff this is the uboat captain mckinnon said to dr sinclair he may be suffering from the bends you know nitrogen poisoning alas bosun we have no decompression chamber aboard i know sir he may just be suffering from the effects of having surfaced from a great depth i dont know all i know is hes suffering pretty badly the rest are well enough all they need is dry clothing he turned to jamieson who had just joined him on deck perhaps sir you would be kind enough to supervise their change of clothing you mean to make sure that theyre not carrying anything they shouldnt be carrying mckinnon smiled and turned to patterson how are the forard watertight bulkheads sir holding ive had a look myself bent and buckled but holding with your permission sir ill get a diving suit and have a look now couldnt that wait a bit im afraid waiting is the one thing we cant afford we can be reasonably certain that the uboat was in contact with trondheim right up to the moment that he signalled us to stop i think it would be very silly of us to assume otherwise flannelfoot is still with us the germans know exactly where we are till now for reasons best known to themselves they have been treating us with kid gloves maybe now theyll be feeling like taking those gloves off i shouldnt imagine that admiral doenitz will take too kindly to the idea of one of his uboats having been sunk by a hospital ship i think it behoves us sir to get out of here and with all speed trouble is weve got to make up our minds whether to go full speed ahead or full speed astern ah yes i see you have a point yes sir if the hole in our bows is big enough then if we make any speed at all i dont see the watertight bulkheads standing up to the pressure for very long in that case wed have to go astern i dont much fancy that it not only slows us down but it makes steering damn difficult but it can be done i knew of a tanker that hit a german uboat about seven hundred miles from its port of destination it made it going astern all the way but i dont much care for the idea of going stern first all the way to aberdeen especially if the weather breaks up you make me feel downright nervous bosun with all speed bosun as you say with all speed how long will this take just as long as it takes me to collect a rubber suit mask and torch then get there and back again at the most twenty minutes mckinnon was back in fifteen minutes mask in one hand torch in the other he climbed up the gangway to where patterson was awaiting him at the top we can go ahead sir mckinnon said full ahead i should think good good good damage relatively slight i take it how small is the hole its not a small hole its a bloody great hole big as a barn door theres a ragged piece of that uboat about eight foot by six embedded in our bows seems to be forming a pretty secure plug and i should imagine that the faster we go the more securely it will be lodged and if we stop or have to go astern or run into heavy weather i mean what if the plug falls off td be glad sir if you didnt talk about such things eight and what are you doing there mckinnon looked down on the recumbent form of janet magnusson who her face very pale was lying on not in the bed nearest the desk where she normally sat i normally have a rest at this time of the morning she tried to inject an acid tone into her voice but her heart wasnt in it and she smiled albeit wanly i have been badly wounded archie mckinnon thanks to you oh dear mckinnon sat on her bedside and put his hand on her shoulder i am sorry how not there she pushed his hand away thats where ive been wounded sorry again he looked up at dr sinclair how bad is badly nurse magnusson has a very slight graze on her right shoulder piece of shrapnel sinclair pointed to a jagged hole in the bulkhead about six feet above deck level then indicated the scarred and pockmarked deckhead thats where the rest of the shrapnel appears to have gone but nurse magnusson was standing at the time and caught quite a bit of the blast effect she was thrown across the bed shes on now it was providentially empty at the tune and it took us ten minutes to bring her round shock thats all layabout mckinnon stood ill be back anybody else hurt here doctor two at the far end of the ward seamen from the argos one in the chest the other in the leg shrapnel ricocheting from the ceiling and pretty spent shrapnel at that didnt even have to dig it out not even bandages cotton wool and plaster mckinnon looked at the man restless and muttering inthe bed opposite oberleutnant klaussen the uboat commander how is he delirious as you can see the trouble with him ive no idea i tend to go along with your suggestion that he must have come up from a very great depth if thats the case im dealing with the unknown sorry and all that i hardly think theres any need to be sorry sir every other doctor would be in the same boat i dont think anyone has ever escaped from a depth greater than two hundred and fifty feet before if klaussen did well its uncharted territory there simply cant be any literature on it archie mckinnon turned round janet magnusson was propped up on an elbow youre supposed to be resting im getting up what are you doing with that sledgehammer and chisel in your hand im going to try to open a jammed door i see she was silent for some moments while she bit her lower lip the recovery room isnt it yes dr singh and the two men from the argos the one with the multiple burns and the other with the fractured pelvis theyre in there arent they so im told well why dont you go to them she sounded almost angry why stand around here blethering and doing nothing i hardly think thats quite fair nurse magnusson jamieson who was accompanying mckinnon and sinclair spoke in tones of gentle reproof doing nothing the bosun does more than the whole lot of us put together im thinking perhaps theres no great hurry janet mckinnon said people have been banging on that door for the past fifteen minutes and theres been no reply could mean anything or nothing point is there was no point in trying to force that door till there was a doctor at hand and dr sinclair has just finished in the wards what you mean what you really mean archie is that you dont think the people inside the recovery room will be requiring the services of a doctor i hope im wrong but yes thats what im afraid of she sank back in her bed as mr jamieson didnt say i was talking out of turn im sorry theres really nothing to be sorry about mckinnon turned away and went into ward a the first person to catch his attention was margaret morrison even paler than janet magnusson had been she was sitting in her chair behind her desk while sister maria carefully tied a bandage around her head mckinnon didnt immediately go to her but went to the far righthand side of the ward where lieutenant ulbricht was sitting up in his bed while bowen and kennet lay flat in theirs three more victims sinclair said well unfortunates i should say while the blast in ward b went upwards im afraid it was slightly downwards here mckinnon looked at ulbricht whats the matter with you ulbricht had a thick bandage round his neck ill tell you whats the matter with him sinclair said luck the devils own luck a piece of shrapnel it must have been as sharp as a razor sliced through the side of his neck another quarterinch to the right and it would have sliced through the carotid artery as well and then hed have been very much the late lieutenant ulbricht ulbricht looked at mckinnon with little in the way of expression on his face i thought you sent us down here for our own safety thats what i thought too i was certain theyd concentrate their fire on the bridge im making no excuses but i dont think i miscalculated i think the uboats gun crew panicked im sure that klaussen gave no instructions to fire into the hull klaussen oberleutnant the captain he survived he seems fairly ill how many survivors altogether six and the rest you sent to the bottom im the guilty party if thats what you mean i dont feel particularly guilty but im responsible yes i suppose that makes two of us responsible but not guilty ulbricht shrugged and seemed disinclined to continue the conversation mckinnon moved to the captains bed sorry to hear youve been hurt again sir me and kennet left thighs both of us dr sinclair tells me its only a scratch and as i cant see it i have to take his word for it doesnt feel like a scratch i can tell you well archie my boy youve done it i knew you would if it werent for those damned bandages id shake hands with you congratulations you must feel pretty good about this i dont feel good at all sir if there were any survivors and if they managed to find a sealed compartment theyll be gasping out their lives now on the floor of the norwegian sea theres that of course theres that but not to reproach yourself archie them or us unpleasant but still well done bowen adroitly switched the subject building up speed arent we limited damage up front i take it far from limited sir were badly holed but theres a large chunk of the uboats casing embedded in that hole lets just hope it stays there we can but pray bosua we can but pray and regardless of how you feel every person aboard this boat is deeply in your debt ill see you later sir he turned away looked at margaret morrison then at dr sinclair is she hurt badly i mean shes the worst of the lot but nothing dangerous you understand she was sitting by captain bowens bedside at the time and was hit twice nasty gash on the upper right arm and a minor scalp wound thats the one sister maria has just finished bandaging shouldnt she be in bed yes i tried to insist on it but i can tell you i wont be doing it again how about you trying no thank you mckinnon approached the girl who looked at him with reproachful brown eyes that were slightly dulled with pain this is all your fault archie mckinnon mckinnon sighed exactly what janet said to me its difficult to please everybody im very very sorry and so you should be not for this though the physical pain i can tell you is nothing compared to the mental hurt you deceived me our greatly respected bosun is exactly what he accused me of being a fibber oh dear longsuffering bosun back in court again what am i supposed to have done wrong now not only that but youve made me feel very very foolish i have i would never do that you did remember on the bridge you suggested in jest of course that you might fight the uboat with a fusillade of stale bread and old potatoes well something like that ah yes ah remember that emotional scene on the bridge well emotional on my part i cringe when i think about it when i begged you to fight them and fight them and fight them you remember dont you yes i think i do he thinks he does you had already made up your mind to fight them hadnt you well yes well yes she mimicked you had already made up your mind to ram that uboat yes why didnt you tell me archie because you might have casually mentioned it to somebody who might have casually mentioned it unknowingly of course to flannelfoot who would far from casually have mentioned it to the uboat captain who would have made damn certain that he would never put himself in a position where he could be rammed you might even again unknowingly have mentioned it directly to flannelfoot she made no attempt to conceal the hurt in her eyes so you dont trust me you said you did i trust you absolutely i did say that then why it was one of those then andnow things then you were sister morrison i didnt know there was a margaret morrison i know now ah she pursed her lips then smiled clearly mollified i see mckinnon left her joined dr sinclair and jamieson and together they went to the door of the recovery room jamieson was carrying with him an electric drill a hammer and some tapered wooden pegs jamieson said you saw the entry hole made by the shell when you went up to examine the bows yes just on well an inch or two above the waterline could be water inside or not its impossible to say how high up eighteen inches say anybodys guess jamieson plugged in his drill and pressed the trigger the tungsten carbide bit sank easily into the heavy steel of the door sinclair said what happens if theres water behind tap in one of those wooden pegs then try higher up through jamieson said he withdrew the bit clear mckinnon struck the steel handle twice with the sledge the handle did not even budge a fraction of an inch on the third blow it sheared off and fell to the deck pity mckinnon said but we have to find out jamieson shrugged no option torch please jamieson left and was back in two minutes with the torch followed by mccrimmon carrying the gas cylinder and a lamp on the end of a wandering lead jamieson lit the oxyacetylene flame and began to carve a semicircle round the space where the handle had been mccrimmon plugged in the wandering lead and the wirecaged lamp burned brightly jamieson said from behind his plastic faceshield were only assuming that this is where the door is jammed if were wrong well cut away round the hinges i dont think well have to the door isnt buckled in any way its nearly always the lock or latch thats jammed the compartment was filled with stinging acrid smoke when jamieson finally straightened he gave the lock a couple of blows with the side of his fist then desisted im sure ive cut through but the damn thing doesnt seem to want to fall away the latch is still in its socket mckinnon tapped the door with his sledge not heavily and the semicircular piece of metal fell away inside he hit the door again heavily this time and it gave an inch with a second blow it gave several more inches he laid aside the sledge and pushed against the door until squeaking and protesting it was almost wide open he took the wandering lead from mccrimmon and went inside there was water on the deck not much perhaps two inches bulkheads and deckhead had been heavily starred and pockmarked by shrapnel from the exploding shell the entrance hole formed by the shell in the outer bulkhead was a jagged circle not more than a foot above the deck the two men from the argos were still lying in their beds while dr singh head bowed to his chest was sitting in a small armchair all three men seemed unharmed unmarked the bosun brought the light closer to dr singhs face whatever shrapnel may have been embedded in his body none had touched his face the only sign of anything untoward were tiny trickles of blood from his ears and nose mckinnon handed the lamp to dr sinclair who stooped over his dead colleague good god dr singh he examined him for a few seconds then straightened that this should happen to a fine doctor a fine man like this you didnt really expect to find anything else did you doctor no not really had to be this or something like this he examined briefly the two men lying in their beds shook his head and turned away still comes as a bit of a shock it was obvious that he was referring to dr singh mckinnon nodded i know i dont want to sound callous doctor i know it might sound that way but you wont be needing those men any more i mean no postmortems nothing of that kind good lord no death must have been instantaneous concussion if its any consolation they died without knowing he paused you might look through their clothing bosun or maybe its in their effects or perhaps captain andropolous has the details you mean names birthdates things like that sir yes i have to fill out the death certificates ill attend to that thank you bosun sinclair essayed a smile but it could hardly have been rated as a success as usual ill leave the grisly part to you with that he was gone a man glad to be gone the bosun turned to jamieson could i borrow mccrimmon sir of course mccrimmon go and find curran and trent will you tell them whats happened curran will know what size of canvases to bring needles and thread bosun curran is a sailmaker just leave it to him and you could tell him that its a clean job this time mccrimmon left and jamieson said a clean job its a lousy job you always get the dirty end of the stick mckinnon i honestly dont know how you keep on doing it if theres anything nasty or unpleasant to be done youre number one on everybodys list not this time im not this time sir youre number one on my list someone has to tell the captain someone has to tell mr patterson worst of all much the worst of all someone has to tell the nursing staff that last is not a job id care for at all the girls god i hadnt thought of that i dont care for it either dont you think bosun seeing you know them so well i mean no i dont think sir mckinnon half smiled surely as an officer you wouldnt think of delegating to an underling something you wouldnt do yourself underling god thats rich very well never let it be said that i shirked my duty but as from now i feel one degree less sorry for you yes sir one other thing when this place is clear wouldyou have a couple of your men weld a patch over this hole in the bulkhead heaven knows theyve had enough practice in welding patches recently of course just lets hope its the last patch jamieson left and mckinnon looked idly around him his attention was caught by a fairly large wooden box in one corner and that only because its lid had been slightly sprung by the shock of the explosion mckinnon not without some effort lifted the lid and peered for some seconds at the contents he replaced the lid retrieved his sledge and tapped the lid securely back into place stamped on the lid in big red letters were the words cardiac arrest mckinnon rather wearily sat down at the table in the dining area the injured sister and nurse both looking as if they should have been in bed they had been relieved by sister maria and nurse irene were sitting there as was inevitably lieutenant ulbricht who not only gave the impression of having completely forgotten his narrow brush with death but was sufficiently back on balance to have found himself a seat between the two girls sinclair patterson and jamieson were clustered round one end of the table mckinnon looked consideringly at ulbricht then addressed himself to dr sinclair not calling your professional competence into question sir but is the lieutenant fit to be up and around my professional competence is irrelevant one could see that dr sinclair had not yet recovered from the shock of the death of his colleague the lieutenant like sister morrison and nurse magnusson is uncooperative intransigent and downright disobedient the three of them would probably call it having minds of their own lieutenant ulbricht as it so happens is in no danger the injury to his neck couldnt even be described as a flesh wound torn skin more like then perhaps lieutenant you would be prepared to take another fix we havent had one since last night at your disposal bosun if the lieutenant harboured any ill will towards the bosun for the deaths of his fellow countrymen he was at pains to conceal it any time i suggest just on noon patterson said you finished through in the recovery room bosun mckinnon nodded well one gets tired of keeping on saying thankyou so ill spare you that when do we bury them your decision sir early afternoon before it starts to get dark patterson laughed without humour my decision chief engineer patterson is your man when it comes to making decisions on matters that are of no importance i dont recall making the decision to attack that submarine i did consult with captain bowen sir ah it was margaret morrison so that was what that twominute conference was about of course he approved janet said and if he hadnt would you still have rammed that uboat mckinnon said patiently he not only approved he was enthusiastic very enthusiastic with all respect to lieutenant ulbricht here the captain wasnt feeling too kindly disposed towards the germans not at that moment of time anyway youre being evasive archie mckinnon answer my question if he had disapproved would you still have attacked yes no need to mention that to the captain though nurse magnusson patterson smiled at janet to rob his words of any offence i hardly think mr mckinnon deserves either interrogation or disapproval i think he deserves congratulations for a magnificent job well done he rose went to the cupboard where dr singh had kept his private supplies and returned with a bottle of scotch and some glasses poured a measure for mckinnon and set it before him i think dr singh would have approved of this thank you sir mckinnon looked down at the glass on the table he wont be needing this any more there was silence round the table predictably it was broken by janet i think archie that that was less than a gracious remark you think so now maybe maybe not there was no hint of apology in his voice he raised his glass and sipped from it knew his scotch did dr singh the silence was longer this time longer and strained it was sinclair embarrassed by the silence who broke it im sure we all echo mr pattersons sentiments mr mckinnon a splendid job but to quote yourself im not questioning your professional competence you did take a bit of a chance didnt you you mean i endangered the lives of all aboard i didnt say that his look of discomfiture made it evident that he had thought it if not said it it was a calculated risk mckinnon said but not all that calculated the odds were on my side quite heavily i believe i am quite certain that the uboat was under orders that we were to be seized not sunk which is why i am equally certain that the gun crew fired into the san andreas without orders the uboat captain oberleutnant klaussen was the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time he was tired or immature or inexperienced or incompetent or overconfident he may have been all those things at the same time what is certain is that an experienced uboat commander would never have put himself in a position where he was running parallel to us and less than a half a mile away he should have stayed at a couple of miles distance which in an emergency would have given him plenty of time to crash dive ordered us to send across a boat loaded it up with a halfdozen men with machine pistols and sent them back to take over the san andreas we could have done nothing to stop them even better he should have closed up from astern a position that would have made ramming impossible then eased up alongside the gangway and of course he was too confident too sure of himself too relaxed by half when he saw us lowering the gangway he was convinced the game was over it never even occurred to him that a hospital ship could be used as a manowar and he was either so blind or so stupid that he never even noticed that we were steadily closing in on him all the time we were in contact in short he made every mistake in the book it would have been difficult to pick a worse man for the job there was a long and rather uncomfortable silence mario unobtrusive and efficient as ever had filled all the glasses on the table but no one with the exception of the bosun had as yet touched theirs sinclair said on the basis of what you say the uboat captain was indeed the wrong man for the job and of course you wholly outmanoeuvred him but surely the danger still existed in the actual collision i mean the uboat could have sunk us and not vice versa we are only made of thin sheet plating the hull of the submarine is immensely strong i would not presume to lecture you on medical matters dr sinclair sinclair smiled meaning i should not presume to advise you on matters maritime but mr mckinnon youre a bosun on a merchant vessel today yes before that i spent twelve years in the submarine service oh no sinclair shook his head too much just too much this is definitely not dr sinclairs day ive known a good number of cases of collisions between merchant vessels and submarines in nearly all cases those collisions were between friend and friend or in peacetime between a submarine and a harmless foreign vessel the results were always the same the surface vessel came off best it doesnt seem logical but it does make sense take a hollow glass sphere with walls say of a third of an inch in diameter submerge it to a very considerable depth im talking of hundreds of feet and it still wont implode bring it to the surface give it a light tap with a hammer and it will shatter into a hundred pieces same with the pressure hull of a submarine it can resist pressure at great depths but on the surface a short sharp blow as from the bows of a merchant ship will cause it to rupture admittedly the chances of the submarine are not improved by the fact that the merchant ship may displace many thousands of tons and be travelling at a fair speed on the other hand even a vessel as small as a trawler can sink a submarine point is dr sinclair it wasnt all that dangerous i hadnt much doubt as to what the outcome would be point taken mr mckinnon you see before you a rueful cobbler who will stick to his last from now on patterson said this ever happen to you no if it had the chances are very high that i wouldnt be here now i know plenty of instances when i was in the service the trade as we called it we had a maxim which said in effect never mind the enemy just watch out for your friends back in the twenties a british submarine the mi it was was accidentally struck by a merchant ship off the devon coast all died not long afterwards the american si was overrun by the italian passenger liner city of rome all died some time later another american submarine was overrun by a coastguard destroyer off cape cod all died the poseidon british was sent to the bottom by a japanese ship accident it was off the north china coast a good number of survivors but some died from the divers bends in the early years of the war the surcouf crewed by the free french and the biggest submarine in the world so big that it was called a submarine cruiser was sunk in the caribbean by a ship in a convoy she was escorting the surcouf had a crew of a hundred and fifty all died mckinnon passed a hand across his eyes there were others i forgot most of them ah yes there was the umpire fortyone i think it took only a trawler and not a very big one to destroy her patterson said youve made your point as dr sinclair says youve more than made your point i accept that the element of risk was not high youll just have to bear with us mr mckinnon amateurs all we didnt know you did the fact that the uboat is at the bottom of the sea is testimony enough to that he paused i have to say bosun that your achievement doesnt appear to have given you any great satisfaction it hasnt patterson nodded i understand to have been responsible for the deaths of so many men well its hardly a cheerful thought mckinnon looked at him in mild surprise whats done is done so the uboats gone and its crew with it its no matter for celebration but its no matter for recrimination either the next allied merchant ship to have appeared on the cross hairs of klaussens periscope sight would surely have gone to where klaussens uboat is now the only good uboat is a uboat with a ruptured pressure hull at the bottom of the ocean then why patterson broke off plainly at a loss for both thought and words then said the hell with the pros and cons it was still a splendid job i didnt fancy a prison camp any more than you well i dont feel as modest about your accomplishments as you do he looked around the table a toast to our bosun here and to the memory of dr singh im not nearly as modest as you think i am i havent the slightest objection to drinking a toast to myself mckinnon looked slowly around the other six but i draw the line at drinking a toast to the memory of flannelfoot mckinnon was becoming very expert at causing silences this the fourth such silence was much longer and much more uncomfortable than the ones that had preceded it the other six stared at him looked at each other with questioning frowning glances then returned their exclusive attention to mckinnon again it was janet who broke the silence you do know what youre saying archie at least i hope you do im afraid i do dr sinclair you had a cardiac arrest unit in the recovery room did you have another similar unit elsewhere yes in the dispensary and you were under strict instructions that in an emergency the dispensary unit was the one that was to be used first that is so sinclair looked at him without understanding how on earth do you know that because im clever the normally calm and unemotional bosun made no attempt to conceal his bitterness after the event im very clever he shook his head theres no point in you listening to me telling you how clever i havent been i suggest you go i suggest you all go and have a look at the recovery room cardiac unit the units not there any more its in ward a by the sisters desk the lid is closed but the lock has been damaged as has the seal you can wrench the lid open easily enough all six looked at each other then rose left and were back within a minute they sat in silence and remained in silence they were either stunned by what they had seen or could not find the words to express their emotions nice is it not mckinnon said a highpowered radio transceiver tell me dr sinclair did dr singh ever lock himself up in the recovery room i couldnt say sinclair shook his head quite violently as if to clear it of disbelief may well have done for all anyone would know but he did frequently go into that room alone yes alone quite often he insisted on looking after the two injured men personally perfectly within his rights of course he was the man who had operated on them of course after id found the radio i still dont know what made me open up that damned cardiac unit i examined the lock the keyhole part that mr jamieson had burnt away with his torch and the latch both were heavily oiled when dr singh turned that key you would have heard no sound of metal against metal or even the faintest click not even if you were listening outside a couple of feet away not that anyone could have had any conceivable reason for lurking outside a couple of feet away after locking the door and checking that his two patients were under sedation and if they werent he would make sure they very quickly were he could use his radio to his hearts content not i should imagine that he used it very often the primary purpose the essential purpose of the radio was that it kept on sending out a continual homing location signal i still cant understand it or bring myself to believe it patterson spoke slowly a man still trying to struggle free of a trance of course its true it has to be true but that doesnt make it any more credible he was such a good man such a kind man and a fine doctor was he not dr sinclair he was an excellent doctor no question and a brilliant surgeon so was dr crippen for all i know mckinnon said i find it as baffling as you do mr patterson i have no idea what his motives could have been and i should imagine that well never find out he was a very clever man a very careful man who never took a chance a man who totally covered his tracks if it werent for a triggerhappy uboat gun crew wed never have found out who flannelfoot was his treachery may have had something to do with his background although he spoke of pakistani descent he was of course an indian and i believe that educated indians have little reason to love the british raj may have had something to do with religion if he had pakistani roots he was probably a muslim the connection i have no idea there are a dozen other reasons apart from nationality and politics and religion that make a man a traitor where did those cardiac arrest units come from dr sinclair they were loaded aboard at halifax nova scotia i know that but do you know where they came from i have no idea does it matter it could point is we dont know whether dr singh installed the radio transceiver after the unit came aboard or whether the unit was supplied with the transceiver already installed i would take long odds that the transceiver had already been installed very tricky thing to do aboard a boat difficult to smuggle the transceiver aboard equally difficult to get rid of the cardiac unit that was inside the box sinclair said when i said i didnt know where that unit came from thats quite true but i know the country of origin britain how can you tell stencil marks would there be many firms in britain that make those things again no idea not a question that comes up a cardiac unit is a cardiac unit very few i should imagine should be easy enough to trace the source and i dont for a moment imagine that the unit left the factory already equipped with the transceiver he looked at patterson naval intelligence should be very interested in finding out what route that cardiac unit took between the factory and the san andreas and what stopovers it made en route they should indeed and it should take them no time at all to find out where it changed hands and who made the switch seems damned careless of our saboteur friends to have left themselves so wide open not really sir they simply never expected to be found out i suppose tell me bosun why did you take so long in getting around to telling us about dr singh because i had the same reaction as you i had to work damned hard to convince myself of the evidence of my own eyes besides you all held dr singh in very high regard no one likes to be the bearer of bad news he looked at jamieson how long would it take sir to fix up a push button on sisters desk in ward a so that it would ring a buzzer in say here the bridge and the engineroom no time at all jamieson paused briefly i know you must have an excellent reason for this what shall we call it alarm system may we know what it is of course so that the sister or nurse in charge of ward a can let us know if any unauthorised person comes into the ward that unauthorised person will be in the same state of ignorance as we are at the moment he will not know whether that transceiver is in working order or not he has to assume that it is he has to assume that we may be in a position to send out an sos to the royal navy its obviously allimportant to the germans that such a signal be not sent and that we remain alone and unprotected they want us and they want us alive so the intruder will do everything in his power to destroy the set wait a minute wait a minute patterson said intruder unauthorised person what unauthorised person dr singh is dead ive no idea who he is all that im certain of is that he exists you may remember that i said earlier that i thought we had more than one flanneifoot aboard now im certain dr sinclair during the entire hour before lieutenant ulbricht and his fockewulf made their appearance and indeed for some time afterwards you and dr singh were operating on the two wounded sailors now the two dead sailors from the argos that is correct thats so sinclair looked and sounded puzzled did he leave the surgery at any time not once and it was during this period that some unknown was busy tinkering with junction boxes and fuses so flannelfoot number two there was a brief silence then jamieson said were not very bright are we of course youre right we should have worked that out for ourselves you would have finding dr singhs dead body and then finding out what he was is enough to put any other thought out of your mind its only just now occurred to me more time to get over the shock i suppose objection patterson said query rather if that set is smashed the germans have no means of tracking us theyre not tracking us now mckinnon said patiently battery leads are disconnected even if they werent smashing the transceiver would be far the lesser of two evils the last thing that flannelfoot number two wants to see is the royal navy steaming over the horizon they may have another transmitter cached away somewhere although i very much doubt it dr sinclair would you please check the other cardiac unit in the dispensary although im sure youll find it okay well sinclair said theres at least some satisfaction in knowing that theyve lost us i wouldnt bet on that doctor in fact id bet against it a submarine cant use its radio underwater but you have to remember that this lad was trailing us on the surface and was almost certainly in constant contact with its shore base theyll know exactly our position and course at the time of the sinking of the submarine i wouldnt even be surprised if theres another uboat tagging along behind us for some damned reason we seem to be very important to the germans and you mustnt forget that the further southwest we steam the more hours of daylight we have the skys pretty clear and the chances are good that a fockewulf or some such will pick us up during the day patterson looked at him morosely you make a splendid jobs comforter bosun mckinnon smiled sorry about that sir just reckoning the odds thats all the odds janet said youre betting against our chances of getting to aberdeen arent you archie mckinnon turned his hands palms upwards im not a gambler and there are too many unknowns any of your opinions is just as good as mine im not betting against our chances janet i think we have a fair chance of making it he paused three things ill go and see captain andropolous and his men i should think that radio is a pretty universal word if not sign language should work most of the crew of the argos survived so the chances are good that there is a radio officer among them he can have a look at this machine and see if we can transmit with it lieutenant ulbricht id be grateful if you could come up to the bridge when its time and take a noon sight third thing if the lights in ward a fail at any time whoever is in charge is to press the panic button immediately mckinnon made to rise stopped and looked at his un touched drink well perhaps after all a toast to the departed an old gaelic curse rather dr singh may his shade walk on the dark side of hell tonight he raised his glass to flannelfoot mckinnon drank his toast alone nine less than ten minutes after mckinnons arrival on the bridge the phone rang jamieson here the voice said things do keep happening aboard this damned ship theres been another accident accident accident on purpose incident i should have said your pal limassol limassol was the name that mckinnon had given to the man whom he had discovered to be the radio operator of the argos apart from this discovery the only other thing that the bosun had been able to discover about him was that he was a greek cypriot from limassol whats happened to my pal limassol hes been clobbered ah mckinnon was not a man much given to exclamatory outbursts inevitably who clobbered him you should know better than to ask that question bosun how the hell should i know who clobbered him nobody ever knows who does anything aboard the san andreas the chief officer was more prophetic than he knew when he gave this ship its new name its a bloody disaster area i can only give you the facts as i know them sister maria was on duty when limassol sat down to have a look at the transceiver after a while he stood and made the motion of screwing his forefinger against the palm of his other hand she guessed correctly that he wanted tools and sent for way land day to take him down to the engineroom i was there and gave him the tools he wanted he also took a bridgemegger with him gave every impression of a man who knew what he was doing on his way back in the passageway leading to the messdeck he was clobbered something hard and heavy how hard how heavy if youll just hang on for a moment we have him down here in a bed in a ward dr sinclair is attending to him he can tell you better than i can there was a brief silence then sinclair was on the phone bosun well damn it confirmation of the existence of flannelfoot number two not that any confirmation was needed but i didnt expect such quick and violent proof this lad doesnt hang around does he dangerous violent acts on his own initiative and his minds working on the same wavelength as ours limassol pretty poorly to say the least some metallic object no question could easily have been a crowbar i would guess that the attackers intent was to kill him with most people he might well have succeeded but this limassol seems to have a skull like an elephant fractured of course ill have an xray routine and quite superfluous but mandatory no signs of any brain damage which is not to say that there isnt any but no obvious damage not at least at this stage two things im pretty certain about mr mckinnon hell live but hes not going to be of much use to you or anyone for some time to come as dr singh said about lieutenant cunningham two hours two days two weeks two months something like that ive simply no idea all i know is that if he does recover rapidly hell be of no possible use to you for days to come so you can rule him out of any plans you may have im fresh out of plans doctor indeed we seem to be running out of options mr jamieson would like to have another word with you jamieson came back on the phone maybe this could have been my fault bosun maybe if id been thinking a bit more clearly and a bit quicker this wouldnt have happened how on earth were you to know that limassol was going to be attacked true but i should have gone with him not for his protection but to watch him to see what he did to make the set work that way i might have picked up enough to have some knowledge rudimentary but some so that we wouldnt have to rely entirely on one man flannelfoot would probably have clobbered you too no point sir in trying to place the blame where none exists the milks spilt and you didnt spill it just give me enough time and ill find out it was all mckinnons fault he hung up and related the gist of his conversation to naseby who had the wheel and to lieutenant ulbricht who had declared himself as feeling so fit that he no longer qualified as a bed patient disturbing ulbricht said our friend seems to be resourceful very quickthinking and very much a man of decision and action i say disturbing because it has just occurred to me that he may have been flannelfoot number one and not dr singh in which case we can expect a great deal more unpleasantness in any event it seems to rule out the crew of the argos none of them speaks english so they couldnt have known about the fake cardiac unit being in a ward mckinnon looked morose the fact that none of them appears to understand a word of english theyre very good with their blank stares when you address them in that language doesnt mean that one or two of them dont speak better english than i do it doesnt rule out the crew of the argos and of course it doesnt rule out our own crew or the nine invalids we picked up in murmansk and how would they have known that the tampered cardiac unit had been transferred from the recovery room to ward a only let me see only seven people knew about the transfer the seven at the table this morning one of us could have talked perhaps no mckinnon was very definite inadvertently no you trust us that much ulbricht smiled but there was no humour in it or is it that you have to trust somebody i trust you all right mckinnon sounded a little weary point is it wasnt necessary for anyone to talk everybody knows that dr singh and the two injured crewmen from the argos are dead mckinnon made a dismissive little gesture with his hand after all were going to bury them inside the halfhour everybody knows that they were killed by an explosive blast inside the recovery room and our newest flannelfoot must have known that the transceiver was there and may have guessed or suspected that the case of the cardiac unit had been damaged sufficiently to reveal the existence of the transmitter it had not in fact but that was pure luck on my part how do you explain the attack on the radio officer easily mckinnon looked and sounded bitter flannelfoot didnt have to know where the radio was all he had to know was that we had developed a certain interest in radio mr jamieson tried to take some of the blame for the attack totally unnecessary when mastermind mckinnon is around my fault my fault entirely when i went down to find a radio officer the crew of the argos were as usual in a corner by themselves they werent alone in the messdeck some of the injured men we picked up in murmansk and some of our crew were there but not close enough to hear us talking not that there was any talking i just said the word radio several times low enough not to be overheard and this lad from limassol looked at me then i made a motion of tapping my forefinger as if sending a signal in morse after that i spun the handle of an imaginary electrical generator none of this could have been seen except by the crew of the argos then i made my stupid mistake i cupped my hand to my ear as if listening to something by this time limassol had got the message and was on his feet but our new flannelfoot had got the message too just one little movement of my hand and he got it hes not only violent and dangerous but very smart too an unpleasant combination indeed it is ulbricht said you have it right you must have and i cant see any reason for selfreproach i used the right word back there disturbing naseby said do you by any chance remember who exactly was in the messdeck when you were there i do every crew member who wasnt on watch on the deckside only two were on watch you and trent down in the captains cabin there keeping an eye on the sextant and chronometer all the offduty engineroom staff two cooks and mario seven of the seventeen invalids we picked up in murmansk the three who were supposed to be tubercular cases the three who are supposed to be suffering from nervous breakdowns and one of the exposure cases hes so wrapped in bandages that he can barely walk so he doesnt come into consideration a couple of nurses they dont come into consideration either and theres no doubt youre right lieutenant the crew of the argos has to be in the clear well thats something ulbricht said a moment ago you were expressing reservations against them which i found rather puzzling as in that long talk in the captains cabin we had more or less agreed that the crew of the argos was in the clear the original suggestion you may remember came from you i remember next thing you know ill be looking into the mirror and saying and i dont trust you either yes i know i made the suggestion but i still had this tiny doubt at the time i more than suspected that we had another flannelfoot aboard but i wasnt certain until less than half an hour ago its impossible to believe that it wasnt our new flannelfoot who blew the hole in the forard ballast room when we were alongside that sinking corvette and its unthinkable and for me this is the clincher that a member of the argos crew would deliberately set out to murder a person who was not only a crewmate but a fellow countryman at least its something naseby said brings it down to our own crew doesnt it yes our crew and at least six allegedly physical and mentally disturbed cripples from murmansk naseby shook his head sorrowfully archie this trip is going to be the ruination of you never known you to be so terribly suspicious of everybody and youve just said you could find yourself not even trusting yourself if a nasty suspicious mind is any kind of hope for survival george then im going to keep on having just that kind of mind you will remember that we had to leave halifax in a tearing hurry in a cargo ship little more than half converted to a hospital why to get to archangel and that with all possible speed then after that little accident when we were alongside that corvette it became equally essential that we be diverted to murmansk why well we were listing a bit and down by the head we had stopped making water weather conditions were fair we could have reached the white sea crossed it and made archangel without much trouble but no it was murmansk or nothing again why so that the russians could place that explosive charge in the ballast room ulbricht smiled i recall your words our gallant allies i recall them too i wish i didnt we all make mistakes im certainly no exception and that was one of my biggest the russians didnt place that charge your people did the germans impossible lieutenant if you imagine murmansk and archangel arent botching with german spies and agents youre living in alices nevernever wonderland its possible its possible but to infiltrate a russian naval working party thats impossible its not impossible but it doesnt even have to be necessary people are capable of being suborned and while it may not be true that every man has his price there are always those who have a russian traitor you suggest why not you have your traitors we have our traitors every country has its traitors why should we the germans want to place a charge in the san andreas i simply have no idea in the same way as i have simply no idea why the germans have attacked harassed and pursued us but not tried to sink us ever since we rounded the north cape what im suggesting is its very likely that the same german agent or agents suborned one or more of the invalids we picked up in murmansk an alleged psychiatric case or mental breakdown patient who is sick of both the war and the sea would make an ideal choice for the traitors part and i shouldnt even imagine that the price would have to be very high objection mr mckinnon it was a lastminute decision to detach the san andreas from the convoy you cant suborn a man overnight true at the most highly unlikely maybe they knew a week or two ago that we would be detached to murmansk how on earth could they have known that i dont know the same way i dont know why someone in halifax knew quite a long time ago that dr singh would be in need of a transceiver and you dont think it extraordinary that the russians if they were not responsible for placing that charge should have brought the san andreas into murmansk apparently for the sole benefit of your mysterious german agents theyre not my agents but theyre mysterious all right the answer again is that i simply dont know the truth appears to be that i just dont know anything about anything he sighed ah well close to noon lieutenant ill go get the sextant and chronometer lieutenant ulbricht straightened from the chart still remarkably holding the same course precisely є north ideally we should steer due south now but were near enough to trondheim as we are now and that would only bring us closer i suggest we maintain this course for the present then turn due south some time during the night midnight or thereabouts that should bring us down the east coast of your native islands tomorrow mr mckinnon ill work it out youre the navigator mckinnon said agreeably in marked contrast to the conditions that had existed exactly fortyeight hours previously when the mass burial had taken place the weather was now almost benign the wind was no more than force three the sea calm enough to keep the san andreas on an all but steady keel and the cloud cover consisted of no more than a wide band of white fleecy mackerel sky against the pale blue beyond mckinnon standing by the starboard rail of the san andreas derived no pleasure whatsoever from the improvement he would greatly have preferred the blanketing white blizzard of the previous burial besides the bosun the only other attendants or witnesses by no stretch of the imagination could they have been called mourners at the burial were patterson jamieson sinclair and the two stokers and two seamen who had brought up the bodies no one else had asked to come for obvious reasons no one was going to mourn dr singh and only sinclair had known the two dead crewmen from the argos and even then as no more than two unconscious bodies on operating tables dr singh was unceremoniously tipped over the side not for him the wellwishing for his journey into the hereafter patterson who would obviously never have made it as a clergyman quickly read the liturgy from the prayerbook over the two dead greek seamen and then they too were gone patterson closed the prayerbook twice of that lot is twice too often lets hope theres not going to be a third time he looked at mckinnon i suppose we just plod on on our far from merry way all we can do sir lieutenant ulbricht suggests that we alter course by and by to due south thatll take us on a more direct route to aberdeen he knows what hes about but that will be approximately twelve hours yet whatevers best patterson gazed around the empty horizon doesnt it strike you as rather odd bosun that weve been left unmolested or at least not located for the better part of three hours since all communication from the uboat has ceased in that time they must be very dense if theyre not aware that something is far wrong with it i should imagine that admiral doenitzs uboat fleet commander in trondheim is very far from dense ive the feeling they know exactly where we are i understand that some of the latest uboats are quite quick under water and one could easily be trailing us by asdic without our knowing anything about it like patterson only much more slowly he looked around the horizon then stood facing the port quarter we are being tailed what whats that cant you hear it patterson cocked his head then nodded slowly i think i can yes i can condor mckinnon said fockewulf he pointed i can see it now its coming straight out of the east and trondheim is about due east of us now the pilot of that plane knows exactly where we are hes been told probably via trondheim by the uboat thats trailing us i thought a submarine had to surface to transmit no all it has to do is to raise its transmitting aerial above the water it could do that a couple of miles away and we wouldnt see it anyway its probably a good deal further distant than that one wonders what the condors intentions are your guess sir were not unfortunately inside the minds of the uboat and luftwaffe commanders in trondheim my guess is that theyre not going to try to finish us off and thats not because theyve been at great pains not to sink us so far if they wanted to sink us one torpedo from the uboat im sure is out there would do the job nicely or if they wanted to sink us from the air they wouldnt use a condor which is really a reconnaissance plane heinkels heinkel ills or stukas with longrange tanks could do the job much more efficiently and trondheim is only about two hundred miles from here whats he after then the condor was two miles distant now and losing height rapidly information mckinnon looked up at the bridge and caught sight of naseby out on the port wing looking aft towards the approaching condor he cupped his hands and shouted george naseby swung round get down get down mckinnon made the appropriate gesture with his hand naseby raised an arm in acknowledgement and disappeared inside the bridge mr patterson lets get inside the superstructure now patterson knew when to ask questions and when not to he led the way and within ten seconds they were all in shelter except the bosun who remained in the shattered doorway information patterson said what information one moment he moved quickly to the side of the ship looked aft for no more than two seconds then returned to shelter half a mile mckinnon said very slow very low about fifty feet information shellholes say on the sides or superstructure something to indicate that we had been in a fight with some vessel he wont see any holes on the port side patterson made to speak but whatever he had to say was lost in the sudden clamour of closerange fire by machineguns in the cacophonous fury of hundreds of bullets striking the superstructure and side in the space of seconds and in the abrupt crescendo of sound as giant aero engines swept by not more than fifty yards away another few seconds and all was relatively quiet again jamieson said well yes i can see now why you told naseby to get his head down information patterson sounded aggrieved almost plaintive bloody funny way they set about getting information and i thought you said they werent going to attack us i said they wouldnt sink us knocking a few of the crew off would be all grist to their mill the more of us they can kill the more they think theyll have us at their mercy you think they got the information they wanted im certain of it you can be sure that every eye on that condor was examining us very closely indeed as they passed by fifty yards away they wont have seen the damage to our bows because its underwater but they cant have helped seeing something else thats underwater up forard our loadline unless theyre completely myopic theyre bound to have seen that were down by the head and unless theyre equally dense theyre bound to realize that weve either hit something or been hit by something it couldnt have been a mine or torpedo or wed be at the bottom now theyll have known at once that we must have rammed something and there wont be much guessing about what that was dear oh dear jamieson said i dont think i like this one little bit bosun nor me sir changes things quite a bit doesnt it question of the german high commands priorities i suppose a question of alive or dead is it more important to them that they take us more or less alive or do they take revenge for their lost uboat whichever they choose theres damnall we can do about it patterson said lets go and have lunch i think we should wait a moment sir mckinnon remained still and silent for a few moments then said its coming back and back it came flying at the same near wavetop height the second flypast was a mirror image of the first instead of flying stern to stem on the port side it flew stem to stern on the starboard side again to the accompaniment of the same fusillade of machinegun fire some ten seconds after the firing ceased mckinnon followed by the others left the shelter and went to the port rail the condor was off the port quarter climbing steadily and flying directly away from them well well jamieson said we seem to have got off lightly bound to have seen those three shellholes on the starboard side werent they bosun couldnt have missed them sir they could be gaining bombing altitude before turning back to settle accounts with us he could bomb us from a hundred feet without the slightest bit of danger to himself or maybe he just isnt carrying any bombs no hell be carrying bombs all right only the focke wulfs on the big halfcircle from trondheim to lorient in france round the british isles or the ones who patrol as far out as the denmark strait dont carry bombs they carry extra fuel tanks instead the ones on shorter patrols always carry bombs kilo bombs usually not the smaller ones that lieutenant ulbricht used the pilot of the condor is of course in direct radio communication with trondheim has told them why theyre not hearing from the uboat any more but still has been told to lay off us for the meantime anyway youre right patterson said hes not coming back funny he could have spent all day till nightfall at least circling us and reporting our position but no hes off i wonder why no need to wonder sir the condors exit is all the proof we require that we are being tailed by a uboat no point in having a uboat and a plane tailing us at the same time isnt there anything we can do about that damned uboat well we cant ram him because we dont know where he is and we can be certain that theres no chance that hell surface because hes bound to have heard by now or will hear very soon what happened to the other uboat we can just possibly shake him off but not at this moment sure by shutting off our engines and generators we could make him lose contact but that wouldnt be for very long hed just raise his periscope traverse the horizon and nail us again not at this moment you mean after it gets dark yes i thought we might try then we lie doggo for half an hour then steam away on a new course at very low engine revolutions the less racket we make the less chance there is of our being picked up might take us the better part of an hour to reach full speed at the best its only a gamble and even if we do win that gamble its still no guarantee that were free and clear the uboat will just radio trondheim that theyve lost us they still know approximately where we are and a condor with a few dozen flares can cover an awfully big area in a very short time you do my morale a power of good jamieson said their tactics puzzle me why do they have a condor fly out here fly back again and then as you suggest fly out here at dusk why doesnt it stay out here all the time and have another condor relieve it it doesnt make sense to me it does to me although were still a long way from aberdeen the german brasshats in norway may well be making a decision as to whether or not to try to stop us again my feeling its no more than that says they will no way a condor can stop us without sinking or crippling us its become quite clear that they have no wish to sink us or cripple us to the extent that we can no longer proceed under our own steam the uboat can surface about a mile off watch carefully for even a couple of degrees deviation in our course and theyll be watching for that very very carefully then proceed to pump shell after shell into the superstructure and hospital zone until we run up the little white flag youre a great comfort to me bosun as mckinnon entered the bridge naseby handed him a pair of binoculars starboard door archie no need to go outside a bit forard of midships near enough west i would say mckinnon took the glasses studied the area indicated for about ten seconds then handed the glasses back mile and a half i would say looks like a mirror only of course its not a mirror its a uboats periscope reflecting the sun we george are being subjected to psychological warfare is that what you call it meant to see it of course by accident of course carelessness of course slowly very slowly george round to port until were heading more or less due east then keep it on that bearing while youre doing that ill call up the chief engineer and ask his permission he located patterson in the messdeck told him the situation and asked for permission to head east whatever you say bosun doesnt exactly get us nearer home does it thats what will make the germans happy sir its also what makes me happy as long as were heading for norway which is where they want us anyway and not to scotland theyre hardly likely to clobber us for doing exactly what they want us to do come darkness of course its heighho for scotland again satisfactory bosun very satisfactory indeed do we make the news public i suggest you tell mr jamieson and lieutenant ulbricht sir as for the rest any more talk about uboats would only put them off their lunch ten have i the ward sisters permission to have a few words with the captain the captain is only two beds away margaret morrison eyed the bosun speculatively or do you have another secret session in mind well yes it is rather private more uboat ramming is it i never want to see another uboat in my life mckinnon spoke with some feeling the only thing that heroics will get us is an early and watery grave he nodded towards the bed where oberleutnant klaussen was lying moving restlessly and mumbling to himself in a barely audible monologue is he like this all the time all the time never stops rambling on does any of what he says make sense nothing nothing at all mckinnon guided the captain into a chair in the small lounge off the crews mess mr patterson and mr jamieson are here sir i wanted them to hear what i have in mind and to have your permission to perhaps carry out certain things i have in mind i have three suggestions to make the first concerns our destination are we absolutely committed to aberdeen sir i mean how ironclad are the admiralty orders captain bowen made a few pointed but unprintable observations about the admiralty then said the safety of the san andreas and of all aboard her are of paramount importance if i consider this safety to be in any way endangered ill take the san andreas to any safe port in the world and the hell with the admiralty were here the admiralty is not we are in the gravest danger the biggest peril facing the admiralty is falling off their chairs in whitehall yes sir the bosun halfsmiled i did think those questions rather unnecessary but i had to ask them why because im convinced theres a german espionage network in murmansk he outlined the reasons he had given to lieutenant ulbricht less than an hour previously if the germans know so much about us and our movements then its nearer a certainty than a possibility that they also know that our destination is aberdeen maintaining any kind of course for aberdeen is like handing the germans a gift from the gods even more important from my way of thinking anyway is why the germans are so very interested in us we probably wont know until we arrive in some safe port and even then it might take some time to find out but if this unknown factor is so very valuable to the germans might it not be even more valuable to us it is my belief i cant give any solid grounds for this belief that the germans would rather lose this valuable prize than let us have it i have the uncomfortable feeling that if we got anywhere near aberdeen the germans would have a submarine maybe two loitering somewhere off peterhead thats about twentyfive miles nornoreast of aberdeen with orders not to let us move any further south that could mean only one thing torpedoes say no more bosun jamieson said youve got me convinced heres one passenger who wants aberdeen struck right off our cruise itinerary i have a feeling youre right bowen said maybe one hundred per cent even if the chances were only ten per cent we wouldnt be justified in taking the risk i have a complaint to make against myself bosun im supposed to be the captain why didnt i think of that because you had other things on your mind sir and where does that leave me patterson said ive only just thought of it myself sir im sure that when mr kennet and i were ashore in murmansk we missed something we must have what i still dont understand is why the russians pulled us into murmansk why they were so prompt and efficient in repairing the hole in the hull and completing the hospital if i had the key to answer that question id know the answer to everything including the answer to why the russians were so helpful and cooperative in marked contrast to their standard behaviour which usually ranges from unfriendliness to downright hostility but i dont have that key we can only speculate bowen said if youve had time to consider this bosun youve obviously had time to consider alternative ports safe ports boltholes if you like yes sir iceland or the orkneys that is reykjavik or scapa flow reykjavik has the disadvantage of being half as far away again as scapa on the other hand the further west we go the more we steam out of the reach of the heinkels and stukas heading for scapa we should be within easy reach practically all the way of the heinkels and stukas based in bergen and theres the other disadvantage that ever since oberleutnant prien sank the royal oak up there the mine defences make entry impossible but it has the advantage that both the navy and the raf have bases there i dont know for certain but i should think it very likely that they maintain frequent air patrols round the orkneys after all it is the base of the home fleet i have no idea how far out those patrols range fifty miles a hundred i dont know i think theres a good chance that we would be picked up long before were even near scapa tantamount to being home and dry is that it bosun i wouldnt quite say that sir there are always the uboats mckinnon paused and considered as i see it sir four things no british pilot is going to attack a british hospital ship wed probably be picked up by a patrol plane like a blenheim which wouldnt waste much time in calling up fighter support and no german bomber pilot in his senses is going to risk meeting up with hurricanes or spitfires the patrol plane would also certainly radio scapa to have them open a minefield passage for us lastly theyd probably send out a destroyer or frigate or sloop something fast anyway with enough depthcharge to discourage any uboat that might be around not a very enviable choice bowen said three days to scapa you would say if we manage to shake off this uboat which im pretty sure is following us five days to reykjavik what if we dont manage to shake off our shadower arent they going to become very suspicious indeed when they see us altering course for scapa flow if they do succeed in following us they wont notice any course alteration for a couple of days or more during that time well be on a direct course to aberdeen once we get south of the latitude of fair isle well alter course southwest or westsouthwest or whatever for scapa its a chance its a chance you have any preference mr patterson i think ill leave my preference to the bosun i second that jamieson said well id feel happier in scapa sir i think we all would well bosun suggestion number one dealt with number two there are six exits from the hospital area sir three forard and three aft dont you think it would be wiser sir if we had everybody confined to the hospital area except of course for those on watch in the engineroom and on the bridge we know our latest flannelfoot is still with us and it seems a good idea to confine his sphere of operations if he has any left which we dont know to as limited an area as possible i suggest we seal up four of those doors two aft two forard and post guards at the other two doors weld them up you mean jamieson said no a bomb might hit the hospital the two doors not sealed off might buckle and jam everyone would be trapped we just close the doors in the usual way and give them a couple of moderate taps with a sledge patterson said and maybe flannelfoot has access to his own private sledgehammer hed never dare use it first metallic clang and hed have the whole ships company on his back true true patterson sighed i grow old you had a third point yes sir involves you if you will i dont think it would do any harm if you were to assemble everybody and tell them whats going on not that you can get across to captain andropolous and his crew because im sure most have no idea whats going on tell them about dr singh the transceiver and what happened to limassol tell them that another flannelfoot is at large and thats why weve closed all four doors so as to limit his movements please tell them that although its not a very nice thing they are to watch each other like hawks it is after all in their own survival interests and to report any suspicious behaviour it might just cramp flannelfoots style and it will at least give them something to do bowen said you really think bosun that this the sealing off of the doors and the warning to the ships company will keep flannelfoot in check on the basis of our performance to date mckinnon said gloomily i very much doubt it the afternoon and the early evening and even although they were now more than three hundred miles south of the arctic circle early evening in those latitudes was still very early indeed passed away as peacefully as mckinnon had expected there was no sign of the uboat but he had been certain that the uboat would not show itself there was no sign of any reconnaissance condor which only served to confirm his belief in the enemy concealed below nor did any heinkels or stukas appear over the eastern horizon for the hour of the coup de grace had not yet come half an hour after sunset the night was as dark as it was likely to become on the norwegian sea cloud cover was patchy and the rest of the sky hazy although a few pale stars could be seen time i think george mckinnon said to naseby im going below when the engines stop that should be in seven or eight minutes time bring her round є till were heading back the way we came you should be able to pick up our wash even though it is dark after that well we can only hope that youll pick up a star i should be back in about ten minutes or so on his way down he passed the captains cabin there was no longer anyone there to guard the sextant and chronometer with two of the forard exits from the hospital area closed off and the third under guard it was impossible for anyone to reach the upper deck and so the bridge on the deck it was so dark the bosun was pleased to note that he had to use the guideline to find his way to the hospital stephen the young stoker was there acting the part of sentry mckinnon told him to join the others on the messdecks when they got there mckinnon found patterson waiting for him everybody here sir everybody not forgetting curran and ferguson those two had been holed up in the carpenters shop in the bows riot act duly read anybody making the slightest sound after we stop after the engines have stopped rather inadvertently or not will be silenced talking only in whispers tell me bosun is it really true that you can pick up the sound of a knife and fork on a plate i dont really know i dont know how sensitive the listening devices on a modern uboat are i do know that the sound of a spanner being dropped on a steel deck is easily detectable no chances he went into the two wards checked that everybody had been told of the need for absolute silence switched on the emergency lamps and went down to the engineroom only jamieson and mccrimmon were there jamieson looked at him and switched on an emergency lamp now i take it its as dark as its going to get sir even by the time mckinnon had reached the messdecks the engine revolutions had fallen away he sat down at a mess table next to patterson and waited in silence until the engines had stopped and the sound of the generator had died away with the complete silence and only the feeble light from the emergency lamps to illuminate the area the atmosphere held the elements of both the eerie and the sinister patterson whispered no chance that the uboat will think that their listening apparatus has failed no sir you wouldnt have to be a very efficient asdic operator to know when engine revolutions are falling then dying away jamieson and mccrimmon appeared each carrying an emergency lamp jamieson sat beside mckinnon all we need now bosun is a ships chaplain a few prayers wouldnt come amiss sir especially a prayer that flannelfoot hasnt got a bug sending out a location signal please dont even talk about such things he was silent for some moments then said were heeling arent we we are yes naseby is making a є turn heading back the way we came ah jamieson looked thoughtful so that he will overshoot us turning back on our tracks but wont he do the same i mean wouldnt that be the first thing that would occur to him quite honestly i dont and wouldnt have the faintest idea as to what his first second or tenth thoughts are his first thought might be that our reversing course is so obvious a ploy that hes not even going to consider it he might even think that were carrying straight on for the norwegian coast which is so ludicrous a possibility that he may even be considering it or we might be heading back northeast again for the barents sea only a madman would do that of course but hell have to consider the fact whether we think he thinks were mad or not alternatively and there are a lot of alternatives he may figure that once we figure were clear of his asdic clutches well just continue on our course to aberdeen or some place in north scotland or the orkneys or the shetlands there are an awful lot of options open to us and the chances are that he will pick the wrong one i see jamieson said i say this in admiration bosun and not in reproof you have a very devious mind lets just hope the oberleutnant in charge of that uboat out there hasnt an even more devious mind he turned to patterson im going up top to join naseby and see if theres any sign of life around sign of life you mean you think the uboat may have surfaced and is looking for us may have done but its dark you said hell have a searchlight two of them for all i know jamieson said and you think hell be using them its a possibility not a probability hes bound to know by this time what happened to his fellow uboat this morning patterson touched his arm you wouldnt ah be considering another possibility another collision heavens no i dont really think the san andreas could survive another bump like that not of course that the captain of that submarine is to know that he may well be convinced that were desperate enough for anything and were not its a long way down to the bottom of the norwegian sea mckinnon paused reflectively what we really need now is a nice little old blizzard still the condor still the flares is that it bosun its not a thought that goes away easily he turned to jamieson under way in half an hour sir half an hour it is but gently gently if you would sir mckinnon examined the sea from both sides of the upper deck but all was dark and quiet and still he climbed to the bridge and went out on the wings but even from this higher perspective there was nothing to be seen no sweeping finger of a searchlight nothing well george this makes a change all is quiet all is peaceful is that a good sign or a bad one take your pick still quite a bit under way arent we yes ive just picked up our wake and ive just located a couple of stars one off the port bow the other off the starboard no idea what they are of course but it should keep us heading more or less west until we come to a halt which should take quite a while yet in just under fifteen minutes the san andreas was dead in the water and fifteen minutes after that she came to life again albeit very very slowly from the bridge any sounds from the engineroom were quite inaudible the only indication that they were under way came from the very faint vibration of the superstructure after a few minutes mckinnon said any steerage way yet george barely were about ten degrees off course right now to the south a couple of minutes and well be heading west again i wonder i wonder you wonder i wonder we all wonder are we alone in the norwegian sea or do we have company company that has no intention of making its presence known i just guess and hope that were alone beyond a certain distance a submarine is not very good at picking up a very slowturning engine and prop what it can pick up is a generator which is why there will be no lights down below for another fifteen minutes yet just under half an hour after mckinnon had arrived on the bridge the telephone bell shrilled naseby answered and handed the phone to the bosun bosun this is ward a sinclair speaking i think you had better come down sinclair sounded weary or dispirited or both flannelfoot has struck again theres been an accident no need to break your neck though nobodys been hurt weve been far too long without an accident the bosun felt as weary as sinclair what happened transceivers wrecked thats just splendid im on my way at a leisurely pace he replaced the phone flannelfoots at it again george it seems that the transceiver in ward a is not quite what it was oh jesus it wasnt an exclamation of shock horror or anger just a sign of resignation why wasnt the alarm buzzer pressed i shall no doubt find that out when i get there ill send trent to relieve you i suggest you broach captain bowens supplies life aboard the san andreas george is like life everywhere just one damned thing after another the first thing that took mckinnons eye in ward a was not the transceiver in the cardiac arrest box but the sight of margaret morrison eyes closed lying on a bed with janet magnusson bending over her the bosun looked at dr sinclair who was sitting disconsolately in the chair that was normally occupied by the ward sister i thought you said nobody had been hurt not hurt in the medical sense although sister morrison might take issue with me on that matter shes been chloroformed but will be fine in a few minutes chloroformed flannelfoot doesnt seem to have a very original turn of mind hes a callous bastard this girl has just been wounded once quite nastily but this character seems to have been missing when they handed out humanitarian instincts you expect delicacy and a tenderness of feeling from a criminal who tries to murder a man with a crowbar mckinnon walked to the side of the table and looked down at the mangled remains of the transceiver ill spare you the obvious remarks naturally of course no one knows what happened because of course there were no eyewitnesses thats about it if its any use nurse magnusson here was the person to discover this mckinnon looked at her why did you come through did you hear a noise she straightened from the bed and looked at him with some disfavour you are a coldblooded fish archie mckinnon this poor poor girl lying here the radio smashed and you dont even look upset or annoyed far less furious am furious i can see that but margaret will be all right and the set is a total ruin i see no point in getting angry about things i can do nothing about and what passes for my mind has other things to worry about did you hear anything youre hopeless no i heard nothing i just came in to talk to her she was crumpled over her table i ran for dr sinclair and we lifted her into this bed here surely someone saw something they couldnt all have been asleep no the captain and the chief officer were awake she smiled sweetly you may have noticed mr mckinnon that the eyes of both captain bowen and chief officer rennet are heavily bandaged you just wait mckinnon said sotto voce until i get you to the shetlands they think a lot of me in lerwick she made a moue and the bosun looked across to bowen did you hear anything captain i heard something that sounded like the tinkling of glass wasnt much though you mr rennet same bosun again it wasnt much it didnt have to be you dont require a sledgehammer to crush a few valves a little pressure from the sole of the foot would be enough he turned to janet again but margaret wouldnt have been asleep shed have been bound no he couldnt have come that way hed have had to pass through your ward im not being very bright today am i no youre not she smiled again but this time without malice not our usual hawkeyed selves this evening are we mcrinnon turned and looked past the sisters table the door to the recovery room was about an inch ajar mcrinnon nodded it figures why should he bother to close it when it would be obvious to anyone with half an eye he must have forgotten about me that there was no other way he could have entered messdeck side passage operating room recovery room ward a simple as that every door unlocked of course why should they have been otherwise well we dont bother locking them now when did this happen anyone know sometime between engine startup and the lights coming back on again i think it had to be that sinclair said it would have been the ideal time and opportunity about ten minutes after startup but five minutes before the generator came on mr patterson gave permission for people to talk normally and move around as long as they didnt make any loud noise the emergency lights are pretty feeble at the best of times everyone was talking excitedly relief of tension i suppose hopes that we had slipped the submarine thankfulness that we were still in one piece that sort of thing and lots of people moving around it would have been childishly simple for anyone to disappear unnoticed and return again after a minute still unnoticed had to be that the bosun said anyone of the crew or that lot from murmansk in fact anyone who was out there still no nearer the identity of the man with the key to the dispensary captain mr kennet i am wondering why you didnt call sister morrison surely you must have smelled the chloroform janet said oh come on archie you can see that their noses are bandaged up could you smell anything with a handkerchief to your nose youre just half right nurse bowen said i did smell it but it was very faint the trouble is that there are so many medical and antiseptic smells in a ward that i paid no attention to it well he wouldnt have gone back to the messdeck with a sponge reeking of chloroform hands too for that matter back in a moment the bosun unhooked an emergency light went into the recovery room looked around briefly then passed into the operating theatre where he switched on the lights almost immediately in a bucket in a corner he found what he was looking for and returned to ward a a sponge duly reeking of chloroform a smashed ampoule and a pair of rubber gloves quite useless not to flannelfoot they werent sinclair said useless to us useless as evidence gets us nowhere mckinnon perched on the sisters table and looked in slight irritation at oberleutnant klaussen who was muttering away to himself unintelligibly incessantly is he still like this always like this sinclair nodded goes on nonstop must be damned annoying to the other patients and to the sister or nurse in charge why isnt his bed wheeled into the recovery room because the sister in charge thats margaret remember doesnt want him removed janet was being cool and patient hes her patient she wants to keep a close eye on aim and she doesnt mind any more questions archie you mean why dont i be on my way or keep quiet or go and do something do what do some detecting he looked gloomy theres nothing to detect im just waiting till margaret comes round signs of grace at last i want to ask her some questions i might have known what questions its as certain as can be that the assailant crept up behind her unseen and had her unconscious before she knew anything about it otherwise shed have reached for the button or called for help she did neither there are no questions you can ask her that we cant answer as im not a gambler i wont take your money away from you question number one how did flannelfoot know and he must have known that apart from captain bowen and mr kennet who are effectively blind at the moment everyone else in ward a was asleep he would never have dared to do what he did if there was even a remote possibility of someone being awake so how did he know answer please i i dont know she was obviously taken aback that had never occurred to me before but i dont think it occurred to anyone else either understandable such questions occur only to stupid old bosuns youre just being defensive janet question number two who told him i dont know that either but maybe maggie does number three what solicitous member of the crew or passengers made solicitous enquiries about the state of health of the patients in ward a how should i know maggie might know mightnt she after all she would be the obvious choice to be asked that question wouldnt she and you said you could answer any questions that she could bosh question number four archie youre beginning to sound like a prosecuting counsel im not guilty of anything dont be daft youre not in dock fourth question and the most important of all flannelfoot as we all know to our cost is no fool he must have taken into account the possibility that someone would ask the question of maggie with whom sister morrison did you discuss the state of health of your patients he had to assume that maggie was in the position to put the finger on him so my question is why to protect his anonymity did he not after rendering her unconscious slit her throat a nice sharp knife is just as silent as a chloroform sponge it would have been the logical thing to do wouldnt it janet but he didnt why didnt he murder her janet had gone very pale and when she spoke her voice was barely above a whisper horrible she said horrible horrible are you referring to me again goes well i must say with what you last called me a heartless fiend not you not you her voice was still unsteady its the question the thought the possibility it it could have happened that way couldnt it archie im more than mildly astonished that it didnt but i think well find the answer when maggie wakes up the silence that fell upon the ward was broken by bowen very gallant of you bosun very gallant indeed not to have reproached the young lady for being unable as she had claimed she could to answer the questions you asked if its any consolation to your friend janet not one of those j questions occurred to me either thank you sir she said that was very kind of you makes me feel more than halfway better already see archie i cant be all that stupid nobody ever suggested you were how long will it take her to come round dr sinclair five minutes fifteen twentyfive impossible to say people vary so much in their recovery times and even when she does come out of it shell be fuzzy for some time not mentally clear enough to remember and answer what might be difficult questions when she is call me please ill be on the bridge eleven half an hour later mckinnon joined margaret morrison in the small lounge off the messdeck she was pale and unsmiling but looked composed enough he sat down opposite her how do you feel now bit sick bit nauseated she halfsmiled dr sinclair seemed to be more concerned about the state of my mind i think thats well enough fine well not fine it was a damnable thing to happen to you but i feel less like commiserating with you than congratulating you i know janet told me im not one for mock shudders archie but well he could have done couldnt he i mean cut my throat he could have done he should have done archie oh god that wasnt very well put was it i meant that for his own sake he should have done he may just possibly have given away enough rope to hang himself i dont understand what you mean she smiled to rob her words of offence i dont think anyone understands quite what you mean janet says youre a very devious character be you white as snow etcetera only the truly honest get maligned in this fashion a cross one has to bear i have difficulty in seeing you in the role of martyr janet said you had lots of questions to ask me not lots just one well a few but all the same question where were you this afternoon before we stopped in the messdeck out there then i went to relieve irene just before the lights went out anyone enquire about the health of the patients in ward a when you were out there well yes she seemed faintly surprised i often get asked about the patients natural isnt it this late afternoon i meant yes i told them also natural isnt it did they ask if anyone was asleep no come to think of it they didnt have to i remember telling them that only the captain and first officer were awake it was some sort of joke she broke off touched her lips with her hand and looked thoroughly chagrined i see it wasnt really such a joke was it it let me in for halfanhours involuntary sleep didnt it im afraid it did who asked the question wayland day ah our pantry boy expantry boy i should say and now your faithful shadow and worshipper from afar not always as far away as you might think gets a little embarrassing at times she smiled and then was suddenly serious youre barking up the wrong tree archie he may be a bit of a pest but hes only a boy and a very nice boy its unthinkable i dont see a tree in sight agree unthinkable our wayland would never be a party to anything that might harm you who were the others at your table within hearing distance i mean how do you know there was anyone else at my table margaret morrison is too clever to be stupid that was stupid maria was there sister maria she nodded shes out who else stephen the polish boy cant pronounce his surname no one can then there were jones and mcguigan who are nearly always with wayland day i suppose because they are the three youngest members of the crew two seamen by the name of curran and ferguson i hardly know them because i hardly ever see them and yes i seem to remember there were two of the sick men we picked up in murmansk i dont know their names you seem to remember no i do its because i dont know their names i suppose im sure ones a tb case the other a nervous breakdown you could identify them again easily both had red hair era hartley and lto simons mckinnon opened the lounge door wayland wayland smith appeared within seconds and stood at respectful attention sir go and find mr patterson and mr jamieson oh yes and lieutenant ulbricht my compliments to them and ask them if they would please come here yes sir right away sir margaret morrison looked at the bosun in amusement how did you know that wayland was so close ever tried to lose your shadow on a sunny day i can prophesy things nothing to do with the second sight such as that lieutenant ulbricht will be the first along oh do be quiet has this been of any good to you another stupid question must have been or you wouldnt have sent for those three indeed it has another little complication but i think we can manage it ah lieutenant ulbricht that was very quick please sit down ulbricht took his seat by the side of margaret morrison while mckinnon contemplated the ceiling she said in a vexed voice theres no need for that ulbricht looked at her what do you mean margaret the bosun has a warped sense of humour not at all she just doesnt like me being right he looked round greeted patterson and jamieson then rose and closed the door with a firm hand as serious as that is it patterson said td rather we werent overheard sir he gave them a brief resume of the talks hed had with janet magnusson and margaret morrison then said one of those nine people within hearing distance of sister morrison knew that captain bowen and mr kennet were the only two patients in ward a who were awake and made the fullest use of that information agreed no one disagreed we can rule out sister maria no hard reason except that its inconceivable inconceivable both patterson and jamieson spoke at the same time stephen no hes probritish enough to make us all feel ashamed and hell never forget that it was the royal navy that saved his life in the north sea margaret morrison looked up in surprise i didnt know that neither did we sister even although he is in the engineroom department not till the bosun told us his agents are in every nook and cranny patterson seemed slightly aggrieved wayland day jones and mcguigan no theyre hardly out of kindergarten and havent lived enough or been steeped enough in sin to make apprentice counterespionage agents junior grade that leaves us with four suspects curran and ferguson are out i know them they are shirkers and malingerers of the first order and havent the energy interest or intelligence to make the grade that apart they spend all their spare time holed up in the carpenters shop in the bows and leave it so seldom that they can hardly know whats going on in the rest of the ship final proof of course is that though they may not be very bright theyre hardly stupid enough to set off an explosive charge in the ballast room while they are sleeping in the carpenters shop directly above that leaves simons and hartley two of the sick men or allegedly sick men that we picked up in murmansk dont you think we should have them up here mr patterson i do indeed bosun this is becoming interesting mckinnon opened the door wayland if possible wayland day made it in even less time than the previous occasion mckinnon gave him his instructions then added have them here in five minutes tell them to bring their pay books he closed the door and looked at margaret morrison wouldnt you like to leave now no i wouldnt why should i im as interested and involved in this as any of you in a wholly unconscious gesture she touched her throat more i would say you might not like it a gestapotype interrogation is that it how they are treated depends entirely on mr patterson im only venturing an opinion but i wouldnt think that mr patterson goes in very much for thumbscrews and racks not standard engineroom equipment she looked at him coldly facetiousness does not become you very little does it seems hartley and simons jamieson said we had them on our list of suspects well more or less remember bosun i remember i also remember that we agreed that the cid were in no danger of a takeover from us something i have to say ulbricht said discouraging but i have to say it i was here from the time the generator lights went out until they came on again with their red heads those two men are unmistakable neither of them left their seats in that time well now margaret morrison had an air of satisfaction about her rather puts a damper on your theory doesnt it mr mckinnon sad sister very sad you really would like to prove me wrong wouldnt you i have the odd feeling that i will have been proved wrong before this trip is over not by you though he shook his head its still sad sister morrison could be very persistent she put on her best ward sisters face and said you heard what the lieutenant said neither of those two men left their seats during the crucial period i should be astonished if they had done margaret morrisons prim frown gave way to perplexity which in turn yielded to a certain wariness mckinnon looked at ulbricht lieutenant we are not just dealing with flannelfoot number two we are dealing with flannelfeet numbers two and three we have established that it was number two a crew member who blew the hole in the ballast room when we were alongside that sinking corvette but no crew member under suspicion was within hearing range of sister morrison so the finger points at hartley or simons maybe both it was clever there was no way we could reasonably associate them with the misfortune of the san andreas for at the time the first hole was blown in the ballast they were still in hospital in murmansk where one or both had been suborned of course neither was going to leave his seat during the time of the attack that could have been too obvious ulbricht tapped his head the only thing that is obvious to me is that lieutenant ulbricht is not at his brightest and best today hit me over the head with a twobyfour long enough and ill see the point as fast as any man of course you have the right of it obvious he looked at margaret morrison dont you agree there was a distinct tinge of red in the normally pale face i suppose so theres no supposing the bosun sounded slightly weary what happened was that the information was passed on before well before the engines stopped how long before the engines stopped did wayland day ask you the question about ward a i dont know im not sure come on margaret cant you see its important fifteen minutes she said uncertainly maybe twenty im really not sure of course youre not people dont check their watches every five minutes but during those fifteen or twenty minutes one of those two men left his seat and returned yes her voice was very low which one i dont know i really dont please believe me i know i said earlier that i could easily identify them please margaret i believe you what you meant is that you could identify them as a pair not individually both look uncommonly alike both have red hair and you didnt even know their names she smiled at him a grateful little smile but said nothing you do have the right of it bosun apart from that im convinced of it because theres no other explanation patterson rubbed his chin this interrogation business like mr jamieson and yourself i dont really think im cid material how do we set about it i suggest we first try to establish their bona fides if any to see if they are what they say they are hartley claims to be an engineroom artificer ill leave him to you simons says hes a leading torpedo operator ill speak to him he looked at his watch the five minutes are up patterson didnt invite either man to sit for some seconds he looked at them coolly and thoughtfully then said my name is chief engineer patterson i am in temporary command of this vessel and have some questions to ask the reasons for the questioning can wait which of you is er a hartley i am sir hartley was slightly taller slightly more heavily built than simons but otherwise the resemblance was remarkable margaret morrisons confusion over the pair was more than understandable you claim to be an era can you prove it trove it hartley was taken aback what do you mean prove it sir i dont have any certificates on me if thats what youre after you could pass a practical test a practical test hartleys face cleared of course sir ive never been in your engineroom but thats no matter an era is an era take me to your engineroom and ill identify any piece of equipment you have i can do that blindfold all i have to do is touch ill tell you the purpose of that or any piece of equipment and i can strip it down and put it together again hm patterson looked at jamieson what do you think i wouldnt waste our time sir neither would i he nodded to the bosun who looked at simons you lto simons yeah and who are you mckinnon looked at the thin arrogant face and thought it unlikely that they would ever be bloodbrothers youre not an officer im a seaman i dont answer questions from a merchant navy seaman you will you know patterson said mr mckinnon is hardly the equivalent of the royal navys ordinary seaman the senior seaman aboard the equivalent of your warrant officer not that it matters to you what he is hes acting under my orders and if you defy him you defy me you understand no mckinnon said in a mild voice no sir when youre talking to a senior officer simons sneered there was a blur of movement and simons was doubled over making retching sounds and gasping for breath mckinnon looked at him unemotionally as he gradually straightened and said to patterson may i have an option as regards this man sir hes an obvious suspect he is you may either irons bread and water till we reach port or a private interrogation with me irons simons voice was a wheeze a mckinnon jab to the solar plexus was not something from which one made an instant recovery you cant do that to me i can and if necessary will pattersons tone was chillingly indifferent i am in command of this ship if i choose i can have you over the side alternatively if i have proof that you are a spy i can have you shot as a spy wartime regulations say so wartime regulations in fact said nothing of the kind but it was most unlikely that simons knew this ill settle for the private interrogation mckinnon said a horrified margaret morrison said archie you cant be quiet pattersons voice was cold i suggest simons that you will be well advised to answer a few simple questions simons scowled and said nothing mckinnon said you an lto course i am can you prove it like hartley here i havent any certificates with me and you dont have any torpedoes to test me with not that you would know one end of a torpedo from another whats your barracks portsmouth where did you qualify lto portsmouth of course when early fortythree let me see your paybook mckinnon examined it briefly then looked up at simons very new and very clean some people look after their things you didnt make a very good job of looking after your old one did you what the hell do you mean this is either a new one a stolen one or a forged one gods sake i dont know what youre talking about you know all right the bosun tossed the paybook on the table thats a forgery youre a liar and youre not an lto unfortunately for you simons i was a torpedo gunners mate in the navy no ltos qualified in portsmouth in early nineteen fortythree or indeed for some considerable time before and after that they qualified at roedean college near brighton used to be the leading girls school in britain before the war youre a fraud and a spy simons whats the name of your accomplice aboard the san andreas i dont know what youre talking about amnesia mckinnon stood and looked at patterson permission to lock him up sir permission granted nobodys going to bloody well lock me up simons shouted i demand his voice broke off in a scream as mckinnon twisted his forearm high up behind his back youll stay here sir mckinnon said patterson nodded i wont be long five ten minutes we wont be needingera hartley any more of course not sorry about that era but we had to know i understand sir it was quite apparent that he did not understand you dont but well explain later hartley left followed by mckinnon and simons the latter with his right wrist still somewhere up in the vicinity of his left shoulderblade ten minutes margaret morrison said it takes ten minutes to lock up a man sister morrison patterson said she looked at him i admire you as a nurse i like you as a person but dont interfere in things or presume to pass judgement on things you know nothing about the bosun may only be a bosun but he operates at a level you know nothing about if it werent for him youd be either a prisoner or dead instead of constantly sniping at him youd be better occupied in giving thanks for a world where theres still a few archie mckinnons around he broke off and cursed in silent selfreproach as he saw tears trickling down the lowered head mckinnon pushed simons inside an empty cabin locked the door pocketed the key turned and hit simons in exactly the same spot as previously although with considerably more force simons staggered backwards across the corticene smashed heavily into the bulkhead and slid to the deck mckinnon picked him up held his right arm against the bulkhead and struck his right biceps with maximum power simons screamed tried to move his right arm and found it impossible it was completely paralysed the bosun repeated the process on the left arm and let him slide down again i am prepared to keep this up indefinitely mckinnons voice was conversational almost pleasant im going to keep on hitting you and if necessary kicking you anywhere between your shoulders and toes there wont be a mark on your face i dont like spies i dont like traitors and i dont care too much for people with innocent blood on their hands mckinnon returned to the lounge and resumed his seat ulbricht looked at his watch and said four minutes my word you do keep your word mr mckinnon a little dispatch thats all he looked at margaret morrison and the still visible tear stains whats wrong nothing its just this whole horrible ugly business its not nice he looked at her for a speculative moment made as if to say something then changed his mind simons has come all over cooperative and volunteered some information cooperative margaret said incredulously volunteered never judge a man by his appearances there are hidden depths in all of us his name is not simons its braun au not ow german surely patterson said sounds that way but he is rn his passport is a forgery someone in murmansk gave it to him he couldnt be more specific than that i assume it must have been a member of what must now be that espionage ring up there hes not an lto hes an sba a sick bay attendant which ties in rather nicely with the chloroform used twice and the drugging of captain andropolous he tossed two keys on the table im sure dr sinclair will confirm that those are the dispensary keys goodness me jamieson said you have not been idle bosun and thats a fact he braun must have been most communicative he was indeed he even gave me the identity of flannelfoot number two what remember margaret that i said to you only a few minutes ago that i would be proved wrong about something before the trip was over well it hasnt taken long for me to prove i was right about that its mccrimmon mccrimmon jamieson was half out of his seat mccrimmon that bloody young bastard you are sitting well more or less next to a young lady mckinnons tone of reproof was mild ah yes so i am sorry sister jamieson sat again but mccrimmon i think the fault is mainly mine sir ive been on record as saying that although he was a criminal i regarded him as a trustworthy criminal serious flaw in judgement but i was half right i can accept that it was mccrimmon pattersons tone was calm and if he was upset it wasnt showing never liked him truculent offensive foul mouthed two terms in barlinnie the maximum security prison outside glasgow both for street violence i should imagine that the feel of an iron crowbar in his hand is nothing new to that man the royal navy would never have accepted a man with his record one can only assume that we have lower standards he paused and considered we pull him in i wonder id love to have a little chat with him point is mr patterson i dont think wed get any useful information out of him men who hired him would be far too clever to tell a character like mccrimmon any more than he needed to know they certainly wouldnt tell him what their plans their end was it would be a case of just do so andso and heres your cash also sir if we leave him loose we can watch every move he makes without his knowing that we are watching its quite possible he has something more up his sleeve and if we can watch him in the act of what hes doing it might give us some very valuable information indeed what i cant imagine but i have the feeling that we should give him that little more rope i agree if hes bent on hanging himself just that little more rope lieutenant ulbricht had found them a star to steer themselves by he was on the bridge with mckinnon as the san andreas headed due west at full speed curran at the wheel cloud cover was patchy the wind light and the sea relatively calm ulbricht had just caught a brief but sufficient glance of the pole star and had established that they were in almost exactly the same place as they had been at noon that morning he had remained on the bridge where he seemed to prefer to spend his time except the bosun couldnt help noticing during those periods when margaret morrison was off duty think weve shaken him now mr mckinnon three and a half hours maybe four since we may have shaken him nor hide nor hair of him and thats a fact but because we cant see him as i keep on saying doesnt mean that hes not there but yes i do have this odd feeling that we may have slipped him i have a certain regard for your socalled odd feelings i only said may we wont know for certain until the first condor comes along with its flares i wish you wouldnt talk about such things anyway its possible that we may have lost him and that the fockewulf may fail to find us how long do you intend to maintain this course the longer the better i should think they have lost us then theyll probably reason that were heading back on a course to aberdeen as far as we know they have no reason to believe that we have reason to believe that they know were heading for aberdeen and would therefore opt for some place else so they may still think that were on a roughly southsouthwest course instead of due west i have heard it said lieutenant ulbricht i cant remember who it was that some germans at some times have onetrack minds nonsense look at our poets and playwrights our composers and philosophers ulbricht was silent for some moments and mckinnon could imagine him smiling to himself in the darkness well yes maybe now and again i sincerely hope that this is one of those times the longer they keep combing the area in the direction of aberdeen and the longer we keep heading west the less chance they will have of locating us so we keep this course for an hour or two more yes longer i propose that we maintain this course throughout the night then shortly before dawn lay off a course directly for scapa flow sounds fair enough to me thatll mean leaving the shetlands on our port hand may even have a glimpse of your islands pity you couldnt drop in in passing therell come a day dinnertime lieutenant so soon mustnt miss that coming may as well curran get on the phone and ask ferguson to come up here tell him to keep a constant lookout on both wings degrees you understand ill do that whats he supposed to be looking out for bosun flares mckinnon met jamieson just after theyd entered the messdeck and drew him to one side our traitorous friend been up to anything he should not have been up to sir no guaranteed chief patterson and i had a discussion and we decided to take all the engineroom staff into our confidence well all except one reilly who seems to be the only person who talks to him reilly apart mccrimmon would win any unpopularity contest without trying hes the most cordially detested person in the engineroom so we spoke to each man individually told them the score and told them not to discuss the matter with any other member of the crew so hell be under constant supervision both in the engineroom and in the messdecks he looked closely at mckinnon we thought it a good idea you dont seem quite sure whatever you and mr patterson decide is okay by me dammit jamieson spoke with some feeling i suggested to the chief that we talk to you but he was sure youd think it a good idea i really dont know sir mckinnon was doubtful it seems a good idea but well mccrimmon may be a villain but hes a clever villain dont forget that hes gone completely undetected and unsuspected so far and would have kept on that way but for a lucky accident being a crude violent and detestable person with a penchant for crowbars doesnt mean that he cant be sensitive to atmosphere to people being overcasual on the one hand and too furtively watchful on the other also if reilly is on speaking terms with him shouldnt he be under observation too its not all that bad bosun even if he does suspect hes under observation isnt that a guarantee for his good behaviour either that or a guarantee that when if he does something he shouldnt be doing hes going to make damn sure that theres no one around when he does it which is the last thing we wanted if he believed he was still in the clear he might have betrayed himself now he never will mckinnon looked at their table wheres mr patterson jamieson looked uncomfortable keeping an eye on things keeping an eye on things keeping an eye on mccrimmon you mean mr patterson has never missed dinner since joining this ship you know that i know that and you can be sure mccrimmon knows that if he has the slightest suspicion that we have the slightest suspicion i can just hear those alarm bells clanging in his head it is possible jamieson said slowly that it may not have been such a good idea after all patterson wasnt the only absentee at the table that night janet magnusson was on duty and both sister maria and dr sinclair were engaged in the ticklish and rather painful task of rebandaging captain bowens head captain bowen it was reported was making a considerable amount of noise jamieson said does dr sinclair think hell be able to see again jamieson like the three others at the table was nursing a glass of wine while waiting for the first course to be served hes pretty sure margaret morrison said so am i some days yet though the eyelids are badly blistered and the rest of the ward sound asleep as usual she winced and shook her head and jamieson said hastily sorry that wasnt a very tactful question was it she smiled its all right its just that itll take me a day or two to get simons and mccrimmon out of my head as usual only mr kennet is awake perhaps oberleutnant klaussen is too its hard to say never still keeps rambling on and making as little sense as ever mckinnon said none all in german of course except for one word in english which he keeps repeating over and over again as if he was haunted by it its odd the theme of scotland keeps cropping up all the time she looked at ulbricht you know scotland well were headed for scotland im halfscots archie and janet although they claim to be shetlanders are really scots mckinnon said and dont forget the lad with the chloroform pad she grimaced i wish you hadnt said that sorry stupid and whats the scots connection with klaussen its the word he keeps repeating edinburgh ah edinburgh the athens of the north ulbricht sounded very enthusiastic know it well very well better than most scots i dare say edinburgh castle holyrood palace the shrine the gardens princes street the most beautiful of all his voice trailed off then he said in a sharp tone mr mckinnon whats the matter the other two looked at the bosun his eyes were those of a man who was seeing things at a great distance and the knuckles of the big hand around the glass were showing white suddenly the glass shattered and the red wine flowed over the table archie the girl reached across the table and caught his wrist archie what is it well now that was a damn stupid thing to do wasnt it the voice was calm without emotion the bosun back on balance again he wiped away the blood with a paper napkin sorry about that she twisted his wrist until the palm showed youve cut yourself quite badly it doesnt matter edinburgh is it hes haunted by it thats what you said margaret haunted so he damn well ought to be and i should be haunted too all my life for being so blind so bloody well eternally stupid how can you say such a thing if you see something that we cant see then were all more stupid than you are no because i know something that you dont know what is it then there was curiosity in her voice but it was overlaid by a deeper apprehension what is it mckinnon smiled margaret i would have thought that you of all people would have learnt the dangers of talking in public would you please bring captain bowen to the lounge i cant hes having his head bandaged i rather think margaret you should do what the bosun suggests it was the first time that ulbricht had used her christian name in company something tells me that the captain will need no second invitation and bring your pal mckinnon said what i have to say may well be of interest to her she looked at him for a long and thoughtful moment then nodded and left without a word mckinnon watched her go an equally thoughtful expression on his face then turned to jamieson i think you should ask one of your men to request mr patterson to come to the lounge also captain bowen came into the lounge accompanied by dr sinclair who had no alternative but to come for he was still only halfway through rebandaging bowens head it looks as if well have to change our minds again about our plans mckinnon said he had a certain air of resignation about him due not to the change in plans but to the fact that janet was firmly bandaging his cut palm its certain now that the germans if they cant take us will send us to the bottom the san andreas is no longer a hospital ship its more of a treasure ship we are carrying a fortune in gold i dont know how much but i would guess at something between twenty and thirty million pounds sterling nobody said anything there wasnt much one could make in the way of comment about such a preposterous statement and the bosuns relaxed certainty didnt encourage what might have been the expected exclamatory chorus of surprise doubt or disbelief it is of course russian gold almost certainly in exchange for lendlease the germans would love to get their hands on it for i suppose gold is gold no matter what the country of origin but if they cant get it theyre going to make damned sure that britain doesnt get it either and this is not out of spite or frustration although i suppose that that would play some part but what matters is this the british government is bound to know that were carrying this gold youve only got to think about it for a moment to see that this must have been a joint planned operation between the soviet and british governments using a hospital ship as a gold transport jamiesons disbelief was total the british government would never be guilty of such a pernicious act i am in no position to comment on that sir i can imagine that our government can be as perfidious as any other and there are plenty of perfidious governments around ethics i should think take very much a back seat in war if there are any ethics in war all i want to say about the government is that they are going to be damned suspicious of the russians and would put the worst possible interpretation on our disappearance they may well arrive at the conclusion that the russians intercepted the ship after it had sailed got rid of the crew sailed the san andreas to any port in northern russia unloaded the gold and scuttled the ship alternatively they might well believe the russians didnt even bother to load any gold at all but just lay in wait for the san andreas the russians do have a submarine fleet small as it is in murmansk and archangel whichever option the government prefers to believe and i can imagine it highly likely that they will believe one or the other the result will be the same and one that would delight the hearts of the germans the british government is going to believe that the russians welshed on the deal and will be extremely suspicious not only of this but of any future deal theyll never be able to prove anything but there is something they can do reduce or even stop all future lendlease to russia this could be a more effective way of stopping allied supplies to russia than all the uboats in the north atlantic and arctic there was quite a long silence then bowen said its a very plausible scenario bosun attractive if one may use that word even convincing but it does rather depend on one thing why do you think we have this gold aboard i dont think sir i know only a few minutes ago just after we had sat down to dinner sister morrison here happened to mention oberleutnant klaussens constant delirious ramblings in his delirium one word kept recurring edinburgh sister says he seemed to be haunted by that word i should damn well think he was it was not so very long ago that a uboat sent the cruiser edinburgh to the bottom on her way back from russia the edinburgh was carrying at least twenty million pounds of gold bullion in her holds good god bowens voice was no more than a whisper good god above you have the right of it archie by heaven you have the right of it it all ties in too damn nicely sir it had been dunned into klaussen that he was not to repeat the exploits of his illustrious predecessor who had dispatched the edinburgh it also accounts the sinking of the edinburgh i mean for the rather underhanded decision to use the san andreas any cruiser any destroyer can be sunk by the geneva convention hospital ships are inviolate i only wish i had told you sooner margaret morrison said hed been muttering about edinburgh ever since he was brought aboard i should have realized that it must have meant something youve nothing to reproach yourself with mckinnon said why should the word have had any significance for you delirious men rave on about anything it wouldnt have made the slightest difference if we had found out earlier what does matter is that we have found out before its too late at least i hope its not too late if there are any reproaches going they should come in my direction at least i knew about the edinburgh dont think anyone else did and shouldnt have had to be reminded of it spilt milk it does all mesh together doesnt it jamieson said explains why they wouldnt let you and mr kennet see what was going on behind that tarpaulin when they were repairing the hole in the ships side they didnt want you to see that they were replacing that ballast theyd taken out to lighten ship by a different sort of ballast altogether i suppose you knew what the original ballast looked like as a matter of fact i didnt im sure mr kennet didnt know either the russians werent to know that and took no chances oh im sure theyd have painted the bullion grey or whatever the colour of the ballast was the size and shape of the blocks and bars of the gold would almost certainly have been different hence the no entry sign at the tarpaulin everything that has happened since can be explained by the presence of that gold jamieson paused seemed to hesitate then nodded as if he had made up his mind doesnt it strike you bosun that mccrimmon poses a bit of a problem not really hes a double agent damn it jamieson was more than a little chagrined id hoped for once that i might be the first to come up with the solution to a problem a close run thing mckinnon said the same question had occurred to me at the same time its the only answer isnt it espionage history or so i am led to believe is full of accounts of double agents mccrimmons just another his primary employer his only really true employer is of course germany we may find out we may not how the germans managed to infiltrate him into the service of the russians but infiltrate him they did sure it was the russians who instructed him to blow that hole in the ballast room but that was even more in the germans interest than the russians both had compelling reasons to find an excuse to divert the san andreas to murmansk the russians to load the gold the germans to load simons and that charge in the ballast room a tangled story bowen said but not so tangled when you take the threads apart this alters things more than a little doesnt it bosun i rather think it does sir any idea of the best course i use that word in both its senses to take for the future im open to suggestions youll get none from me with all respect to dr sinclair his ministrations have just about closed down a mind that wasnt working all that well in the first place mr patterson mckinnon said mr jamieson oh no jamieson said i have no intention of being caught out in that way again it does my morale no good to have it quietly explained to me why my brilliant scheme wont work and why it would be much better to do it your way besides im an engineer what do you have in mind on your own heads i have in mind to continue on this course which is due west until about midnight this will help to take us even further away from the heinkels and stukas im not particularly worried about them they rarely attack after dark and if were right in our assumption that weve slipped that uboat then they dont know where to look for us and the absence of any flares from a condor would suggest that if they are looking they are looking in the wrong place at midnight ill ask the lieutenant to lay off a course for aberdeen we must hope that there will be a few helpful stars around that would take us pretty close to the east coast of the shetlands lieutenant very close indeed i should say hailing distance youll be able to wave a last farewell to your homeland mr mckinnon mr mckinnon isnt going to wave farewell to any place the voice was janet magnussons and it was pretty positive he needs a holiday he tells me hes homesick and lerwick is his home right archie you have the second sight janet if mckinnon was chagrined at having his thunder stolen he showed no signs of it i thought it might be a good idea captain to stop off a bit in lerwick and have a look at what we have up front this has two advantages i think were certain now that the germans will sink us sooner than permit our safe arrival in any british port and the further south we go the greater the likelihood of being clobbered so we make as little southing as possible secondly if we are found by either plane or uboat theyll be able to confirm that were still on a direct course to aberdeen and so have plenty of time in hand at the appropriate moment well turn west round a place called bard head then northwest and north to lerwick from the time we alter course till the time we reach harbour shouldnt be much more than an hour and it would take rather longer than that for the german bombers to scramble from bergen and reach there sounds pretty good to me jamieson said i wish i could say the same its far too easy too cut and dried and theres always the possibility of the germans figuring out that thats exactly what we will do probability would be more like its too close to a counsel of desperation but its the least of all the evils i can imagine and we have to make a break for it some time as i keep on saying bosun jamieson said its a great comfort having you around twelve the time wore on to midnight and still the condors kept away apart from two men on watch in the engineroom naseby and trent on the bridge and lieutenant ulbricht and mckinnon in the captain cabin two hospital lookouts and two night nurses everyone was asleep or appeared to be asleep or should have been asleep the wind backing to the north had freshened to force four and there was a moderate sea running enough to make the san andreas roll as she headed steadily west but not enough to inconvenience one in the captains cabin lieutenant ulbricht looked up from the chart he had been studying then glanced at his watch ten minutes to midnight not that the precise time matters well be making course alterations as we go along i suggest we take a last sight then head for the shetlands dawn came a cold and grey and blustery dawn and still the condors stayed away at ten oclock a rather weary mckinnon hed been on the wheel since am went below in search of breakfast he found jamieson having a cup of coffee a peaceful night bosun does look as if weve shaken them off doesnt it so it would seem seem only seem jamieson looked at him speculatively do i detect a note of something less than cheerful confidence a whole night long without a sign of the enemy surely we should be happy with our present circumstances sure i am the presents just fine what im not so happy about is the future its not only quiet and peaceful at the moment its too damn quiet and peaceful as the old saying goes its the lull before the storm the present the lull the future the storm dont you feel it sir no i dont jamieson looked away and frowned slightly well i didnt not until you came along and disturbed the quiet and even tenor of my way any moment now and youll be telling me im living in a fools paradise that would be stretching it a bit sir too quiet too peaceful maybe it is at that cat and mouse again with us of course in the role of mouse they have us pinned and are just waiting for a convenient moment convenient for them that is to strike yes ive just spent six hours on the wheel and ive had plenty of time to think about it two minutes should have been enough if theres anybody living in a fools paradise its been me how many fockewulf condors do you think they have in the trondheim and bergen airfields sir i dont know too damn many for my liking im sure and for mine three or four of them acting in concert could cover ten thousand square miles in a couple of hours all depending upon how high they are and what the visibility is bound to locate us us the most valuable prize on the norwegian sea but they havent they havent even bothered to try why because they know where we are because we didnt manage to slip that submarine after sunset mckinnon nodded and propped his chin on his hands his breakfast lay untouched before him you did your best bosun there was never any guarantee you cant reproach yourself oh yes i can its a thing im getting pretty good at reproaching myself i mean but in this case not for the reason you think given only the slightest degree of luck we should have shaken him yesterday evening we didnt we forgot the factor x you sound like an advertisement bosun factor x the secret ingredient in the latest ladies cosmetics what i mean sir is that even if we slipped him moved out of his asdic listening range he could still have found us asdic or not condors or not a good archer always carries a second string for his bow a second string jamieson put his cup down very carefully you mean we have a second of those damned location transmitter bugs aboard can you think of any other solution sir luck has made us too smug too selfconfident to the extent that we have been guilty of gravely underestimating the ungodly singh or mccrimmon or simons all three of them for all i know have been smarter than us smart enough anyway to gamble on the likelihood of our missing the glaringly obvious just because it was too obvious chances are high that this wont be a transceiver just a simple transmitter no bigger than a ladys handbag but weve already searched bosun very thoroughly indeed if there wasnt anything there then there wont be anything now i mean transmitters just dont materialise out of thin air no but there could have been one before we made our search it could have been transferred elsewhere before that its entirely possible that any or all of the three flannelfeet may have anticipated just such a search sure we combed the area of the hospital cabins storerooms galleys everything but thats all we did search yes but where else jamieson broke off and looked thoughtful yes sir the same thought had occurred to me the superstructure is no more than an uninhabited warren at the moment isnt it just jamieson put down his cup and rose well heighho for the superstructure ill take a couple of my boys with me would they recognize a bug if they saw one i dont think i would i would all theyve got to do is to bring me any piece of equipment that has no place aboard a ship after he had gone mckinnon reflected that jamieson in addition to his engineering qualifications was also an amiee and as such probably able to identify a bug not more than ten minutes later jamieson returned smiling widely and in evident satisfaction the unfailing instinct of your true bughunter bosun got it first time unerring you might say where cunning devils suppose they thought it would be ironic and the last place we wouldlook what more fitting place for a radio device than a wrecked radio room not only had they used one of the few undamaged batteries there to power it theyd even rigged up a makeshift aerial not that you would ever know that it was an aerial of any kind not just to look at it congratulations sir that was well done is it still in place yes first instincts of course were to rip the damn thing out but then wiser counsels if i can use that term about myself prevailed if they have us on that transmitter then they have us on their asdic of course and if wed dismantled our set and stopped the engine and generator theyd just have poked their periscope above the surface and located us in nothing flat therell be a better time and better place to dismantle that bug during the night you mean bosun if were still afloat by nightfall im not rightly sure sir as you infer it all depends upon what condition were in come the dark jamieson looked at him in what could have been a faintly disbelieving speculation but said nothing mckinnon in an empty cabin next to that of captain andropolous was sound asleep when johnny holbrook shook him half an hour after noon mr naseby is on the phone sir mckinnon sat up in his bunk rubbed his eyes and looked with something less than favour at the teenage ward orderly who like wayland day walked in awe of the bosun couldnt somebody else have spoken to him sorry sir specially asked for you mckinnon moved out into the messdeck where people were already gathering for lunch patterson was there with jamieson and sinclair together with margaret morrison and nurse irene he picked up the phone george i was in a better world right now sorry about that archie thought youd better know we have company naseby could have been talking about the weather ah starboard about two miles a bit under perhaps says to stop or he will fire oh also says that if we try to alter course he will sink us is that so so he says may even mean it shall i turn into him yes full power ill ask for it up in a minute he replaced the phone my word margaret morrison said that was an intriguing conversation full of information if i may say so we bosuns are men of few words mr patterson could we have full power patterson nodded heavily rose without speaking and crossed to the telephone jamieson said in a resigned voice no need to ask i suppose no sir sorry about your lunch the usual ah direct tactics sinclair said no option man says hes going to sink us hes going to say more than that when he sees us altering course towards him jamieson said hes going to say that the san andreas is crewed by a bunch of unreconstructed lunatics if he does he could well be right as he turned to go ulbricht put out a restraining hand im coming too please not lieutenant i dont believe our new acquaintance is going to sink us but hes sure as hell going to try to stop us the primary target will be the bridge im sure you want to undo all the good work dr sinclair and the nursing staff have already done the stitching and bandaging all over again selfish margaret you stay where you are karl ulbricht ulbricht scowled shrugged smiled and stayed where he was when mckinnon reached the bridge the san andreas under maximum helm was already beginning to slew round to starboard naseby looked round as mckinnon entered take the wheel archie hes sending naseby moved out on the starboard wing someone on the conningtower of the uboat was indeed using an aldis lamp but transmitting very slowly almost certainly mckinnon guessed because a nonenglishspeaking operator was sending letter by given letter forard of the conningtower three men were crouched around the deckgun which as far as the bosun could judge at that distance was pointed directly at them the signalling ceased what does he say george regain course stop or i fire send him that bit about a hospital ship and the geneva convention he wont pay a blind bit of attention send it anyway distract him give us time the rules say you dont shoot a man when youre having a conversation with him naseby started transmitting but almost immediately jumped back inside the bridge the puff of smoke from the gun was unmistakable as was the shock and sound of a shell exploding inside the superstructure almost immediately afterwards naseby gave mckinnon a reproachful look theyre not playing by your rules archie so it would seem can you see where weve been hit naseby went out on the starboard wing and looked below and aft crews messdeck he said well what was the crews messdeck nobody there now of course not what they were aiming for you can be sure of that a force four is nothing to us but it makes for a very unstable gunplatform on a submarine i dont like that very much george theyre liable to hit anywhere except where theyre aiming for we can only hope that the next one is as high above the bridge as that one was below it the next one came straight through the bridge it shattered the starboard forard window one of those that had been replaced after klaussens machinegunners had destroyed them penetrated the thin sheetmetal that separated the bridge from what had been the wireless office and exploded just beyond the sliding wooden door now hi a hundred jagged fragments blew forward into the bridge and the concussive blast of the explosion sent both men staggering mckinnon against the wheel naseby against a small chart table but the razorsharp shards of the shell casing had flown in the other direction and both men were unhurt naseby recovered some of the air that had been driven from his lungs theyre improving archie fluke the san andreas its superstructure beginning to vibrate quite badly as engine revolutions built up was now bearing down directly on the conningtower of the uboat which however was still considerably more than a mile distant next one will miss the bridge by a mile the next one in fact missed the ship completely and went into the sea a hundred yards astern of the san andreas it did not detonate on impact the following shell struck somewhere in the vicinity of the bows where it had exploded was impossible to tell from the bridge for there was no visible uplifting or buckling of the focsle deck but that it had done its damage was beyond doubt the furious rattling of chain as one of the fore anchors plunged down to the floor of the norwegian sea could be heard a mile away the rattling ceased as abruptly as it had begun the fastening doubtless torn from the floor of the chain locker no loss naseby said whos ever anchored in a thousand feet or whatever who cares about the anchor point is are we open to the sea yet another shell buried itself in the bows and this time there was no doubt where it had landed for a small area of the focsle deck port side lifted upwards almost a foot open to the sea or not naseby said this hardly seems to be the time to investigate not as long as they are zeroing in on the bows which is what they appear to be doing were all that closer now so theyre getting all the more accurate they seem to be going for the waterline it cant be that they want to sink us and dont they know the gold is there i dont know what they know probably know theres gold aboard no reason why they should know where not that a little shrapnel lowers the value of gold anyway i suppose we should be grateful for small mercies at this angle of approach its impossible that they can hit the hospital area a third shell struck and exploded in the bows in almost the same position as the previous one the already uplifted section of the focsle had heaved up almost another foot thats where the paint and carpenters shops are naseby said absently thats what ive been thinking were ferguson and curran in the messdeck when you left thats why ive been thinking cant remember seeing them although thats not to say they werent there theyre such an idle couple they might well have passed up lunch for an hours kip i should have warned them there wasnt time for you to warn anyone i could have sent someone i did think theyd concentrate their fire on the bridge but i should still have sent someone my fault slipping as i told jamieson he paused narrowed his eyes in concentration and said i think theyre turning away george naseby had the glasses to his eyes they are and theres someone on the bridge captain or whoever using a loudhailer ah the gun crew are working on their gun and yes theyre aligning it fore andaft this mean what i think it means archie well the conningtowers empty and the gun crew are going down the hatch so it must mean what you think see any bubbles coming up no wait a minute yes yes lots blowing main ballast but were still a mile away from them captains taking no chances and i dont blame him hes not a clown like klaussen they watched for some moments in silence the uboat was now at a є angle the decks barely awash and vanishing quickly take the wheel george give the chief engineer a ring will you tell him whats happened and ask him to drop down to normal speed then back on the course we were on im going to check on any flooding forard naseby watched him go and knew that flooding was secondary in the bosuns mind he was going to find out whether indeed curran and ferguson had elected to miss lunch mckinnon was back in about ten minutes he had a bottle of scotch in his hand and two glasses and no smile on his face naseby said their luck run out abandoned by fortune george abandoned by mckinnon archie you must stop it please stop blaming yourself whats done is done janet had intercepted him as he had entered the messdeck he had come down with naseby and left trent on the wheel with jones and mcguigan as lookouts and pulled him into a corner oh i know thats trite meaningless if you want and if you want another trite and meaningless remark you cant bring back the dead true true the bosun smiled without humour and speaking of the dead and one should speak no ill of the dead they were a couple of moderately useless characters but both were married both had two daughters what would they think if they knew that the gallant bosun in his anxiety to get at a uboat completely forgot them the best thing would be if ow forgot them sounds cruel i know but let the dead bury their dead we are alive when i say we im not talking about you im talking about every other person aboard including myself your duty is to the living dont you know that every single person this ship from the captain and mr patterson down depends on you were depending on you to take us home do be quiet woman youll take me home archie scalloway hop skip and jump of course i will she stood back at arms length hands on his shoulders searched his eyes then smiled you know archie i really believe you will he smiled in return im glad of that he didnt for a moment believe it himself but there was no point in spreading undue gloom and despondency they joined patterson jamieson and ulbricht at the table patterson pushed a glass in front of him t would say that you have earned that bosun a splendid job not so splendid sir i had no option but to do what i did cant say i feel sorry for a uboat captain but hes really up against a nearly impossible problem faced with a hiding to nothing hes under orders not to sink us so the best he can do is to try to incapacitate us as much as possible we run at him and he hides simple as that the way you put it yes i hear you had a very narrow escape on the bridge if the shell had passed through metal and exploded in the bridge that would have been it but it passed through the glass instead luck and up front three holes all above the waterline what with those and the damage that the uboat did to us rather the damage we inflicted on ourselves theres going to be a fair old job for the ship repairers when we get into dry dock the watertight bulkheads seem sound enough thats the good part the bad part and im afraid this is all my fault is that archie janets voice was sharp oh all right youll have heard ferguson and curran are dead i know and im sorry damnable that makes twenty now patterson thought for a few moments you reckon this situation will continue for some time what situation sir that they keep on trying to stop us instead of sinking us mckinnon shrugged it is much more important to the germans that they discredit the russians with our government than that they get the gold as things stand at the moment they want both to have their cake and eat it factor of greed really so as long as they remain greedy were relatively safe safe from sinking yes but not safe from being taken over but you just said all they have to do is to bring up another uboat and theyll have us cold with two uboats we have no chance if we go after one the other will parallel our course and pump shells into us at their leisure not the engineroom of course they want to take us under our own steam to norway the hospital area first shell in there and the white flag flies if weve any sense wed fly it before the first shot next time i go up to the bridge ill take a nice big bedsheet with me there are times bosun jamieson said when i wish youd keep your thoughts to yourself merely answering a question sir and i have another thought another question if you like only a tiny handful of people would have known of this operation the plan to use the san andreas as a bullion carrier a cabinet minister or two an admiral or two no more i wonder who the traitor is who sold us down the river we get back and if some famous and prominent person unaccountably commits suicide then well know he rose if youll excuse me i have some work to do what work archie it was janet havent you done enough for one day a bosuns work is never done routine janet just routine he left the messdeck routine janet said what routine currans dead she looked puzzled i know that curran was the sailmaker its the sailmakers job to sew up the dead janet rose hastily and left the table patterson gave jamieson a sour look there are times second when i wish you would keep your thoughts to yourself you do have half an eye i take it true true delicacy a water buffalo could have done it better thirteen patterson finished speaking by this time he was getting quite professional at reading burial services planks tilted and the shrouded forms of curran and ferguson slid down into the icy wastes of the norwegian sea it was then that the engineroom noise faded away and the san andreas began to slow nearly all the crew were on deck the dead men had been an amiable enough couple and well liked the cooks and stewards were below as were the nursing staff and three stokers trent and jones were on the bridge jamieson was the first to move it looks he said as if we have made a mistake he walked away not quickly with the air of a man who knew that this was not a moment that called for any particular urgency patterson and mckinnon followed more slowly patterson said what did he mean by that that weve made a mistake i mean he was being kind sir what he meant was that the allwise bosun has made another blunder who was on watch down below just young stephen you know the polish boy lets hope hes not the next to go over the side patterson stopped and caught mckinnon by the arm what do you mean by that and what do you mean blunder the one thing ties up with the other mckinnons voice sounded dull maybe im tired maybe im not thinking too well did you notice who wasnt at the funeral sir patterson looked at him for a few silent moments then said the nursing staff kitchen staff stewards men on the bridge his grip tightened on the bosuns arm and mccrimmon indeed and whose brilliant idea was it to let mccrimmon roam around on the loose it just worked out the wrong way you cant think of everything no man can hes a slippery customer this mccrimmon do you think well be able to pin anything on him im certain we wont nevertheless sir id like your permission to lock him up mckinnon shook his head his face bitter theres nothing like locking the door when the horse has bolted stephen was lying on the steel plates covered with oil still gushing from a severed fuel line there was a rapidly forming bruise bleeding slightly behind his right ear sinclair finished examining his head and straightened ill have him taken to hospital xray but i dont think it necessary i should think hell waken up with nothing more than a sore head he looked at the two steel objects lying on the deckplates beside stephen you know who did this bosun yes the stilson wrench that laid him out and the fireaxe that slashed the fuel line there could be fingerprints no with his toe mckinnon touched a clump of engineroom waste he used that and therell be no prints on that he looked at patterson this line can be replaced sir it can how long second couple of hours jamieson said give or take mckinnon said would you come along with me mr patterson it will be a pleasure bosun you could have killed him you know mckinnon said conversationally from his bench seat in the messdeck mccrimmon looked up with an insolent stare what the bloody hell are you talking about stephen stephen what about stephen his broken head i still dont know what youre talking about broken head how did he get a broken head because you went down to the engineroom and did it and cut open a fuel line youre crazy i havent left this seat in the past quarter of an hour then you must have seen whoever went down to the engineroom youre a stoker mccrimmon an engine stops and you dont go down to investigate mccrimmon chewed some gum this is a frameup what proof do you have enough patterson said i am putting you under arrest mccrimmon and in close confinement when we get back to britain youll be tried for murder high treason convicted and certainly shot this is absolute rubbish he prefaced the word rubbish with a few choice but unprintable adjectives ive done nothing and you cant prove a thing but his normally pasty face had gone even pastier we dont have to mckinnon said your friend simons or braun or whatever his name is has been well as the americans say been singing like a canary hes willing to turn kings evidence on you in the hope of getting less than life the bastard mccrimmon was on his feet lips drawn back over his teeth his right hand reaching under his overalls dont patterson said whatever it is dont touch it youve got no place to run mccrimmon and the bosun could kill you with one hand let me have it mckinnon said he stretched out his hand and mccrimmon very slowly very carefully placed the knife hilt first in the bosuns palm you havent won his face was both scared and vicious at the same time its the person who laughs last that wins could be mckinnon looked at him consideringly you know something that we dont as you say could be such as the existence of a transmitting bug concealed in the wireless office mccrimmon leapt forward and screamed briefly before collapsing to the deck his nose had broken against the bosuns fist patterson looked down at the unconscious man and then at mckinnon that give you a certain kind of satisfaction i suppose i shouldnt have done it but well yes it did give a certain kind of satisfaction me too patterson said what seemed but wasnt a long day wore on into the evening and then darkness and still the germans stayed away the san andreas under power again was still on a direct course to aberdeen stephen had regained consciousness and as dr sinclair had predicted was suffering from no more than a moderate headache sinclair had carried out what were no better than temporary repairs to mccrimmons broken face but it was really a job for a plastic surgeon and sinclair was no plastic surgeon lieutenant ulbricht a chart spread out on the table before him rubbed his chin thoughtfully and looked at mckinnon who was seated opposite him in the captains cabin weve been lucky so far lucky never thought id say that aboard a british ship why are we being left alone because were just that lucky they didnt have a spare uboat around and our friend whos trailing us wasnt going to try it on his own again also were still on a direct course to aberdeen they know where we are and have no reason to believe that we still arent going where were supposed to be going they have no means of knowing whats happened aboard this ship reasonable i suppose ulbricht looked at the chart and tapped his teeth if something doesnt happen to us during the night something is going to happen to us tomorrow thats what i think at least thats what i feel i know what do you know tomorrow your countrymen arent clowns well be passing very close to the shetlands tomorrow theyll suspect that there is a possibility that we might make a break for lerwick or some such place and will act on that possibility planes condors its possible does the raf have fighters there i should imagine so but i dont know havent been there for years the luftwaffe will know if there are hurricanes or spitfires there the luftwaffe would never risk a condor against them they could send some longrange messerschmitts as escort if not it could be a torpedo thats not something i care to think about nor me theres something very final about a torpedo you know its not necessary to sail south round bressay and turn round bard head we could use the north channel maryfield is the name of the village isnt it i was born there that was stupid stupid of me i mean we make a sharp turn for the north channel and its a torpedo for sure yes and if we steam steadily south past bressay they may well think that were keeping on course to aberdeen we can only hope lieutenant a guarantee is out of the question theres nothing else we can do nothing well theres something we can go down below and have dinner our last perhaps mckinnon crossed his ringers smiled and said nothing dinner understandably was a rather solemn affair patterson was in a particularly pensive mood has it ever occurred to you bosun that we might outrun this uboat without bursting a few steam valves we could get two or three knots more out of this tub yes sir im sure we could the tension in the air was almost palpable im also sure that the uboat would pick up the increased revolutions immediately he would know that we were on to him know that we know that hes following us he would just surface that would increase his speed and finish us off hes probably carrying a dozen torpedoes how many do you think would miss us the first one would be enough patterson sighed rather desperate men make rather desperate suggestions you could sound more encouraging bosun rest after toil jamieson said ton after stormy seas theres going to be no rest for us bosun no safe harbour is that it has to be sir he pointed at janet magnusson you heard me promise to take this lady back home janet smiled at him youre very kind archie mckinnon also youre lying in your teeth mckinnon smiled back at her ye of little faith ulbricht was the first to sense a change in the atmosphere something has occurred to you mr mckinnon yes at least i hope it has he looked at margaret morrison i wonder if you would be so kind as to ask captain bowen to come to the lounge another secret conference i thought there were no more spies or criminals or traitors left aboard i dont think so but no chances he looked around the table i would like it if you all joined us just after dawn the next morning still a very late dawn in those latitudes lieutenant ulbricht gazed out through the starboard wing doorway at lowlying land that could be intermittently seen through squalls of sleety snow so thats unst is it thats unst although mckinnon had been up most of the night he seemed fresh relaxed and almost cheerful and that that is what you shetlanders break your hearts over yes indeed i dont want to give any offence mr mckinnon but thats probably the most bare bleak barren and inhospitable island ive ever had the misfortune to clap my eyes on home sweet home mckinnon said placidly beauty lieutenant is in the eye of the beholder besides no place would look its sparkling best in weather conditions like this and thats another thing is the shetland weather always as awful as this mckinnon regarded the slategrey seas the heavy cloud and the falling snow with considerable satisfaction i think the weather is just lovely as you say the eye of the beholder i doubt whether a condor pilot would share your point of view its unlikely mckinnon pointed ahead fine off the starboard now thats fetlar ah ulbricht consulted the chart within a mile or two at the most or where we ought to be we havent done too badly mr mckinnon we you you mean a splendid piece of navigation lieutenant the admiralty should give you a medal for your services ulbricht smiled i doubt whether admiral doenitz would quite approve of that speaking of services you will now i take it be finished with mine as a navigator i mean my father was a fisherman a professional my first four years at sea i spent with him around those islands it would be difficult for me to get lost i should imagine ulbricht went out on the starboard wing looked aft for a few seconds then hastily returned shivering and dusting snow off his coat the sky or what i can see of the sky is getting pretty black up north winds freshening a bit looks as if this awful weather or if you like wonderful weather is going to continue for quite some time this never entered your calculations im not a magician nor am i a fortuneteller reading the future is not one of my specialities well just lets call it a welltimed stroke of luck luck we could use a little anyway fetlar was on the starboard beam when naseby came up to take over the wheel mckinnon went out on the starboard wing to assess the weather as the san andreas was heading just a degree or two west of south and the wind was from the north it was almost directly abaft the clouds in that direction were dark and ominous but they did not hold his attention for long he had become aware very faintly at first but then more positively of something a great deal more ominous he went back inside and looked at ulbricht remember we were talking about luck a little while back ulbricht nodded well our little luck has just run out we have company theres a condor out there ulbricht said nothing just went outside on the wing and listened he returned after a few moments i can hear nothing variation in wind force or direction something like that i heard it all right up in a northeasterly direction im quite sure that the pilot didnt intend that we should hear him some passing freak of wind theyre being either very careful or very suspicious or maybe both they have to consider the possibility that we might make a break for some port in the shetlands so the uboat surfaces before dawn and calls up the fockewulf pilots doubtless been told to stay out of sight and hearing hell do that until he hears from the uboat that weve suddenly changed direction then hell come calling to finish us off naseby said they wont be dropping any rose petals thats for sure ulbricht said you no longer think that it will be torpedobombers or gliderbombers or stukas that will come and do the job no they wouldnt get here in time and they cant come earlier and hang around waiting they havent the range but that big lad out there can hang around all day if need be of course im only assuming theres only one condor put there could be two or three of them dont forget were a very very important target its a gift not given to many ulbricht was gloomy this ability to cheer up people and lighten their hearts i second that naseby didnt sound any happier than ulbricht i wish to hell you hadnt gone out on that wing you wouldnt like me to keep the burden of my secrets alone would you no need to tell anyone else why spread gloom and despondency unnecessarily especially when theres damnall we can do about it blissful ignorance is that it naseby said mckinnon nodded i could do with some of that shortly after noon when they were off a small and dimly seen group of islands which mckinnon called the skerries he and ulbricht went below leaving naseby and mcguigan on the bridge the snow which was now really more sleet than snow had eased but not stopped the wind too had eased the visibility if that was the word for it varied intermittently between two and four miles cloud cover was about two thousand feet and somewhere above that the unseen condor lurked mckinnon had not heard it again but he didnt for a moment doubt that it was still there the captain and rennet were sitting up in bed and the bosun passed the time of day with them and margaret morrison everybody was being elaborately calm but the tension and expectancy in the air were unmistakable and considerable it would have been even more considerable mckinnon reflected if they had known of the condor patrolling above the clouds he found patterson and sinclair in the messdeck sinclair said singularly free from alarms and excursions this morning arent we bosun long may it continue that way he wondered if sinclair would consider the accompanying condor an alarm or an excursion the weather is rather on our side snowing poor visibility not fog but not good and low cloud cover sounds promising may yet be that we shall touch the happy isles we hope speaking of the happy isles have you made preparations for offloading our wounded cripples when we reach the isles yes no problem rafferty is a stretcher case so are four of the men we picked up in murmansk two with leg wounds two frostbite cases five in all easy sounds good mr patterson those two rogues mccrimmon and simons or whatever his name is well have to tie them up at least tie their hands behind their backs before we take them ashore if we get the chance to take them ashore have to leave it to the last minute doubledyed criminals they may be but we cant have a couple of men go down in a sinking ship please dont talk about such things sinclair said of course sir have they been fed not that i really care no it was sinclair i saw them simons says hes lost his appetite and mccrimmons face is too painful to let him eat i believe him he can hardly move his lips to speak it looks bosun as if you hit him with a sledgehammer no tears for either mckinnon had a quick lunch and rose to go have to go to relieve naseby mckinnon said two hours or so perhaps earlier if i can see a convenient bank of low cloud or snow or even fog anything we can disappear into you or mr jamieson will be in the engineroom about then both probably patterson sighed we can only hope it works bosun thats all we can do sir shortly after three oclock in the afternoon on the bridge with naseby and ulbricht mckinnon made his decision to go he said to ulbricht we cant see it but were near enough opposite the south tip of bressay i would say so due west of us well no point in putting off the inevitable he lifted the phone and called the engineroom mr patterson now if you please george hard astarboard due west and how am i to know where west is mckinnon went to the starboard wing door and latched it open going to be a bit chilly and damp but if you keep the wind fair and square on your right cheek that should be it near enough he went into the wrecked radio room disconnected the transmitting bug returned to the bridge and went out on the port wing the weather had changed very little grey skies grey seas moderate sleet and a patchy visibility extending to not more than two miles he returned to the bridge again leaving the door open so that the north wind had a clear passage through the bridge one wonders ulbricht said what thoughts are passing through the mind of the uboat captain at this moment probably not very pleasant ones all depends whether he was depending on the transmitting bug or the asdic or both to keep tabs on us it was the bug then he might trail us at a prudent distance so that he could have his aerial raised to pick up the transmitting signal without being seen in that case he might have been out of asdic listening range and if that is the case he might well believe that the transmitter has failed he has after all no reason to believe that we might have stumbled on the bug and that we know of mccrimmons shenanigans the san andreas silent now was heading approximately west still with a good turn of speed on so hes in a quandary mckinnon said not a position i would like to be in so what decision does he make does he increase speed on the same course weve been following in the hope of catching us up or does he think we might be running for shelter and go off on an interception course for bard head in the hope of locating us all depends how crafty he is i just dont know ulbricht said i know naseby said were just assuming that he hasnt been tracking us on asdic if hes as crafty as you are archie hell set off on an interception course and hell ask the condor to come down and look for us i was afraid youd say that fifteen minutes passed in an increasingly eerie silence then mckinnon went out on the port wing he didnt remain there long you were right george the bosun sounded resigned hes out there searching for us i can hear the condors engines quite clearly but he hasnt seen us yet but he will though he will hes only got to quarter the area long enough and that wont be long and hell nail us then a signal to the uboat a cluster of bombs for us and the uboat comes to finish us off thats a very depressing thought naseby said ulbricht went out on to the port wing and returned almost immediately he said nothing just nodded his head mckinnon picked up the engineroom phone mr patterson would you start up please and please dont bother working her up slowly quickly if you would and to maximum power the condor is down searching for us and it can only be a matter of minutes before he finds us id like to make tracks out of here with all speed youre not as fast as a condor naseby said im sadly aware of that george but i dont intend to remain here like a sitting duck while he comes and clobbers us we can always try a little evasive action he can also turn and twist a damn sight faster than we can youd be better off trying a few prayers the condor took another twenty minutes to find them but find them he did and wasted no time in making his presence felt as well as heard in the classic fashion he approached from astern flying low as naseby had predicted he would certainly at not more than three hundred feet naseby gave the rudder maximum helm to port but it was a wasted effort as naseby had also said the condor could turn and twist much faster than they could the bomb certainly not the size of a pounder struck the deck some sixty feet forard of the superstructure penetrated and exploded in a flash of flame and a large jet of oily black water that was odd naseby said the bosun shook his head not odd greed greed ulbricht looked at him then nodded gold they havent given up hope yet how far would you say it was to bard head four miles about that if they dont get us stop us i mean by that point then theyre going to sink us and if they stop us they wait till the uboat comes up and takes us over its a sad thing naseby said very sad this love of money i mean i think mckinnon said that theyll be back in a minute or so to show us some more love and indeed the condor was executing a very tight turn and heading back to pass the san andreas on the port side some of you condor pilots mckinnon said to ulbricht have very determined and onetrack minds there are times when one wishes they hadnt the second attack was an exact replica of the first the pilot or his navigator was evidently a precision bombardier of some note for the second bomb landed in exactly the same place with precisely the same results these are not very big bombs mckinnon said but its for sure we cant take much more of this another one like that and i think well call it a day the white bedsheet is that it thats it i have it up here i wasnt kidding listen i hear an aero engine so did i ulbricht said all made in germany not this one its not different note altogether its a fighter plane my god how stupid can i be come to that how stupid can you be or the pilot of that condor of course theyve got radar on the island place is probably botching with the stuff of course theyve picked us up of course theyve picked the condor up so theyve sent out someone to investigate no not someone i hear two mckinnon reached out and flooded the decks and side of the san andreas with its red cross lights we had better not be mistaken for the tirpitz i can see them now ulbricht said his voice was without expression me too mckinnon looked at ulbricht and managed to keep the elation out of his voice do you recognize them yes hurricanes im sorry lieutenant the regret in the bosuns voice was genuine but you know what this means im afraid i do it was no contest the hurricanes rapidly overhauled the condor from the rear and fired simultaneously one from above the other from below the fockewulf didnt blow up or disintegrate or burst into flames or anything dramatic of that nature trailing clouds of smoke it crashed steeply into the sea and vanished at once below the waves lieutenant ulbrichts face still remained empty of all expression the two fighter planes returned to the san andreas and began to circle it one close in the other at the distance of about a mile although it was difficult to see what they could do against a submarine about to launch a torpedo except blow its periscope off their presence was immensely comforting and reassuring mckinnon stepped out on the port wing and waved at one of the planes the one making a close circuit of the ship the hurricane waggled its wings jamieson answered the telephone when mckinnon called i think you can reduce to normal speed now sir the condors gone gone where there was as there might well have been bafflement in jamiesons voice under the sea a couple of hurricanes shot him down the hurricanes remained with them until they were within a mile of bard head when a lean purposeful frigate approached out of the gathering dusk and slid effortlessly alongside the bosun was on the deck a man aboard the frigate presumably the captain used a loudhailer are you in need of care and protection
