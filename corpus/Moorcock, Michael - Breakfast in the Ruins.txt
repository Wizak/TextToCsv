breakfast in the ruins the sequel to behold the man michael moorcock scanned by iczelion for proofing scan date february in the roof garden scarlet sin commonwealth immigrants to britain were per cent down in april there were compared with in april last year the guardian june when in doubt karl glogauer would always return to derry and toms he would walk down kensington church street in the summer sunshine ignoring the boutiques and coffee shops until he reached the high street he would pass the first of the three great department stores which stood side by side to each other stern and eternal and bountiful blotting out the sky and would go through the tall glass doors of the second store derrys the strongest of the citadels weaving his way between the bright counters piled with hats and silks and paper flowers he would reach the lifts with their late art nouveau brass work and he would take one of them up to the third floor a little journey through time for here it was all art deco and cunard style pastel plastics which he could admire for their own sake as he waited for the special lift which would come and bear him up into the paradise of the roof garden the gate would open to reveal something like a small conservatory in which two pleasant middleaged ladies stood to greet the new arrivals and sell them if required teatowels postcards and guide books to one of these ladies karl would hand his shilling and stroll through into the spanish garden where fountains splashed and welltended exotic plants and flowers grew karl had a bench near the central fountain if it was occupied when he arrived he would stroll around for a while until it was free then he would sit down open his book and pretend to read the wall behind him was lined with deep airy cages sometimes these cages were completely deserted but at other times they would contain a few parrots parakeets canaries cockatoos or a mynah bird occasionally pink flamingos were present parading awkwardly about the garden wading through the tiny artificial streams all these birds were on the whole decently silent almost gloomy offering hardly any reaction to the middleaged ladies who liked to approach them and coo at them in pathetic sometimes desperate tones if the sunshine were warm and the number of visitors small karl would sit in his seat for the best part of a morning or an afternoon before taking his lunch or tea in the roof garden restaurant all the waitresses knew him well enough to offer a tight smile of recognition while continuing to wonder what a slightly seedy looking young man in an old tweed jacket and rumpled flannels found to attract him in the roof garden karl recognized their puzzlement and took pleasure in it karl knew why he liked to come here in the whole of london this was the only place where he could find the peace he identified with the peace of his early childhood the peace of ignorance he had been born at the outbreak of the war but he thought of his childhood as having existed a few years earlier in the midthirties only lately had he come to understand that this peace was not really peace but rather a sense of coziness the unique creation of a dying middleclass vulgarity given a gloss of good taste outside london there were a few other spots like it he had found the right atmosphere in the teagardens of surrey and sussex the parks in the richer suburbs of dorking hove and haywards heath all created during the twenties and thirties when to that same middleclass confines had been a synonym for beauty for all he knew too well that the urge which took him so frequently to the roof garden was both infantile and escapist he tolerated it in himself he would console himself sardonically that of all his other infantile and escapist pursuits his collection of childrens books his model soldiers this was the cheapest he no longer made any serious attempts to rid himself of these unmanly habits he was their slave just as much as he was the slave of his mothers childhood terrors of the rich variety of horrors she had managed to introduce into his own childhood thinking about his childhood as he sat in his usual place on a soft summers day in june karl wondered if his somewhat small creative gift was not as most people would nowadays think the result of his unstable upbringing at all perhaps by virtue of his sensitivity he had been unduly prone to his mothers influence such an influence could actually stunt talent maybe he did not like the drift of his thoughts to follow their implications would be to offset the effects of the garden he smiled to himself and leaned back breathing in the heavy scent of snapdragons and tulips believing as he always did that it was enough to admit a selfdeception it was what he called selfknowledge he peered up at the blue uncluttered afternoon sky the hum of the traffic in the street far below could almost be the sound of summer insects in a country garden a country garden long ago he leaned back on the bench a fraction more he did not want to think about his mother his childhood as it actually was the failure of his ambitions he became a handsome young aristocrat he was a regency buck relaxing from the wild london round of politics gambling dueling and women he had just come down to his somerset estate and had been greeted by his delightful young wife he had married a sweet girl from these parts the daughter of an oldfashioned squire and she was ecstatic that he had returned home for she doted on him it did not occur to her to criticize the way he chose to live as far as she was concerned she existed entirely for his pleasure what was her name emma sophy or something a little more greek perhaps the reverie was just beginning to develop into a fullscale fantasy when it was interrupted good afternoon the voice was deep slightly hesitant husky it shocked him and he opened his eyes the face was quite close to his its owner was leaning down and its expression was amused the face was as dark and shining as ancient mahogany almost black do you mind if i join you on this bench the tall black man sat down firmly frustrated by the interruption karl pretended an interest in a paving stone at his feet he hated people who tried to talk to him here particularly when they broke into his daydreams not at all he said i was just leaving it was his usual reply he adjusted the frayed cuff of his jacket im visiting london said the black man his own light suit was elegantly cut a subtle silvery grey silk karl supposed all the mans clothes and jewelry were evidently expensive a rich american tourist thought karl i hadnt expected to find a place like this in the middle of your city the man continued i saw a sign and followed it do you like it here karl shrugged the man laughed removing the cover from his rolleiflex can i take a picture of you here and now karl was flattered nobody had ever volunteered to take his picture before his anger began to dissipate it gives life to a photograph it shows that i took it myself otherwise i might just as well buy the postcards eh karl rose to go but it seemed that the black man had misinterpreted the movement you are a londoner arent you he smiled his deepset eyes looking searchingly into karls face karl wondered for a moment if the question had some additional meaning he hadnt divined yes i am he frowned only now did the elegant negro seem to realize karls displeasure im sorry if im imposing he said again karl shrugged it would not take a moment i only asked if you were a londoner because i dont wish to make the mistake of taking a picture of a typical englishman and then you tell me you are french or something he laughed heartily you see karl didnt much care for the typical but he was disarmed by the mans charm he smiled the black man got up put a hand on karls shoulder and guided him gently to the fountain if you could sit on the rim for a moment he backed away and peered into his viewfinder standing with his legs spread wide and his heels on the very edge of the flower bed taking from slightly different angles a whole series of photographs karl was embarrassed he felt that the situation was odd but he could not define why it should seem so it was as if the ritual of photography was a hint at a much more profound ritual going on at the same time he must leave even the click and the whirr of the camera seemed to have a significant meaning thats fine the photographer looked up he narrowed his eyes against the sunlight just one more im over here from nigeria for a few days unfortunately its more of a business visit than a pleasure trip trying to get your government to pay a better price for our copper what do you do karl waved a hand oh nothing much look here i must come now with a face as interesting as yours you must do something equally interesting im a painter an illustrator really again karl was flattered by the attention he had an impulse to tell the man anything he wanted to know to tell him far more probably than he was prepared to listen to karl felt he was making a fool of himself an artist very good what sort of things do you paint i make my living doing military uniforms mainly people collect that sort of thing its a specialized craft sometimes i do work for the odd regiment which wants a picture to hang in the mess famous battles and stuff you know so youre not a disciple of the avantgarde i might have guessed your hairs too short ha ha no cubism or action painting eh the nigerian snapped the case back on his camera none of your which way up should i stand to look at it karl laughed outright for the first time in ages he was amused partly by the mans somewhat oldfashioned idea of the avantgarde partly because he actually did paint stuff in his spare time which would fit the nigerians general description all the same he was pleased to have won the black mans approval not a revolutionary said the man stepping closer youre conventional are you in every respect oh hardly who is who indeed have you had tea the black man took his arm looking around him vaguely i understand theres a cafe here a restaurant on the other side shall we cross i dont know karl shivered he didnt much care for people holding him like that particularly when they were strangers but a touch shouldnt make him shiver im not sure normally he could have walked away easily why should he mind being rude to a man who had so forcefully intruded on his privacy you must have tea with me the grip tightened just a little you have a bit of time to spare surely i rarely get the chance to make friends in london now karl felt guilty he remembered his mothers advice good advice for a change never have anything to do with people who make you feel guilty she should have known but it was no good he did not want to disappoint the nigerian he felt rather faint suddenly there was a sensation in the pit of his stomach which was not entirely unpleasurable they walked together through part of the tudor garden and through an archway which led into the woodland garden and there was the restaurant with its white wroughtiron tables and chairs on the veranda its curve of glass through which the interior could be seen the restaurant was quite busy today and was serving cucumber sandwiches and danish pastries to little parties of women in jersey suits and silk frocks who were relaxing after their shopping the only men present were one or two elderly husbands or fathers tolerated because of their chequebooks karl and his new friend entered the restaurant and walked to the far end to a table by the window which looked out onto the lawns and willow trees skirting the miniature stream and its miniature wooden bridge you had better order i think said the nigerian im not much used to this sort of thing again he smiled warmly karl picked up the menu we might as well stick to the set tea said karl sandwiches and cakes very well the mans reply was vague insouciant he gave karl the impression that for all his politeness he had weightier matters on his mind than the choice of food for a few moments karl tried to signal a waitress he felt embarrassed and avoided looking at his companion he glanced about the crowded restaurant at the pastel mauves and pinks and blues of the ladies suits the fluffy hats built up layer on layer of artificial petals the jaeger scarves at last the waitress arrived he didnt know her she was new but she looked like the rest a tired woman of about thirtyfive her thin face was yellow beneath the powder the rouge and the lipstick she had bags under her eyes and the deep crows feet emphasized the bleakness of her expression the skin on the bridge of her nose was peeling she had the hands of a hag twice her age one of them plucked the order pad from where it hung by a string against her dowdy black skirt and she settled her pencil heavily against the paper it seemed that she lacked even the strength to hold the stub with only one hand two set teas please said karl he tried to sound pleasant and sympathetic but she paid attention neither to his face nor his tone thank you sir she let the pad fall back without using it she began to trudge towards the kitchen pushing open the door as if gratefully entering the gates of hell karl felt the pressure of his companions long legs against his own he tried politely to move but could not not without a violent tug the black man seemed unaware of karls discomfort and leaned forward over the little table putting his two elbows on the dainty white cloth and looking directly into karls eyes i hope you dont think ive been rude old chap he said rude karl was trapped by the eyes it occurred to me you might have better things to do than keep a bored tourist entertained of course not karl heard himself say im afraid i dont know much about nigeria id like to know more of course i followed the biafran thing in the papers had that been the wrong remark your alfred had similar trouble with his breakaway states you know i suppose he did karl wasnt sure who alfred had been or what he had done the waitress came back with a mocksilver tray on which stood a teapot a milk jug and a hot water jug also of mock silver together with cups and saucers and plates she began to set her load down between the two men the nigerian leaned back but continued to smile into karls eyes while karl murmured thank you every time the waitress placed something in front of him these ingratiating noises were his usual response to most minor forms of human misery as they had been to his mother when she had made it evident what it had cost her to prepare a meal for him shall i be mother said karl and again the not unpleasant sensation of weakness swept through him the nigerian was looking away vague once again his handsome profile in silhouette as he took an interest in the garden karl repeated eagerly shall i the nigerian said fine and karl realized that he was now desperate to please his companion that he needed the mans whole attention that he would do anything to ensure that he got it he poured the tea he handed a cup to his friend who accepted it absently we havent introduced ourselves karl said he cleared his throat im karl glogauer the attention was regained the eyes looked directly into karls the pressure of the leg was deliberate the nigerian picked up the bowl nearest him and offered it to karl sugar thanks karl took the bowl youve got nice hands said the nigerian an artists hands of course briefly he touched karls fingers karl giggled do you think so the sensation came again but this time it was a wave and there was no doubt about its origin thank you he smiled suddenly because to remark on their hands and to pretend to read their palms was one of his standard ways of trying to pick up girls are you going to read my palm the nigerians brows came together in a deep frown why should i karls breathing was heavier at last he understood the nature of the trap and there was nothing he wished to do about it in silence they ate their sandwiches karl was no longer irritated by the pressure of the mans leg on his a little later the nigerian said will you come back with me yes whispered karl he began to shake what would you do you are a passenger on a plane which is about to crash the plane is not a jet and so you have a chance to parachute to safety with the other passengers you stand in line and take one of the parachutes which the crew hands out to you there is one problem the people ahead of you on the line are already jumping out but you have a fourmonthold baby with you and it is too large to button into your clothing yet you must have both hands free in order to pull the emergency ripcord in the event of the parachute failing to open guide the chute to safety if you see danger below the baby is crying the people behind you are pressing forward someone helps you struggle into the harness and hands you back your baby even if you did hold the baby in both hands and pray that you had an easy descent there is every possibility he could be yanked from your grip as you jumped there are a few more seconds to go before you miss your chance to get out of the plane in the commune a smile not only france but the whole civilized world was startled and dismayed by the sudden success of the red republicans of paris the most extraordinary and perhaps the most alarming feature of the movement was the fact that it had been brought about by men nearly all of whom were totally unknown to society at large it was not therefore the influence whether for good or evil of a few great names which might be supposed to exercise a species of enchantment on the uneducated classes and to be capable of moving them almost without thought towards the execution of any design which the masterminds might have determined on it was not this which had caused the convulsion the outbreak was clearly due less to individual persuasion which in the nature of things is evanescent than to the operation of deeprooted principles such as survive when men depart the ideas which gave rise to the commune were within the cognizance of the middle and upper classes of society but it was not supposed that they had attained such power or were capable of such organized action a frightful apparition of the red republic had been momentarily visible in june but it was at once exercised by the cannon and bayonets of cavaignac it was again apprehended towards the close of and would probably have made itself once more manifest had not the coup detat of louis napoleon prevented any such movement not only at that time but for several years to come every now and then during the period of the second empire threatenings of this vague yet appalling danger came and went but the admirable organization of the imperial government kept the enemies of social order in subjection though only by a resort to means regrettable in themselves against which the moderate republicans were perpetually directing their most bitter attacks little thinking that they would soon be obliged to use the same weapons with still greater severity nevertheless although the emperor napoleon held the red republic firmly down throughout his term of power the principles of the extreme faction were working beneath the surface and they only awaited the advent of a weaker government and of a period of social disruption to glare upon the world with stormy menace history of the war between france and germany anonymous cassell petter galpin there you are karl the black man strokes his head karl has removed his clothes and lies naked on the double bed in the hotel suite the silk counterpane is cool do you feel any better now im not sure karls mouth is dry the mans hands move down from his head to touch his shoulders karl gasps he shuts his eyes karl is seven years old he and his mother have fled from their house as the versaillais troops storm paris in their successful effort to destroy the commune established a few months earlier it is civil war and it is savage the more so perhaps because the french have received such an ignominious defeat at the hands of bismarcks prussians he is seven years old it is the spring of he is on the move do you like this asks the black man karl was seven his mother was twentyfive his father was thirtyone but had probably been killed fighting the prussians at st quentin karls father had been so eager to join the national guard and prove that he was a true frenchman now karl his mother put him down and he felt the hard cobbles of the street beneath his thin shoes you must walk a little mother is tired too it was true when she was tired her alsatian accent always became thicker and now it was very thick karl felt ashamed for her he was not sure what was happening the previous night he had heard loud noises and the sounds of running feet there had been shots and explosions but such things were familiar enough since the siege of paris then his mother had appeared in her street clothes and made him put on his coat and shoes hurrying him from the room and down the stairs and into the street he wondered what had happened to their maid when they got into the street he saw that a fire had broken out some distance away and that there were many national guardsmen about some of them were running towards the fires and others who were wounded were staggering in the other direction some bad soldiers were attacking them he gathered and his mother was afraid that the house would be burned down starvation bombardment and now fire she had muttered bitterly i hope all the wretched communards are shot her heavy black skirts hissed as she led him through the night away from the fighting by dawn more of the city was burning and all was confusion ragged members of the national guard in their stained uniforms rallied the citizens to pile furniture and bedding onto the carts which had been overturned to block the streets sometimes karl and his mother were stopped and told to help the other women and children but she gave excuses and hurried on karl was dazed he had no idea where they were going he was vaguely aware that his mother knew no better than he when he gasped that he could walk no further she picked him up and continued her flight her sharp face expressing her disapproval at his weakness she was a small wiry woman who would have been reasonably pretty had her features not been set so solidly in a mask of tension and anxiety karl had never known her face to soften either to him or to his father her eyes had always seemed fixed on some distant objective which secretly and grimly she had determined to reach that same look was in her eyes now though much more emphatic and the little boy had the impression that his mothers flight through the city was the natural climax to her life karl tried not to cry out as he trotted behind his mothers dusty black skirts his whole body was aching and his feet were blistered and once he fell on the cobbles and had to scramble up swiftly in order to catch her as she turned a corner they were now in a narrow side street not far from the rue du bac on the left bank twice karl had caught a glimpse of the nearby seine it was a beautiful spring morning but the sky was slowly being obscured by thick smoke from the many burning buildings on both sides of the river noticing this his mother hesitated oh the animals her tone was a mixture of disgust and despair they are setting fire to their own city may we rest now mother asked karl rest she laughed bitterly but she made no effort to continue on her way though she cast about her in every direction trying to decide where she could best expect to find safety suddenly from a couple of streets away there came a series of explosions which shook the houses there were shots and then a great angry cry followed by individual screams and shouts in the guise of addressing her son she muttered to herself the streets are not safe the dogs are everywhere we must try to find some government soldiers and ask their protection are those the bad soldiers mother no karl they are the good soldiers they are freeing paris of those who have brought the city to ruin the prussians the communists we all knew it would come to this what a fool your father was karl was surprised to hear the contempt in her voice she had previously always told him to look up to his father he began to cry for the first time since leaving the house he felt deeply miserable rather than merely uncomfortable oh my god his mother reached out and shook him we dont need your weeping on top of everything else be quiet karl he bit his lip but he was still shaken by sobs she stroked his head your mother is tired she said she has always done her duty a sigh but whats the point karl realized that she was not trying to comfort him at all but herself even the automatic stroking of his hair was done in an effort to calm herself there was no real sympathy in the gesture for some reason this knowledge made him feel deep sympathy for her it has not been easy even when his father was alive with noone coming to buy clothes in the shop just because they had a germansounding name and she had protected him from the worst of the insults and beaten the boys who threw stones at him he hugged her waist have courage mother he whispered awkwardly she looked at him in astonishment courage what does it gain us she took his hand come well find the soldiers trotting beside her karl felt closer to her than he had ever felt not because she had shown affection for him but because he had been able to show affection for her of late he had begun to feel guilty believing he might not love his mother as much as a good son should the two of them entered the somewhat broader street that was rue du bac and here was the source of the sounds they had heard the communards were being beaten back by the welltrained versailles troops the versaillese having been so roundly defeated by the prussians were avenging themselves on their recalcitrant countrymen most of the communards were armed with rifles on which were fixed bayonets they had run out of ammunition and were using the rifles as spears most of them were dressed in ordinary clothes but there was a handful of national guardsmen among them in soiled pale blue uniforms karl saw a torn red flag still flying somewhere many women were taking part in the fighting karl saw one woman bayonet a wounded versaillese who lay on the ground his mother pulled him away she was trembling now as they rounded a bend in the rue du bac they saw another barricade then there was an eruption and a roar and the barricades flew apart through the dust and debris karl saw bodies flung in every direction some of the dead were children of his own age a terrifying wailing filled the street a wailing which turned into a growl of anger the remaining communards began to fire at the unseen enemy another eruption and another roar and the remains of the barricade went down for a second there was silence then a woman rushed from a nearby house and screamed something hurling a burning bottle through an open window in her own cellar karl saw that a house on the opposite side of the street was beginning to burn why were the people setting fire to their own houses now through the smoke and the ruins came the versaillese in their smart dark blue and red uniforms their eyes were red and glaring reflecting the flames they frightened karl far more than the national guardsmen behind them galloped an officer on a black horse he was screaming in the same highpitched tone as the woman he was waving a saber karls mother took a step towards the troops and then hesitated she turned and began to run in the other direction karl running with her there were several shots and karl noticed that bullets were striking the walls of the houses he knew at once that he and his mother were being fired at he grinned with excitement they dashed down the next side street and had to wade through piles of garbage to enter a ruined building an earlier victim of the first siege his mother hid behind a quaking wall as the soldiers ran past when they had gone she sat down on a slab of broken stone and began to cry karl stroked her hair wishing that he could share her grief your father should not have deserted us she said he had to fight mother said karl it was what she had said to him when his father joined the guard for france for the reds for the fools who brought all this upon us karl did not understand soon his mother was sleeping in the ruins he curled up beside her and slept too when they awakened that afternoon there was much more smoke it drifted everywhere on all sides buildings burned karls mother staggered up without looking at him or speaking to him she seized his hand in a grip which made him wince her boots slipping on the stones her skirts all filthy and ragged at the hem she dragged him with her to the street a young girl stood there her face grave good day she said are they still fighting the girl could hardly understand his mothers accent it had become so thick the girl frowned are they still fighting his mother asked again speaking in a peculiar slow voice yes the girl shrugged they are killing everyone anyone that way karls mother pointed towards the seine that way yes everywhere but more that way she pointed in the general direction of the boulevard du montparnasse are you a petrolwoman certainly not madame glogauer glared at the girl are you i wasnt allowed said the girl regretfully there isnt much petrol left karls mother took him back the way they had come the fires which had been started earlier were now out it appeared that they had done little damage not enough petrol thought karl with her sleeve over her mouth his mother picked her way through the corpses and crossed the ruins of the barricade the other men and women who were searching for dead friends or relatives ignored them as they went by karl thought there were more dead people than living people in the world now they reached the boulevard stgermaine hurrying towards the quai dorsay on the far side of the river monstrous sheets of flame sprang from a dozen buildings and smoke boiled into the clear may sky i am so thirsty mother murmured karl the smoke and the dust filled his mouth she ignored him here again the barricades were deserted save for the dead the victors and the sightseers groups of versaillese stood about leaning on their rifles smoking and watching the fires or chatting to the innocent citizens who were so anxious to establish their hatred of the communards karl saw a group of prisoners their hands bound with rope sitting miserably in the road guarded by the regular soldiers whenever a communard moved he would receive a harsh blow from a rifle butt or would be threatened by the bayonet the red flag flew nowhere in the distance came the sound of cannon fire and rifle fire at last madame glogauer began to move towards the troops we shall go home soon karl if they have not burned our house down karl saw an empty wine bottle in the gutter perhaps they could fill it with water from the river he picked it up even as his mother dragged him forward mother we could she stopped what have you got there put the filthy thing down we could fill it with water well drink soon enough and eat she grabbed the bottle from his hand if we are to remain respectable karl she turned her head at a shout a group of citizens were pointing at her soldiers began to run towards them karl heard the word petroleuse repeated several times madame glogauer shook her head and threw the bottle down it is empty she said quietly they could not hear her the soldiers stopped and raised their rifles she stretched her hands towards them it was an empty bottle she cried karl tugged at her mother he tried to take her hand but it was still stretched towards the soldiers they cannot understand you mother she began to back away and then she ran he tried to follow but fell down she disappeared into a little alley the soldiers ran past karl and followed her into the alley the citizens ran after the soldiers they were shrieking with hysteria and bloodlust karl got up and ran behind them there were some shots and some screams by the time karl had entered the little street the soldiers were coming back again the citizens still standing looking at something on the ground karl pushed his way through them they cuffed him and snarled at him and then they too turned away the pigs use women and children to fight their battles said one man he glared at karl the sooner paris is cleansed of such scum the better his mother lay sprawled on her face in the filth of the street there was a dark wet patch on her back karl went up to her and as he had suspected found that the patch was blood she was still bleeding he had never seen his mothers blood before he tried hard to turn her over but he was too weak mother suddenly her whole body heaved and she drew in a great dry breath then she moaned the smoke drifted across the sky and evening came and the city burned red flames stained the night on every side shots boomed but there were no more voices even the people who passed and whom karl begged to help his wounded mother did not speak one or two laughed harshly with his help his mother managed to turn herself over and sat with her back propped against the wall she breathed with great difficulty and did not seem to know him staring as fixedly and as determinedly into the middle distance as she had always done her hair was loose and it clung to her tight anxious face karl wanted to find her some water but he did not want to leave her at last he got up and blocked the path of a man who came walking towards boulevard stgermaine please help my mother sir he said help her yes of course then they will shoot me too that will be good eh the man threw back his head and laughed heartily as he continued on his way she did nothing wrong karl shouted the man stopped just before he turned the corner it depends how you look at it doesnt it young man he gestured into the boulevard heres what you need hey there stop ive got another passenger for you karl heard the sound of something squeaking the squeaking stopped and the man exchanged a few words with someone else then he disappeared instinctively karl backed away with some idea of defending his mother a filthy old man appeared next ive just about got room he complained he brushed karl aside heaved madame glogauer onto his shoulder and turned staggering back down the street karl followed was the man going to help his mother take her to the hospital a cart stood in the street there were no carthorses for they had all been eaten during the siege as karl knew instead between the shafts stood several ragged men and women they began to move forward when they saw the old man appear again dragging the squeaking cart behind them karl saw that there were people of all ages and sexes lying on top of one another in the cart most of them were dead many with gaping wounds and parts of their faces or bodies missing give us a hand here said the old man and one of the younger men left his place at the front and helped heave madame glogauer onto the top of the pile she groaned where are you taking her asked karl they continued to ignore him the cart squeaked on through the night karl followed it from time to time he heard his mother moan he became very tired and could hardly see for his eyes kept closing but he followed the cart by its sound hearing the sharp clack of clogs and the slap of bare feet on the road the squeal of the wheels the occasional cries and moans of the living passengers by midnight they had reached one of the outlying districts of the city and entered a square there were versaillese soldiers here standing about on the remains of a green in the middle of the green was a dark area the old man said something to the soldiers and then he and his companions began unloading the cart karl tried to see which one of the people was his mother the ragged men and women carried their burdens to the dark area and dropped them into it karl could now see that it was a freshly dug pit there were already a large number of bodies in it he peered in certain that he had heard his mothers voice among the moans of the wounded as indiscriminately they were buried with the dead all around the square shutters were closing and lights were being extinguished a soldier came up and dragged karl away from the graveside get back he said or youll go in with them soon the cart went away the soldiers sat down by the graveside and lit their pipes complaining about the smell which had become almost overpowering and passing a bottle of wine back and forth ill be glad when this is over said one karl squatted against the wall of the house trying to distinguish his mothers voice amongst those which groaned or cried out from the pit he was sure he could hear her pleading to be let out by dawn her voice had stopped and the cart came back with a fresh load these were dumped into the pit and the soldiers got up reluctantly at the command of their officer putting down their rifles and picking up shovels they began to throw earth onto the bodies when the grave was covered karl got up and began to walk away the guards put down their shovels they seemed more cheerful now and they opened another bottle of wine one of them saw karl hello young man youre up early he ruffled the boys hair hoping for some more excitement eh he took a pull on the bottle and then offered it to karl like a drink he laughed karl smiled at him karl gasps and he writhes on the bed what are you doing he says dont you like it you dont have to like it not everyone does oh god says karl the black man gets up his body gleams in the faint light from the window he moves gracefully back out of range of karls vision perhaps you had better sleep there is lots of time no you want to go on a pause yes what would you do you have been brought to a room by the secret police they say that you can save the lives of your whole family if you will only assist them in one way you agree to help there is a table covered by a cloth they remove the cloth and reveal a profusion of objects there is a childrens comforter a smith and wesson an umbrella a big volume of don quixote illustrated by dore two blankets a jar of honey four bottles of drugs a bicycle pump some blank envelopes a carton of sullivans cigarettes an enameled pin with the word on it a wristwatch a japanese fan they tell you that all you have to do is choose the correct object and you and your family will be released you have never seen any of the objects before you tell them this they nod that is all right they know now choose you stare at the objects trying to divine their significance kaffee klatsch in brunswick the lowdown bismarck was very fond of enlarging on his favorite theory of the male and female european nations the germans themselves the three scandinavian peoples the dutch the english proper the scotch the hungarians and the turks he declared to be essentially male races the russians the poles the bohemians and indeed every slavonic people and all celts he maintained just as emphatically to be female races a female race he ungallantly defined as one given to immense verbosity to fickleness and to lack of tenacity he conceded to these feminine races some of the advantages of their sex and acknowledged that they had great powers of attraction and charm when they chose to exert them and also a fluency of speech denied to the more virile nations he maintained stoutly that it was quite useless to expect efficiency in any form from one of the female races and he was full of contempt for the celt and the slav he contended that the most interesting nations were the epicene ones partaking that is of the characteristics of both sexes and he instanced france and italy intensely virile in the north absolutely female in the south maintaining that the northern french had saved their country times out of number from the follies of the meridionaux he attributed the efficiency of the frenchmen of the north to the fact that they had so large a proportion of frankish and norman blood in their veins the franks being a germanic tribe and the normans as their name implied northmen of scandinavian therefore also of teutonic origin he declared that the fairhaired piedmontese were the driving power of italy and that they owed their initiative to their descent from the germanic hordes who invaded italy under alaric in the fifth century bismarck stoutly maintained that efficiency wherever it was found was due to teutonic blood a statement with which i will not quarrel as the inventor of practical politics bismarck had a supreme contempt for fluent talkers and for words saying that only fools could imagine that facts could be talked away he cynically added that words were sometimes useful for papering over structural cracks when they had to be concealed for a time with his intensely overbearing disposition bismarck could not brook the smallest contradiction or any criticism whatever i have often watched him in the reichstag then housed in a very modest building whilst being attacked especially by liebknecht the socialist he made no effort to conceal his anger and would stab the blottingpad before him viciously with a metal papercutter his face purple with rage bismarck himself was a very clear and forcible speaker with a happy knack of coining felicitous phrases the vanished pomps of yesterday lord frederick hamilton hodder and stoughton there is a big color tv in the suite the nigerian walks up to it his penis is still slightly stiff do you want this on karl is eight it is brunswick he has a very respectable mother and father they are kind but firm it is very comfortable he shakes his head well do you mind if i watch the news karl is eight it is there is a man in pajamas in his mothers room it is karl was eight his mother was thirtyfive his father was forty they had a large modem house in the best part of brunswick his fathers business was in the centre of town trade was good in germany and particularly good in brunswick the glogauers were part of the best society in brunswick frau glogauer belonged to the coffee circle which once a week met in rotation at the house of one of the members this week the ladies were meeting at frau glogauers karl of course was not allowed into the big drawing room where his mother entertained his nurse watched over him while he played in the garden in the hot summer sunshine through the french windows which were open he could just see his mother and her friends they balanced the delicate china cups so elegantly and they leaned their heads so close together when they talked they were not bored karl was bored he swung back and forth on his swing up and down and back and forward and up and down and back he was dressed in his best velvet suit and he was hot and uncomfortable but he always dressed in this way when it was his mothers turn to entertain the kaffee klatsch even though he wasnt invited to join them usually he was asked to come in just before the ladies left they would ask him the same questions as they asked every tune and they would compliment his mother on his looks and his size and his health and they would give him a little piece of gateau he was looking forward to the gateaux karl you must wear your hat said miss henshaw miss henshaw was english and her german was rather unfortunate in that she had learned it in a village it was low german and it made her sound like a yokel karls parents and their friends spoke nothing but the more sophisticated high german low german sounded just like english anyway he didnt know why shed bothered to learn it your hat karl the sun is too hot in her garishly striped blouse and her silly stiff grey skirt and her own floppy white hat miss henshaw looked awful how dowdy and decrepit she was compared to mother who corseted and bustled and covered in pretty silk ribbons and buttons and lace and brocade moved with the dignity of a sixmasted clipper miss henshaw was evidently only a servant for all her pretense at authority she stretched out her freckled arm offering him the little sun hat he ignored her making the swing go higher and higher you will get sunstroke karl your mother will be very angry with me karl shrugged and kicked his feet out straight enjoying miss henshaws helplessness karl karl miss henshaws voice was almost a screech karl grinned he saw that the ladies were looking out at him through the open window he waved to his mother the ladies smiled and returned to their gossip he knew it was gossip about everyone in brunswick because once he had lain beside the window in the shrubs and listened before he had been caught by miss henshaw he wished that he had understood more of the references but at least he had got one useful tip that fritz viewegs father had been born the wrong side of the blanket he hadnt been sure of the meaning but when he had confronted fritz vieweg with it it had stopped vieweg calling him a jewpig all right gossip like that was worth a lot karl karl oh go away fraulein henshaw i am not in need of my hat at present he chuckled to himself when he talked like his father she always disapproved his mother appeared in the doorway of the french window karl dear there is someone who would like to meet you may we have karl in with us for a moment miss henshaw of course frau glogauer miss henshaw darted him a look of stern triumph reluctantly he let the swing slow down and then jumped off miss henshaw took his hand and they walked across the ornamental pavement to the french windows his mother smiled fondly and patted his head frau spiegelberg is here and wants to meet you he supposed from his mothers tone that he should know who frau spiegelberg was that she must be an important visitor not one of frau glogauers regulars a woman dressed in purple and white silk was towering behind his mother she gave him quite a friendly smile he bowed twice very deeply good afternoon frau spiegelberg good afternoon karl said frau spiegelberg frau spiegelberg is from berlin karl said his mother she has met the great chancellor bismarck himself again karl bowed the ladies laughed frau spiegelberg said with charming almost coquettish modesty i must emphasize i am not on intimate terms with prinz bismarck and she gave a trilling laugh karl knew that all the ladies would be practicing that laugh after she had gone back to berlin i would like to go to berlin said karl it is a very fine city said frau spiegelberg complacently but your brunswick is very pretty karl was at a loss for something to say he frowned and then brightened frau spiegelberg he gave another little bow have you met chancellor bismarcks son i have met both do you mean herbert or william or frau spiegelberg glanced modestly at her companions again bill as he likes to be called bill said karl i have attended several balls at which he has been present yes so you have touched him frau spiegelberg and again the trilling laugh why do you ask well father met him once i believe when on business in berlin so your father and i have an acquaintance in common that is splendid karl frau spiegelberg made to turn away a handsome boy frau and father shook hands with him said karl really well and father said he drank so much beer that his hands were always wet and clammy and he could not possibly live for long if he continued to drink that much father is himself not averse to a few tots of beer or glasses of punch but he swears he has never seen anyone drink so much in all his life is bill bismarck dead yet frau spiegelberg his mother had been listening to him in cold horror her mouth open frau spiegelberg raised her eyebrows the other ladies glanced at each other miss henshaw took his hand and began to pull him away apologizing to his mother karl bowed again i am honored to have met you frau spiegelberg he said in his fathers voice i am afraid i have embarrassed you and so i will take my leave now miss henshaws tugging became more insistent i hope we shall meet again before you return to berlin frau spiegelberg it is time i left icily said frau spiegelberg to his mother his mother came out for a moment and hissed you disgusting child you will be punished for this your father shall do it but mother in the meantime miss henshaw said frau glogauer in a terrible murmur you have my permission to beat the boy karl shuddered as he caught a glint of hidden malice in miss henshaws pale grey eyes very well madam said miss henshaw as she led him away he heard her sigh a deep sigh of pleasure already he was plotting his own revenge youll like it better when you get used to it its a question of your frame of mind karl sighs maybe its a matter of time thats all i believe you youve got to let yourself go they sip the dry chilled champagne the black man has ordered outside people are going into the theatres after all says the black man we are many people there are a lot of different sides to ones personality you mustnt feel that youve lost something you have gained something another aspect is flowering i feel terrible it wont last your moment will come karl smiles the black mans english is not always perfect there you see you are feeling more relaxed already the black man reaches out and touches his arm how smooth your flesh is what are you thinking i was remembering the time i found the airraid warden in bed with my mother i remember her explaining it to my father my father was a patient man is your father still alive i dont know you have a great deal to learn yet what would you do you are returning from the theatre after a pleasant evening with your sweetheart you are in the centre of the city and you want a taxi you decide to go to the main railway station and find a taxi there as you come into a sideentrance and approach a flight of steps you see an old man trying to ascend he is evidently incapably drunk normally you would help him up the steps but in this case there is a problem his trousers have fallen down to his ankles revealing his filthy legs from his bottom protrude several pieces of newspaper covered in excrement to help him would be a messy task to say the least and you are reluctant to spoil the previously pleasant mood of the evening there is a second or two before you pass him and continue on your journey capetown party butterflies in the meantime let us not forget that if errors of judgment have been committed they have been committed by men whose zeal and patriotism has never been doubted we cannot refrain however from alluding here to the greatest of all lessons which this war has taught not us alone but all the world the solidarity of the empire and for that great demonstration what sacrifice was not worth making with the flag to pretoria h w wilson harmsworth brothers karl emerges from the deep bath liquid drips from him he stares in bewilderment at himself in the wall mirror opposite why did you make me do that i thought youd like it you said how much you admired my body i meant your physique oh i see i look like something out of a minstrel show al jolson yes you do rather but you could pass for what an eurasian the black man begins to laugh karl laughs too they fall into each others arms it shouldnt take long to dry says the black man karl is nine is he is at work now i think i like you better like that says the black man he puts a palm on karls damp thigh its your color karl giggles there you see it has made you feel better karl was nine his mother did not know her age he did not know his father he was a servant in a house with a huge garden a white house he was the punkahwallah the boy who operated the giant fan which swept back and forth over the white people while they were eating when he was not doing this he helped the cook in the kitchen whenever he could however he was out in the grounds with his net he had a passion for butterflies he had a large collection in the room he shared with the two other little houseboys and his companions were very envious if he saw a specimen he did not own he would forget everything else until he had caught it everyone knew about his hobby and that was why he was known as butterfly by everyone from the master and mistress down it was a kind house and they tolerated his passion it was not everyone even who would employ a cape colored boy because most thought that halfbreeds were less trustworthy than pureblooded natives the master had presented him with a proper killing jar and an old velvetlined case in which to mount his specimens karl was very lucky whenever the master saw him he would say and hows the young entomologist today and karl would flash him a smile when karl was older it was almost certain that he would be given a position as a footman he would be the very first cape colored footman in this district this evening it was very hot and the master and mistress were entertaining a large party of guests to dinner karl sat behind a screen and pulled on the string which made the fan work he was good at his job and the motion of the fan was as regular as the swinging of a pendulum when his right arm became tired karl would use his left arm and when his left arm was tired he would transfer the string to the big toe of his right foot when his right foot ached he would use his left and by that time his right arm would be rested and he could begin again in the meantime he daydreamed thinking of his lovely butterflies and of the specimens he had yet to collect there was a very large one he wanted particularly it had blue and yellow wings and a complicated pattern of zigzags on its body he did not know its name he knew few of the names because nobody could tell them to him someone had once shown him a book with some pictures of butterflies and the names underneath but since he could not read he could not discover what the names were laughter came from the other side of the screen a deep voice said somebody will teach the boers a lesson soon mark my words those damned farmers cant go on treating british subjects in that highhanded fashion forever weve made their country rich and they treat us like natives another voice murmured a reply and the deep voice said loudly if thats the sort of life they want to preserve why dont they go somewhere else theyve got to move with the times karl lost interest in the conversation he didnt understand it anyway besides he was more interested in butterflies he transferred the string to his left toe when all the guests had withdrawn a footman came to tell karl that he might go to his supper stiffly karl walked round the screen and hobbled towards the door the dinner had been a long one in the kitchen the cook put a large plate of succulent scraps before him and said hurry up now young man ive had a long day and i want to get to my bed he ate the food and washed it down with the half a glass of beer the cook gave him it was a treat she knew he had been working hard too as she let him out of the kitchen she rumpled his hair and said poor little chap hows your butterflies very well thank you cook karl was always polite you must show them to me sometime ill show them to you tomorrow if you like she nodded well sometime goodnight butterfly goodnight cook he climbed the back stairs high up to his room in the roof the two houseboys were already asleep quietly he lit his lamp and got out his case of butterflies he would be needing another case soon smiling tenderly he delicately stroked their wings with the tip of his little finger for over an hour he looked at his butterflies and then he got into his bed and pulled the sheet over him he lay staring at the eaves and thinking about the blue and yellow butterfly he would try to catch tomorrow there was a sound outside he ignored it it was a familiar sound feet creeping along the passage either one of the housemaids was on her way out to keep an assignation with her follower or her follower had boldly entered the house karl turned over and tried to go to sleep the door of his room opened he turned onto his back again and peered through the gloom a white figure was standing there panting it was a man in pajamas and a dressing gown the man paused for a moment and then crept towards karls bed there you are you little beauty whispered the man karl recognized the voice as the one he had heard earlier talking about the boers what do you want sir karl sat up in bed eh damn who the devil are you the punchboy sir i thought this was where that little fat maid slept what the devil there was a crunch and the man grunted in pain hopping about the room oh ive had enough of this now the other two boys were awake their eyes stared in horror at the hopping figure perhaps they thought it was a ghost the white man blundered back out of the room leaving the door swinging on its hinges karl heard him go down the passage and descend the stairs karl got up and lit the lamp he saw his butterfly case where he had left it beside the bed the white man had stepped on it and broken the glass all the butterflies were broken too wont it wash off asks karl do you want it to come off dont you feel more free free what would you do you are escaping from an enemy you have climbed along the top of a sloping slate roof several stories up it is raining you slip and manage to hang on to the top of the roof you try to get back but your feet slip on the wet tiles below you you can see a lead gutter will you risk sliding down the roof while there is still some strength left in your fingers and hope that you can catch the gutter as you go down and thus work your way to safety or will you continue to try to pull yourself back to the top of the roof there is also the chance that the gutter will break under your weight when you grab it perhaps also your enemy has discovered where you are and is coming along the roof towards you liberation in havana hooks you may fire when ready gridley commodore dewey may st there its dried nicely the black man runs his nail down karls chest are you religious karl not really do you believe in incarnation or what you might call transincarnation i suppose i dont know what youre talking about the nail traces a line across his stomach he gasps the black man bares his teeth in a sudden smile oh you do really whats this willful ignorance how many people today suffer from that malaise leave me alone alone karl is ten the son of a small manufacturer of cigars in havana cuba his grandfather had the cigar factory before his father he will inherit the factory from his father yesalone oh god the black mans tone becomes warmly sympathetic whats up karl looks at him in surprise hearing him speak english slang easily for the first time the black man is changing karl shudders youve youve made me cold then wed better tuck you into bed old chap youve corrupted me corrupted is that what you think turns me on the corruption of ignorance the black man throws back his handsome head and laughs heartily karl is ten the black man leans down and kisses karl ferociously on the lips karl was ten his mother was dead his father was fifty one his brother willi was nineteen and when last heard of had joined the insurgents to fight against the spaniards karls father had not approved of willis decision and had disowned his eldest son that was why karl was now the heir to the cigar factory one day he would be master of nearly a hundred women and children who worked in the factory rolling the good cigars which were prized all over the world not that business could be said to be good at present with the american ships blockading the port but the war is virtually over said senor glogauer and things will be returning to normal soon enough it was sunday and the bells were ringing all over havana big bells and little bells it was almost impossible to hear anything else after church senor glogauer walked with his son down the prado towards parque central since the war the beggars seemed to have multiplied to four or five tunes their previous number disdaining a carriage senor glogauer led his son through the ragged clamorers tapping a way through with his cane sometimes a particularly sluggish beggar would receive a heavy thwack for his pains and senor glogauer would smile to himself and put a little extra tilt on his beautifully white panama hat his suit was white too karl wore a coffeecolored sailor suit and sweated his father made a point of making this journey on foot every sunday because he said karl must learn to know the people and not fear them they were all wretched cowards even when you had to deal with a whole pack of them as now this morning a brigade of volunteers had been lined up for inspection in the prado their uniforms were illfitting and not all of them had rifles of the same make but a little spanish lieutenant strutted up and down in front of them as proudly as if he were napoleon inspecting the grand army and behind the marshaled volunteers a military band played rousing marches and patriotic tunes the bells and the beggars and the band created such a cacophony that karl felt his ears would close up against the noise it echoed through the faded white grandeur of the street from the elaborate stucco walls of the hotels and official buildings on both sides of the avenue from the black and shining windows of the shops with their ornate gold silver and scarlet lettering and mingled with this noise were the smells smells from sewers and beggars and sweating soldiers threatening to drown the more savory smells of coffee and candy and cooking food karl was glad when they entered the babble of the cafe inglaterra on the west side of the parque central this was the fashionable place to come and as always it was crowded with the representatives of all nations professions and trades there were spanish officers businessmen lawyers priests there were a number of ladies in colors as rich as the feathers of the jungle birds there were merchants from all the countries of europe there were english planters and even a few american journalists or tobaccobuyers they sat at the tables crowded tightly together and drank beer or punch or whisky talking laughing quarrelling some stood at the counters while upstairs others ate late breakfasts or early luncheons or merely drank coffee senor glogauer guided karl into the cafe nodding to acquaintances smiling at friends and found a seat for himself you had better stand karl until a seat becomes free he said your usual lemonade thank you papa karl wished he could be at home reading his book in the cool semidarkness of the nursery senor glogauer studied the menu the cost he exclaimed ill swear it has doubled since last week the man sitting opposite spoke good spanish but was evidently english or american he smiled at senor glogauer its true what you people say youre not being blockaded by the warships youre being blockaded by the grocers senor glogauer pursed his lips in a cautious smile our own people are ruining us senor you are quite right the tradesmen are soaking the life out of us they blame the americans but i know they had prepared for this salting away their food knowing that if the blockade took effect they could charge anything they liked it is hard for us at the moment senor so i see said the stranger wryly when the americans get here things will be better eh senor glogauer shrugged not if la lucha is correct i was reading yesterday of the atrocities the american rough riders are committing in santiago they are drunk all the time they steal they shoot honest citizens at will and worse senor glogauer glanced significantly at karl the waiter came up he ordered a coffee for himself and a lemonade for karl karl wondered if they ate children im sure the reports are exaggerated said the stranger a few isolated cases perhaps senor glogauer put both his hands over the knob of his cane but i fear that if they come here i or my son might be one of those isolated cases we should be just as dead i think the stranger laughed i take your point senor he turned in his chair and looked out at the life of the parque but at least cuba will be master of her own fate when this is over possibly senor glogauer watched the waiter setting down his coffee you have no sympathy with the insurgents none why should i they have disrupted my business your view is understandable senor well i have work to do the stranger rose karl thought how ill and tired the man looked he put on his own slightly grubby panama it has been pleasant talking with you senor good day good day senor senor glogauer pointed to the vacant chair and gratefully karl went to it sitting down the lemonade was warm it tasted of flies thought karl he looked up at the huge electric fans rattling round and round on the ceiling they had only been installed last year but already there were specks of rust on their blades a little later when they were leaving the cafe inglaterra on their way across the parque to where senor glogauers carriage waited a spanish officer halted in front of them and saluted he had four soldiers with him they looked bored senor glogauer the spaniard gave a slight bow and brought his heels together yes senor glogauer frowned what is it captain we would like you to accompany us if you please to where for what a security matter i do apologize you are the father of wilhelm glogauer are you not i have disowned my son said karl glogauers father grimly i do not support his opinions you know what his opinions are vaguely i understand he is in favor of a break with spain i think he is rather more active a supporter of the insurgent cause than that senor the captain glanced at karl as if sharing a joke with him well if you will now come with us to our headquarters we can sort this whole thing out quickly must i come cant you ask me your questions here no what about the boy he will come with his father for a moment karl thought that his fathers decision was made from fear that his father needed karls moral support but that was silly for his father was such a proud selfreliant man with the soldiers behind them they walked out of the parque central and up obispo street until they reached a gateway guarded by more soldiers they went through the gate and into a courtyard here the captain dismissed the soldiers and gestured for senor glogauer to precede him into the building slowly with dignity senor glogauer ascended the steps and entered the foyer one hand on his cane the other grasping karls hand and now this way senor the captain indicated a dark passage with many doors leading off it on both sides they walked down this and down these steps senor down a curving flight of steps into the basement of the building the lower passage was lit by oillamps and another flight of steps down please and now the smell was worse even than the smell of the prado senor glogauer took out a pure white linen handkerchief and fastidiously wiped his lips where are we senor captain the cells senor glogauer this is where we question prisoners and so on you are not i am not of course not you are a private citizen we only seek your help i assure you your own loyalty is not in question into one of the cells there was a table in it on the table was a flickering oil lamp the lamp cast shadows which danced sluggishly there was a strong smell of damp of sweat of urine one of the shadows groaned senor glogauer started and peered at it mother of god i am afraid it is your son senor as you see he was captured only about twenty miles from the city he claimed that he was a small planter from the other side of the island but we found his name in his wallet and someone had heard of you your cigars you know which are so good we put two and two together and then you thank you very much confirmed that your son was an insurgent but we wanted to be sure this was your son naturally and not someone who had managed merely to get hold of his papers and again we thank you karl leave said senor glogauer remembering his other son his voice was shaking at once the sergeant at the door said the officer perhaps he will give you a drink but karl had already seen the dirty steel butchers hooks on which willis wrists had been impaled had seen the blue and yellow flesh around the wounds the drying blood he had seen willis poor beaten face his scarred body his beasts eyes calmly he came to a decision he looked up the corridor it was deserted when his father eventually came out of the cell weeping and asking to be pardoned and justifying himself and calling upon god and cursing his son all at the same time karl had gone he was walking steadily walking on his little legs towards the outskirts of the city on his way to find the insurgents still at liberty he intended to offer them his services and why do you dislike americans i dont like the way some of them think they own the world but didnt your people think that for centuries dont they still its different and why do you collect model soldiers i just do its relaxing a hobby because you cant manipulate real people so easily think what you like karl turns over on the bed and immediately regrets it but he lies there he feels the expected touch on his spine now you are feeling altogether more yourself arent you karl karls face is pressed into the pillow he cannot speak the mans body presses down on his and for a moment he smiles is this what they mean by the white mans burden sssssshhhhh says the black man what would you do you have three children one is eight years old a girl one is six years old a girl one is a few months old a boy you are told that you can save any two of them from death but not all three you are given five minutes to choose which one would you sacrifice london sewing circle a message one would have thought that the meaning of the word sweating as applied to work was sufficiently obvious but when the sweating system was inquired into by the committee of the house of lords the meaning became suddenly involved as a matter of fact the sweater was originally a man who kept his people at work for long hours a schoolboy who sweats for his examination studies for many hours beyond his usual working day the schoolboy meaning of the word was originally the trade meaning but of late years the sweating system has come to mean an unhappy combination of long hours and low pay the sweaters den is a workshop often a dwelling room as well in which under the most unhealthy conditions men and women toil for from sixteen to eighteen hours a day for a wage barely sufficient to keep body and soul together the sweating system as far as london is concerned exists chiefly at the east end but it flourishes also in the west notably in soho where the principal sweating trade tailoring is now largely carried on let us visit the east end first for here we can see the class which has largely contributed to the evil the destitute foreign jew place his alien foot for the first time upon the free soil of england living london by george r sims cassell co ltd karl turns onto his side he is aching he is weeping did i promise you pleasure asks the tall black man as he wipes his hands on a hotel towel and then stretches and then yawns did i no karls voice is muffled and small you can leave whenever you wish like this youll get used to it after all millions of others have have you known them all the black man parts the curtain it is now pitch dark outside and it is silent now thats a leading question he says the fact is karl you are intrigued by all these new experiences you welcome them why be a hypocrite im not the hypocrite the black man grins and wags a chiding finger dont take it out on me man that wouldnt be very liberal would it i never was very liberal youve been very liberal to me the black man rolls his eyes in a comic grimace karl has seen the expression earlier he begins to tremble again he looks at his own brown hands and he tries to make his brain see all this in a proper normal light he is eleven a dark filthy room many little sounds the black man says from beside the window come here karl automatically karl hauls himself from the bed and begins to make his way across the floor he remembers his mother and the tin of paint she threw at him which missed and ruined her wallpaper you dont love me he had said why should i she had replied he had been fourteen perhaps and ashamed of the question once he had asked it he is eleven many little regular sounds he approaches the black man that will do karl says the black man karl stops the black man approaches him under his breath he is humming old folks at home kneeling on the carpet karl begins to sing the words in an exaggerated minstrel accent karl was eleven his mother was thirty his father was thirty five they lived in london they had come to london from poland three years earlier they had been escaping a pogrom on their way they had been robbed of most of their money by their countrymen when they had arrived at the dockside they had been met by a jew who said he was from the same district as karls father and would help them he had taken them to lodgings which had proved poor and expensive when karls father ran out of money the man had loaned him a few shillings on his luggage and when karls father could not pay him back had kept the luggage and turned them out onto the street since then karls father had found work now they all worked karl his mother and his father they worked for a tailor karls father had been a printer in poland an educated man but there was not enough work for polish printers in london one day karls father hoped that a job would become vacant on a polish or russian newspaper then they would become respectable again as they had been in poland at present both karl his mother and his father all looked rather older than their respective ages they sat together at one corner of the long table karls mother worked a sewing machine karls father sewed the lapel of a jacket around the table sat other groups a man and a wife three sisters a mother and daughter a father and son two brothers they all had the same appearance were dressed in threadbare clothes of black and brown the womens mouths were tight shut the men mostly had thin straggly beards they were not all polish some were from other countries russia bohemia germany and elsewhere some could not even speak yiddish and were therefore incapable of conversing with anyone not from their own country the room in which they worked was lit by a single gas jet in the centre of the low ceiling there was a small window but it had been nailed up the walls were of naked plaster through which could be seen patches of damp brick although it was winter there was no fire in the room and the only heat came from the bodies of the workers there was a fireplace in the room but this was used to store the scraps of discarded material which could be reused for padding the smell of the people was very strong but now few of them really noticed it unless they left the room and came back in again which was rarely some people would stay there for days at a time sleeping in a corner and eating a bowl of soup someone would bring them before starting work again a week ago karl had been there when they had discovered that the man whose coughing they had all complained about had not woken up for seven hours another man had knelt down and listened at the sleeping mans chest he had nodded to the sleeping mans wife and sisterinlaw and together they had carried him from the room neither the wife nor the sisterinlaw came back for the rest of the day and it seemed to karl that when they did return the wifes whole soul had not been in her work and her eyes were redder than usual but the sisterinlaw seemed much the same the coughing man had not returned at all and of course karl reasoned it was because he was dead karls father laid down the coat it was time to eat he left the room and returned shortly with a small bundle wrapped in newspaper a single large jug of hot tea karls mother left her sewing machine and signed to karl the three of them sat in the corner of the room near the window while karls father unwrapped the newspaper and produced three cooked herrings he handed one to each of them they took turns to sip from the teajug the meal lasted ten minutes and was eaten in silence then they went back to their place at the table having carefully cleaned their fingers on the newspaper for mr armfelt would fine them if he discovered any grease spots on the clothes they were making karl looked at his mothers thin red fingers at his fathers lined face they were no worse off than the rest that was the phrase his father always used when he and his mother crawled into their end of the bed once he had prayed every night now that phrase was the nearest he came to a prayer the door opened and the room became a little more chill the door closed a short young man wearing a black bowler hat and a long overcoat stood there blowing on his fingers he spoke in russian his eyes wandering from face to face few looked up only karl stared at him any lad like to do a job for me said the young man urgent good money several of the workers had his attention now but karl had already raised his hand his father looked concerned but said nothing youll do fine said the young man five shillings and it wont take you long probably a message a message where like karl karls father spoke russian as well as he spoke polish just down to the docks not far im busy or id go myself but i need someone who knows a bit of english as well as russian i speak english said karl in english then youre definitely the lad i need is that all right glancing at karls father youve no objection i suppose not come back as soon as you can karl and dont let anybody take your money from you karls father began to sew again his mother turned the handle of the sewingmachine a trifle faster but that was all come on then said the young man karl got up its pelting down out there said the young man take the blanket karl said his father karl went to the corner and picked up the thin scrap of blanket he draped it round his shoulders the young man was already clumping down the stairs karl followed outside in the alley it was almost as dark as night heavy rain swished down and filled the broken street with black pools in which it seemed you could fall and drown a dog leaned in a doorway shivering at the far end of the alley were the lights of the pub blinds were drawn in half the windows of the buildings lining both sides of the street in some of the remaining windows could be seen faint ghostly lights a voice was shouting but whether it was in this alley or the next one karl couldnt tell the shouting stopped he huddled deeper into the blanket you know irongate stairs the young man looked rapidly up and down the alley where the boats come ashore said karl thats right well i want you to take this envelope to someone whos landing from the solchester in an hour or so tell no one you have the envelope save this man and mention the mans name as little as you can he may want your help do whatever he asks and when will you pay me when you have done the work how will i find you ill come back here dont worry im not like your damned masters i wont go back on my word the young man lifted his head almost proudly this days work could see an end to what you people have to suffer he handed karl the envelope on it in russian was written a single word a name kovrin kovrin said karl rolling his r this is the man hes very tall and thin said his new employer probably wearing a russian cap you know the sort of thing people wear when they first come over a very striking face im told youve not met him a relative come to look for work said the young man somewhat hastily thats enough go before youre too late and tell no one save him that you have met me or therell be no money for you get it karl nodded the rain was already soaking through his blanket he tucked the envelope into his shirt and began to trot along the alley avoiding the worst of the puddles as he passed the pub a piano began to play and he heard a cracked voice singing dont stop me arf a pint o beer its the only fing whats keepin me alive i dont mind yer stoppin of me corfee and me tea but arf a pint o beer a day is medicine to me i dont want no bloomin milk or eggs and to buy them ill find it very dear if you want to see me appy and contented all me life dont stop me arf a pint o beer now im a chap whats moderate in all i ave to drink and if thats wrong then tell me what is right karl did not hear all the words properly besides such songs all sounded the same to him with virtually the same tunes and the same sentiments he found the english rather crude and stupid particularly in their musical tastes he wished he were somewhere else whenever he wasnt working when he could daydream quite cheerfully as he sewed pads into jackets this feeling overwhelmed him he longed for the little town in poland he could barely remember for the sun and the cornfields the snows and the pines he had never been clear about why they had had to leave so hastily water filled his ruined shoes and made the cloth of his trousers stick to his thin legs he crossed another alley there were two or three english boys there they were scuffling about on the wet cobbles he hoped they wouldnt see him there was nothing that cheered bored english boys up so much as the prospect of baiting karl glogauer and it was important that he shouldnt lose the letter or fail to deliver it five shillings was worth nearly two days work in an hour he would make as much as he would normally make in thirtysix they hadnt seen him he reached the broader streets and entered commercial street which was crowded with slowmoving traffic everything even the cabs seemed beaten down by the grey rain the world was a place of blacks and dirty whites spattered with the yellow of gaslamps in the windows of the pieandmash shops the secondhand clothes shops the pubs and the pawnshops plodding drey horses threatened to smash their heads against the curved green fronts of the trams or the omnibuses carters swore at their beasts their rivals and themselves swathed in rubber or canvas or gabardine crouching beneath umbrellas men and women stumbled into each other or stepped aside just in time through all these dodged karl with his message in his shirt crossing aldgate and running down the dismal length of leman street past more pubs a few dismal shops crumbling houses brick walls which seemed to have no function but to block light from the street a police station with a blue lamp gleaming over its door another wall plastered with advertisements for meatdrinks soaps bicycles nerve tonics beers moneylenders political parties newspapers musichalls jobs furniture on easy terms the army the rain washed them down and made some of them look fresh again across cable street down dock street through another maze of alleys even darker than the others to wapping lane when he reached the river karl had to ask his way for in fact he had lied when he had told the man he knew irongate stairs people found his guttural accent hard to understand and lost patience with him quickly but one old man gave him the direction it was still some distance off he broke into a trot again the blanket drawn up over his head so that he looked like some supernatural creature a body without a skull running mindlessly through the cold streets when he reached irongate stairs the first boats were already bringing the immigrants ashore for the ship itself could not tie up at the wharf he saw that it was the right ship a mass of red and black belching oily smoke over the oily river smoke which also seemed pressed down by the rain and which would not rise the solchester was a regular caller at irongate stairs sailing twice a week from hamburg with its cargo of jews and political exiles karl had seen many identical people in his three years in whitechapel they were thin and there was hunger in their eyes bewildered bareheaded women with shawls round their shoulders more threadbare than karls blanket dragged their bundles from the boats to the wharf trying at the same time to keep control of their scrawny children a number of the men were quarrelling with the boatman refusing to pay the sixpence which was his standard charge they had been cheated so often on their journey that they were certain they were being cheated yet again others were staring in miserable astonishment at the blurred and blotted line of wharves and grim buildings which seemed to make up the entire city hesitating before entering the dark archway which protected this particular wharf the archway was crowded with loafers and touts all busily trying to confuse them to seize their luggage almost fighting to get possession of it two policemen stood near the exit to irongate stairs refusing to take part in any of the many arguments which broke out unable to understand the many questions which the refugees put to them simply smiling patronizingly and shaking their heads pointing to the reasonably welldressed man who moved anxiously amongst the people and asking questions in yiddish or lettish chiefly he wanted to know if the people had an address to go to karl recognized him this was mr somper the superintendent of the poor jews temporary shelter mr somper had met them three years before at that time karls father had been confident that he needed no such assistance karl saw that many of the newcomers were as confident as his father had been mr somper did his best to listen sympathetically to all the tales they told him of robbery at the frontier of the travel agent who told them they would easily find a good job in england of the oppression they had suffered in their own countries many waved pieces of crumpled paper on which addresses were written in english the names of friends or relatives who had already settled in london mr somper his dark face clouded with care saw to it that their baggage was loaded on to the waiting carts assured those who tried to hang on to their bundles that they would not be stolen united mothers with stray children and husbands with wives some of the people did not need his help and they looked as relieved as he did these were going on to america and were merely transferring from one boat to another karl could see no one of kovrins description he was jostled back and forth as the germans and the romanians and the russians many of them still wearing the embroidered smocks of their homeland crowded around him shrieking at each other at the loafers and the officials terrified by the oppressive skies and the gloomy darkness of the archway another boat pulled in and a tall man stepped from it he carried only a small bundle and was somewhat better dressed than those around him he wore a long overcoat which was buttoned to the neck a peaked russian cap and there were high boots on his feet karl knew immediately that this was kovrin as the man moved through the crowd making for the exit where the officials were checking the few papers the immigrants had karl ran up to him and tugged at his sleeve mr kovrin the man looked surprised and hesitated before answering he had pale blue eyes and high cheekbones there was a redness on his cheekbones which contrasted rather strangely with his pale skin he nodded kovrin yes i have a letter for you sir karl drew the sodden envelope from his shirt the ink had run but kovrins name was still there in faint outline kovrin frowned and glanced about him before opening the envelope and reading the message inside his lips moved slightly as he read when he had finished he looked down at karl who sent you pesotsky a short man he did not tell me his name you know where he lives no you know where this address is the russian pointed at the letter what is the address kovrin scowled at the letter and said slowly trinity street and falmouth road a doctors surgery southwark is it thats on the other side of the river said karl a long walk or you could get a cab a cab yes you speak english yes sir you will tell the driver where we wish to go there were fewer of the immigrants on irongate stairs now kovrin must have realized that he was beginning to look conspicuous he seized karls shoulder and guided him up to the exit showing a piece of paper to the official there the man seemed satisfied there was one cab standing outside it was old and the horse and driver seemed even older there murmured kovrin in russian that will do eh it is a long way to southwark sir i was not told karl tried to break free of the mans grip kovrin hissed through his teeth and felt in the pocket of his greatcoat he drew out halfasovereign and pushed it at karl will that do will that pay for your valuable time you urchin karl accepted the money trying to disguise the light of elation which had fired his eyes this was twice what the young man had offered him and he would get that as well if he helped the russian kovrin he shouted up to the cabby hey this gentleman and i wish to go to southwark to trinity street get a move on there ye can pay can ye said the old man spitting ive ad trouble wi you lot afore he looked meaningfully around him at noone the rain fell on the sheds on the patches of dirt on the brick walls erected for no apparent purpose along the lane could just be seen the last of the immigrants shuffling behind the carts which carried their baggage and their children ill want arf in advance how much karl asked call it three bob eighteen pence now eighteen pence when we get there thats too much take it or leave it he wants three shillings for the fare karl told the russian half now have you got it wearily and disdainfully kovrin displayed a handful of change karl took three sixpences and gave them to the driver all right op in said the driver he now spoke patronizingly which was the nearest his tone could get to being actually friendly the hansom creaked and groaned as the cabby whipped his horse up the springs in the seats squeaked and then the whole rickety contrivance was off making quite rapid progress out of the dock area and heading for tower bridge the nearest point of crossing into southwark a boat was passing under the bridge which was up a line of traffic waited for it to be lowered again while he waited karl looked towards the west the sky seemed lighter over that part of the city and the buildings seemed paler purer to him he had only been to the west once and had seen the buildings of parliament and westminster abbey in the sunshine they were tall and spacious and he had imagined them to be the palaces of very great men the cab jerked forward and began to move across the river passing through a pall of smoke left behind by the funnel of the boat doubtless the russian sitting in silence and glaring moodily out of the window noticed no great difference between the streets on this side of the river but karl saw prosperity here there were more food shops and there was more food sold in them they went through a market where stalls sold shellfish fried cod and potatoes meat of almost every variety as well as clothing toys vegetables cutlery everything one could possibly desire with a fortune in his pocket karls daydreams took a different turn as he thought of the luxuries they might buy perhaps on saturday after they had been to the synagogue certainly they could have new coats get their shoes repaired buy a piece of meat a cabbage the cab pulled up on the corner of trinity street and falmouth road the cabby rapped on the roof with his whip this is it they pushed open the door and descended karl took another three sixpences from the russian and handed them up to the driver who bit them nodded and was off again disappearing into dover street joining the other traffic karl looked at the building there was a dirty brass plate on the wall by the door he read seamens clinic he saw that the russian was looking suspiciously at the plate unable to understand the words are you a sailor karl asked are you ill be silent said kovrin ring the bell ill wait here he put his hand inside his coat tell them that kovrin is here karl went up the cracked steps and pulled the iron bell handle he heard a bell clang loudly he had to wait some time before the door was opened by an old man with a long white forked beard and hooded eyes what do you want boy said the man in english karl said also in english kovrin is here he jerked a thumb at the tall russian standing in the rain behind him now the old man smiled in unsuppressed delight here kovrin kovrin suddenly sprang up the steps pushing karl aside after a perfunctory embrace he and the old man went inside speaking rapidly to each other in russian karl followed them he was hoping to earn another half guinea he heard little of what they said just a few words st petersburg prison commune death and one very potent word he had heard many times before siberia had kovrin escaped from siberia there were quite a few russians who had karl had heard some of them talking in the house he could see that it was evidently no longer a doctors surgery the house in fact seemed virtually derelict with hardly any furniture but piles of paper all over the place many bundles of the same newspaper stood in one corner of the hall over these a mattress had been thrown and was serving someone as a bed most of the newspapers were in russian others were in english and in what karl guessed was german there were also handbills which echoed the headlines of the newspapers peasants revolt said one cruel suppression of democratic rights in st petersburg said another karl decided that these people must be political his father had always told him to steer clear of politicals they were always in trouble with the police perhaps he should leave but then the old man turned to him and smiled kindly you look hungry will you eat with us it would be foolish to turn down a free meal karl nodded they entered a big room warmed by a central stove from the way in which the room was laid out karl guessed that this had been the doctors waiting room but now it too stored bales of paper he could smell soup it made his mouth water at the same time there came a peculiar sound from below his feet growling thumping clanking it was as if some awful monster were chained in the cellar trying to escape the room shook the old man led karl and kovrin into what had once been the main surgery there were still glass instrument cases along the walls over in one corner they had installed a big black cooking range and at this stood a woman stirring an iron pot the woman was quite pretty but she looked scarcely less tired than karls mother she ladled thick soup into an earthenware bowl karls stomach rumbled the woman smiled shyly at kovrin whom she plainly did not know but had been expecting who is the boy she asked karl said karl he bowed not karl marx perhaps laughed the old man nudging karl on the shoulder but karl did not recognize the name karl glogauer he said the old man explained to the woman hes kovrins guide pesotsky sent him pesotsky couldnt come himself because hes being watched to meet kovrin would have been to betray him to our friends give the boy some soup tanya he took hold of kovrins arm now andrey vassilitch tell me everything that happened in petersburg your poor brother i have already heard about the rumbling from below grew louder it was like an earthquake karl ate the tasty soup sitting hunched over his bowl at the far end of the long bench the soup had meat in it and several kinds of vegetables at the other end of the bench kovrin and the old man talked quietly together hardly aware of their own bowls because of the noise from the cellar karl caught little of what they said but they seemed to be speaking much of killing and torture and exile he wondered why nobody else seemed to notice the noise the woman called tanya offered him more soup he wanted to take more but he was already feeling very strange the rich food was hard to hold down he felt that he might vomit at any moment but he persisted in keeping it in his stomach it would mean he would not need to eat tonight he summoned the courage to ask her what the noise was are we over an underground railway she smiled it is just the printing press she indicated a pile of leaflets on the bench we tell the english people what it is like in our country how we are ground under by the aristocrats and the middleclasses they want to know karl asked the question cynically his own experience had given him the answer again she smiled not many the other papers are for our countrymen they give news of what is going on in russia and in poland and elsewhere some of the papers go back to those countries the old man looked up putting a finger to his lips he shook his head at tanya and winked at karl what you dont hear wont harm you young one my father was a printer in poland karl said perhaps you have work for him he speaks both russian polish and yiddish he is an educated man theres little money in our work said tanya is your father for the cause i dont think so said karl is that necessary yes said kovrin suddenly his red cheekbones burned a little more hotly you must stop asking questions boy wait a while longer i think i will need to see pesotsky karl didnt tell kovrin that he didnt know where to find pesotsky because he might get another sum of money for taking kovrin back to whitechapel perhaps that would do also if he could introduce his father to one of these people they might decide to give him a job anyway then the family would be respectable again he looked down at ms clothes and felt miserable they had stopped steaming and were now almost dry an hour later the noise from below stopped karl hardly noticed for he was almost asleep with his head on his arms on the table someone seemed to be reciting a list to what had been the rhythm of the printing press elizelina kralchenskaya prison vera ivanovna siberia dmitry konstantinovitch dead yegor semyonitch dead dukmasovs all three dead the lebezyatnikovna sisters five years prison klinevich dead kudeyarov dead nikolayevich dead pervoyedov dead petrovich dead and i heard they found tarasevich in london and killed him thats so a bomb every bomb they use on us confirms the police in their view were always blowing ourselves up with our bombs arent we the old man laughed theyve been after this place for months one day a bomb will go off and the newspapers will report the accident another bunch of nihilists destroy themselves it is easier to think that what about cherpanski i heard he was in germany they rooted him out he fled i thought he was in england his wife and children are said to be here thats so karl fell asleep he dreamed of respectability he and his father and mother were living in the houses of parliament but for some reason they were still sewing coats for mr armfelt kovrin was shaking him wake up boy youve got to take me to pesotsky now how much karl said blearily kovrin smiled bitterly youre learning a good lesson arent you he put another halfguinea on the table karl picked it up you people kovrin began but then he shrugged and turned to the old man can we get a cab not much chance youd best walk anyway ft will be a degree safer karl pulled his blanket round him and stood up he was reluctant to leave the warmth of the room but at the same time he was anxious to show his parents the wealth he had earned for them his legs were stiff as he walked from the room and went to stand by the front door while kovrin exchanged a few last words with the old man kovrin opened the door the rain had stopped and the night was very still it must be very late thought karl the door closed behind them karl shivered he was not sure where they were but he had a general idea of the direction of the river once there he could find a bridge and he would know where he was he hoped kovrin would not be too angry when he discovered that karl could not lead him directly to pesotsky they began to walk through the cold deserted streets some of which were dimly lit by gaslamps a few cats screeched a few dogs barked and a few voices raised in anger came from the mean houses by which they passed once or twice a cab clattered into sight and they tried to hail it but it was engaged or refused to stop for them karl was surprised at how easily he found london bridge once across the sullen blackness of the thames he got his bearings and began to walk more confidently kovrin walking silently beside him in another halfanhour they had reached aldgate brightened by the flaring lamps of the coffeestall which stood open all night catering to the drunkards reluctant to go home to the homeless to the shift workers and even to some gentlemen who had finished sampling the lowlife of stepney and whitechapel and were waiting until they could find a cab there were a few women there too haggard sickly in the glare of the stall their garishly painted faces reminded karl of the icons he had seen in the rooms of the russians who lived on the same floor as his family even their soiled silks and their faded velvets had some of the quality of the clothes the people wore in the icons two of the women jeered at karl and kovrin as they passed through the pool of light and entered the gash of blackness which was the opening to the warren of alleys where karl lived karl was anxious to get home now he knew he had been away much longer than he had expected he did not wish to give his parents concern he passed the dark and silent pub kovrin stepping cautiously behind him he came to the door of the house his parents might be sleeping now or they might still be working they shared a room above the workroom kovrin whispered is this pesotskys you can go now this is where i live pesotsky said he would meet me here karl told him at last he felt relieved now that this confession was off his chest he owes me five shillings you see he said he would come here and pay it perhaps he is waiting for us inside kovrin cursed and shoved karl into the unlit doorway karl winced in pain as the russians hand squeezed his shoulder high up near the neck it will be all right he said pesotsky will come it will be all right kovrins grip relaxed and he gave a huge sigh putting his hand to his nose and rubbing it hissing a tune through his teeth as he considered what karl had told him karl pressed the latch of the door and they entered a narrow passage the passage was absolutely dark have you a match karl asked kovrin kovrin struck a match karl found the stump of candle and held it out for kovrin to light the russian just managed to light the wick before the match burned his fingers karl saw that kovrin had a gun in his other hand it was a peculiar gun with an oblong metal box coming down in front of the trigger karl had never seen a picture of a gun like it he wondered if kovrin had made it himself now where kovrin said he displayed the gun in the light of the guttering candle if i think youve led me into a trap pesotsky will come said karl it is not a trap he said he would meet me here karl pointed up the uncarpeted stairway he may be there shall we see kovrin considered this and then shook his head you go see if he is there and if he is bring him down to me ill wait karl left the candle with kovrin and began to grope his way up the two flights to the landing off which was the workroom he had seen no lights at the window but that was to be expected mr armfelt knew the law and protected himself against it few factory inspectors visited this part of whitechapel but there was no point in inviting their attention if they closed his business where else would the people find work karl saw a faint light under the door he opened it the gasjet was turned if anything a trifle lower at the table sat the women and the children and the men bent over their sewing karls father looked up as karl came in his eyes were red and bleary he could hardly see and his hands shook it was plain that he had been waiting up for karl karl saw that his mother was lying in the corner she was snoring karl his father stood up swaying what happened to you it took longer than i expected father i have got a lot of money and there is more to come and there is a man i met who might give you a job as a printer a printer karls father rubbed his eyes and sat down on his chair again it seemed he was finding it difficult to understand what karl was saying printer your mother was in despair she wanted to ask the police to find you she thought an accident i have eaten well father and i have earned a lot of money karl reached into his pocket this russian gave it to me he is very rich rich you have eaten good well you can tell me when we wake up go up now i will follow with your mother karl realized that his father was too tired to hear him properly karl had seen his father like this before you go father he said i have slept too and i have some more business to do before i sleep again that young man who came today has he returned the one who gave you the job his father screwed his eyes up and rubbed them yes he came back about four or five hours ago asking if you had returned he had come to pay me my money said karl did he say he would be back i think he did he seemed agitated what is going on karl nothing father karl remembered the gun in kovrins hand nothing which concerns us when pesotsky comes back it will all be finished they will go away karls father knelt beside his mother trying to wake her but she would not wake up karls father lay down beside his mother and was asleep karl smiled down at them when they woke they would be very pleased to see the twentyfive shillings he would by that time have earned and yet something marred his feeling of contentment he frowned realizing that it was the gun he had seen he hoped pesotsky would return soon and that he and kovrin would go away for good he could not send kovrin off somewhere because then pesotsky would not pay him the five shillings he had to wait he saw that a few of the others at the table were staring at him almost resentfully perhaps they were jealous of his good fortune he stared back and they resumed their concentration on their work he felt at that point what it must be like to be mr armfelt mr armfelt was scarcely any richer than the people he employed but he had power karl saw that power was almost as good as money and a little money gave one a great deal of power he stared in contempt around the room at the meanfaced people at his sprawled snoring parents he smiled kovrin came into the room the hand which had held the gun was now buried in his greatcoat pocket his face seemed paler than ever his red cheekbones even more pronounced is pesotsky here he is coming karl indicated his sleeping father my father said so when karl became amused by kovrins anxiety soon he said the people at the table were all looking up again one young woman said we are trying to work here go somewhere else to talk karl laughed the laughter was highpitched and unpleasant even he was shocked by it we will not be here much longer he said get on with your work then the young woman grumbled but resumed her sewing kovrin looked at them all in disgust you fools he said you will always be like this unless you do something about it you are all victims the young womans father who sat beside her stitching the seam of a pair of trousers raised his head and there was an unexpected gleam of irony in his eyes we are all victims he said comrade his hands continued to sew as he stared directly at kovrin we are all victims kovrin glanced away thats what i said he was disconcerted he stepped to the door ill wait on the landing he told karl karl joined him on the landing high above a little light filtered through a patched fanlight most of the glass had been replaced with slats of wood from the room behind them the small sounds of sewing continued like the noises made by rats as they searched the tenements for food karl smiled at kovrin and said familiarly hes mad that old man i think he meant you were a victim but you are rich arent you mr kovrin kovrin ignored him karl went and sat on the top stair he hardly felt the cold at all tomorrow he would have a new coat he heard the street door open below he looked up at kovrin who had also heard it karl nodded it could only be pesotsky kovrin pushed past karl and swiftly descended the stairs karl followed but when they reached the passage the candle was still flickering and it was plain that no one was there kovrin frowned his hand remained in the pocket of his coat he peered into the back of the passage behind the stairs pesotsky there was no reply and then the door was flung open suddenly and pesotsky stood framed in it he was hatless panting wildeyed christ is that kovrin he gasped kovrin said quietly kovrin here now said karl my five shillings mr pesotsky the young man ignored the outstretched hand as he spoke rapidly to kovrin all the plans gone wrong you shouldnt have come here i had to uncle theodore said you knew where cherpanski was hiding without cherpanski there is no point in kovrin broke off as pesotsky silenced him they have been following me for days our friends they dont know about cherpanski but they do know about theodores damned press its that they want to destroy but im their only link thats why ive been staying away i heard youd been at the press and had left for whitechapel i was followed but i think i shook them off wed better leave at once my five shillings sir said karl you promised uncomprehending pesotsky stared at karl for a long moment then he said to kovrin cherpanskis in the country hes staying with some english comrades yorkshire i think you can get the train youll be safe enough once youre out of london its the presses theyre chiefly after they dont care what we do here as long as none of our stuff gets back into russia now youll want kings cross station the door opened again and two men stood there one behind the other both were fat both wore black overcoats with astrakhan collars and had bowler hats on their heads they looked like successful businessmen the leader smiled here at last he said in russian karl saw that his companion carried a hatbox under his arm it was incongruous it was sinister karl began to retreat up the stairs stop him called the newcomer from the shadows of the next landing stepped two men they held revolvers karl stopped halfway up the stairs here was an explanation for the sound of the door opening which had brought them down this is a good cover comrade pesotsky said the leader is that your name these days pesotsky shrugged he looked completely dejected karl wondered who the welldressed russians could be they acted like policemen but the british police didnt employ foreigners he knew that much kovrin laughed its little captain minsky isnt it or have you changed your name too minsky pursed his lips and came a few paces into the passage it was obvious that he was puzzled by kovrins recognition he peered hard at kovrins face i dont know you no said kovrin quietly why have they transferred you to the foreign branch were your barbarities too terrible even for st petersburg minsky smiled as if complimented there is so little work for me in petersburg these days he said that is always the snag for a policeman if he is a success he faces unemployment vampire hissed pesotsky arent you satisfied yet must you drink the last drop of blood it is a feature of your kind pesotsky said minsky patiently that everything must be colored in the most melodramatic terms it is your basic weakness if i might offer advice you are failed poets the lot of you that is the worst sort of person to choose a career in politics pesotsky said sulkily well youve failed this time anyway this isnt the printing press its a sweatshop i complimented you once on your excellent cover said minsky do you want another compliment pesotsky shrugged good luck in your search then we havent time for a thorough search minsky told him he signed to the man with the hatbox we too have our difficulties problems of diplomacy and so on he took a watch from within his coat but we have a good five minutes i think karl was almost enjoying himself captain minsky really did believe that the printing press was hidden here shall we begin upstairs minsky said i understand thats where you were originally how could a press be upstairs pesotsky said these rotten boards wouldnt stand the weight the last press was very neatly distributed through several rooms minsky told him lead on please they ascended the stairs to the first landing karl guessed that the occupants of these rooms were probably awake and listening behind their doors he once again experienced a thrill of superiority to them one of the men who had been on the landing shook his head and pointed up the next flight of stairs the seven of them went up slowly captain minsky had his revolver in his gloved hand his three men also carried their revolvers trained on the wretched pesotsky and the glowering kovrin karl led the way this is where my father and mother work he said it is not a printers they are disgusting said minsky to his lieutenant with the hatbox they are so swift to employ children for their degraded work theres a light behind that door open it up boy karl opened the door of the workroom fighting to hide his grin his mother and father were still asleep the young woman who had complained before looked up and glared at him then all seven had pushed into the room minsky said oh you do look innocent but i know what youre really up to here wheres the press now everyone put down their work and looked at him in astonishment as he kicked at the wall in which the fireplace was set it rang hollow but that was because it was so thin there was an identical room on the other side but it satisfied minsky put that in here he told the man with the hatbox we must be leaving have you found the press then karl grinned openly minsky struck him across the mouth with the barrel of his revolver karl moaned as blood filled his right cheek he fell back over the sleeping bodies of his parents they stirred kovrin had drawn his gun he waved it to cover all four members of the secret police drop your weapons he shouted you pick that hatbox up again the man glanced uncertainly at minsky its already triggered we have a few moments karl realized there was a bomb in the box he tried to wake his father to tell him now the people who had been working were standing up there was a noisy outcry children were weeping women shrieking men shouting kovrin shot minsky one of minskys men shot kovrin kovrin fell back through the door and karl heard him fall to the landing outside pesotsky flung himself at the man who had shot kovrin another gun went off and pesotsky fell to the floor his fists clenched his stomach pulsing out blood karls father woke up his eyes widened at what they saw he clutched karl to him karls mother woke up she whimpered karl saw that minsky was dead the other three men hurried from the room and began to run downstairs an explosion filled the room karl was protected by his parents bodies but he felt them shudder and move as the explosion hit them he saw a little boy strike the far wall he saw the window shatter he saw the door collapse driven out into the darkness of the stairwell he saw fire send tendrils in all directions and then withdraw them the workbench had come to rest against the opposite wall it was black and broken the wall was naked brick and the brick was also black something was roaring his vision was wiped out and he saw only whiteness he closed his eyes and opened them again his eyes stung but he could see dimly even though the gas jet had been blown out throughout the room there was a terrible silence for a second or two then they began to groan soon the room was filled with their groaning karl saw that the floor sloped where it had not sloped before he saw that part of the outer wall had split through this great crack came moonlight black things shifted about on the floor now the entire street outside was alive with noise voices came from below and from above he heard feet on the stairs someone shone a lamp onto the scene and then retreated with a gasp karl stood up he was unhurt although his skin was stinging and he had some bruises he saw that his father had no right hand any more and that blood was oozing from the stump he put his head to his fathers chest he was still breathing his mother held her face she told karl that she was blind karl went out onto the landing and saw the crowd on both the upper and the lower stairs the man with the lamp was mr armfelt he was in his nightshirt he looked unwell and was staring at the figure who leaned on the wall on the opposite side of the door it was kovrin he was soaked in blood but he was breathing and the strange gun was still in his right hand karl hated kovrin whom he saw as the chief agent of this disaster he went and looked up into the tall russians eyes he took the pistol from kovrins limp hand as if the pistol had been supporting him kovrin crashed to the floor as soon as it was removed from his grasp karl looked down at him kovrin was dead none of the watchers spoke they all looked on as if they were the audience at some particularly terrifying melodrama karl took the lamp from mr armfelt and returned to the room many of the occupants were dead karl saw that the young woman was dead her body all broken and tangled up with that of her father the man who had said we are all victims karl sniffed minskys body had been blown under the shattered bench but pesotsky had been quite close to the recess where karl and his parents had lain although wounded he was alive he was chuckling with every spasm more blood gushed from his mouth he said thickly to karl thanks thanks he waited for the blood to subside theyve blown up the wrong place thanks to you what luck karl studied the gun he had taken from kovrin he assumed that it was basically the same as a revolver and contained at least another five bullets he held it in both hands and with both his index fingers on the trigger squeezed the gun went off with a bang and a flash and karls knuckles were driven back into his face cutting his lip again he lowered the gun and picked up the lamp which he had placed on the floor he advanced on pesotsky and held the lamp over the body the bullet had driven through one of pesotskys eyes and pesotsky was dead karl searched through pesotskys bloodsoaked clothes and found two shillings and some coppers he counted it three shillings and eightpence in all pesotsky had lied to him pesotsky had not possessed five shillings he spat on pesotskys face at the sound of the shot the people on the stairs had withdrawn a few paces only mr armfelt remained where he was he was talking rapidly to himself in a language karl did not recognize karl tucked the gun into the waistband of his trousers and turned kovrins corpse over in the pockets of the greatcoat he found about ten pounds in gold in an inner pocket he found some documents which he discarded and about fifty pounds in paper money carrying the lamp high he shone it on the blind face of his mother and on the painracked face of his father his father was awake and saying something about a doctor karl nodded it was sensible that they should get a doctor as soon as possible they could afford one now he held out the money so that his father could see it all the white banknotes and the bright gold i can look after you both father you will get better it doesnt matter if you cannot work we shall be respectable he saw that his father could still not quite understand with a shake of his head karl crouched down and put a kindly hand on his fathers shoulder he spoke clearly and gently as one might address a very young child who had failed to gather it was about to receive a birthday present and was not showing proper enthusiasm we can go to america father he inspected the wrist from which most of the hand had been blown with some of the rags he bandaged it stopping the worst of the bleeding and then the sobs began to come up from his stomach he did not know why he was crying but he could not control himself the sobs made him helpless his body was shaken by them and the noise he made was not very loud but it was the worst noise any of the listeners had heard that night even mr armfelt absorbed in his hysterical calculations was dimly aware of the noise and he became if anything even more depressed what do you think it can be something you ate do you want some aspirin aspirin wont do anything for me i dont know what causes a migraine a combination of things maybe or merely a useful evasion karl like some forms of gout or consumption one of those subtle diseases whose symptoms can only be transmitted by word of mouth thanks for your sympathy can i sleep now what a time to get a headache and you were just beginning to enjoy yourself too what would you do you live in a city a disaster has resulted in the collapse of society as you know it public amenities such as gas electricity telephones and postal services no longer exist there is no piped water rats and other vermin proliferate in the piles of garbage which uncollected contaminate the city disease is rife you have heard that things are equally bad in the country there strangers are attacked and killed if they try to settle in some ways it is more dangerous in the country than it is in the city where gangs of predatory men and women roam the streets you are used to city life you have a house a car and you have obtained several guns from a gun shop you broke into you raid shops and garages for fuel and food you have a water purifier and a camp stove you have a wife and three young children do you think it would be better to go out into the country and take your chances in the wild or would you try to work out a way of living and protecting yourself and your family in a city with which you are familiar calcutta flies doing business ten years ago an observer going to india with a fresh mind for its problems saw two great engines at work one was the british government ruling the country according to its own canons of what would be best for the people its system of education in western science and thought was shaking the old beliefs and social traditions by securing justice and enforcing peace it had set mens minds free to speculate and criticize for indias future it had no definite plan its ambitions to all outward seeming were confined to a steady growth of administrative efficiency the other engine was the awakening of a national consciousness it was feeding on the western ideas provided by the british government and the noble army of christian missionaries adapting them to its own purposes and building on them a rising demand that the people should be given a larger share in their own destiny our observer could not help being impressed by how far the two engines were from working in parallel there was friction and a general feeling of unsettlement in a cautious measure of political advance had been offered when lord minto was viceroy and lord morley was his opposite number in whitehall it was tainted however with an air of unreality which disquieted the officials and irritated the indian politician the cry grew loud for more rapid progress colonial selfgovernment was the slogan and the professional classes with an english education were busy in a widespread movement for a change in the methods of government as in all nationalist movements there was an extreme wing which leaned to direct action rather than the slower constitutional modes of agitation in eastern hyperbole they wrote and harangued about british tyranny and the duty of patriots to rise and become martyrs for freedom what they thus conceived in poetic frenzy was translated into sinister prose by others anarchists are never lacking in any crowded population especially when hunger is the bedfellow of so many in india the section of violence had got into touch with revolutionary camps in europe and the united states and sporadic outbursts from onwards including attempts on the life of two viceroys and a lieutenantgovernor indicated the existence of subterranean conspiracy public opinion condemned it but did little to check vehemence of language which continued to inflame weak minds the whole position was one of anxiety would it ever be possible to reconcile the two forces which were rapidly moving towards conflict the dominions and dependencies of the empire india by the rt hon lord meston kcsi lld collins there thats more like it kadi ah better better now youre moving karl bucks and bounces gasps and groans his muscles ache but he forces his body to make dramatic responses to every tiny stimulus the black man cheers him on yelling with delight ah sings karl oh ah oh up and down and from side to side whinnying like a proud stallion he carries the black man round the hotel room on his back his back is wet but not from sperm or sweat for in spite of all his shouts of pleasure the black man has not had an orgasm as jar as karl can tell his back is wet with just a drop or two of blood now youre moving now youre moving shouts the black man again hurrah karl is twelve an orphan halfgerman halfindian in calcutta in faster faster the black man has produced a riding crop and with it he flicks karls bouncing buttocks faster when karl was fifteen he left home to become a great painter he returned home three months later he had been turned down by the art school his mother had been very sympathetic she could afford to be faster thats it youre learning karl karl is twelve the red sun rises over red ships calcutta the riding crop cracks harder and karl gallops on karl was twelve his mother was dead his father was dead his two sisters were sixteen and seventeen and he did not often see them he embarrassed them karl was in business for himself and all things considered he was doing pretty well he worked the docks along the hooghly he described himself as an agent if something was wanted by the sailors or the passengers off the ships he would either get it for them or take them somewhere where they might obtain it he did better than the other boys in the same trade for he was quite lightskinned and he wore a european suit he spoke english and german perfectly and was fairly fluent in most other languages including a fair number of indian dialects because he knew when to be honest and who to bribe he was popular both with customers and suppliers and people coming from the big red steamers would ask after him when they landed having been recommended to him by friends because he was wellmannered and discreet he was tolerated by most of the indian and british policemen on the docks karl was rumored to be a millionaire but because of his overheads he was in fact worth only about a thousand rupees which he banked with his friend in barrackpore some fifteen miles away because it was safer he was content with his relatively small profit and had worked out that by the time he was twenty he would be quite rich enough to set himself up in a respectable business of some kind in central calcutta karls only concession to his indian mother was his turban his turban was virtually his trademark and he was recognized by it throughout calcutta it was a black turban of gleaming silk its single decoration was a small pin an enameled pin he had been given by a rather eccentric english lady who had sought his services a year or two back the pin was white gold and red and showed a crown with a scroll over it on the scroll was written edward vii it had been made the lady had told karl to commemorate the coronation the pin was therefore quite old and might be valuable karl felt it a fitting decoration for his black silk turban earlier that morning karl had been contacted by a young sailor who had offered to buy all the hemp karl could procure by that afternoon he had offered a reasonable price though not an especially good one and karl had agreed he knew that the young sailor had a customer in one of the european ports and that once his hemp arrived in europe it would be several tunes more valuable than it was in calcutta but karl was not worried he would make his profit and it would be satisfactory everyone would be happy the young sailor was english but he was working on a french boat the juliette currently taking on grain and indigo down at kalna the young sailor whose name was marsden had come up on one of the river steamers through the confusion of the dock strode karl walking as quickly as was sensible in the midday heat dodging bicycles and donkeys and carts and men who were scarcely visible for the huge bundles on their backs karl was proud of his city enjoying the profusion of different racial types the many contrasts and paradoxes of calcutta when he was cursed as he often was he would curse back in the same language when he was greeted by acquaintances he would give a little bow and salute them with cheeky condescension aping the manner of the lieutenantgovernor on one of his ceremonial processions through the city karl swaggered a little as he crossed kidderpore bridge and walked across the maidan he imagined that london must look very much like this and had heard the maidan compared to hyde park although the maidan was much bigger the trees were mainly of the english variety and reminded karl of the pictures he had seen of the english countryside he passed close to the cathedral with its gothic spire emerging from a mass of greenery and a large sheet of water in the foreground one of his customers whom he had taken on a tour of the city the year before had said it recalled exactly the view over bayswater from the bridge spanning the serpentine one day karl would visit london and see for himself he swaggered a little as he crossed the maidan he always felt more relaxed and at home in the better part of town near government house he hailed a rickshaw with a lordly wave and told the boy to take him to the junction of armenian street and bhudab road it was really not much further to walk but he felt in an expansive mood he leaned back in his seat and breathed the spiced air of the city he had told marsden the sailor that he could get him a hundred pounds worth of hemp if he wanted it marsden had agreed to bring a hundred pounds to dalhousie square that afternoon it would be one of the largest single business deals karl had pulled off he hoped that his friend in armenian street would be able to supply him with all the hemp he needed his friend worked for one of the big shipping firms in armenian street this friend was a messenger and made a number of trips in and out of calcutta during the week almost every one of these trips yielded a certain supply of hemp which karls friend then stored in a safe place until contacted by karl the rickshaw stopped at the corner of bhudab road and karl descended to the pavement giving the rickshaw boy a man of about fifty a generous tip the bustle in this part of town was of a different quality to that nearer the docks it was more assured more muted people didnt push so much or bellow at one or shout obscene insults and here too there were fewer people sharing considerably more money karl was considering armenian street as the site for his business when he opened it it would probably be an importexport business of some kind he began to walk sighing with pleasure at the thought of his future the bright sunshine and the blue sky served as a perfect background to the solid imposing victorian buildings making them all the more imposing karl strolled in their shade reading off their dignified signs as he passed the signs were beautifully painted in black script or gothic gold or tasteful silver there was nothing vulgar here karl entered the offices of a wellknown shipping company and asked for his friend when he had completed his business in armenian street karl took out his steel railway watch and saw he had plenty of time to lunch before meeting the young sailor dalhousie square was only a short distance away karl had in fact decided on one of his regular meeting places in st andrews church the red church as the indians called it which would be deserted that afternoon he had chosen a spot not too far from armenian street because it was unwise to carry a full case of hemp around for too long there was always the risk of an officious policeman deciding to find out what was in his case on the other hand st andrews was almost next door to the police headquarters and therefore one of the least likely places so karl hoped the police would reason to choose for an illegal transaction karl lunched at the small hotel called the imperial indian hotel in cotton street it was run by a bengali friend of his and served the most delicious curries in calcutta karl had brought many a customer here and his enthusiastic recommendations were always genuine the customers too were wellpleased in return for this service karl could eat at the imperial indian hotel whenever he wished he finished his lunch and passed the time of day with the manager of the restaurant before leaving it was nearly three oclock karl had arranged to meet marsden at seven minutes past three karl always arranged to meet people at odd minutes past the hour it was one of his superstitions the curry had settled well on his stomach and he moved unhurriedly through the city of his birth his suit was as clean and as wellpressed as ever his shirt was white and crisp and his black silk turban gleamed on his head like a fat sleek cat in fact karl himself was almost purring in a short time he would have a hundred pounds in his pocket fifty of that of course would go immediately to his friend in armenian street then there were a few other expenses such as the one he had just incurred during his chat with the manager of the hotel restaurant but there would at the end of the day be about forty pounds to bank with his friend in barrackpore a worthwhile sum his own business was not too far away now dalhousie square was one of karls favorite spots in the city he would often come here simply for pleasure but when he could he mixed business with pleasure and became an unofficial tourist guide as this was one of the oldest parts of calcutta he could show people everything they expected the original fort william had once stood here and part of it was now the customs house karl particularly enjoyed pointing out to the european ladies where the guard room of the fort had been this guard room had in become the infamous black hole karl could describe the sufferings of the people more than adequately he had had the satisfaction more than once of seeing sensitive english ladies faint away during his descriptions st andrews scottish presbyterian church stood in its own wooded grounds in which there were two large artificial ponds and the one drawback of the place was that it was infested with mosquitoes virtually all the year round as karl walked up the paved path between the trees he saw a great cloud of flies swarming in the bars of light between the grecian columns of the portico the clock on the lal girjas tower stood at six minutes past three karl opened the iron gate in the fence and went up the steps swatting at mosquitoes as he did so he killed them in a rather chiding friendly way he entered the relatively cool and almost deserted church there was no service today and the only other occupant standing awkwardly in the aisle between the pews of plain polished wood was the young sailor marsden his face was red and sticky with sweat he was wearing a pair of creamcolored shorts and a somewhat dirty white shirt his legs and his arms were bare and the mosquitoes were delighted marsden plainly had not wanted to make a noise in the church for fear of attracting someones attention so he had not slapped at the mosquitoes which covered his face arms hands and legs instead he was vainly trying to brush them off him they would fly up in a cloud and settle immediately continuing their feast marsden plainly had not wanted to make a noise in the good afternoon mr marsden sir said karl displaying the carpet bag containing the drug one hundred pounds worth as promised have you the money im glad to see you said marsden im being eaten alive in here what a place to choose is it always like this usually im afraid to say karl tried to sound completely english but to his annoyance he could still detect a slight lilt in his voice the lilt he knew betrayed him the sailor held out his hand for the bag karl saw that red lumps were rising on virtually every spot of the mans bare skin come on then old son said marsden lets see if its the genuine article karl smiled ingratiatingly it is one hundred percent perfect stuff mr marsden he put the bag at his feet and spread his hands can i say the same about your cash sir naturally you can of course you can dont say you dont trust me you little baboo its me should be worrying then let me see the money sir karl said reasonably i am sure you are an honorable man but youre damned right i am i wont have a bloody darkie marsden looked round nervously realizing he had raised his voice and it was echoing through the church he whispered im not have a bloody darkie telling me im a welsher the moneys back at the ship id have been a fool to come here alone with a hundred quid on me wouldnt i karl sighed so you do not have the money on your person mr marsden no i dont then i must keep the bag until you bring the money karl told him i am sorry business is business you agreed i know what we agreed said marsden defensively but ive got to be certain show me the stuff karl shrugged and opened the bag the aroma of hemp was unmistakable marsden leaned forward and sniffed he nodded how much money do you have with you said karl he was beginning to see that marsden had been exaggerating when he had said he would buy as much as karl could find marsden shrugged he put his hands in his pockets i dont know its mainly in rupees about four pounds ten karl sniggered it is not a hundred pounds i can get it back at the ship the ship is nearly fifty miles away mr marsden ill give it you tomorrow when marsden jumped forward and grabbed up the bag karl didnt move when marsden pushed him aside and ran with the bag up the aisle karl sat down in one of the pews if marsden really did have four pounds ten then at least karl would have lost nothing on the deal he would return the bag to his friend in armenian street and wait until he had a proper customer a short while later the young sikh from delhi came into the church he was holding the bag the sikh had been staying at the imperial indian hotel and had had trouble paying his bill the manager of the restaurant had told karl this and karl had told the sikh how he could earn the money to pay for his room the sikh evidently did not relish working for karl but he had no choice he handed karl the bag did he have enough money karl asked the sikh nodded is that all excellent karl told him where is marsden now in the tank he was probably drunk and fell in there it happens to sailors i hear in calcutta he may drown he may not thank you said karl he waited for the sikh to leave and remained in the church for some minutes watching the mosquitoes dancing in the light from the windows he was a little disappointed he had to admit but sooner or later another deal would come even if he had to work a trifle harder and there was no doubt that his savings would increase that his ambitions would be realized a priest appeared from behind the altar he saw karl and smiled at him youre early laddie if youve come for the choir practice youre learning says the black man lasciviously you see i said you would karl smiles up at him and stretches yes you said i would its funny you were saying about that girlfriend of yours the black man changes the subject how she became pregnant thats right before the abortion reforms it cost me the best part of two hundred pounds karl smiles a lot of uniforms but the other two were cheaper the two before they got those done themselves i was always unlucky i couldnt use those rubber things that was the trouble id just lose interest if i tried to put one on none of your children were born if you put it like that no let the next one be born the black man puts his hand on the muscles of karls upper forearm karl is astonished at this apparent expression of human feeling youre against abortion then the black one rolls over and reaches for his cigarettes on the bedside table they are nat shermans queen size cigaretellos an obscure american brand which karl hasnt seen before earlier he has studied the packet with some interest he accepts one of the slim brown cigarettes and lights up from the tip of the black mans he enjoys the taste youre against abortion then karl repeats im against the destruction of possibilities everything should be allowed to proliferate the interest lies in seeing which becomes dominant which wins ah says karl i see you want as many pieces on the board as you can get why not what would you do you are a refugee fleeing from a government which will kill you and your family if they catch you you reach the railway station and in a great deal of confusion manage to get your wife and children onto the train telling them to find a seat while you get the luggage on board after a while you manage to haul your luggage into the train as it is leaving the station you settle it in the corridor and go to look for your family you search both ends of the train and they are not there someone tells you that only half the train left that the other half is going to another destination could they have got into the other half by mistake what will you do pull the communication cord and set off back to the station leaving your luggage on the train wait until you reach the next station leave your luggage there and catch the next train back hope that your family will remain calm and follow you to your ultimate destination on the next available train quiet days in thann mixed meat never probably in the history of the world not even in the last years of the napoleonic domination has there taken place such a display of warlike passion as manifested itself in the most civilized countries of europe at the beginning of august then was seen how frail were the commercial and political forces on which modern cosmopolitanism had fondly relied for the obliteration of national barriers the elaborate system of european finance which in the opinion of some had rendered war impossible no more availed to avert the catastrophe than the utopian aspirations of international socialism or the links with which a common culture had bound together the more educated classes of the continent the world of credit set to work to adapt itself to conditions which seemed for a moment to threaten it with annihilation the voices of the advocates of a worldwide fraternity and equality were drowned in a roar of hostile preparation the great gulfs that separate slav latin teuton and anglosaxon were revealed and the forces which decide the destinies of the world were gauntly expressed in terms of racial antagonism history of the war part one published by the times its your turn now says the black man if you like im tired says karl oh come now tired psychological tiredness thats all the black man pats him on the back he gives karl an encouraging grin offering him the riding crop no says karl please no well i offered karl is thirteen his mother is twentynine his father is dead killed at verdun in his mother has gone to live with her sister in a village near thann in alsace leave me alone says karl of course i dont want to influence you when karl was thirteen he met a man who claimed to be his father it was in a public lavatory somewhere in west london im your dad the man had said his stiff penis had been exposed are you still at school lad karl had mumbled something and run out of the lavatory he regretted his decision later because the man could have been his father after all leave me in peace youre a very moody chap young karl laughs the black man he brings the riding crop down with a crack on karls back karl yells he scrambles cut of the bed and begins to get dressed thats it he says im sorry says the black man please forgive me karl is thirteen he is now the provider for his mother and his aunt the war continues not too far away while it continues karl will survive i misinterpreted you thats all says the black man please stay just a short while longer eh why should i but karl is weakening again karl was thirteen his mother was twentynine his father was dead killed in the war his mothers sister was twentysix also a widow where they lived there were many reminders of the war it had been fought around here for a while broken fences smashed trees craters filled with water old trenches and ruins ploughmen did not like to plough the ground for they always found at least one corpse karl had found a gun it was a good french rifle he had found plenty of ammunition in the belt of the soldier he had tried to get the soldiers boots but the flesh inside them had swollen up too much besides karl was perfectly satisfied with the gun with it he was now able to earn a decent living few people in the villages around thann could do that at present in a thick corduroy jacket and tweed knickerbockers secured below the knee with an english soldiers puttees with a large german knapsack over his shoulder and the french rifle in the crook of his arm karl sat comfortably on a slab of masonry and smoked a cigarette waiting it was close to sunrise and he had arrived at the ruined farmhouse about an hour earlier dawn was a yellow line on the horizon he unpacked his german field glasses and began to scan the surrounding ground mud tree stumps ditches trenches craters ruins all were shadowy all still karl was looking for movement he saw a dog it was quite big but thin it sauntered along the edge of a ditch wagging its feathery tail karl put down his field glasses and picked up his rifle he adjusted the sliding rear sight tucked the stock firmly into his shoulder braced his feet on the mound of brick took precise aim and squeezed the trigger of the rifle the stock banged into his shoulder and the gun jumped there was a report and smoke karl lowered the rifle and took out his fieldglasses the dog was not quite dead he stood up a thumb hooked into the strap of the knapsack by the tune he reached it the dog would be dead as he skinned the animal karl kept his eyes peeled for other quarry it was thin on the ground these days but if anyone could get it karl could he sawed off the head with the bayonet he carried for the purpose the butcher in thann did not ask questions when he bought karls loads of mixed meat but he did not like to be reminded too closely of the type of animal he was buying a little later karl shot two rats and the cat which had been hunting them he was amused by this exploit he wished he could have told someone of it but his mother and aunt were squeamish they preferred to believe he was hunting pigeons sometimes he did shoot a pigeon he would take that home and give it to his mother to cook part of the bag he would say it was just as well to keep up appearances by midday karl had done well his knapsack was so heavy that he had trouble carrying it he lay in a trench which was overgrown with a rich variety of weeds and grasses and smelled delicious the early autumn day was warm and karl had been amazed to see a pair of hares he had killed one but the other had fled he was hoping it would reappear when he had it he would go home he had not eaten that morning and was both tired and hungry the rims of the glasses were beginning to irritate his eyes when he caught a movement to the south and adjusted the focus quickly at first he was disappointed it wasnt the hare only a man the man was running sometimes he fell down but picked himself up again immediately running on his back was bowed and he waved his arms loosely as he ran karl could now see that he was in uniform the uniform was probably grey it was covered in mud the man was hatless and had no weapons karl hadnt seen a soldier in this part of the world for well over a year he had heard the gunfire as had everyone else but otherwise his particular village had seen no action for ages the german soldier came closer he was unshaven his eyes were red he gasped as he moved he seemed to be running away surely the allies had not broken through the german line karl had been certain it would hold forever it seemed to have been holding for almost as long as he could remember the thought unsettled him he had been happy with the status quo and wasnt sure if he looked forward to any change more likely the german soldier was a deserter a silly place to desert round here still karl yawned another quarter of an hour and hed leave he hung his field glasses round his neck and picked up his rifle he sighted down the barrel aiming at the german soldier he pretended he was in the war and that this was an attack on his trench he cocked the bolt of the rifle there were thousands of them attacking now he squeezed the trigger although he was surprised when the german threw up his arms and shouted he did not regret his action he raised his field glasses the bullet had struck the soldier in the stomach a careless shot but then he hadnt been aiming properly the soldier fell down in the long grass and karl saw it waving he frowned the waving stopped he wondered whether to go home or whether to cross the field and have a look at the soldier morally he should look at the soldier after all it was the first time he had killed a human being he shrugged and left his bag of mixed meat where it was the soldier might have something useful on him anyway with his rifle over his shoulder he began to plod towards the spot where his man had fallen is it morning yet asks karl yawning no a long time until morning karl the night seems to be lasting forever arent you glad he feels a strong hand in his crotch it squeezes him gently but firmly karls lips part a little yes says karl im glad what would you do you are a white man in a town where the people are predominantly black because of indignities and insufficient representation of their cause the black people militant and angry seize control of the town they are met with violence from some of the whites and they respond in turn lynching two white officials against whom they have particular grievances but now the people have become a mob and are out for white blood the mob is approaching your part of the town smashing and burning and beating whites some of the whites have been beaten to death you cannot contact your black friends and ask for their help because you dont know exactly where they are would you hide in the house and hope that the mob didnt bother you would you try to take your chances on the street and hope to find a black friend who would vouch for you would you go to the aid of other white people defending themselves against the mob would you then try to make everyone calm down or would you simply help your fellow white people kill the black people attacking them or would you join the black people attacking the whites and hope to win acceptance that way the downline to kiev shuffling along official verification came to hand yesterday of the report recently published of the extsars violent end at ekaterinburg at the hands of his red guards the message has been transmitted as follows through the wireless stations of the russian government recently ekaterinburg the capital of the red ural was seriously threatened

correspondence amongst which are letters by gregory rasputin to romanoff and his family all these materials will be examined and published in the near future news of the world sunday july seated before the mirror karl examines his flesh neither the harsh neon light over the mirror nor the mirror itself are flattering karl pouts his lips and rolls his eyes i dont think youre a nigerian at all now your accent changes all the time we all change our accents to suit our circumstances in the mirror their eyes meet karl feels cold we are all victims he is fourteen his mother and his father were killed in an explosion in a cafe in bobrinskaya karls friend puts friendly hands on karls shoulders what would you like to do now he is fourteen sitting on a flat car hanging on for dear life as the train roars across the plain the plain is dead it consists of nothing but the blackened stalks of what was once wheat the wheat has been deliberately burned the sky is huge and empty karl shivers any ideas the train moves to meet the sullen bank of grey cloud on the horizon it is like the end of the world the train carries death it goes to find more death that is its cargo its destiny at several points on the train on the locomotive bellowing ahead on the rocking carriages the bucking open trucks black flags flap like the wings of settling crows it is the ukraine and karl shivers karl was fourteen his mother and father had been thirtyfive when they were killed by the bomb they came from kiev but had been driven out during one of the pogroms they had thought it safer to stay with their relatives in bobrinskaya someone had let a bomb off in a cafe and karl had gone to alexandria where he had met the army of makhno the anarchist he had joined that army he had been in several battles since then and now he had a machine gun of his own to look after he loved the machine gun he had secured the stand to the flat car with big horseshoe nails it was an english machine gun a lewis his greatcoat was english too it was leather and had a special pocket in the front shaped like a revolver during their last battle near golta he had managed to acquire a revolver they had been beaten at that battle they were now making for kiev because the railway line direct to alexandria had been blown up to cut off their retreat makhnos black banners flew everywhere on the train some of the banners bore his slogan anarchy breeds order but most were plain makhno was in a bad mood since golta over the rattle of the train and the roar of the locomotive came the sounds of laughter of song of an accordions whine makhnos army lounged on every available surface young men mainly their clothes were evidence of a hundred successful raids one wore a tall silk hat decorated with streaming red and black ribbons his body was swathed in a sleeveless fur coat with the skirt hacked off to give his legs freedom he wore green cossack breeches tucked into red leather boots over his coat were crisscrossed four bandoliers of bullets in his hands was a rifle which intermittently he would fire into the air laughing all the time at his belt was a curved saber and stuck in the belt were a mauser automatic pistol and a smith and wesson revolver bottles were passed from hand to hand as they thundered along the young man in the top hat flung back his head and poured wine over his bearded face and down his throat breaking into song as the accordion began to play the armys familiar melody arise young men karl himself joined in with the sad bold last lines who lies under the green sward sang the man in the top hat we heroes of makhno sang karl saddle rugs for shrouds there was a great cheer and peaked caps sheepskin hats derby hats stocking caps and the caps of a dozen different regiments were waved or thrown through the steam from the engine karl was proud to be of this reckless company which cared nothing for death and very little for life the cause for which they fought might be doomed but what did it matter the human race was doomed they at least would have made their gesture there was not a man on the train who was not festooned with weapons sabres and rifles and pistols were common to all some sported ornate antique weapons broadswords officers dress swords pistols inlaid with gold silver and motheropearl they wore boaters solar toupees extravagant german helmets widebrimmed felt hats panamas and every variety of clothing near karl and manning one of the other machine guns a fat georgian was stripped to the waist wearing only a pair of gentlemans blue riding breeches and boots decorated with silver thread around his neck he had wound a long feather boa he was hatless but had on a pair of smoked glasses with gold rims at his belt were two military holsters containing matchedrevolvers the georgian claimed that they had belonged to the emperor himself sharing a bottle with the georgian was a sailor from odessa his vest open to the navel displaying a torso completely covered in pink and blue tattoos showing dragons swords and halfdressed ladies all mixed up together the freshest of the tattoos ran across his breastbone a nihilist slogan death to life a boy younger than karl wearing a torn and bloodstained surplice clutching a cooked chicken in one hand jumped down from the top of the boxcar behind them and swayed towards the sailor offering him half the chicken in exchange for the rest of the wine in his other hand he held an enormous butchers cleaver the boy was already nine parts drunk the train hooted balancing on the carriage ahead an old man with a student cap perched on his white hair hooted back he steadied himself by means of a cossack lance around which was tied a torn black skirt painted on the skirt was a yellow sunrise the old man hooted again before falling on his side and rolling dangerously close to the edge of the roof the lance remained where he had stuck it the old man lost his cap and began to laugh the train took a bend the old man fell off karl saluted the tumbling figure as it disappeared down a bank on the curve karl could see the front section of the train where nestor makhno himself sat the flatwagons on both sides of him were piled with guncarriages their dirty steel and brass work shining dully beneath a sun which now only made occasional appearances through the looming clouds a truck near to the engine was full of shaggy horses their backs covered by jewish prayershawls in place of blankets makhnos chosen heroes sat all around their leader their feet dangling over the sides of the wagons but none sat near him karl had an impression of nothing but legs there were legs in riding boots legs in puttees made from silk dresses or red plush or green baize ripped from a billiard table feet in yellow silk slippers with velvet pompoms bouncing on them in felt shoes in laced boots in sandals and in brogues or some completely naked scratched red horny dirty no songs came from makhnos guard they were probably all too drunk to sing on makhnos wagon a huge gleaming black landau had been anchored the landaus door was decorated with the gilded coat of arms of some dead aristocrat the upholstery was a rich crimson morocco leather the shafts of the landau stuck up into the air and on each shaft flapped a black banner of anarchy on each corner of the wagon was placed a highlypolished machine gun and at each machine gun squatted a man in a white cossack cap and a black leather greatcoat these four were not drunk makhno himself was probably not drunk he lay against the leather cushions of the landau and laughed to himself tossing a revolver high into the air and catching it again his feet in their shining black boots crossed indolently on the coach box nestor makhno was dying karl realized it suddenly the man was small and sickly his face was the grey face of death the black cossack hat and the gay embroidered cossack jacket he wore only served to emphasize the pallor of his features over his forehead hung a damp fringe of hair which made him look a little like some pictures of napoleon and his eyes were alive even from where he sat karl could see the eyes blazing with a wild and malevolent misery nestor makhno tossed the revolver up again and caught it he tossed it and caught it again karl saw that they were nearing a station the train howled the platform was deserted if there were passengers waiting for a train they were hiding people normally hid when makhnos army came through karl grinned to himself this was not an age in which the timid could survive the train slowed as it approached the station did makhno intend to stop for some reason and then incongruously a guard appeared on the platform he was dressed in the uniform of the railway line and he held a green flag in his right hand what a fool he was thought karl still sticking to the rule book while the world was being destroyed around him the guard raised his left hand to his head in a shaky salute there was a terrified grin on his face an imploring placatory grin the front part of the train was by now passing through the station karl saw nestor makhno catch his revolver and cock it then casually as his landau came level with the guard makhno fired he did not even bother to aim he had hardly glanced at the guard perhaps he had not really intended to hit the man but the guard fell stumbling backwards on buckling legs and then crumpling against the wall of his office his whole body shuddering as he dropped his flag and grasped at his neck his chest heaved and blood vomited from between his lips karl laughed he swung his machinegun round and jerked the trigger the gun began to sing the bullets smashed into the walls and made the body of the guard dance for a few seconds karl saw that the placatory smile was still on the dead mans face he pulled the trigger again and raked the whole station as they went through glass smashed a sign fell down someone screamed the name of the station was pomoshnaya karl turned to the fat georgian who had opened a fresh bottle of vodka and was drinking from it in great gulps he had hardly noticed karls action karl tapped him on the shoulder hey old pyat where the hell is pomoshnaya the georgian shrugged and offered karl the bottle he was too fuddled to understand the question the station was disappearing behind them soon it had vanished the tattooed sailor his arm around a snubnosed girl with cropped hair a mauser in her hand took the bottle from the georgian and placed it against the girls thin lips drink up he said he peered at karl what was that youngster karl tried to repeat his question but the train entered a tunnel and thick smoke filled their lungs stung their eyes and they could see nothing everyone began to cough and to curse it doesnt matter said karl youre still looking a bit pale says karls friend fingering his own ebony skin maybe you could do with another bath karl shakes his head itll be hard enough getting this lot off ive got to leave here sometime you know its going to be embarrassing only if you let it be brazen it out after all youre not the only one are you karl giggles i bet you say that to all the boys what would you do you have been told that you have at most a year to live would you decide to spend that year enjoying every possible pleasure doing charitable works in some quiet retreat relishing the simpler pleasures of life trying to accomplished one big thing that you will be remembered for in times to come putting all your resources into finding a cure for the illness you have or would you simply kill yourself and get the whole thing over with hitting the high spots on w fiftysix recognition trapped at sea in a violent thunder storm the uss akron largest and finest dirigible airship in the world crashed off the barnegat lightship at oclock this morning with officers and men aboard among them was rear admiral william a moffett chief of the bureau of aeronautics only four of the were known to have been saved at oclock this morning at that time the wreckage of the stricken airship was out of sight in the storm and darkness from the german oil tanker phoebus which first reported the catastrophe a northwest wind blowing about miles an hour was blowing the wreckage off shore and made rescue operations doubly difficult no hint of the cause of the disaster was contained in the fragmentary and frequently confusing reports received from the phoebus but it was considered highly likely that the great airship was struck by lightning the new york times april you were bound to get depressed after all that excitement says karls friend what about some coffee or would you rather i sent down for some more champagne he grins making an expansive gesture name your poison karl sighs and chews at his thumbnail his eyes are hooded he wont look at the black man all right then how can i cheer you up you could fuck off says karl take it easy karl you could fuck off what good would that do i didnt know you were interested in doing good where did you get that idea dont you feel more a person now than you felt before you came with me through the door more real maybe thats the trouble you dont like reality yes maybe thats it well that isnt my problem no its your problem yes oh come on now youre starting a new life and you cant manage even a tiny smile im not your slave says karl i dont have to do everything you say who said you had to me the black man laughs deridingly did i say that i thought that was the deal deal now youre being obscure i thought you wanted some fun karl is fifteen quite a little man now fuck off he says leave me alone in my experience the black man sits down beside him thats what people always say when they think theyre not getting enough attention its a challenge in a way leave me alone maybe youre right darling im not often wrong the black man once again puts his arm around karls shoulders karl is fifteen and in his own way pretty good looking hes dating the sweetest little tomato in the school oh jesus karl begins to weep now thats enough of that says his friend karl was fifteen his mom was forty his dad was fortytwo his dad had done all right for himself in his business and just recently had become president of one of the biggest investment trusts in the nation he had to celebrate increased karls allowance at his fifteenth birthday and turned a blind eye when karl borrowed his mothers car when he went out on a date karl was a big boy for his age and looked older than fifteen in his new tuxedo and with his hair gleaming with oil karl could have passed for twenty easily that was probably why nancy goldmann was so willing to let him take her out as they left the movie theatre he whistled one of the tunes from the film while he gathered his courage together to suggest to nancy what he had been meaning to suggest all evening nancy put her arm through his and saved him the worst part where to now she asked theres a speakeasy i know on west fifty six he guided her across the street while the cars honked on all sides it was getting dark and the lights were coming on all down forty second street what do you say nancy they reached his car it was a new ford coupe his dad had a cadillac limousine which he hoped to borrow by the time he was sixteen he opened the door for nancy a speakeasy karl i dont know she hesitated before getting into the car he glanced away from her calves his eyes would keep going to them it was the short fluffy skirt you could almost see through it aw come on nancy are you bored with speakeasies is that it she laughed no will it be dangerous gangsters and bootleggers and shooting and stuff itll be the dullest place in the world but we can get a drink there he hoped she would have a drink then she might do more than hold his hand and kiss him on the way home he had only a vague idea of what more meant if you want one of course well maybe just one he could see that nancy was excited all the way up to wth street she chattered beside him talking about the movie mostly he could tell that she was unconsciously seeing herself as ann pennington well he didnt mind that he grinned to himself as he parked the car taking his hat and his evening coat from the back he walked round and opened the door for nancy she really was beautiful and she was warm they crossed seventh avenue and were nearly bowled over by a man in a straw hat who mumbled an apology and hurried on karl thought it was a bit late in the year to be wearing a straw hat he shrugged and then on impulse leaned forward and kissed nancys cheek not only didnt she resist she blew him a kiss back and laughed her lovely trilling laugh did anyone ever tell you you looked like rudy vallee she said lots of people he smirked in a comic way and made her laugh again they came to a gaudy neon sign which flashed on and off it showed a pink pyramid a blue and green dancing girl a white camel it was called the casa blanca shall we said karl opening the door for her this is a restaurant just wait and see they checked their hats and coats and were shown by an ingratiating little waiter to a table some distance from the stand where a band was backing someone who looked and sounded almost exactly like janet gaynor she was even singing keep your sunny side up what happens next said nancy she was beginning to look disappointed the waiter brought the menus and bowed karl had been told what to say by his friend paul who had recommended the place could we have some soft drinks please he said certainly sir what kind uh the strong kind please karl looked significantly at the waiter yes sir the waiter went away again karl held nancys hand she responded with a funny little spasm and grinned at him what are you going to eat oh anything steak diane im mad about steak diane me too under the table his knee touched nancys and she didnt move away of course there was always the chance that she thought his knee was a table leg or something then when she looked at him she moved her chin up in a way that told him she knew it was his knee he swallowed hard the waiter arrived with the drinks he ordered two steak dianes and all the trimmings he lifted his glass and toasted nancy they sipped together theyve put a lot of lemon in it said nancy i guess they have to in case of a raid or something thats it said karl fingering his bow tie he saw his father just as his father saw him he wondered if his father would take the whole thing in good part the band struck up and a couple of thinly dressed lady dancers began to charleston he saw that the lady dining with his father was not his mother in fact she looked too young to be anybodys mother in spite of the makeup karls father left his place and came over to karls table mr glogauer nodded at nancy and glared at karl get out of here at once and dont tell your mother you saw me here tonight who told you about this place he had to speak loudly because the band was now in full swing a lot of people were clapping in time to the music i just knew about it dad did you do you come here often then do you know what kind of a place this is its a haunt of gangsters unmoral women all kinds of riffraff karl looked at his fathers young friend that young lady is the daughter of a business associate said mr glogauer i brought her here because she said she wanted to see some new york nightlife it is not the place for a boy of fifteen nancy got up i think ill get somebody to call me a cab she said she paused then took her drink and swallowed it all down karl ran after her and caught her at the checking desk theres another place i know nancy he said she stopped pulling on her hat and giving him a calculating look then her expression softened we could go back to my place my mom and pop are out oh great on the way back to nancys place in the car she put her arms round his neck and nibbled his ear and ruffled his hair youre just a little boy at heart arent you she said his knees shook he had heard that line earlier tonight and he could guess what it meant he knew he would always remember this day in september thanks karl accepts the cup of coffee his friend hands him how long have i been asleep not long karl remembers their scene he wishes it hadnt happened he was behaving like some little fairy all temperament and flounce homosexual relationships didnt have to be like that now it was normal after all between normal people he thought that was the difference he looked at his friend the man was sitting naked on the edge of a chest of drawers swinging his leg lazily as he smoked a cigarette his body really was beautiful it was attractive in itself it was very masculine oddly it made karl feel more masculine too that was what he found strange he had thought things would be different he kept being reminded of some quality he had always felt in his father when his father had been at home did you dream anything asked the black man i dont remember what would you do you are married with a family and you live in a small apartment in the city reasonably close to your work you learn that your mother has become very ill and can no longer look after herself you hate the idea of her coming to live with you in your already cramped conditions particularly since she is not a very nice old woman and tends to make the children nervous and your wife tense your mothers house is larger but in a part of the world which depresses you and which is also a long way from your work yet you have always sworn that you will not let her go into an old peoples home you know it would cause her considerable misery any other decision however would mean you changing your way of life quite radically would you sell your mothers house and use the money to buy a larger flat in your own area or would you move away to a completely different area perhaps somewhere in the country and look for a new job or would you decide after all that it would be best for everyone if she did go into a retirement home shanghai sally problems of diplomacy in shanghai is one of the most extraordinarily gruesome sights in the world i have never seen anything to approach it parts of chapei and hongkew where fighting was hottest are in ruins paralleling those of the western front in france the japanese looted this area which comprises several square miles not merely of furniture valuables and household possessions but of every nail every window wire every screw bolt nut or key every infinitesimal piece of metal they could lay hands on houses were ripped to pieces then the whole region set on fire no one lives in this charred ruin now no one could the japanese have however maintained street lighting the lighted avenues protrude through an area totally black totally devoid of human life like phosphorescent fingers poking into a grisly void what is known as the garden bridge separates this japaneseoccupied area with one rim of the international settlement proper barbed wire and sandbags protect it japanese sentries representing army navy and police stand at one end british sentries are at the other i have seen these tall englishmen go white with rage as the japanese a few feet away kicked coolies or slapped old men the japanese have lifeanddeath power over anyone in their area chinese passing the japanese sentries have to bow ceremoniously and doff their hats yet the japanese at the same time they may playfully prod a man across the bridge with their bayonets say that they are in china to make friends of the chinese people lest it be thought that i exaggerate i append the following reuter dispatch from shanghai of date march feeling is running high in british military circles here today as a result of an incident which occurred this morning on a bridge over the soochow creek japanese soldiers set upon and beat an old chinese man who happened to be on the bridge and then threw him over into the water the whole action was in full view of sentries of the durhams who were on duty at one end of the bridge the british soldiers unable to leave their posts were compelled helplessly to watch the old man drown while the japanese soldiers laughed and cheered inside asia by john gunter hamish hamilton we protect ourselves in so many foolish ways says karls friend but let the defenses drop and we discover that we are much happier i dont feel much happier not at present perhaps freedom after all takes some getting used to i dont feel free not yet there is no such thing as freedom of course there is its often hard to assimilate a new idea know your ideas dont seem particularly new oh you just havent understood yet thats all karl is sixteen shanghai is the largest city in china it is one of the most exciting and romantic cities in the world his mother and father came here to live two years ago there are no taxes in shanghai great ships stand in the harbor war ships stand a few miles out to sea anything can happen in shanghai why do people always need a philosophy to justify their lusts karl says spitefully whats so liberating about sex of any kind it isnt just the sex black smoke boils over the city from the north people are complaining no its power oh come come karl take it easy karl glogauer is sixteen although a german by birth he attends the british school because it is considered to be the best who do you like best asks karl men or women i love everyone karl karl was sixteen his mother was fortytwo his father was fifty they all lived in the better part of shanghai and enjoyed many benefits they would not have been able to afford in munich having dined with his father at the german club karl feeling fat and contented ambled through the revolving glass doors into the bright sunshine and noisy bustle of the bund shanghais main street and the citys heart the wide boulevard fronted the harbor and offered him a familiar view of junks and steamers and even a few yachts with crisp white sails sailing gently up towards the sea as he creased the crown of his creamcolored hat he noticed with dissatisfaction that there was a spot of dark grease on the cuff of his right sleeve he adjusted the hat on his head and with the fingers of both hands turned down the brim a little then he looked out over the bund to see if his mother had arrived yet she had arranged to meet him at three oclock and take him home in the car he searched the mass of traffic but couldnt see her there were trams and buses and trucks and cars rickshaws and pedicabs transport of every possible description but no rollsroyce he was content to wait and watch the passing throng shanghai must be the one place in the world where one never tired of the view he could see people on the bund of virtually every race on earth chinese from all parts of china from beautifully elegant businessmen in welltailored europeans suits mandarins in flowing silks singing girls in slit skirts flashily dressed gangster types sailors and soldiers to the poorest coolies in smocks or loincloths as well as the chinese there were indian merchants and clerks french industrialists with their wives german shipbrokers dutch swedish english and american factoryowners or their employees all moving along in the twin tides that swept back and forth along the bund as well as the babble of a hundred languages there was the rich satisfying smell of shanghai a mixture of human sweat and machine oil of spices and drugs and stimulants of cooking food and exhaust fumes horns barked beggars whined streetsellers shouted their wares shanghai karl smiled if it were not for the present trouble the japanese were having in their sector of the international district shanghai would offer a young man the best of all possible worlds for entertainment there were the cinemas theatres and clubs the brothels and dancehalls along the szechwan road you could buy anything you wanted a piece of jade a bale of silk embroideries fine porcelain imports from paris new york and london a child of any age or sex a pipe of opium a limousine with bulletproof glass the most exotic meal in the world the latest books in any language instruction in any religion or aspect of mysticism admittedly there was poverty but it was a price that had to be paid for so much color and beauty and experience in the two years that he had been here he had managed to sample only a few of shanghais delights and as he neared manhood the possibilities of what he could do became wider and wider no one could have a better education than to be brought up in shanghai he saw the rolls pull in to the curb and he waved his mother wearing one of her least extravagant hats leaned out of the window and waved back he sprang down the steps and pushed his way through the crowd until he got to the car the chinese chauffeur whose name karl could never remember and whom he always called hank got out and opened the door saluting him karl gave him a friendly grin he stepped into the car and stretched out beside his mother kissing her lightly on the cheek lovely perfume he said he nattered her as a matter of habit but she was always pleased it hardly occurred to him to dislike anything she chose to do wear or say she was his mother after all he was her son oh karl its been terrible today frau glogauer was hungarian and spoke german as she spoke french and english with a soft pretty accent she was very popular with the gentlemen in all the best european circles of the city i meant to do much more shopping but there wasnt time the traffic thats why i was late darling only five minutes mama karl looked at his swiss watch i always give you at least halfanhour you know that do you want to finish your shopping before we go home they lived in the fashionable frenchtown area to the west not too far from the race course in a large victorian gothic house which karls father had purchased very reasonably from the american who had previously owned it his mother shook her head no no i get irritable if i cant do everything at my own pace and its impossible this afternoon i wish those japanese would hurry up and restore order a handful of bandits cant cause that much trouble surely im sure if the japanese had a free hand the whole city would be better run we ought to put them in charge thered be fewer people to manage said karl dryly im afraid i dont like them awfully theyre a bit too heavyhanded in their methods if you ask me do the chinese understand any other methods his mother hated being contradicted she shrugged and pouted out of the window but perhaps youre right he conceded well see for yourself she said gesturing into the street it was true that the usual dense mass of traffic was if anything denser was moving more slowly with less order hampered by even more pedestrians than was normal at this hour karl didnt like the look of a lot of them really villainous wretches in their grubby smocks and headrags its chaos his mother continued were having to go halfway round the city to get home i suppose its the refugees from the japanese quarters said karl you could blame the japs for the delays too mother i blame the chinese she said firmly in the end it always comes down to them they are the most inefficient people on the face of the earth and lazy karl laughed and devious theyre terrible scamps ill agree but dont you love them really what would shanghai be without them orderly she said but she was forced to smile back at him making fun at herself for her outburst and clean they run all the vicerings you know the opiumdens the dancehalls thats what i meant they laughed together the car moved forward a few more inches the chauffeur sounded the horn frau glogauer hissed in despair and flung herself back against the upholstery her gloved fingers tapping the arm of the seat karl pulled the speaking tube towards him could you try another way hank this seems impassable the chinese in his neat grey uniform nodded but did nothing there were carts and rickshaws packing the street in front of him and a large truck blocking his way back we could walk said karl his mother ignored him her lips pursed a moment later she took out her handbag and opened the flap so that she could look into the mirror set inside it she brushed with her little finger at her right eyelid it was a gesture of withdrawal karl stared out of the window he could see the skyscrapers of the bund looming close behind them still they had not gone far he studied the shops on both sides for all that the street was crowded nobody seemed to be doing much business he watched a fat indian in a linen suit and a white turban pause outside a shop selling the newspapers of a dozen countries the indian picked his nose as he studied the papers then he selected an american pulp magazine from another rack and paid the proprietor rolling the magazine up the indian walked rapidly away it seemed to karl that some more mysterious transaction must have taken place but then every transaction seemed like that in shanghai the rolls rolled a few more feet then the chauffeur saw an opening in a side street and turned down it he managed to get halfway before a nightsoil cart the honeycarts as the chinese called them got in his way and he was forced to brake quite sharply the driver of the cart pretended not to notice the car one wheel of his cart mounted the sidewalk as he squeezed past then they were able to drive into the side street which was barely wide enough to accommodate the big phantom at least were moving said frau glogauer putting her compact back into her bag and closing the clasp with a snap where are we were going all round the world said karl the rivers just ahead i think is that a bridge he craned forward trying to get his bearings now that must be north my god what chapei they must have set fire to it the smoke i thought it was clouds will it mean trouble here i mean asked his mother taking hold of his arm he shook his head ive no idea were pretty close to the japanese concession now maybe we should go back and speak to father she was silent she liked to make the decisions but the political situation had never interested her she always found it boring now she had no information on which to base a decision yes i suppose so she said reluctantly that was gunfire wasnt it it was something exploding karl suddenly felt an intense hatred for the japanese with all their meddling they could ruin shanghai for everybody he took up the speaking tube back to the bund hank as soon as you can get out of here they entered a wider thoroughfare and karl saw the crowds part as if swept back by invisible walls through the corridor thus created a chinese youth came running hank had pulled out into the street and now the car was blocking the youths progress behind the youth came three little japanese policemen with clubs and pistols in their hands they were chasing him the youth did not appear to see the car and he struck it in the way that a moth might strike a screen door he fell backwards and then tried to scramble up he was completely dazed karl wondered what to do the japanese policemen flung themselves onto the youth their clubs rising and falling karl started to wind down the window hey his mother buried her face in his shoulder he saw a smear of powder on his lapel oh karl he put his arm around his mothers warm body the smell of her perfume seemed even stronger he saw blood well out of the bruises on the chinese boys face and back hank was trying to turn the car into the main street a tug went past on the river its funnel belching white smoke which contrasted sharply with the oily black smoke rising over chapei it was strange how peaceful the rest of the tall city looked the new york of the orient the clubs continued to rise and fall his mother snuffled in his shoulder karl turned his eyes away from the sight the car began to reverse a fraction there was a tap on the window one of the japanese policemen stood there bowing and smiling and saluting with his bloody club he made some apology in japanese and grinned widely shaking his free hand as if to say such things happen in even the bestrun city karl leant over and wound the window right up the car pulled away from the scene he didnt look back as they drove towards the bund again karls mother sniffed straightened up and fumbled in her handbag for a handkerchief oh that awful man she said and those policemen they must have been drunk karl was happy to accept this explanation of course he said they were drunk the car stopped there is certainly something secure says karl about a world which excludes women which is not to say that i deny their charms and their virtues but i can understand suddenly one of the strong appeals of the homosexual world now youre thinking of substituting one narrow world for another warns his friend i spoke earlier of broadening your experience thats quite different what if the person isnt up to being broadened i mean we all have a limited capacity for absorbing experience surely i could be as it were naturally narrow karl feels euphoric he smiles slowly no one but a moron could be that says the black man just a trifle prudishly what would you do a girl you know has become pregnant you are almost certainly the father the girl is not certain whether she wants the baby or not she asks you to help her to decide would you try to convince her to have an abortion would you try to convince her to have the baby would you offer to support her if she had the baby would you deny that the baby was yours and have nothing further to do with the girl if she decided to have an abortion and it had to be done privately would you offer to pay the whole cost would you tell her that the decision was entirely up to her and refuse to be drawn into any discussion memories of berlin dusty king alexander of yugoslavia was assassinated at marseilles yesterday m barthou the french foreign minister who had gone to the port to greet the king was also murdered the assassin jumped on the running board of the car in which the king who had only just landed was driving with m barthou general georges and admiral berthelot and fired a series of shots the general and the admiral were both wounded the murderer believed to be a croat was killed by the guard king alexander was on his way to paris for a visit of great political importance it was to have been the occasion of an attempt to find means through french mediation of improving relations between yugoslavia the ally of france and italy as preliminary to a francoitalian rapprochement the times october a policy of keeping the united states unentangled and free was announced here today by president roosevelt in his first public utterance recognizing the gravity of war abroad the general advance of the italian armies from eritrea has begun at dawn today men in four columns crossed the mareb river which forms the ethiopian boundary groups of light tanks operating ahead covered the crossing airplanes hovered overhead and long range guns fired occasional shells to discourage opposition italian planes bombed adowa and adigrat the new york times october and the italian government is capable of almost any kind of treason adolph hitler august he looks up into the cloudy eyes of his friend you seem quite pale he says why doesnt anything happen karl wipes his lips thats none of your business says the black man i feel like a drink do you want one he turns and goes to the table where the waiter has arranged a variety of drinks what do you like i dont drink much a lemonade will do a glass of wine all right karl accepts the glass of red wine he holds it up to a beam of moonlight i wish i could help you he says dont worry about that if you say so karl sits down on the edge of the bed swinging his legs and sipping his wine do you think im unimaginative i suppose you are but thats nothing to do with it maybe thats why i never made much of a painter there are lots of different kinds of imagination yes its a funny thing imagination is mans greatest strength and yet its also his central weakness imagination was a survival trait at first but when it becomes overdeveloped it destroys him like the tusks of a mammoth growing into its own eyes imagination in my opinion is being given far too much play these days i think youre talking nonsense says the black man it is true that he looks paler perhaps that is the moonlight too thinks karl probably agrees karl imagination can allow man to become anything he wants to be it gives us everything that is human and it creates the fears the bogeymen the devils which destroy us unreasoning terror what other beast has fears like ours the black man gives him an intense glare for a moment his eyes seem to shine with a feral gleam but perhaps that is the moonlight again karl is seventeen a dupe of the duce escaped from berlin and claiming italian citizenship he now finds himself drafted into the army you cant win in europe these days its bad there is pain there is heat are you afraid then asks karls friend of course im guilty fearful unfulfilled forget your guilts and your fears and you will be fulfilled and will i be human what are you afraid of karl was seventeen his mother had gone his father had gone his uncle an italian citizen adopted him in almost immediately karl had been conscripted into the army he had no work he had been conscripted under his uncles new name of giombini but they knew he was a jew really he had guessed he would be going to ethiopia when all the lads in the barracks had been issued with tropical kit almost everyone had been sure that it would be ethiopia and now after a considerable amount of sailing and marching here he was lying in the dust near a burning mud hut in a town called adowa with the noise of bombs and artillery all around him and a primitive spear stuck in his stomach his rifle stolen his body full of pain and his head full of regrets his comrades ran about all round him shooting at people he couldnt see he didnt bother to call out he would be punished for losing his rifle to a skinny brown man wearing a white sheet he hadnt even had a chance to kill somebody he regretted first that he had left berlin things might have quietened down there eventually after all he had left only because of his parents panic after the shop had been smashed in rome he had never been able to get used to the food he remembered the berlin restaurants and wished he had had a chance to eat one good meal before going he regretted too that he had not been able to realize his ambitions once in the army a clever lad could rise rapidly to an important rank in wartime he knew a bomb fell nearby and the force of it stirred his body a little dust began to drift over everything the yells and the shots and the sounds of the planes the whine of the shells and the bombs became distant the dust made his throat itch and he used all his strength to stop himself from coughing and so make the pain from his wound worse but he coughed at last and the spear quivered a sharp black line against the dust which made everything else look so vague he watched the spear forcing his eyes to focus on it it was all he had you were supposed to forget about worldly ambitions when you were dying but he felt cheated he had got out of berlin at the right tune really there was no point in believing otherwise friends of his would be in camps now or deported to some frightful dung heap in north africa italy had been a clever choice antisemitic feeling had never meant much in italy the fools who had gone to america and britain might find themselves victims of pogroms at any minute on the other hand the scandinavian countries had seemed to offer an alternative perhaps he should have tried his luck in sweden where so many people spoke german and he wouldnt have felt too strange a spasm of pain shook him it felt as if his entrails were being stirred around by a big spoon he had become so conscious of his innards he could visualize them all his lungs and his heart and his ruined stomach the yards and yards of offal curled like so many pink grey and yellow sausages inside him then his cock his balls the muscles in his strong naked legs his fingers his lips his eyes his nose and his ears the black line faded he forced it back into focus his blood no longer circulating smoothly through his veins and arteries but pumping out of the openings around the blade of the spear dribbling into the dust nothing would have happened in germany after the first outbursts it would have died down the trouble hitler and his friends would have turned their attention to russia to the real enemies the communists a funny little flutter started in his groin below the spear blade it was as if a moth were trying to get into the air using his groin as a flying field hopping about and beating its wings and failing to achieve takeoff he tried to see but fell back he was thirsty the line of the spear shaft had almost disappeared and he didnt bother to try to focus on it again the distant noises seemed to combine and establish close rhythms and counterrhythms coupled with the beating of his heart he recognized the tune some american popular song he had heard in a film he had hummed the same song for six months after he had seen the film in berlin it must have been four years ago maybe longer he wished that he had had a chance to make love to a woman he had always disdained whores a decent man didnt need whores he wished that he had been to a whore and found out what it was like one had offered last year as he walked to the railway station the film had been called sweet music he remembered he had never learned all the english words but had made up words to sound like them theres a tavern in the town in the town when atroola setsen dahn setsen dahn und der she sits on a luvaduvadee und never never sinka see so fairdeewell mein on tooday he had had ambitions to be an opera singer and he had had ambitions to be a great writer the potential had all been there it was just a question of choosing he might even have been a great general his possible incarnations marched before him through the dust and then he was dead you could be anything you wanted to be his friend kisses his shoulder or nothing could i be a woman and give birth to five children karl bites the black man the black man leaps up he is a blur for a moment in the halflight karl thinks that his friend is a woman and white and then an animal of some kind teeth bared the black man glowers at him dont do that to me and karl wipes his lips he turns his back on his friend okay you taste funny anyway what would you do you are a priest devoutly religious you are made miserable by the very idea of violence you are in every sense a man of peace one morning you are cutting bread in the small hall attached to your church you hear screams and oaths coming from the church itself you hurry into the church the knife still in your hand the soldier of the enemy currently occupying your country is in the act of raping a girl of about thirteen he has beaten her and torn her clothes he is just about to enter her she whimpers he grunts you recognize the girl as a member of your parish doubtless she came to the church for your help you shout but the soldier pays no attention you implore him to stop to no avail if you kill the soldier with your knife it will save the young girl from being hurt any further it might even save her life nobody knows the soldier has entered the church you could hide the body easily if you merely knock him out even if thats possible he will almost certainly take horrible reprisals on you your church and its congregation it has happened before in other towns yet you want to save the girl what would you do at the anschwitz ball strings the war in europe has been won but the air of europe smells of blood nazis and fascists have been defeated but their leaders have not yet been destroyed it is still touchandgo even now whether the surviving nazis are to have another chance of power or whether they can be made harmless for ever by their swift arraignment as war criminals and make no mistake this is not simply a matter for selfevident criminals such as goering rosenberg and those others guilty of outstanding crimes or responsible for the orders which caused major atrocities i have before me about twenty dossiers from small unimportant french villages and some from betterknown places they are unemotional accounts based on the evidence of named witnesses of events which occurred during the german occupation the massacre of dun les plages on june the destruction of the village of manlay on july the treatment and murder in the gestapo barracks at cannes and so it goes on sometimes the names of the local nazis responsible have been discovered and named often not the full horror of these cold indictments are revealed by the photographs which accompany them it is difficult to describe them two or three of the mildest only are reproduced here the nazis took delight in having themselves photographed with their victims while these were in their agony of outrage and torture it is not a simple crime that is depicted but a terrible degradation of man all the most horrible instincts which survive in our subconscious have come brutally out into the open it is no relapse into savagery because no savages ever behaved with such cold unfeeling educated brutality and shamelessness these dossiers are french but the same story is repeated in every country the germans occupied and also from those countries which allied themselves with the nazis arrests deportations questionings and punishment were all carried out with a deliberate maximum of brutality accompanied by every conceivable carnal license like the concentration camps these methods aimed at the destruction of confidence in democratic values at inducing a total surrender to the nazi terror they succeeded for a time probably more than most people who have never lived under nazi domination care to believe that fear and horror of the nazi bully has not yet been eradicated the war will not be over until all the outraged millions of onceoccupied europe enjoy full confidence that democratic governments can protect their rights and that those who have offended are punished and broken the nazis mobilized the untermensch the subhuman into their ranks the wickedness he worked is a vivid memory and it must be exorcised before europe can have peace picture post june dont try that with me you little white bastard karl displays his arms im a black bastard now we can soon change that oh hell im sorry says karl it was just an impulse well says his friend grimly youre certainly losing your inhibitions now arent you karl is eighteen he is very lucky along with the other members of the orchestra his mother told him there was a point to learning that you never knew when it came in useful fiddle playing and it was beautifully warm in the barracks he hoped they would dance all night come back to bed says karl please i thought you were a nice simple uncomplicated sort of chap says the black man thats what attracted me to you in the first place ah well it was my own fault i suppose karl is eighteen and playing johann strauss how beautiful how his mother would have loved it there are tears in his eyes he hoped they would dance forever the oswiecim waltz well im not at my best says karl i wasnt when you met me thats why i was in the roof garden its true says his friend that we hardly know each other yet karl was eighteen his mother had been given an injection some time ago and she had died his father had probably been killed in spain karl sat behind the screen with the other members of the orchestra and he played the violin that was his job in auschwitz it was the plum job and he had been lucky to get it others were doing much less pleasant work and it was so cold outside the big barrack hall was wellheated for the christmas dance and all the guards and noncommissioned officers their sweethearts and wives were enjoying themselves thoroughly in spite of rations being so short karl could see them through a gap in the screen as he and the others played the blue danube for the umpteenth time that evening round and round went the brown and grey uniforms round and round went the skirts and the dresses boots stamped on the uncarpeted boards of the hall beer flowed everyone laughed and joked and sang and enjoyed themselves and behind the leather upholstered screen borrowed for the occasion the band played on karl had two pullovers and a pair of thick corduroy trousers but he hardly needed the second pullover it was so warm he was much better off than when he had first come to the camp with his mother not that he had actually seen his mother at the camp because they had been segregated earlier on it had been awful at first seeing the faces of the older inmates feeling that you were bound to become like them losing all dignity he had suffered the humiliation while he summed up the angles and while a rather poor violinist had registered himself as a professional it had done the trick he had lost a lot of weight of course which was only to be expected nobody after all was doing very well this winter but he had kept his dignity and his life and there was no reason why he shouldnt go on for a long while as he was the guards liked his playing they were not very hot on bach and mozart and luckily neither was he he had always preferred the lighter gayer melodies he shut his eyes smiling as he enjoyed his own playing when he opened his eyes the others were not smiling they were all looking at him he shut his eyes again would you say you were a winner asks karls friend no everything considered id say i was a loser arent we all are we with the proper encouragement you could be a winner with my encouragement oh i dont know im something of a depressive as you may have noticed thats my point youve never had the encouragement i love you karl for myself of course i have a lot of influence i could get your work sold for good prices you could be rich i suppose id like that if i got you a lot of money what would you do i dont know give it back to you i dont mean my money i mean if your work sold well id buy a yacht i think go round the world its something ive always wanted to do i went to paris when i was younger did you like it it wasnt bad what would you do you own a dog it is a dog you inherited from a friend some years ago the friend asked you to look after it for a short while and never returned now the dog is getting old you have never cared much for it but you feel sympathetic towards it it has become long in the tooth it makes peculiar retching noises it has difficulty eating and sometimes its legs are so stiff you have to carry it up and down stairs the dog is rather curlike in its general demeanor it has never had what you would call a noble character it is nervous cowardly and given to hysterical barking because of the stiffness in its legs you take it to the veterinary clinic the dog has lived several years beyond its expected lifespan its eyes are failing and it is rather deaf you have the opportunity to ask the veterinary to destroy the dog and yet the dog is in no pain or any particular discomfort most of the time the vet says that it will go on quite happily for another year or so you hate the idea of witnessing the dogs last agonies when its time does come to die you have only a faint degree of affection for it it would really be better if the vet got it over with now what would you say to the vet the road to telaviv traps atiyah i have three comments to make first concerning what reid said about palestine having belonged to the turks under turkish suzerainty the arabs were not a subject people but partners with the turks in the empire second on what i considered was the false analogy when crossman said the jews were unlucky in that they were as he put it the last comers into the fields of overseas settlement he mentioned australia i would point out that the arabs in palestine do not belong to the same category as the aborigines of australia they belong to what was once a highlycivilized community and before what you call overseas settlement in palestine by the jews was begun the arabs were reawakening into a tremendous intellectual and spiritual activity after a period of decadence so there can be no comparison between the two cases crossman tom what do you think were the real mistakes of british policy which led up to what we all agree is an intolerable situation reid the british government during the first world war had induced the arabs who were in revolt against the turks to come in and fight on the allied side we made them a promise in the mcmahon declaration and then without their knowledge invited the jews to come in and establish a national home that was unwise and wicked as i understand it the idea of the british government was that the jews should come in and gradually become a majority that was a secret understanding and was doubly wicked picture post palestine can deadlock be broken discussion between edward atiyah arab office thomas reid mp rhs crossman mp and prof martin buber prof sociology jerusalem university july what does money mean to you karl well security i suppose first and foremost you mean it can buy you security a house food the obvious comforts power over others im not sure about power over others what has that to do with security oh it must have something to do with it at nineteen karl is bent on vengeance and the regaining of his rights he has a lee enfield rifle some hand grenades a bayonet and a long dagger he wears a khaki shirt and blue jeans on his head is a burnoose he stands on the bank overlooking the winding road to telaviv he lifts his head proudly into the sun you can keep yourself to yourself says karl with a grin cant you as long as others do the dweller in the suburbs karl must pursue a policy of armed neutrality i was brought up in the suburbs i never saw it like that i dont know what things are like in nigeria mind you at nineteen karl has a girl whom he has left behind in joppa there are five friends with him on the road he sees a dustcloud approaching it must be the jeep with the veil of his burnoose karl covers his mouth against the dust much the same says karls friend much the same karl was nineteen his mother had been gassed his father had been gassed at least that was as far as he knew he had been lucky in he and his uncle had managed to sneak into palestine and had not been caught as illegal immigrants but karl had soon realized the injustice of british rule and now he belonged to the irgun tsvai leumi pledged to drive the british out of palestine if they had to kill every single british man woman or child to do it it was time the jews turned there would never be another pogrom against the jews that was not answered in kind it was the only way he squinted against the glare of the sun breaking with some difficulty through the gauze of his headdress the air was dry dusty and stale there was no doubt about the single jeep droning along the road from abid to telaviv it was british he gestured down to his friend david david too was masked david too had a lee enfield rifle he handed up the fieldglasses to karl karl took them adjusted them saw that there were two soldiers in the jeep a sergeant and a corporal they would do further along the road in the shade of a clump of stunted palms waited the rest of the section karl signaled to them he swept the surrounding hills with his glasses to check that there was no one about even a goatherd could prove an embarrassment particularly if he were an arab the parched hills were deserted you could hear the jeep quite clearly now its engine whining as it changed gear and took an incline karl unclipped a grenade from his belt the others left the shade of the palms and got into the ditch behind the bank lying flat their rifles ready karl looked at david the boys dark eyes were troubled karl signaled for david to join him he pulled the pin from the grenade david imitated him unclipping a grenade pulling out the pin holding down the safety karl felt his legs begin to tremble he felt ill the heat was getting to him the jeep was almost level he sprang up steadied himself on the top of the bank and threw the grenade in a gentle graceful curve it was a beautiful throw it went straight into the back seat of the jeep the soldiers looked astonished they glanced back they glanced at karl the jeeps pace didnt slacken it blew up there was really no need for the second grenade which david threw and which landed in the road behind the remains of the jeep the two soldiers had been thrown out of the wreckage they were both alive though broken and bleeding one of them was trying to draw his sidearm karl walked slowly towards him his cocked with a casual movement of his foot he kicked the pistol from the sergeants hand as the man tried to get the hammer back the sergeants face was covered in blood out of the mess stared two blue eyes the ruined lips moved but there were no words nearby the corporal sat up the rest of the group joined karl im glad you werent killed karl said in his guttural english aaah said the corporal you dirty arab bastards he hugged his broken right arm we are jews said david ripping his mask down i dont believe it said the corporal we are going to hang you said karl pointing at the palms visible beyond the bank david went to look at the jeep the whole back section was buckled and one of the wheels was off some piece of machinery still gasped under the bonnet david reached into the jeep and turned the engine off there was a smell of leaking petrol its not much use to us said david what do you bloody mean said the corporal in horror what the fuck do you bloody mean its a message said karl from us to you ive made up my mind says karls friend as he busily massages karls buttocks im going to take you with me when i go home youll like it it isnt everyone i meet id do that for karl makes no reply he is feeling rather detached he doesnt remember when he felt so relaxed what would you do you are very attracted to a girl of about seventeen who is the daughter of one of your parents friends the girl lives with her parents in the country you take every opportunity to see her but although you take her out to formal parties a couple of times and to the cinema once you cant be sure how she feels towards you the more you see of her the more you want to make love to her but you realize she is quite young and you dont want to see yourself in the role of the seducer you would feel perfectly happy about it if she made the first move but she is shy she plainly likes you probably she is waiting for you to make the first move you are passing through the part of the world where she and her parents live and you decide to visit the house and ask if you can stay the night as its quite late you rather hope that at last you will be able to find an opportunity to make love to the girl you arrive at the house the door is opened by the girls mother an attractive woman in her early forties she is very welcoming you tell her your story and she says that of course you can stay for as long as you like she regrets that you will not be able to see her husband because he is away for some days on a business trip her daughter is out with one of her boyfriends you feel disappointed you have dinner with the mother and you and she drink quite a lot of wine the mother makes no doubt about the fact that she finds you attractive after dinner sitting together on a couch you find that you are holding hands with her you have a mixture of feelings she is attractive and you do feel that you want to make love but you are rather afraid of her experience secondly you feel that if you sleep with her it will complicate the situation so much that you will never have an opportunity to make love to her daughter whom you feel you could easily fall in love with you also need the mothers good will would you get up from the couch and make an excuse in order to go to bed would you make love to the mother up to a point and then claim that you were too drunk to go further would you pretend to be ill would you give in completely to your desires of the moment and sleep with the mother in spite of the inevitable situation which this would lead to would you hope that the daughter would be so intrigued by your having slept with her mother that she would make it clear that she too wanted to sleep with you or would you feel that the whole problem was too much leave the house and resolve never to see any member of the family ever again big bang in budapest leaving home in the troodos hills in the west of cyprus the job is being carried out by number commando of the royal marines together with two companies of the gordon highlanders the commando arrived

on the balcony while the business was discussed the students below thought they had been pushed out they tried to crush through the door and the police opened fire i did not see my daughter fall down they said she fell and the security police carried her away she may not be dead perhaps it were better she were picture post hungarian woman november picture post brings you this week the most dramatic exclusive of the war in egypt the first documentary record of life behind the egyptian lines after the invasion of port said how this story was obtained by correspondent william richardson and photographer max scheler is in itself one of the remarkable stories of the campaign while the fires at port said still burned richardson was at the british front line at el cap watching the egyptians dig in yards south three weeks later he stood at those same egyptian positions watching the british across the lines and getting a briefing on the campaign from brigadier anin helmini one of nassers most brilliant young generals yet to negotiate that yards between the british and egyptian lines richardson had to travel some times that distance flying from port said to cyprus and from there to athens and rome there the egyptian embassy granted him a visa after he told them he had been in port said and wanted to see both sides in a month he was accredited to three forces british egyptian and united nations a total of nationalities in uniform picture post december is your only pleasure making me feel pleasure karl asks of course not well you dont seem to be getting any fun out of this not physical anyway cerebral pleasures can be just as nice it depends what turns you on surely karl turns over theres something pretty repressed about you he says something almost dead you know how to be offensive dont you a short time ago you were just an ordinary london lad now youre behaving like the bitchiest little pansy i ever saw maybe i like the role karl is twenty he scents escape at last he has survived through the war through the communist takeover now there is a way out he prays that nothing will happen to frustrate his plans this time and maybe i dont when i said you could have anything you wanted i didnt mean a bra and suspender belt the black man turns away in disgust you said anything was worth trying didnt you i think id look rather nifty a few hormone jabs a pump or two of silicone in my chest id be a luscious tropical beauty wouldnt you love me more karl is twenty his brain is sharp he tears up his party membership card time for a change stop that orders karls friend or i wont bother you can leave now whos being narrow minded then karl is twenty both his mother and his father had been killed in the prewar pogroms he had survived in budapest by changing his name and keeping undercover until the war was over when the new government was installed he became a member of the communist party but he didnt tell his friends that would have been pointless since part of his work involved making discreet enquiries for the russian controlled security department on the westbahnhof now he was working out his best route to the austrian border he had joined with his fellow students in the least aggressive of the demonstrations against the russians and had established himself as a patriot when the russians won as they must win he would be in vienna on his way to america other hungarians would vouch for him a victim like themselves of russian imperialism earlier that day he had contacted the hotel where the tourists were staying they told him that there were some cars due to leave for austria in the afternoon by the big suspension bridge near the hotel he had described himself as a known patriot whom the secret police were even now hunting down they had been sympathetic and assured him of their help lenin street was comparatively quiet after the fighting which yesterday had blasted it into ruins he picked his way through the rubble ducking behind a fallen tree as a russian tank appeared its treads squeaking protest as they struck obstacle after obstacle karl reached the riverside a few people came running up the boulevard but there didnt seem to be anyone behind them karl decided it was safe to continue he could see the bridge from here not far to go there came the sudden slamming cacophony of automatic cannon a few blocks to the east a howl from a hundred throats at least the decisive rattle of machine guns the sound of running feet from out of a street opposite him karl saw about fifty freedom fighters most of them armed with rifles and a few with tommyguns dash like flushed rats onto the boulevard glance around and then run towards the bridge he cursed them why couldnt they have fled in the other direction but he decided to follow them at a distance on the suspension bridge he saw some tanks he hoped they had been immobilized bodies were being thrown over the side into the danube he hoped they were russian bodies he began to look for the cars a new citroen green one of the tourists had told him and a volkswagen he peered through the gaps in the ranks of the running men he began to run himself and then the automatic cannon started once more this time it was directly ahead and it was joined by the guns of the tanks the freedom fighters fell down some got up and crawled into doorways firing back karl fell flat rolling to the railings and looking to see if there was a way down to the river he might be able to swim the rest of the distance he looked across the danube he could still make it he would survive tanks came towards him he made a vain attempt to get through the railings and then lay still hoping they would think him dead more rifle and tommygun fire more russian gunfire a shout a strangled scream karl opened his eyes one of the tanks was on fire its camouflaged sides scorched its red star smeared with blood the tanks driver had tried to get out of his turret and had been shot to pieces the other tanks rumbled on the fighting became more distant karl glanced at his watch no more than five minutes before the cars left he got cautiously to his feet a russians head appeared in the turret behind the corpse of the driver the mans flat features were tormented he was doubtless badly wounded he saw karl karl put up his hands to show that he was unarmed he smiled an ingratiating smile the russian aimed a pistol at him karl tried to think what to do he felt the impact as the bullet struck his skull he went back against the railings and collapsed without seeing the danube again you seem to think im trying to corrupt your morals or something youve got hold of the wrong end of the stick i was simply talking about expanding your range of choices i dont know what to make of you karl then were even i might have to change my mind about you im sorry but thats the way it is if im to adopt you it will be on very strict terms i dont want you to embarrass me that goes for me too now dont be insolent karl what would you do you live in a poor country though you yourself are comparatively rich there is a famine in the country and many of the people are starving you want to help them you can afford to give the local people in the village about fifty pounds but the number of people in the village is at least two hundred if each receives part of the money you have it will buy them enough to live on for perhaps another four days would you give them the money on condition it was spent on the people most in need or on condition that it was spent on the children or would you select a handful of people you thought deserved the money most or would you hand it over to them and ask them to divide as they saw fit camping in kenya smoke here is the grim record as far as it can be added up in figures more than a thousand africans hanged for serious crimes mau mau convicts jailed for serious offences and detainees guilty of lesser mau mau offences in rehabilitation prison camps in these camps in carefully graded groups mau mau adherents are reeducated as decent citizens to make return possible mental attitudes have to be changed perhaps soulwashing is not too

illarmed men fighting for what they believe to be a good cause all but the broken remnants under their broken leader dedan kimathi have been killed or rounded up the battle to turn mau mau adherents into decent citizens goes well but the battle to remove the underlying causes social and economic of the antiwhite hate that created mau mau will go on for long years there too a hopeful beginning has been made princess margarets visit marks not just the end of a long nightmare but the beginning of a new era of multiracial integration and of fairer shares for the african in lovely kenya picture post october if the malayan and korean campaigns had drawn most attention during the early part of the s the british army had had much to do elsewhere in kenya the man mau gangs recruited from the kikuyu tribe had taken to the dense rain forests from which they made sorties to attack europeans and africans the kikuyu were land hungry their discontent was used to further the aspirations of urban africans for political independence over eight years british battalions batteries and engineer squadrons supported by small but intenselyworked communications and administrative teams broke the movement in alliance with a devoted police and civil government organization many of them africans or asian settlers only when this had been done was the cause of kenyan independence advanced history of the british army ed brigadier peter young and ltcol j p lawford ch after the war by brig anthony h farrarhockley dco mbe mc arthur barker youre right theres no such thing as innocence says karl

semidetached house which karls father who had never been out of work in his life had begun to buy just before the war his father had been doing indispensable war work and so had not had to serve in the army his father had thoughtfully changed his name to gower in partly because it sounded too german partly because you never knew if the germans won it sounded too jewish not of course that it was a jewish name karls dad denied any such suggestion vehemently it was an old austrian name resembling a name attached to one of the most ancient noble houses in vienna thats what karls grandfather had said anyway karl had been called after his granddad karls fathers name was english arnold karl had been in the army since he had joined up as a boyentrant in he had seen a lot of service since then but for the past two years hed been out in kenya clearing up the mau mau business which seemed to drag on forever off duty it was a smashing life the worst of the terrorism was over and it wasnt nearly so dangerous as it had been karl had an indian girlfriend in nairobi and he got there as often as he could to fuck the shit out of her she was a hot little bitch though he had a sneaking suspicion shed given him his last dose of crabs you could never tell with crabs mind you so he gave her the benefit of the doubt what a muff what tits it gave you a hard on just thinking about them lovely the jeep pulled up at the gates of the compound another days work was beginning karl was part of the special intelligence team working closely with the kenya police in this area where there was still a bit of mau mau mischief privately karl thought it would go on forever they didnt have a hope in hell of governing themselves he looked at the inmates behind the barbed wire it made you smile to think about it offering it that was different if you had to keep them under control of course you can have independence in two million bloody years ho ho ho he scratched his crotch with his swagger stick and grinned to himself as his driver presented their pass the jeep bumped its way over the uneven mud track into the compound the kikuyu prisoners stood or sat or leaned around looking with dull eyes at the jeep as it pulled up outside the main intelligence hut some distance away squatting on the ground were about a hundred natives listening to colonel wibberley giving them their usual brainwashing oh what a horrible lot they were in their reachmedown flannel shorts their tattered shirts their old tweed jackets their bare scabby feet some of them with silly grins all over their ugly mugs he saluted private peterson who was on guard outside the hut as usual he already felt like an officer morning sarge said peterson as he passed bastard corporal anderson all red and sweaty as usual was on duty at the desk when karl entered anderson always looked as if hed just been caught in the act of pulling his plonker shifty seedy you are an unwholesome little sod corporal anderson

right because hed been recognized and hed used to work at the farm he claimed to have been in his own village but that was a lie who could prove it and hed been in the camp more than once he was a known mau mau and he was a killer or knew who the killers were which was the same thing ill have a word with him i think said karl sipping the tea the corporal brought him ill have to get unpleasant today if he dont open his fucking mouth and ill have him all to my fucking self wont i corp yes sarge said corp his thick lips writhing his hot shifty eyes seething as if karl had caught him out at some really nasty form of selfabuse ugh you are horrible said karl automatically yes sarge karl snorted with laughter go and tell them to take our little black brother into the special room will you yes sarge corporal anderson went through the door into the back of the hut karl heard him talking to the guards a bit later anderson came back hes ready sarge thank you corporal said karl in his crisp decisive voice he put his cigarettes and matches in the top pocket of his shirt picked up his swagger stick and crossed the mud floor to the inner door oh he said hesitating before entering if our

the special room it was bleeding hot in here worse than a bloody native hut it stank of fucking kikuyu he gave the guard at the door of the special room his officers salute with the swagger stick touching the peak of his wellset cap he went into the special room and turned on the light lailu sat on the bench his bony knees sticking up at a peculiar angle his eyes wide and white there was a lot of sweat in his thin moustache hello mr lailu said karl with his cold grin how are you feeling this fine summer morning a bit warm sorry we cant open a window for you but you can see for yourself

lots of rights youve heard the lectures yes of course you have more than once because youve been here more than once havent you mr lailu lailu made no response at all to this karl went up to him and

lit the cigarette so that it was burning just right he put the matches back in his pocket and neatly he buttoned the pocket he drew a deep puff on the cigarette smoke lailu lailu trembled all over no boss please shit lailu you look as if you feel like one use the pot over there get them manky pants down lailu please boss karl moved quickly it was always best to move quickly he grabbed the top of the kikuyus shorts and ripped them down to his knees exposing the shriveled scarred genitals oh i have been here before havent i lailu thats better says karl youre insatiable says his friend admiringly ive got to admit it for all your faults whats the time karl asks my watch has stopped it must be coming up for morning says his friend what would you do you and your sister have been captured by your enemies they are brutal enemies they want information from you concerning your friends they say they will make you responsible for your sisters safety if you tell them all they wish to know she will go free if you do not they will humiliate terrorize and torture her in every way they know you are aware that should they catch your friends they will do the same thing to at least some of them perhaps all of them whom will you betray so long son lon babies quite apart from the enormous present importance of south vietnam and our actions there i have often reflected as one who was tempted to become a professional historian that the story of vietnam of southeast asia and of american policy there forms an extraordinarily broad case history involving almost all the major problems that have affected the world as a whole in the past years for the strands of the vietnam history include the characteristics of french colonial control compared to colonial control elsewhere the end of the colonial period the interrelation and competition of nationalism and communism our relation to the soviet union and communist china and their relationships with each other our relation to the european colonial power france and at least since the relation of vietnam to the wider question of national independence and selfdetermination in southeast asia and indeed throughout asia so all over southeast asia there is today a sense of confidence to which drew middleton again testified from his trip time has been bought and used but that confidence is not solid or secure for the future it would surely be disrupted if we were in president johnsons words to permit a communist takeover in south vietnam either through withdrawal or under the cloak of a meaningless agreement if on the contrary we proceed on our present course with measured military actions and with every possible nonmilitary measure and searching always for an avenue to peace the prospects for a peaceful and secure southeast asia now appear brighter than they have been at any time since the nations of the area were established on an independent basis the path to vietnam by william p bundy an address given before the national student association convention held at the university of maryland august united states information service american embassy london august we were all psyched up and as a result when we got there the shooting started almost as a chain reaction the majority of us had expected to meet vc combat troops but this did not turn out to be so after they got in the village i guess you could say that the men were out of control gi dennis conti they just kept walking towards us you could hear the little girl saying no no all of a sudden the gis opened up and cut them down ron haeberle reporter its just that they didnt know what they were supposed to do killing them seemed like a good idea so they did it the old lady who fought so hard was probably a vc maybe it was just her daughter jay roberts reporter my lai a report on the massacre and its aftermath seymour m hersh harpers magazine may mr daniel ellsberg will surrender tomorrow in boston where he lives he was charged on friday with being unlawfully in possession of secret documents and a warrant was issued for his arrest since he was named on june by a former reporter of the new york times as the man who provided the paper with its copy of a pentagon report mr ellsberg and his wife have been in hiding the pentagon is about to hand over its vietnam study to congress for confidential perusal on saturday the justice department sought to convince the court that indiscriminate publication of further documents from the study would endanger troops in south vietnam and prejudice the procedures for obtaining the release of prisoners the guardians june youre not slow are you says karls friend and to think i was worried now i think ill get some sleep not yet says karl yes now im not feeling too well as it happens you are looking a bit grey karl inspects the black mans flesh compared with his own skin it is quite pale karl is twentytwo and its his last few months in the army the past five months have been spent in vietnam although hes seen only one vc in that time hes tired and tense and fearful he jokes a lot like his buddies there is heat sticky sweat jungle mud flies poverty death but no viet cong and this is a place reputedly thick with them ill be all right when ive rested says karls friend youve worn me out thats all karl reaches out the index finger of his right hand and traces his nail over his friends lips you cant be that tired twentytwo and weary a diet of little more than cold crations for weeks at a stretch no change of clothing crashing around in the jungle for nothing it wasnt like the john wayne movies or maybe it was the shit and the heat and then the action coming fast and hard the victory the tough captain proving he was right to drive the men so hard after all the bowed heads as they honored dead buddies not many could stop the tears but so jar all they had was the shit and the heat karls friend opens his lips karl hasnt noticed before that his friends teeth are rather stained just let me rest a little karl was twentytwo his mother was fortyfive his father was fortyfour his father managed a hardware store in phoenix arizona his mother was a housewife karl was on a big mission at last he felt that if he survived the mission then it would all be over and he could look forward to going home back to his job as his fathers assistant it was all he wanted he sat shoulder to shoulder with his buddies in the shivering chopper as it flew them to the combat area he tried to read the tattered xmen comic book he had brought along but it was hard to concentrate nobody among the other members of his platoon was talking much karls hands were sweating and there was dark grease on them from the helicopter from his rifle the grease left his fingertips on the pages of the comic book he tucked the book into his shirt and buttoned his shirt he smoked a joint handed to him by bill leinster who like two thirds of the platoon was black the joint didnt do anything for him he shifted the extra belt of m ammo to a more comfortable position round his neck he was overloaded with equipment it would almost worth a battle to get rid of some of the weight of cartridges he was carrying he wondered what would be happening in son lon now the hamlet had already been hit by the mornings artillery barrage and the gunships had gone in ahead the first platoon must have arrived already karl was in the second platoon of four things would be warming up by the time he landed the note of the choppers engine changed and karl knew they were going down he thought he heard gunfire he wiped the grease off his hands onto the legs of his pants he took a grip on his m everyone else was beginning to straighten up ready themselves none of the faces showed much emotion and karl hoped that his face looked the same after what they did to goldberg said bill leinster in a masculine growl im going to get me a lot of ears karl grinned at him the choppers deck tilted a little as the machine settled sergeant grossman got the door open now karl could hear the firing quite clearly but he could only see a few trees through the door okay lets go said sergeant grossman grimly he sprayed a few rounds into the nearby trees and jumped out karl was the fifth man to follow him there were eight other helicopters on the ground a patch of mud entirely surrounded by trees karl could see four big gunships firing at something ahead two more big black transports were landing the noise of their rotors nearly drowned the noise of the guns it seemed that the first platoon was still in the landing zone karl saw sergeant grossman run across to where lieutenant snider was standing with his men they conferred for a few moments and then grossman ran back sniders platoon moved off into the jungle after waiting a moment or two grossman ordered his men forward entering the line of trees to the left and at an angle to where sniders men had gone in karl assumed that the vc in this area had either been killed or had retreated back to the hamlet there was no firing from the enemy as yet but he kept himself alert they could be anywhere in the jungle and they could attack in a dozen different ways he suddenly got a craving for a coors only a coors in a giantsize schooner the glass misted with frost and a kool enjoyed in that downtown bar where his fathers friends always drank on saturday nights that was what hed have when he got home the firing in front intensified the first platoon must have met head on with the vc karl peered through the trees but could still see nothing sergeant grossman waved at them to proceed with increased caution the comic book was scratching his stomach he regretted putting it in there he glanced back at bill leinster leinster had the only grenade launcher in this team karl wondered if leinster shouldnt be ahead of them with the machine gunner and the sergeant on the other hand their rear might not be protected by the squad supposed to be flanking them and there was no cover on either side as far as he knew though technically there should have been you could be hit from anywhere he began to inspect the ground for mines walking carefully in the footprints of the man in front of him sergeant grossman paused and for a second they halted karl could now see a flash of red brick through the trees they had reached the hamlet of son lon there was a lot of ground fire suddenly karl was ready he knew he would do well on this mission his whole body was alert they moved into the hamlet the first thing they saw were vc bodies in black silk pajamas and coolie hats they were mostly middleaged men and some women there didnt seem to be too many weapons about maybe these had been collected up by the first platoon two or three hootches were burning fitfully where they had been blasted by grenades and subsequently set on fire a couple of the red brick houses bore evidence of having been in the battle outside one of them lay the bloody corpse of a kid of around eight or nine that was the worst part when they used kids to draw your fire or even throw grenades at you more firing came from the left karl turned ducking and ready his rifle raised but no attack came they proceeded warily into the village leinster on command from grossman loaded his grenade launcher and started firing into the huts and houses as they passed in case any vc should still be in there it was menacingly safe thought karl wondering what the vc were waiting for or maybe there hadnt been as many slopes in the hamlet as captain heffer had anticipated or maybe they were in the paddyfields on the left and right of the village karl really wanted to fire at something just one vc would do it would justify everything else they entered the centre of the village the plaza lieutenant snider and his men were already there rounding up civilians there were a lot of bodies around the plaza mainly women and children karl was used to seeing corpses but he had never seen so many he was filled with disgust for the vietnamese they really had no human feelings they were just like the japs had been and the chinese in korea what was the point of fighting for them one of the kids in the group which had been rounded up ran forward he held a coke bottle in his hand offering it to the nearest soldier the soldier was henry tabori karl knew him tabori backed away from the boy and fired his m from the hip the m was an automatic the boy got all of it staggering backwards and falling into the gang of villagers some of the women and old men started to shout some fell to their knees wringing their hands karl had seen pictures of them doing that lieutenant snider turned away with a shrug tabori put a new magazine into his rifle by this time the other five men were firing into the ranks of the civilians they poured scores of rounds into them blood appeared on the jerking bodies bits of chipped bone flew karl saw sergeant grossman watching the slaughter grossmans face was thoughtful then grossman said okay leinster give it to em he indicated the huts which had so far not been blasted leinster loaded his grenade launcher and began sending grenades through every doorway he could see people started to run out grossman shot them down as they came his machinegunner opened up one by one the other boys started firing karl dropped to a kneeling position tucked his rifle hard against his shoulder set the gun to automatic and sent seventeen rounds into an old man as he stumbled from his hootch his hands raised in front of his face his legs streaming with blood he put a fresh magazine into the rifle the next time he fired he got a woman the woman with a dying action rolled over onto a baby the baby wasnt much good without its mother karl stepped closer and fired half his magazine into the baby all the huts and houses were smoking but people kept running out karl killed some more of them their numbers seemed to be endless grossman shouted for them to cease firing then led them at a run out of the plaza and along a dirt road get em out of the huts grossman told his men round the bastards up karl and a negro called keller went into one of the huts and kicked the family until they moved out into the street there were two old men an old woman two young girls a boy and a woman with a baby karl and keller waved their rifles and made the family join the others in the street they did not wait for grossmans orders to fire some of the women and the older girls and boys tried to put themselves between the soldiers and the smaller children the soldiers continued to fire until they were sure they were all dead leinster began to giggle soon they were all giggling they left the pile of corpses behind them and some of them swaggered as they walked we sure have got a lot of vc today said keller wiping his forehead with a rag karl looked back he saw a figure rising from the pile of corpses it was a girl of about thirteen dressed in a black smock and black pajamas she looked bewildered her eyes met karls karl turned away but he could still see her eyes he whirled dropped to one knee took careful aim and shot her head off he thought theyve all got to die now what have they got to live for anyway he was putting them out of their misery he thought if i dont shoot them theyll see that it was me who shot the others he reached up and pulled his helmet more firmly over his eyes it was not his fault they had told him he would be shooting vc it was too late now they left the hamlet and were on a road they saw a whole lot of women and children in a ditch between the road and a paddy field karl was the first to fire at them leinster finished them off with his grenades only karl and leinster had bothered to fire that time nobody looked at anybody else for a moment then grossman said its a vc village all were doing is stopping them from growing up to be vc leinster snorted yeah its true said sergeant grossman he looked around him at the paddyfields as if addressing the hundreds of hidden vc he thought must be there its true weve got to waste them all this tune another group of men emerged on the other side of the paddyfield they had two grenade launchers which they were firing at random into the ground and making the mud and plants gout up karl looked at the corpses in the ditch they were really mangled they went back into the village they found a hut with three old women in it they wasted the hut and its occupants they found a twoyearold kid screaming they wasted him they found a fifteenyearold girl after leinster and another man called aitken had torn her clothes off and raped her they wasted her karl didnt fuck her because he couldnt get a hardon but he was the one who shot her tits to ribbons jesus christ grinned karl as he and leinster paused for a moment what a day they both laughed they wasted two waterbuffalo and a cow leinster blew a hole in the cow with his launcher thats a messy cow said karl karl and leinster went hunting they were looking for anything which moved karl was haunted by the faces of the living these and not the dead were the ghosts that had to be exorcised he would not be accused by them he kicked aside the corpses of women to get at their babies he bayoneted the babies he and leinster went into the jungle and found some wounded kids they wasted the kids as they tried to stumble away they went back to the village and found lieutenant snider talking to captain heffer they were laughing too captain heffers pants were covered in mud to the thigh he had evidently been in one of the paddies the gunships and communications choppers were still thundering away overhead every two or three minutes you heard gunfire from somewhere karl couldnt see any more gooks for a moment he had an impulse to shoot lieutenant snider and captain heffer if they had turned and seen him he might have done so but leinster tapped him on the shoulder as if he guessed what he was thinking and jerked his thumb to indicate they should try the outlying hootches karl went with him part of the way but he had begun to feel tired he was hoping the battle would be over soon he saw an unshattered coke bottle lying on the ground he reached out to pick it up before it occurred to him that it might be boobytrapped he looked at it for a long tune struggling with his desire for a drink and his caution he trudged along the alley between the ruined huts the sprawled and shattered corpses why hadnt the vc appeared it was their fault he had been geared to fight he sound of gunfire went on and on and on karl found that he had left the village he thought he had better try to rejoin his squad they ought to retain military discipline it was the only way to make sense of this he tried to go back but he couldnt he dropped his rifle he leant down to pick it up on either side of him the rice paddies gleamed in the sun he reached out for the rifle but his boot caught it by accident and it fell into a ditch he climbed into the ditch to get the rifle he found it i was covered in slime he knew it would take him an age to clean it he realized that he had begun to cry he sat in the ditch and he shook with weeping a little later grossman found him grossman kneeled at the side of the ditch and patted karls shoulder whats the matter boy karl couldnt answer come on son said grossman kindly he picked karls slimy rifle out of the ditch and slung it over his own shoulder there aint much left to do here he helped karl to his feet karl drew a deep shuddering breath dont worry kid said grossman please he seemed to be begging karl as if karl were reminding him of something he didnt want to remember now you stop all that you hear it aint manly he spoke gruffly and kept patting karls shoulder but there was an edge to his voice too sorry said karl at last as they moved back to the village nobodys blaming you said the sergeant nobodys blaming nobody its what happens thats all im sorry said karl again but we have got to blame somebody sooner or later says karl we need victims somebodys got to suffer now lieutenant will you kindly tell the court just what you had to do with the human condition we are waiting lieutenant why are we not as happy as we might be lieutenant give your answer briefly and dearly what the hell are you talking about says his friend waking up and yawning i didnt say anything says karl you must have been dreaming do you feel better im not sure you dont look it what would you do you have been traveling in the desert there has been an accident your car has overturned and the friend with whom you were traveling has been badly hurt he is almost certain to die would you remain with him and hope that rescue would come soon would you leave him what water you have making him as comfortable as possible and setting off to find help knowing he will probably he dead by the time you return would you decide that since he was as good as dead you might as well take the water and food with you as it will give you a better chance would you remain in the shade of the wreck knowing that this would be the wisest thing to do but deciding not to waste your water on your dying friend london life city of shadows one of the happiest answers recorded of living statesmen was that in which a well known minister recommended to an alarmed interrogator the study of large maps the danger which seems so imminent so ominous when we read about it in a newspaper article or in the report of a speech grows reassuringly distant when considered through the medium of a good sized chart her majestys army indian and colonial forces a descriptive account by walter richards j s virtue co if sncc had said negro power or colored power white folks wouldve continued sleeping easy every night but black power black that word black and the visions came of alligatorinfested swamps arched by primordial trees with moss dripping from the limbs and out of the depths of the swamp the mire oozing from his skin came the black monster and fathers told their

lonely all as far as he can see the ruins stretch away some black some grey some red outlined against a cold sky the world is over karls friend seizes him by the wrist the grip hurts karl he tries to break free karl blinks the pain swims through him confusing him an old fiftyone a scrawny fiftyone and what has he survived for what right has he had to survive when others have not there is no justice karl you promised me last night i dont remember much of last night it was a bit confused last night wasnt it karl im warning you karl smiles taking an interest in his fine black body he turns one of his arms this way and that as the dawn sunshine glints on the rich shiny skin thats nice he says after all ive done for you says his friend almost weeping theres no justice says karl or maybe there is a very little maybe you have to work hard to manufacture tiny quantities of justice the way you get gold by panning for it eh theres only desire his friend hisses through savage stained teeth his eyes are bloodshot karl karl karl youre looking even worse in the daylight says karl you could do with some breakfast as much as me lets order it now we can talk while we eat karl will be fiftyone his mother will have been dead longsince of cancer his father will have been dead for eight years killed in the wolverhampton riots of karl will be unemployed he will sit by the shattered window of his front room on the ground floor of the house in ladbroke grove london he will look out into the festering street there will be nobody there but the rats and the cats there will be only a handful of other human beings left in london most of them in southwark by the river but the wars will be over it will be peaceful peaceful for karl at any rate karl will have been a cannibal for two of the years he has been home having helped in the destruction of hong kong and served as a mercenary in paris where he will have gained the taste for human flesh anything will be preferable to the rats and the cats not that by this time he will be hunting his meat himself he will have lost any wish to kill the few creatures like him who will haunt the diseased ruins of the city karl will brood by the window he will have secured all other doors and windows against attack though there will have been no attack up to that time he will have left the wide window open since it will command the best view of ladbroke grove he will have been burning books in the big fireplace to keep himself warm he will not any longer be reading books they will all depress him too much he will not as far as it will be possible think any more he will wish to become only a part of whatever it will be that he is part of from the corners of his eyes he will see fleeting shadows which he will think are people perhaps even old friends who will have come seeking him out but they will only be shadows or perhaps rats or cats but probably only shadows he will come to think of these shadows in quite an affectionate way he will see them as the ghosts of his unborn children he will see them as the women he never loved the men he never knew karl will scratch his scurvy unhealthy body his body will be dying much faster now that the cans will have run out and he will no longer be able to find the tablets of vitamins he has used before he will not fear death he will not understand death just as he will not understand life one idea will run together with another nothing will have a greater or a lesser value than another thing all will have been brought to the same state this will be peace of a particular kind this will be security and stability of a particular kind there will be no other kind who will have come seeking him out but they will only be neither content nor discontented as the time will pass all things will flow together there will be no past no present no future later karl will lie like a lizard unmoving on the flat table his rifle forgotten beside him and he will stare out at the ruins as if he has known them all his life as if they like him are eternal they eat breakfast its a lovely morning says karl i am very rich says his friend i can let you have all you want women other men anyone power you can satisfy every desire and i will be whatever you want me to be i promise i will serve you i will be like a genie from the lamp bringing you your hearts every whim it is true karl the sickly eyes burn with a fever of lust im not sure i want anything at the moment karl finishes his coffee stay with me karl karl feels sorry for his friend he puts down his napkin ill tell you what well do today well go back to the roof garden what about it if thats what you want im very grateful to you in a way says karl what would you do your father has been to hospital at his doctors request because he has been suffering pain in his chest his stomach and his throat the hospital has told him that he has a form of rheumatism and prescribes certain kinds of treatment you receive a request from your fathers doctor to visit him the doctor tells you that your father is actually suffering from inoperable cancer he has cancer of the lung of the stomach and of the throat he has at very most a year to live the doctor says that the decision whether to tell your father of this is up to you he the doctor cant accept the responsibility your father loves life and he fears death would you tell your father the whole truth would you offer him part of the truth and tell him that he has a chance of recovering would you think it better for your fathers peace of mind that he know nothing in the roof garden happy day the prosecution today won its fight to try capt ernest l medina on murder charges but decided not to seek the death penalty international herald tribune june karl and his friends stood together by the railing looking at the view over london it was a beautiful warm day karl breathed in the scents of the flowers of the store below of the traffic beyond he felt contented his friends pale blue eyes were troubled he looked thin and his silk suit hardly seemed to fit any longer he had put on several rings and when he tapped his fingers nervously on the rails they seemed to be the only part of him that had any life are you sure you know what youre doing karl said his friend i think so honestly it would be for the best now it couldnt last i could do so much for you still if you knew who i really was youd believe me oh ive seen your pictures i didnt want to put you out by mentioning it i didnt recognize you at first that was all i offered you an empire and youve chosen a cabbage patch karl grinned its more my style boss you can always change your mind i know thank you karls friend was reluctant to say goodbye but he was too miserable to attempt to summon any further strength and try to persuade karl karl adjusted the hat he had bought for himself on the way up i think ill go down and buy a suit somewhere now he said adios the white man nodded and turned away without saying goodbye look after yourself said karl get some sleep with a spring in his step he walked through the woodland garden to the exit the two middleaged ladies were there as usual a fat tourist came out of the lift and bumped into him the tourist cursed him and then apologized almost at the same time he was evidently embarrassed dont worry boss said karl flashing him a grin thats okay he took the lift down changed as usual at the third floor went down to the ground floor bought himself a newspaper and studied the lists of runners for the days races a middleaged man in a check suit and wearing a smart bowler with a white handlebar moustache smelling of tobacco asked what are you planning to do he was genuinely interested he had his own paper open at the racing page any tips im feeling lucky today karl ran his slender brown finger down the lists what about russian roulette twothirty epsom right and thank you very kindly its all right man the punter laughed heartily and slapped karl on the back ill say that for you fellows you know how to keep cheerful cheerio karl saluted and left the store crossing the high street and walking up church street enjoying the morning at notting hill he stopped and wondered if he should go straight back to ladbroke grove the suit he wanted had just taken shape in his mind
