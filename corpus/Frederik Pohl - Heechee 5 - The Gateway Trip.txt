 there was a time half a million years ago or so when some new neighbors came into the vicinity of the earths solar system they were eager to be friendlythat is that was what they wanted to be if they could find anyone around to be friends with so one day they dropped in on the third planet of the system the one we now know as earth itself to see who might be at home it wasnt a good time to pay a call oh there was plenty of life on earth no doubt of that the planet crawled with the stuff there were cave bears and sabertooth cats and things like elephants and things like deer there were snakes and fish and birds and crocodiles and there were disease germs and scavengers and there were forests and savannahs and vegetation of all kinds but one element was conspicuously missing in the catalogue of terrestrial living creatures that was a great pity because that was the one quality the visitors were most anxious to find what those visitors from space couldnt find anywhere on the planet was intelligence it just hadnt been invented yet the visitors sought it very diligently the closest they could find to a being with what they were after was a furry little creature without language fire or social institutionsbut which did at least have a few promising skills when modern humans came along and began tracing their evolutionary roots they would namd this particular brand of prehuman australopithecus the visitors didnt call it anything in particular except one more disappointment in their quest for civilized company in space the little animals werent very tallabout the size of a modern sixyearoldbut the visitors didnt hold that against them they had no modern humans to compare the little guys with and anyway they werent terribly tall themselves this was the chancy pleistocene the time when the ice was growing and retreating in europe and north america when african rainfall patterns swelled and diminished and adaptability was the key for any species that wanted to stay alive at the time the visitors arrived the countryside in which they found a tribe of their little pets was rolling arid savannah covered with grasses and occasional wildflowers where the australopithecines had camped was in a meadow by the banks of a slow trickly little stream that flowed into a huge salty lake a few kilometers away on the western horizon a line of mountains stretched away out of sight the nearest of them steamed gently the mountains were all volcanoes though of course the australopithecines did not have any idea what a volcano was they did have fire to be sure theyd gotten that far in technological sophistication at least most of the time they did when lightning started grass burning they didnt use fire for much they had not yet considered the possibility of cooking with it for instance what they found it good for was keeping large nocturnal predators away at which it sometimes succeeded by day they could take pretty good care of themselves they carried stone hand axesnot very elaborate just rocks chipped into more or less the shape of a fat sharpedged clamand clubs that were even less impressive looking just the unmodified long leg bones of the deerlike grazers they liked to eat that sort of weapon would never stop a sabertooth but enough of them wielded by enough of the screaming little apemen could usually deter the hyenas that were the savannahs fiercest predators especially if the little folk had first discouraged the hyena pack by pelting it with rocks from a distance they didnt usually succeed in killing the hyenas but most of the time they did convince the animals that their time would be better spent on more defenseless prey the little people did lose a baby to a carnivore now and then of course or an old person whose wornout teeth were making his or her life chancy anyway they could stand that they seldom lost anyone important to the wellbeing of the tribeexcept when hunting of course but they didnt have any choice about taking the risks of the hunt they had to hunt to eat although the australopithecines were tiny they were quite strong they tended to have pot bellies but the gluteus maximus was quite smalleven the females had no hips to speak of their faces were not very human no chin worth mentioning a broad nose tiny ears almost hidden in the head furyou wouldnt call it hair yet an average australopithecines skull did not have room for any large supply of brains if you poured the brains out of his sloped skull into a pint beer mug they would probably spill over the edge but not much of course no modern beer drinker would do that but one of the little furry people might havegladly in their diet brains were a delicacy even each others the visitors didnt think much of the furry peoples eating habits still the creatures had one anatomical characteristic that interested the visitors a lotin a sort of winkyjokey way with sexual overtones like the visitors the australopithecines were bipeds unlike the visitors their legs were positioned so close to each other that they actually rubbed together at the thighs when they walked and for the males at least that seemed to the visitors to present real problems since the male sexual organs hung between the thighs so the visitors from space looked the little furry creatures over for a while then chirruped their disappointment to each other got back in their spaceships and went glumly away their visit had not been a total loss any planet that bore life at all was a rare jewel in the galaxy still they had really been hoping for a more sophisticated kind of lifesomeone to meet and be friends and interchange views and have discussions with these little furry animals definitely werent up to any of that the visitors didnt leave them quite untouched though the visitors had learned from dismal experience that faintly promising species of creatures might easily die off or take a wrong turning somewhere along the evolutionary line and so never realize their promise so the visitors had a policy of establishing a sort of well call them game preserves accordingly they took a few of the australopithecines away with them in their spaceships when they left they put the little beasts in a safe place in the hope that they might amount to something after all then the visitors departed time passed a lot of time the australopithecines never did get very far on earth but then their close relativesthe genus homo better known as you and me and all our friendscame along the genus homo people worked out a lot better over some five hundred thousand years in fact they did just about all the things the visitors had hoped for from the australopithecines these humans as they called themselves were pretty clever at thinking things up as the ages passed they invented a lot of neat stuffthe wheel and agriculture and draft animals and cities and levers and sailing ships and the internal combustion engine and credit cards and radar and spacecraft they didnt invent them all at once of course and not everything they invented turned out to be an absolute boon because along the way they also invented clubs and swords and bows and catapults and cannon and nuclear missiles these humans had a real talent for messing things up for instance a lot of their inventions were the kind that looked as though they ought to do something but really did something very differentwhich was the case with all their peacekeeping gadgets none of which kept any peace medicine was another case in point they invented what they called medicine quite early that is they invented the practice of doing all sorts of bizarre things to people who were unfortunate enough to get sick ostensibly the things they did were intended to make the sick person better often enough they went the other way at best they generally didnt help the man who was dying of malaria may have been grateful to his local doctor for putting on the devil mask and dancing around the bed hut the patient died anyway by the time human medicine reached the point where a sick persons chances of recovery were better with a doctor than without onethat took about of those yearshumans had managed to find a more efficient way of screwing things up they had invented money human medicine became fairly good at curing many human ailments but more and more of the human race began to have trouble finding the money to pay for it and along about the same time the humans who lived on this little green planet called earth finally reached the point where they could get off it for the first time the age of human exploration of space had begun in a sense this was a happy coincidence by the time human beings reached the point of being able to launch a spaceship it may well have been true that it was also getting to be a good time to think seriously about leaving the earth for good the earth was a pretty good place to be rich in it was a very bad one to be poor by then of course the people who had dropped in on the australopithecines were long gone in their yearning quest for some other intelligent race to talk to they had surveyed more than half the galaxy actually there were some successes or almost successes they did find a few promising specieswell at least as promising as the poor dumb australopithecines probably the race that came closest to what they were looking for were the ones they called the slow swimmers these people lived in the dense liquidgas atmosphere of a heavy planet the slow swimmers had language at least in fact they sang beautiful endless songs in their language which the visitors finally managed to puzzle out enough to understand the slow swimmers even had citiessort of citieswell what they had was domiciles and public structures that floated around in the soupy mud they lived in the slow swimmers werent a lot of fun to talk to but the main reason for that was that they were youd better believe it really slow if you tried to talk to them you had to wait a week for them to get out a word a year to finish the first few bars of one of their songsand a couple of lifetimes anywa r to carry on a real conversation that wasnt the slow swimmers fault they lived at such a low temperature that everything they did was orders of magnitude slower than warmblooded oxygenbreathers like human beingsor like the visitors from space then the visitors found someone else and that was a whole other thing and a very scary one they stopped looking after that when human beings went into space they had their own agenda which wasnt quite the same as the purposes of their ancient visitors the humans werent really looking for other intelligences at least not in the same way the human telescopes and probe rockets had told them long ago that no intelligent aliens were going to be found at least in their own solar systemand they had little hope of going any farther than that the humans might well have looked for their longago visitors if they had had any idea they existed but of course they didnt maybe the best way to find another intelligent race is to be lucky rather than purposeful when human beings got to the planet venus it didnt look very promising the first humans to look at it didnt lookno one could see very far through its miserably dense and murky airthey just circled around it in orbit feeling for surface features with radar what they found wasnt encouraging certainly when the first human rockets landed beside the rift valley of aphrodite terra and the first parties began to explore the inhospitable surface of venus they had no hope of finding life there and sure enough they didnt but then in a part of venus called aino planitia a geologist made a discovery there was a fissurecall it a tunnel though at first they thought it might be a lava tubeunder the surface of the planet it was long it was regular and it had no business being there the venusian explorers without warning had found the first signs of that halfmillionyearago visit i my name is audee waithers my job airbody driver my home on venusin the spindle or in a heechee hut most of the time wherever i happen to be when i feel sleepy otherwise until i was twentyfive i lived on earth mostly in amarillo central my father was deputy governor of texas he died when i was still in college but he left me enough in civilservice dependency benefits for me to finish school get a masters in business administration and pass the journeymans examination as clerktypist in the service so i was set up for life or so most people would have thought after i had tried it for a few years i made a discovery i didnt like the life i was set up for it wasnt so much for the reasons anyone might expect amarillo central wasnt all that bad i dont mind having to wear a smog suit can get along with neighbors even when there are eight thousand of them to the square mile tolerate noise can defend myself against the hoodlum kid gangsno it wasnt texas itself that bothered me it was what i was doing with my life in texas and for that matter what i would have to be doing with it anywhere else on earth so i got out i sold my uopwa journeymans card to a woman who had to mortgage her parents room to pay for it i mortgaged my own pension accrual i took the little bit of money i had saved in the bank and i bought a oneway ticket to venus there wasnt anything strange about that it was what every kid tells himself hes going to do when he grows up the difference is that i did it i suppose it would all have been different if id had any chance at real money if my father had been full governor with all those chances for payoffs and handouts instead of being just a civilservice flunky if the dependency benefits hed left me had included unlimited full medical if id been at the top of the heap instead of stuck in the oppressed middle squeezed from both directions it didnt happen that way so i took the pioneer route and wound up trying to make a living out of terrestrial tourists in venuss main place the spindle everybody has seen pictures of the spindle just as with the colosseum and niagara falls the difference of course is that the only view you ever get of the spindle is from inside it its under the surface of venus in a place called alpha regio like everything worth looking at on venus the spindle was something left over by the heechee nobody had ever figured out exactly what it was the heechee wanted with an underground chamber three hundred meters long and spindleshaped but there it was so we used it it was the closest thing venus had to a times square or a champs elysйes all terry tourists head first for the spindle so thats where we start fleecing them my own airbodyrental business is reasonably legitimate as tourist ventures go on venusi mean at least it is if you dont count the fact that there isnt really much worth seeing on venus that wasnt left there under the surface by the heechee all the other tourist traps in the spindle are reasonably crooked terries dont seem to mind that they must know theyre being taken though they all load up on heechee prayer fans and dollheads and those paperweights of transparent plastic in which a contoured globe of venus swims in a kind of orangybrowny snowstorm of makebelieve blooddiamonds firepearls and fly ash none of the souvenirs are worth the price of their mass charge back to earth but to a tourist who can get up the price of the interplanetary passage in the first place i dont suppose that matters to people like me who cant get up the price of anything the tourist traps matter a lot we live on them i dont mean that we draw our excess disposable income from them i mean that they are how we get the price of what to eat and where to sleep if we dont have the price we die there arent many legitimate ways of earning money on venus theres the army if you call that legitimate the rest is tourism and dumb luck the dumblucky chancesoh like winning a lottery or striking it rich in the heechee diggings or blundering into a wellpaying job with one of the scientific expeditionsare all real long shots for our bread and butter almost everybody on venus depends on terry tourists and if we dont milk them dry when we get the chance weve had it of course there are tourists and then there are tourists they come in three varieties the difference between them is celestial mechanics class iii is the quick and dirty kind back on earth they are merely welltodo the class ills come to venus every twentysix months at hohmannorbit time riding the minimumenergy circuit from earth because of the critical time windows of the hohmann orbits they never can stay on venus for more than three weeks so they come out on their guided tours determined to get the most out of the quartermilliondollar minimum cabin fare their rich grandparents have given them for a graduation present or that theyve saved up for a second honeymoon or whatever the bad thing about them is that they dont usually have much extra money to spend since theyve spent it all on fares the nice thing is that there are a lot of them when the tour ships are in all the rental rooms on venus are filled sometimes theyll have six couples sharing a single partitioned cubicle two pairs at a time hotbedding eighthour shifts around the clock then people like me hole up in heechee huts on the surface and rent out our own belowground rooms and that way maybe make enough money to live a few months but you couldnt make enough out of class ills to live until the next hohmannorbit time so when the class ii tourists come in we cut each others throats over them the class ils are the mediumrich what you might call the poor millionaires the ones whose annual income is in the low seven figures they can afford to come in powered orbits taking a hundred days or so for the run instead of the long slow hohmann drift the price for that runs a million dollars and up so there arent nearly as many of the class ii tourists but there are a few trickling in every month or so at the time of reasonably favorable orbital conjunctions they also have more money to spend when they get to venus so do those other class ii mediumrich ones who wait for the four or five times in a decade when the ballistics of the planets sort themselves into the lowenergy configuration that al lows them to hit three planets in an orbit that doesnt have much higher energy costs than the straight earthvenus run they hit us first if were lucky and then go on to mars if theyve gone the other way around we get the leavings from the martian colonists thats bad because the leavings are never very much but the very richah the very rich the class i marvels they come as they like in orbital season or not and they can spend when my informant on the landing pad reported the yuri gagarin incoming under private charter my money nose began to quiver whoever was on it had to be a good prospect it was out of season for anybody except the really rich the only question on my mind was how many of my competitors would be trying to cut my throat to get to the gagarins passengers first while i was doing my best to cut theirs it was important to me i happened to have a pretty nasty cashflow problem just then airbody rental takes a lot more capital than say opening a prayerfan booth id been lucky in buying my airbody cheap when the fellow i worked for died i didnt have too many competitors a couple of the ones who mightve competed were out of service for repairs and a couple more had kited off on heechee diggings of their own so actually i considered that i might have the gagarins passengers whoever they were pretty much to myself assuming they could be interested in taking a trip outside the maze of heechee tunnels right around the spindle i had to assume that they would be interested because i needed the money very much you see i had this little liver condition it was getting close to total failure the way the doctors explained it to me i had three choices i could go back to earth and live for a while on external dialysis or i could somehow find the money for a transplant or i could die ii the name of the fellow who had chartered the gagarin turned out to be boyce cochenour age apparently around forty height easily two meters ancestry irishamericanfrench i recognized his type at once he was the kind thats used to being the boss wherever he is i watched him come into the spindle looking as though he owned it and everything it held and was thinking about liquidating his holdings he sat down in sub vastras imitation of a combination paris boulevardheechee sidewalk cafй scotch he said without even looking to see if he was being waited on he was vastra hurried to pour john begg over supercooled ice and hand it to him all crackling with cold and numbing to the lips smoke he said and the girl with him instantly lit a cigarette and passed it to him crummylooking dump he observed glancing around and vastra fell all over himself to agree i sat down next to themwell i mean not at the same table i didnt even look their way but from the next table i could hear everything they said vastra didnt look at me either but of course he had seen me come in and knew i had my eye on these promising new marks i had to let his numberthree wife take my order instead of vastra himself because vastra certainly wasnt going to waste his time on a tunnelrat when he had a chartership terry at his table the usual i said to her meaning straight alk in a tumble of soft drink and a copy of your briefing i added more softly her eyes twinkled understandingly at me over her flirtation veil cute little vixen i patted her hand in a friendly way and left a rolledup bill in it then she left the terry was inspecting his surroundings which included me i looked back at him polite but distant and he gave me a sort of quarternod and turned back to subhash vastra since im here he said in all the right tones for a bored tourist i might as well sample whatever action youve got whats to do here sub vastra grinned widely like a tall skinny frog ah whatever you wish sah entertainment in our private rooms we have the finest artists of three planets nautch dancers music fine comedians weve got enough of that stuff in cincinnati i didnt come to venus for a nightclub act cochenour couldnt have known it of course but that was the right decision to make subs private rooms were way down the list of night spots on venus and even the top of the list wasnt much of course sah then perhaps you would like to consider a tour aw cochenour shook his head whats the point of running around does any of the planet look any different than the space pad we came in on right over our heads vastra hesitated i could see him doing swift arithmetic in his head measuring the chance of persuading the terry to go for a surface tour against what he might get from me as his commission on something bigger he didnt look my way honesty won out that is honesty reinforced by a quick appraisal of cochenours gullibility not much different no sah he admitted all pretty hot and dry on the surface all the same pretty much but i did not think of the surface what then ah the heechee warrens sah there are many miles of same just below this settlement a reliable guide could be found not interested cochenour growled not in anything that close sah if a guide can lead us through them cochenour explained that means theyve all been explored which means if there was anything good in them its been looted already whats the fun of that of course vastra cried immediately i understand your meaning sah he looked noticeably happier and i could feel his radar reaching out to make sure i was listening though he still didnt look in my direction at all to be sure he went on weightily an expert explaining complexities to a valued client there is always the chance that one may find new digs sah provided one knows where to look am i correct in assuming that this would interest you the third of vastras house had brought me my drink and a thin powderfaxed slip of paper thirty percent i whispered to her tell sub only no bargaining and no getting anybody else to bid she nodded and winked shed been listening too of course and she was as sure as i was that this terry was firmly on the hook it had been my intention to nurse my drink as long as i could while the mark ripened under vastras skillful ministrations but it looked like prosperity was looming ahead i was ready to celebrate i took a long happy swallow unfortunately the hook didnt seem to have a barb unaccountably the terry shrugged waste of time i bet he grumbled i mean really if anybody knew where to look why wouldnt he have looked there on his own already right ah mister vastra cried beginning to panic but i assure you there are hundreds of tunnels not yet explored thousands sah and in them who knows treasures beyond price very likely cochenour shook his head lets skip it he said just bring us another drink and see if you cant get the ice really cold this time that shook me my nose for money was rarely wrong i put down my drink and half turned away to hide what i was doing from the terries as i looked at the fax of subs briefing report on them to see if it might explain to me why cochenour had lost interest so fast the report couldnt answer that question it did tell me a lot though the woman with cochenour was named dorotha keefer she had been traveling with him for a couple of years now according to their passports though this was their first time off earth there was no indication of a marriage between themor of any intention of it at least on cochenours part keefer was in her early twentiesreal age not simulated by drugs and transplants while cochenour himself was well over ninety he did not of course look anywhere near that id watched him walk over to their table and he moved lightly and easily for a big man his money came from land and petrofoods according to the synoptic on him he had been one of the first oil millionaires to switch over from selling oil as fuel for cars to oil as a raw material for food production growing algae in the crude oil that came out of his well and selling the algae in processed form for human consumption so then he had stopped being a mere millionaire and turned into something much bigger that accounted for the way he looked he had been living on full medical with extras the report said that his heart was titanium and plastic his lungs had been transplanted from a twentyyearold killed in a copter crash his skin muscles and fatsnot to mention his various glandular systemswere sustained by hormones and cellbuilders at what had to be a cost of several thousand dollars a day to judge by the way he stroked the thigh of the girl next to him he was getting his moneys worth he looked and acted no more than forty at mostexcept perhaps for the look of his paleblue diamondbright weary and disillusioned eyes he was in short a lovely mark i couldnt afford to let him get away i swallowed the rest of the drink and nodded to the third of vastra for another there had to be some way somehow to land him for a charter of my airbody all i had to do was find it of course on the other side of the little railing that set vastras cafй off from the rest of the spindle half the tunnelrats on venus were thinking the same thoughts this was the worst of the low season the hohmann crowd was still three months in the future and all of us were beginning to run low on money my need for a liver transplant was just a little extra incentive of the hundred mazerunners i could see out of the corner of my eye ninetynine needed to cut a helping out of this tourists bankroll as much as i did just for the sake of staying alive we couldnt all do it he looked pretty fat but nobody could have been fat enough to feed us all two of us maybe three maybe even half a dozen might score enough to make a real difference no more than that i had to be one of those few i took a deep swallow of my second drink tipped the third of vastras house lavishlyand conspicuouslyand turned idly around until i was facing the terries the girl was bargaining with the knot of souvenir vendors leaning over the rail boyce she called over her shoulder whats this thing for he bent over the rail and peered looks like a fan he told her heechee prayer fan right the dealer cried i knew him booker allemang an oldtimer in the spindle found it myself miss itll grant your every wish letters every day from people reporting miraculous results its sucker bait cochenour grumbled buy it if you want to but what does it do she asked cochenour had an unpleasant laugh he demonstrated it it does what any fan does it cools you down not that you need that he added meanly and looked over to me with a grin my cue i finished my drink nodded to him stood up and walked over to their table welcome to venus i said may i help you the girl looked at cochenour for permission before she said i thought this fan thing was pretty very pretty i agreed are you familiar with the story of the heechee i looked inquiringly toward the empty chair and as cochenour didnt tell me to get lost i sat down in it and went on the heechee built these tunnels a long time agomaybe a quarter of a million years maybe more they seem to have occupied them for some time anything up to a century or two give or take a lot then they went away again they left a lot of junk behind and some things that werent junk among other things they left thousands of these fans some local conmanit wasnt beegee here i think but somebody like himgot the idea of calling the things prayer fans and selling them to tourists to make wishes on allemang had been hanging on my every word trying to guess where i was going partly thats right he admitted all of it is right but you two are too smart for that kind of thing still i added look at the fans theyre pretty enough to be worth having even without the story they are absolutely allemang cried see how this one sparkles miss and this black and gray crystal how nice it looks with your fair hair the girl unfurled the black and gray one it came rolled like a diploma only coneshaped it took just the slightest pressure of the thumb to keep it open and it really sparkled very prettily as she gently waved it about like all the heechee fans it weighed only about ten grams not counting the simulatedwood handles that people like beegee allemang put on them its crystalline lattice caught the lights from the luminous heecheemetal walls as well as from the fluorescents and gas tubes we mazerunners had installed and tossed all the lights back as shimmering iridescent sparks this fellows name is booker garey allemang i told the terries hell sell you the same goods as any of the others but he wont cheat you as much as most of themespecially with me watching cochenour looked at me dourly then beckoned sub vastra for another round of drinks all right he said if we buy any of this well buy from you booker garey allemang but not now he turned to me and now what is it that you hope ill buy from you i spoke right up my airbody and me if you want to go l oking for new tunnels were both as good as you can get he didnt hesitate how much one million dollars i said immediately threeweek charter all found this time he didnt answer at once although i was pleased to see that the price didnt seem to scare him away he looked as receptive or at least as merely bored as ever drink up he said as vastra and his third served us and then he gestured with his glass to the spindle around us do you know what this is for he asked do you mean why the heechee built it no the heechee werent any taller than we are so it wasnt this big because they needed headroom and it was entirely empty when it was found he looked around without excitement at the busy scene the spindle is always busy it had balconies cut into the sloping sides of the cavern with eating and drinking places like vastras along there and rows of souvenir booths most of them were of course empty in this slow season but there were still a couple hundred mazerats living in and near the spindle and the number of them hovering around us had been quietly growing all the time cochenour and the girl had been sitting there he said theres nothing much to see here is there i didnt argue theres nothing but a hole in the ground full of people trying to take my spare change away from me i shrugged he grinned at meless meanly than before i thought so why did i come to venus if thats how i feel well thats a good question but since you didnt ask it i dont have to answer he looked at me to see if i might be going to press the matter i didnt so lets just talk business he went on you want a million dollars lets see what that pays for itd be around a hundred k to charter an airbody a hundred and eighty k or so to rent equipment for a week times three weeks food supplies permits another fifty k so were up close to seven hundred thousand not counting your own salary or what you have to give our host here as his cut for not throwing you off the premises is that about the way it adds up walthers i had not expected him to be a costaccountant i had a little difficulty swallowing the drink i had been holding in my mouth but i managed to say close enough mr cochenour i didnt see any point in telling him that i already owned the airbody as well as most of the other needed equipmentthat was the only way there was going to be anything left for me after paying off all the other charges but i wouldnt have been surprised to find out that he knew that too then he surprised me sounds like the right price he said casually youve got a deal i want to leave as soon as possible which i want to be urn just about this time tomorrow fair enough i said getting up ill see you then i avoided sub vastras thunderstricken expression as i left i had some work to do and a little thinking cochenour had caught me off base and thats a bad place to be when you cant afford to make a mistake i knew he hadnt missed the fact that id called him by name that was all right he would easily guess that i had checked him out immediately and his name was the least of the things he would assume i had found out about him but it was a little surprising that he had known mine hi i had three major errands the first thing i had to do was doublecheck my equipment to make sure it would still stand up against all the nastiness venus can visit on a machineor a person the second was to go to the local union office and register a contract with boyce cochenour for validation with a commission clause for vastra the third was to see my doctor the liver hadnt been giving me much trouble for a while but then i hadnt been drinking much grain alcohol for a while the equipment turned out to be all right it took me about an hour to complete the checks but by the end of the time i was reasonably sure that i had all the gear and enough spare parts to keep us going the quackery was on the way to the union office so i stopped in to see dr morius first it didnt take long the news was no worse than i had been ready for the doctor put all his instruments on me and studied the results carefullyabout a hundred and fifty dollars worth of carefullyand then expressed the guarded hope that i would survive three weeks away from his office provided i took all the stuff he gave me and wandered no more than usual from the diet he insisted on and when i get back i asked same as ive been telling you audee he said cheerily you can expect total hepatic collapse in oh maybe ninety days he patted his fingertips looking at me optimistically i hear youve got a live one though want me to make a reservation for your transplant how live did you hear my prospect was i asked he shrugged the price is the same in any case he told me goodnaturedly two hundred k for the new liver plus the hospital anesthesiologist preop psychiatrist pharmaceuticals my own feeyouve already got the figures i did and i had already calculated that with what i might make from cochenour plus what i had put away plus a loan on the airbody i could just about meet it leaving me broke when it was over of course but alive happens ive got one in stock now thats just your size dr morius said halfkidding i didnt doubt him there are always plenty of spare parts in the quackery thats because people are always getting themselves killed one way and another and their heirs do their best to fatten up the estate by selling off the innards i dated one of the quacks once or twice when wed been drinking she took me down to the cold cuts department and showed me all the frozen hearts and lungs and bowels and bladders each one already dosed with antiallergens so it wouldnt be rejected all tagged and packed away ready for a paying customer it was a pity i wasnt in that class because then dr morius could have pulled one out warmed it up in the microwave and slapped it in when i jokedi told her i was jokingabout swiping just one little liver for me the date went sour and not long after that she packed it in and went back to earth i made up my mind make the reservation i said three weeks from today and i left him looking mildly pleased like a burmese hydrorice planter watching the machines warm up to bring in another crop dear daddy why hadnt he sent me through medical school instead of giving me an education it would have been nice if the heechee had been the same size as human beings instead of being just that little bit shorter it was reflected in their tunnels in the smaller ones like the one that led to the local union office i had to half crouch all the way the deputy organizer was waiting for me he had one of the very few good jobs on venus that didnt depend on tourismor at least not directly he said subhash vastras been on the line he says you agreed to thirty percent and besides you took off without paying your bar bill to the third of his house admitted both ways he made a note and you owe me a little too audee three hundred for the powderfax copy of my report on your pigeon a hundred for validating your contract with vastra and youre going to need a new guides license sixteen hundred for that i gave him my currency card and he checked the total out of my account into the locals then i signed and cardstamped the contract hed drawn up vastras thirty percent would not be on the whole million dollars but on my net even so he was likely to make as much out of it as i would at least in liquid cash because i was going to have to pay off the outstanding balances on equipment the banks would carry a man until he scored but then they wanted to get paid in full because they knew how long it might be until he scored again the deputy verified the signed contract thats that then anything else i can do for you not at your prices i told him he gave me a sharp look with a touch of envy in it ah youre putting me on audee boyce cochenour and dorotha keefer traveling ss yuri gagarin odessa registry carrying no other passengers he quoted from the report hed intercepted for us no other passengers why you can be a rich man audee if you work this customer right rich man is more than i ask i told him all i want is to be a living one it wasnt entirely true i did have some little hopenot much not enough to talk about and in fact id never said a word about it to anyonethat i might be coming out of this rather better than just alive there was however a problem the problem was that if we did find anything boyce cochenour would get most of it if a tourist like cochenour goes on a guided hunt for new heechee tunnels and he happens to find something valuabletourists have you know not often but enough to keep them hopefulthen its the charterer who gets the lions share guides get a taste but thats all we just work for the man who pays the bills of course i could have gone out by myself at any time and prospected on my own then anything i found would be all mine but in my case that was a really bad idea if i staked myself to a trip and lost i wouldnt just be wasting my time and fifty or a hundred k on usedup supplies and wear and tear on the airbody if i lost i would be dead shortly thereafter when that beatup old liver finally gave out i needed every penny cochenour would pay me just to stay alive whether we struck it rich or not my fee from him would take care of that unfortunately for my peace of mind i had a notion that i knew where something very interesting might be found and my problem was that as long as i had the standard charterersrights contract with cochenour i really couldnt afford to find it the last stop i made was in my sleeping room under my bed keystoned into the rock was a guaranteed breakproof safe that held some papers i wanted to have in my pocket from then on see when i first came to venus it wasnt scenery that interested me i wanted to make my fortune i didnt see much of the surface of venus then or for nearly two years after that you dont see much in the kind of spacecraft that can land you on venus to survive the squeeze of a ninetythousandmillibar surface pressure means you need a hull thats a little more rugged than the bubbleships that go to the moon or mars or farther out they dont put unnecessary windows into the skin of venuslanders that didnt matter much because there isnt much on the surface of venus that you can see everything the tourists can snap pictures of is inside venus and every bit of it or ce belonged to the heechee we dont know much about the heechee we dont even rightly know their name heechee isnt a name its how somebody once wrote down the sound that a firepearl makes when you stroke it as that was the only sound anybody had ever heard that was connected with the heechee it got to be their name the hesperologists dont have any idea where these heechee folks came from although there are some markings that seem to be a star chartpretty much unrecognizable if we knew the exact position of every star in the galaxy a few hundred thousand years ago we might be able to locate them from that maybe assuming they came from this galaxy i wonder sometimes what they wanted escaping a dying planet political refugees tourists whose cruise ship had a breakdown between somewhere and somewhere so that they had to hang around long enough to repair whatever they had to repair to get themselves going again i dont know nobody else does either but though the heechee packed up nearly everything when they left leaving behind only empty tunnels and chambers there were a few scraps here and there that either werent worth taking or were overlooked all those prayer fans enough empty containers of one kind or another to look like a picnic ground at the end of a hard summer some trinkets and trifles i guess the best known of the trifles is the anisokinetic punch the carbon crystal that transmits a blow at a ninetydegree angle that made somebody a few billion just by being lucky enough to find one though not until somebody else had made his own billions by being smart enough to analyze and duplicate it but thats the best of the lot what we usually find is face it just junk there must once have been good stuff worth a million times as much as those sweepings did they take all the good stuff with them when they left that was another thing that nobody knew i didnt know either but i did think i knew something that had a bearing on it i thought i knew a place where a heechee tunnel had had something pretty neat in it long ago and that particular tunnel wasnt near any of the explored diggings i didnt kid myself i knew that that wasnt a guarantee of anything but it was something to go on maybe when those last ships left the heechee were getting impatient and maybe not as thorough at cleaning up behind themselves and that was what being on venus was all about what other possible reason was there for being there the life of a mazerat was marginal at best it took fifty thousand a year to stay aliveair tax capitation tax water assessment subsistencelevel bill for food if you wanted to eat meat more than once a month or demanded a private cubicle of your own to sleep in it cost a lot more than that guides papers cost a weeks living costs when any of us bought a set of them we were gambling that weeks cost of living against the chance of a big enough strike either from the terry tourists or from what we might find to make it possible to go home to earth where no one died for lack of air and no one was thrust out into the highpressure incinerator that was venuss atmosphere not just to get back to earth but to get back there in the style every mazerat had set himself as a goal when he headed sunward in the first place with money enough to live the full life of a human being on full medical that was what i wanted the big score iv the last thing i did that night was to visit the hall of discoveries that wasnt just the whim of the moment id made an arrangement with the third of vastras house the third winked at me over her flirtation veil and turned to her companion who looked around and recognized me hello mr walthers she said i thought i might find you here i said which was no more than the truth i didnt know what to call the woman my own mother had been oldfashioned enough to take my fathers name when they married but that didnt apply here of course miss keefer was accurate mrs cochenour might have been diplomatic i got around the problem by saying since well be seeing a lot of each other how about getting right on to first names audee is it i gave her a twelvetooth smile swede on my mothers side old texan on my fathers names been in his family a long time i guessdorotha vastras third had melted into the background i took over to show this dorotha keefer what the hall of discoveries was all about the hall is there for the purposes of getting terry tourists and prospectors hotted up so theyll spend their money poking around heechee digs theres a little of everything in it from charts of the worked diggings and a largescale mercator map of venus to samples of all the principal finds i showed her the copy of the anisokinetic punch and the original solidstate piezophone that had made its discoverer almost as permanently rich as the guys who marketed the punch there were about a dozen firepearls quarterinch jobbies they sat behind armor glass on cushions blazing away with their cold milky light they were what made the piezophone possible i told her the machine itself thats a human invention but the firepearls are what makes it workthey convert pressure into electricity and vice versa theyre pretty she said but why do they have to be protected like that i saw bigger ones lying on a counter in the spindle without anybody even watching them thats a little different dorotha i told her these are real she laughed out loud i liked her laugh no woman looks beautiful when shes laughing hard and girls who worry about looking beautiful dont do it dorotha keefer looked like a healthy pretty woman having a good time which when you come down to it is about the best way for a woman to look she did not however look quite good enough to take my mind off my need for the money to buy a new liver so i got down to business the little red marbles over there are blooddiamonds i told her theyre radioactive not so much that theyll hurt you but they stay warm which is one way you can tell the real one from a fake anything over about three centimeters is a fake a real one that big generates too much heatthe squarecube law you know so it melts so the ones your friend was trying to sell me were fakes right she nodded still smiling what about what you were trying to sell us audee real or fake the third of vastras house had discreetly vanished by then so i took a deep breath and told dorotha the truth not the whole truth maybe but nothing but the truth all this stuff here i said is what thousands of people have found after a hell of a lot of digging its not much the punch the piezophone and two or three other gadgets that we can make work a few busted pieces of things that theyre still studying and some trinkets thats it thats the way i heard it she said and one more thing none of the discovery dates on these things is less than twenty years old she was smarter and better informed than i had expected and the conclusion you can draw from that i agreed is that as nothing new has been found lately the planet has probably been mined dry youre right thats what the evidence seems to show the first diggers found everything useful that there was to be found so far but you think theres more i hope theres more look item the tunnel walls you see theyre all alikethe blue walls perfectly smooth the light coming from them that never varies the hardness how do you suppose the heechee made them why i dont know neither do i or anybody else but every heechee tunnel is the same and if you dig into them from the outside you find the same basic substrate rock then a boundary layer thats sort of half wallmetal and half substrate then the wall itself conclusion the heechee didnt dig the tunnels and then line them they had something that crawled around underground like an earthworm leaving these tunnels behind and one other thing they overdug thats to say they dug lots of tunnels they didnt need going nowhere never used for anything does that suggest anything to you it must have been cheap and easy she guessed i nodded so it was probably an automatic machine and there really ought to be at least one of them somewhere on this planet to find next item the air they breathed oxygen like we do and they must have got it from somewhere where why theres oxygen in the atmosphere isnt there hardly any less than a half of a percent and most of what there is isnt free oxygen its compounded into carbon dioxide and other garbage theres no water vapor to speak of either oh a littlenot as much as for instance sulfur dioxide when water seeps out of the rock it doesnt come out as a fresh clear spring it goes into the air as vapor pretty fast it risesthe water molecule being lighter than the carbon dioxide molecule when it reaches a point where the sun can get at it it splits into hydrogen and oxygen the oxygen and half the hydrogen mostly go into turning the sulfur dioxide into sulfuric acid the rest of the hydrogen just escapes into space she was looking at me quizzically audee she said gently i already believe youre an expert on venus i grinned but do you get the picture i think so it looks pretty bad it is pretty bad but all the same the heechee managed to get that little bit of oxygen out of the mixture cheaply and easily remember those extra tunnels they filledalong with inert gases like nitrogenand theyre present only in trace amountsenough to make a breathing mixture how i dont know but if theres a machine that did it id like to find that machine next item aircraft the heechee flew around the surface of venus a lot so do you audee arent you a pilot airbody pilot yes but look what it takes to make an airbody go theres a surface temperature of seventhirtyfive k and not enough oxygen to keep a cigarette lit so my airbody has to have two fuel tanks one for the fuel one for the thing to burn it with thats not just oil and air you know it fl t not here dorotha not at the kind of ambient temperatures weve got it takes exotic fuels to get that hot did you ever hear of a fellow named carnot oldtime scientist was he the carnot cycle fellow right again that was the third time shed surprised me i noted cautiously the carnot efficiency of an engine is expressed by its maximum temperaturethe heat of combustion lets say divided by the temperature of its exhaust well but the temperature of the exhaust cant be lower than the temperature of whatever its exhausted intootherwise youre not running an engine youre running a refrigerator and youve got that seventhirtyfive air temperature to fight so even with special fuels you have basically a lousy engine any heat engine on venus is lousy did you ever wonder why there are so few airbodies around i dont mind it helps to have something close to a monopoly but the reason is that theyre so damn expensive to run and the heechee did it better i think they did she laughed again unexpectedly and once more very attractively why you poor fellow she said in good humor youre hooked on the stuff you sell arent you you think that one of these days youre going to find the mother tunnel and pick up a few billion dollars worth of heechee stuff i wasnt pleased with the way she put that i wasnt all that happy with the meeting i had set up with vastras third for that matter id figured that away from her boyfriend i could pick this dorotha keefers brains about him pretty easily it wasnt working out that way she was making me aware of her as a person which was an undesirable development in itselfyou cant treat a mark as a mark if you think of him or her as a fellow human being worse than that she was making me take a good look at myself so i just said you may be right but im sure going to give it a good try youre angry arent you no i lied but maybe a little tired and weve got a long trip tomorrow so id better take you back to the spindle miss keefer v my airbody was roped down at the edge of the spacepad and was reached the same way the spacepad was reached elevator to the surface lock then a sealed tractor cab to carry us across the dry rocky tortured surface of venus peeling away under the highdensity wind normally i kept the airbody under a lasheddown foam housing of course you dont leave anything free and exposed on the surface of venus if you want to find it intact when you get back to it not even if its made of chrome steel id had the foam stripped off first thing that morning when i checked it out and loaded supplies now it was ready i could see it from the bullsйye ports of the crawler through the howling greenyellow murk outside cochenour and the girl could have seen it too if theyd known where to look but they might not have recognized it as something that would fly did you and dorrie have a fight cochenour screamed in my ear no fight i screamed back dont care if you did just wanted to know you dont have to like each other just so you do what i want you to do he was silent for a moment resting his vocal cords jesus what a wind zephyr i told him i didnt say any more he would find out for himself the area around the spacepad is a sort of natural calm area by venusian standards orographic lift throws the meanest of the winds up over the pad and all we get is a sort of confused back eddy that makes taking off and landing relatively easy the bad part of that is that some of the heavy metal compounds in the air settle out on the pad what passes for air on venus has layers of red mercuric sulfide and mercurous chloride in the lower reaches and when you get above them to those pretty fluffy clouds tourists see on the way down you find that some of them are droplets of sulfuric and hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid but there are tricks to that too navigation over venus takes d skills its easy enough to proceed from point a to point b on the surface your transponders will link you to the radio range and map your position continuously on the charts whats hard is to find the right altitude that takes experience and maybe intuition and thats why my airbody and i were worth a million dollars to people like boyce cochenour by then we were at the airbody and the telescoping snout from the crawler was poking out to its lock cochenour was staring out the bullseye it doesnt have any wings he shouted as though i was cheating him it doesnt have sails or snow chains either i shouted back get aboard if you want to talk itll be easier in the airbody we climbed through the little snout i unlocked the entrance and we got aboard without much trouble we didnt even have the kind of trouble that i might have made for myself you see an airbody is a big thing on venus i was damn lucky to have been able to acquire it and well i wont beat around the bush you could say i loved it mine could have held ten people without equipment with what sub vastras outfitting shop had sold us and local had certified as essential to have on board it was crowded with just the three of us i was prepared for at least sarcasm but cochenour merely looked around long enough to find the best bunk strode over to it and claimed it as his the girl was acting like a good sport about all the inconveniences and there i was left with my glands charged up for hostile criticism and nobody criticizing it was a lot quieter inside the airbody you could hear the noise of the winds right enough but it was only annoying i passed out highfilter earplugs and with them in place the noise was hardly even annoying sit down and strap in i ordered and when they were stowed away i took off at ninety thousand millibars wings arent just useless theyre poison my airbody had all the lift it needed built right into its seashellshaped hull i fed the double fuel mixture into the thermojets we bounced across the reasonably flat ground at the edge of the spacepad and we were zooming off into the wild yellowgreen yondera moment later into the wild browngray yonder after a run of no more than fifty meters cochenour had fastened his harness loosely to be comfortable i enjoyed hearing him yell as he was thrown about in the savage shortperiod turbulence it wouldnt kill him and it only lasted for a few moments at a thousand meters i found our part of venuss semipermanent atmospheric inversion and the turbulence dropped to where i could take off my belt and stand i took the plugs out of my ears and motioned to cochenour and the girl to do the same he was rubbing his head where hed bounced into an overhead chart rack but he was grinning a little pretty exciting he admitted fumbling in his pocket all right if i smoke theyre your lungs he grinned more widely they are now he agreed say why didnt you give us those earplugs while we were in the tractor there is as you might say a tide in the affairs of guides where you either let them flood you with questions and then spend the whole time explaining what that funny little dial means when it turns red or you keep your mouth shut and go on to do your work and make your fortune what it came down to was a choice was i going to come out of this liking cochenour and his girlfriend or not if i was i should try to be civil to them more than civil living the three of us for three weeks in a space about as big as an apartment kitchenette meant that everybody would have to work real hard at being nice to everybody else if we were going to come back without total hatred and as i was the one who was being paid to be nice i should be the one to set an example on the other hand the cochenours of the world are sometimes just not likable if that was going to be the case the less talk the better and i should slide questions like that off with something like i forgot but he hadnt actually gone out of his way to be unpleasant the girl had even actually attempted friendliness so i opted for courtesy well thats an interesting thing you see you hear by differences in pressure while the airbody was taking off the plugs filtered out part of the soundthe pressure wavesbut when i yelled at you to belt up the plugs passed the overpressure of my voice and you could hear easily enough however theres a limit past about a hundred and twenty decibelsthats a unit of sound i know what a decibel is cochenour growled right past a hundred and twenty or so the eardrum just doesnt respond anymore so in the crawler it was just too loud you not only got sound in through the hull it came up from the ground conducted by the treads if youd had the plugs in you wouldnt even have been able to hearwell anything at all i finished lamely dorotha had been listening while she repaired her eye makeup anything like what she demanded i decided to think of them as friends at least for the time being like orders to get into your heatsuits in case of accident i mean a gust couldve tipped that crawler right over or sometimes solid objects come flying over the hills and hit you before you know it she was shaking her head but she was laughing lovely place you took us to boyce she commented he wasnt paying any attention he had something else on his mind why arent you flying this thing he demanded i got up and activated the virtual globe right i said its time we talked about that just now my airbodys on autopilot heading in the general direction of this quadrant down here we have to decide on a specific destination dorrie keefer was inspecting the globe it isnt real of course its just a threedimensional image that hangs in the air and you can poke your finger right through it venus doesnt really look like much she commented those lines you see i explained are just radiorange markers you wont see them looking out the window venus doesnt have any oceans and it isnt cut up into countries so making a map of it isnt quite what youd expect on earth see this bright spot here thats us now look i overlaid the radiorange grid and the contour colors with geological data those blobby circles are mascon markers you know what a mascon is a concentration of mass a lump of heavy stuff she offered fine now see what happens when i phase in the locations of known heechee digs when i hit the control the digs appeared as golden patterns like worms crawling across the planet dorotha said at once theyre all in the mascons cochenour gave her a look of approval and so did i not quite all i corrected but damn near why i dont know nobody knows the mascons are mostly older denser rockbasalt and so onand maybe the heechee felt safer with strong dense rock around them in my correspondence with professor hegramet back on earth in the days when i didnt have a dying liver in my gut and thus could afford to take an interest in abstract knowledge we had kicked around the possibility that the heechee digging machines would only work in dense rock or rock of a certain chemical composition but i wasnt prepared to discuss some of the ideas id gotten from professor hegramet with them i rotated the virtual globe slightly by turning a dial see over here where we are now this formations alpha regio theres the big digging which we just came out of you can see the shape of the spindle that particular mascon where the spindle is is called serendip it was discovered by a hesperological hesperological by a geological team studying venus which makes it a hesperological team they detected the mass concentration from orbit then after the landings they drilled out a core sample there and hit the first heechee dig now these other digs you see in the northern high latitudes are all in this one bunch of associated mascons there are interventions of less dense rock between them and they tunnel right through to connect but theyre almost all right in the mascons theyre all north cochenour said sharply were going south why it was interesting that he could read the virtual globe but i didnt say so i only said the ones that are marked are no good theyve been probed already some of them look even bigger than the spindle a hell of a lot bigger right but theres nothing much in them or anyway not much chance that anything in them is in good enough shape to bother with subsurface fluids filled them up a hundred thousand years ago maybe more a lot of good men have gone broke trying to pump one out and excavate without finding anything ask me i was one of them i didnt know venus had any liquid water cochenour objected i didnt say water did i but as a matter of fact some of it was or anyway a sort of oozy mud apparently water cooks out oc the rocks and has a transit time getting to the surface of some thousands of years before it seeps out boils off and cracks to hydrogen and oxygen and gets lost in case you didnt know it theres some under the spindle its what you were drinking and what you were breathing while you were there we werent breathing water he corrected no of course not we were breathing air that we made but sometimes the tunnels still have kept their airi mean the original stuff the air the heechee left behind them of course after a few hundred thousand years they generally turn into ovens then they tend to bake everything organic away maybe thats why weve found so little of lets say animal remainstheyve been cremated sosometimes you might find air in a dig but ive never heard of anybody finding drinkable water in one dorotha said boyce this is all very interesting but im hot and dirty and all this talk about waters getting to me can i change the subject for a minute cochenour barked it wasnt really a laugh subliminal prompting walthers dont you agree and a little oldfashioned prudery too i expect i think what dorrie really wants to do is go to the toilet given a little encouragement from the girl i would have been mildly embarrassed for her she was evidently used to cochenour she only said if were going to live in this thing for three weeks id like to know what it offers certainly miss keefer i said dorotha dorrie if you like it better sure dorrie well you see what youve got there are five bunks they partition to sleep ten if wanted but we dont want two shower stalls they dont look big enough to soap yourself in but theyll do the job if you work at it two chemical toilets in those cubbies kitchen over therestove and storage anyway pick the bunk you like dorrie theres a screen arrangement that comes down when you want it for changing clothes and so on or just if you dont want to look at the rest of us for a while cochenour said go on dorrie do what you want to do i want walthers to show me how to fly this thing anyway it wasnt a bad start to the trip ive had worse ive had some real traumatic times parties that came aboard drunk and steadily got drunker couples that fought each other every waking moment and only got together long enough so they could fight in a united front against me this trip didnt look bad at all even apart from the fact that i hoped it was going to save my life for me you dont need much skill to fly an airbodyat least just to make it move in the direction you want to go in venuss atmosphere there is lift to spare you dont worry about things like stalling out and anyway the automatic controls do most of your thinking for you cochenour learned fast it turned out he had flown everything that moved through the air on earth and operated oneman submersibles as well in the deepsea oil fields of his youth he ur derstood as soon as i mentioned it tа him that the hard part of pilotage on venus was selecting the right flying level and anticipating when youd have to change it but he also understood that he wasnt going to learn that in one day or even in three weeks what the hell waithers he said cheerfully enough at least i can make it go where i have toin case you get trapped in a tunnel or shot by a jealous husband i gave him the smile that little pleasantry was worth which wasnt much the other thing i can do he went on is cook unless youre really good at it no i thought not well i paid too much for this stomach to fill it with hash so ill make the meals thats a little skill dorrie never got around to learning it was the same with her grandmother the most beautiful woman in the world but she had the idea that was all she had to be to own it i put that aside to sort out later he was full of little unexpected things this ninetyyearold young athlete he said all right now while dorries using up all the water in the shower not to worry it recycles anyway while shes cleaning up finish your little lecture on where were going right i spun the globe a little the bright spot that was us had been heading steadily south while we were talking see that cluster where our track intersects those grid marks just short of lise meitner whos lise meitner he grunted somebody they named that formation after thats all i know do you see where im pointing yeah those five big mascons close together no diggings indicated is that where were going in a general way yes why in a general way well i said theres one little thing i didnt tell you im assuming you wont jump salty over it because then ill have to get salty too and tell you you should have taken the trouble to learn more about venus before you decided to explore it he studied me appraisingly for a moment dorrie came quietly out of the shower in a long robe her hair in a towel and stood near him watching me that depends a lot on what you didnt tell me friend he saidnot sounding friendly that part there is the south polar security area i said thats where the defense boys keep the missile range and the biggest part of their weapons development areas and civilians arent allowed to enter he was glowering at the map but theres only that one little piece of a mascon that isnt off limits and that little piece i said is where were going vi for a man more than ninety years old boyce cochenour was spry i dont mean just that he was healthy full medical will do that for you because you just replace whatever wears out or begins to look tacky you cant replace the brain though so what you usually see in the very rich old ones is a bronzed muscular body that shakes and hesitates and drops things about that cochenour had been very lucky he was going to be abrasive company for three weeks hed already insisted i show him how to pilot an airbody and he had learned fast when i decided to use a little flight time to give the cooling system a somewhat premature thousandhour check he helped me pull the covers check the refrigerant levels and clean the filters then he decided to cook us lunch dorrie keefer took over as my helper while i moved some of the supplies around getting the autosonic probes out at the steady noise level of the inside of an airbody our normal voices wouldnt carry to cochenour a couple of meters away at the stove i thought f pumping the girl about him while we checked the probes i decided against it i already knew the important thing about cochenour namely that with any luck he might be going to pay for my new liver i didnt need to know what he and dorrie thought about when they thought about each other so what we talked about was the probes about how they would fire percussive charges into the venusian rock and time the returning echoes and about what the chances were of finding something really good and about what had made me come to venus in the first place i mentioned my fathers name but shed never heard of the deputy governor of texas too young no doubt anyway she had been born and bred in southern ohio where cochenour had worked as a kid and to which hed returned as a billionaire she told me without my urging how hed been building a new processing center there and how many headaches that had beentrouble with the unions trouble with the banks bad trouble with the governmentand so hed decided to take a good long time off to loaf i looked over to where he was stirring up a sauce and said he loafs harder than anybody else i ever saw hes a work addict audee i imagine thats how he got rich in the first place the airbody lurched and i dropped everything to jump for the controls i heard cochenour howl behind me but i was busy locating a better transit level by the time i had climbed a thousand meters and reset the autopilot he was rubbing his wrist and swearing at me sorry i said he said dourly i dont mind your scalding the skin off my arm ican always buy more skin but you nearly made me spill the gravy i checked the virtual globe the bright ship marker was twothirds of the way to our destination is lunch about ready i asked well be there in an hour for the first time he looked startled so soon i thought you said this thing was subsonic i did youre on venus mr cochenour at this level the speed of sound is a lot faster than on earth he looked thoughtful but all he said was well we can eat any minute later he said while we were finishing up i think maybe i dont know as much about this planet as i might if you want to give us the guides lecture well listen you already know the outlines i told him say youre a great cook mr cochenour i know i packed all the provisions but i dont even know what this is im eating if you come to my office in cincinnati he said you can ask for mr cochenour but while were living in each others armpits you might as well call me boyce and if you like the fricassee why arent you eating it the answer was because it might kill me i didnt want to get into a discussion that might lead to why i needed his fee so badly doctors orders i said have to lay off the fats for a while i think he thinks im putting on too much weight cochenour looked at me appraisingly but all he said was the lecture well lets start with the most important part i said carefully pouring coffee while were inside this airbody you can do what you likewalk around eat drink smoke if you got em whatever the cooling system is built for more than three times this many people plus their cooking and appliance loads with a safety factor of two air and water more than wed need for two months fuel enough for three round trips plus maneuvering if anything went wrong wed yell for help and somebody would come and get us in a couple of hours at the most probably it would be the defense boys because theyre closest and they have really fast airbodies the worst thing would be if the hull breached and the whole venusian atmosphere tried to come in if that happened fast wed just be dead it never happens fast though wed have time to get into the suits and we can live in them for thirty hours long before that wed be picked up assuming of course that nothing went wrong with the radio at the same time right assuming that you know that you can get killed anywhere if enough accidents happen at once he poured himself another cup of coffee and tipped a little brandy into it go on well outside the airbody its a lot trickier youve only got the suit to keep you alive and its useful life as i say is only thirty hours its a question of refrigeration you can carry plenty of air and water and you dont have to worry about food on that time scale but it takes a lot of compact energy to get rid of the diffuse energy all around you that means fuel the cooling systems use up a lot of fuel and when thats gone youd better be back in the airbody heat isnt the worst way to die you pass out before you begin to hurt but in the end youre dead the other thing is you want to check your suit every time you put it on pressure it up and watch the gauge for leaks ill check too but dont rely on me its your life and watch the faceplates theyre pretty strongyou can drive nails with them without breaking thembut if theyre hit hard enough by something thats also hard enough they can crack all the same that way youre dead too dorrie asked quietly have you ever lost a tourist no but then i added others have five or six get killed every year ill play at those odds cochenour said seriously anyway that wasnt the lecture i wanted audee i mean i certainly want to hear how to stay alive but i assume you would have told us all this before we left the ship anyway what i really wanted to know was how come you picked this particular mascon to prospect this old geezer with the musclebeach body was beginning to bother me with his disturbing habit of asking the questions i didnt want to answer there definitely was a reason why i had picked this site it had to do with about five years of study a lot of digging and about a quarter of a million dollars worth of correspondence at spacemail rates with people like professor hegramet back on earth but i didnt want to tell him all my reasons there were about a dozen sites that i really wanted to explore if this happened to be one of the payoff places he would come out of it a lot richer than i wouldthats what the contracts you sign say forty percent to the charterer five percent to the guide the rest to the government and that should be enough for him if this one happened not to pay off i didnt want him taking some other guide to one of the others id marked so i only said call it an informed guess i promised you a good shot at a tunnel thats never been opened and i hope to keep my promise and now lets get the food put away were within ten minutes of where were going with everything strapped down and ourselves belted up we dropped out of the relatively calm layers into the big surface winds again we were over the big southcentral massif about the same elevation as the lands surrounding the spindle thats the elevation where most of the action is on venus down in the lowlands and the deep rift valleys the pressures run a hundred and twenty thousand millibars and up my airbody wouldnt take any of that for very long neither would anybody elses except for a few of the special research and military types fortunately it seemed the heechee didnt care for the lowlands either nothing of theirs has ever been located much below ninetybar doesnt mean it isnt there of course anyway i verified our position on the virtual globe and on the detail charts and deployed the first three autosonic probes the winds threw them all over the place as soon as they dropped free that was all right it doesnt much matter where the probes land within broad limits which is a good thing they dropped like javelins at first then flew around like straws in the wind until their little rockets cut in and the groundseeking controls fired them to the surface every one embedded itself properly you arent always that lucky so it was a good start i verified their position on the detail charts it was close enough to an equilateral triangle which is about how you want them then i made sure everybody was really strapped in opened the scanning range and began circling around now what bellowed cochenour i noticed the girl had put her earplugs back in but he wasnt willing to risk missing a thing now we wait for the probes to feel around for heechee tunnels itll take a couple of hours while i was talking i brought the airbody down through the surface layers now we were being thrown around by the gusts the buffeting got pretty bad but i found what i was looking for a surface formation like a blind arroyo and tucked us into it with only one or two bad moments cochenour was watching very carefully and i grinned to myself this was where pilotage counted not en route or at the prepared pads over the spindle when he could do what i was doing now he could get along without someone like menot before our position looked all right so i fired four holddowns tethered stakes with explosive heads that opened out in the ground i winched them tight and all of them held that was also a good sign reasonably pleased with myself i released the belt catches and stood up were here for at least a day or two i told them more if were lucky how did you like the ride dorrie was taking the earplugs out now that the protecting walls of the arroyo had cut the thundering down to a mere scream im glad i dont get airsick she said cochenour was thinking not talking he was studying the airbody controls while he lit another cigarette dorotha said one question audee why couldnt we stay up where its quieter fuel i carry enough to get us around but not to hover for days is the noise bothering you she made a face youll get used to it its like living next to a spaceport at first you wonder how anybody stands the noise for a single hour after youve been there a week youll miss it if it stops she moved over to the bullseye and gazed pensively out at the landscape wed crossed over into the night portion and there wasnt much to see but dust and small objects whirling around through our external light beams its that first week im worrying about she said i flicked on the probe readout the little percussive heads were firing their slapcharges and measuring each others echoes but it was too early to see anything the screen was barely beginning to build up a shadowy pattern there were more holes than detail cochenour finally spoke up how long until you can make some sense out of the readout he demanded another point he hadnt asked what it was depends on how close and how big anything is you can make a guess in an hour or so but i like all the data i can get six or eight hours id say theres no hurry he growled im in a hurry walthers the girl cut in what should we do audee play threehanded bridge whatever you want but id advise some sleep ive got pills if you want them if we do find anythingand remember the odds are really rotten on the first trywell want to be wide awake for a while all right dorotha said reaching out for the spansules but cochenour stopped her what about you he demanded ill sack in pretty soon im waiting for something he didnt ask what probably i thought because he already knew i decided that when i did hit my bunk i wouldnt t ke a sleepy pill right away this cochenour was not only the richest tourist i had ever guided he was one of the best informed and i wanted to think about that for a while so none of us went right to sleep and what i was waiting for took almost an hour to come the boys at the base were getting a little sloppy they should have been after us before this the radio buzzed and then blared unidentified vessel at one three five zero seven four eight and seven two five one five four please identify yourself and state your purpose cochenour looked up inquiringly from his gin game with the girl i smiled reassuringly as long as theyre saying please theres no problem i told him and opened the transmitter this is pilot audee walthers airbody poppa tare nine one out of the spindle we are licensed and have filed approved flight plans i have two terry tourists aboard purpose recreational exploration acknowledged please wait blared the radio the military always broadcasts at maximum gain hangover from drillsergeant days no doubt i turned off the microphone and told my passengers theyre checking our flight plan nothing to worry about in a moment the defense communicator came back loud as ever you are eleven point four kilometers bearing two eight three degrees from terminator of a restricted area proceed with caution under military regulations one seven and one eight sections i know the drill i cut in i have my guides license and have explained the restrictions to the passengers acknowledged blared the radio we will keep you under surveillance if you observe vessels or parties on the surface they are our perimeter teams do not interfere with them in any way respond at once to any request for identification or information the carrier buzz cut off they act nervous cochenour said no thats how they always are theyre used to seeing people like us around theyve got nothing else to do with their time thats all dorrie said hesitantly audee you told them youd explained the restrictions to us i dont remember that part oh i explained them all right we stay out of the restricted area because if we dont theyll start shooting that is the whole of the law vii i set a wakeup for four hours and the others heard me moving around and got up too dorrie fetched us coffee from the warmer and we stood drinking it and looking at the patterns the probe computer had traced i took several minutes to study them although the patterns were clear enough at first look they showed eight major anomalies that could have been heechee warrens one was almost right outside our door we wouldnt have to move the airbody to dig for it i showed them the anomalies one by one cochenour just studied them thoughtfully dorotha asked you mean all of those blobs are unexplored tunnels no wish they were but even if they were one any or all of them could have been explored by somebody who didnt go to the trouble of recording it two they dont have to be tunnels they could be fracture faults or dikes or little rivers of some kind of molten material that ran out of somewhere and hardened and got covered over a billion years ago the only thing we know for sure so far is that there probably arent any unexplored tunnels in this area except in those eight places so what do we do we dig and then we see what weve got cochenour asked where do we dig i pointed right next to the bright delta shape of our airbody right here is that the best bet well not necessarily i considered what to tell him and decided to experiment with the truth there are three traces altogether that look like better bets than the othershere ill mark them i keyed the chart controls and the three good traces immediately displayed letters a b and c a is the one that runs right under the arroyo here so well dig it first the brightest ones are best is that it i nodded but c over here is the brightest of the lot why dont we dig that first i chose my words carefully partly because wed have to move the airbody partly because its on the outside perimeter of the survey area that means the results arent as reliable as right around the ship but those arent the most important reasons the most important reason is that c is on the edge of the line our itchyfingered defense friends are telling us to stay away from cochenour snickered incredulously are you telling me that if you find a real untouched heechee tunnel youll stay out of it just because some soldier tells you its a nono i said the problem doesnt arise we have seven legal anomalies to look at alsothe military will be checking us from time to time particularly in the next day or two all right cochenour insisted suppose we come up empty on the legal ones what then i never borrow trouble but suppose damn it boyce how do i know he gave it up then but winked at dorrie and chuckled what did i tell you honey hes a bigger bandit than i am but she was looking at me and what she said was why are you that color i fobbed her off but when i looked in the mirror i could see that even the whites of my eyes were turning yellowish the next few hours we were too busy to talk about theoretical possibilities we had some concrete facts to worry about the biggest concrete fact was an awful lot of hightemperature highpressure gas that we had to keep from killing us that was what the heatsuits were for my own suit was custommade of course and needed only the fittings and tanks to be checked boyce and the girl had rental units id paid top dollar for them and they were good but good isnt perfect i had them in and out of the suits half a dozen times checking the fit and making adjustments until they were as right as i could get them the suits were laminated twelveply with nine degrees of freedom at the essential joints and their own little fuel batteries they wouldnt fail i wasnt worried about failure what i was worried about was comfort because a very small itch or rub can get serious when theres no way to stop it finally they were good enough for a trial we all huddled in the lock and opened the port to the surface of venus we were still in darkness but theres so much scatter from the sun that it doesnt get really dark ever i let them practice walking around the airbody leaning into the wind bracing themselves against the holddowns and the side of the ship while i got ready to dig i hauled out our first instant igloo dragged it into position and ignited it as it smoldered it puffed up like the childrens toy that used to be called a pharaohs serpent producing a light yet tough ash that grew up around the digging site and joined in a seamless dome at the top i had already emplaced the digging torch and the crawlthrough lock as the ash grew i manhandled the lock to get a close union and managed to get a perfect join the first time dorrie and cochenour stayed out of the way watching from the ship through their plug windows then i keyed the radio on you want to come in and watch me start it up i shouted inside the helmets they both nodded their heads i could just see the bobbing motion through the plugs come on then i yelled and wiggled through the crawl lock i signed for them to leave it open as they followed me in with the three of us and the digging equipment in it the igloo was even more crowded than the airbody had been they backed away as far from me as they could get bent against the arc of the igloo wall while i started up the augers checked that they were vertical and watched the first castings begin to spiral out of the cut the foam igloo reflects a lot of sound and absorbs even more all the same the din inside the igloo was a lot worse than in the howling winds outside cutters are noisy when i thought theyd seen enough to satisfy them for the moment i waved them out of the crawlthrough followed sealed it behind us and led them back into the airbody so far so good i said twisting off the helmet and loosenng the suit weve got about forty meters to cut i think might as well wait in here as out there how long will it take maybe an hour you can do what you like what im going to do is take a shower then well see how far weve got that was one of the nice things about having only three people aboard we didnt have to worry much about water discipline its astonishing how a quick wetdown revives you after coming out of a heatsuit when id finished mine i felt ready for anything i was even prepared to eat some of boyce cochenours three thousandcalorie gourmet cooking but fortunately it wasnt necessary dorrie had taken over the kitchen and what she laid out was simple light and reasonably nontoxic on cooking like hers i might be able to survive long enough to collect my charter fee it crossed my mind to wonder why she was a health nut but then i thought of course she wants to keep cochenour alive with all his spare parts no doubt he had dietary problems worse than mine well not worse exactly at least he probably wasnt quite as likely to die of them the venusian surface at that point was little more than ashy sand the augers chewed it out very rapidly too rapidly in fact when i went back into the igloo it was filled almost solid with castings i had a devil of a job getting to the machines so that i could rotate the auger to pump the castings out through the crawl lock it was a dirty job but it didnt take long i didnt bother to go back into the airbody i reported over the radio to boyce and the girl whom i could see staring out of the bullseyes at me i told them i thought we were getting close but i didnt tell them exactly how close actually we were only a meter or so from the indicated depth of the anomaly so close that i didnt bother to auger all the castings out i just made enough room to maneuver around inside the igloo then i redirected the augers and in five minutes the castings were beginning to come up with the pale blue heecheemetal glimmer that was the sign of a real tunnel viii about ten minutes later i keyed my helmet transmitter on and shouted boyce dorrie weve hit a tunnel either they were already in their suits or they dressed faster than any mazerat i unsealed the crawlthrough and wriggled out to help them and they were already coming out of the airbody pulling themselves hand over hand against the wind toward me they were both yelling questions and congratulations but i stopped them inside i ordered you can see for yourself as a matter of fact they didnt have to go that far they could see the blue color as soon as they knelt to enter the crawlthrough i followed and sealed the outer port of the crawlthrough behind me the reason for that is simple enough as long as the tunnel isnt breached it doesnt matter what you do but the interior of a heechee tunnel that has remained inviolate is at a pressure only slightly above earthnormal without the sealed dome of the igloo the minute you crack the casing you let the whole ninetythousandmillibar atmosphere of venus pour in heat and ablation and corrosive chemicals and all if the tunnel is empty or if whats in it is simple sturdy stuff there might not be any harm but there are a couple of dozen mysterious chunks of scrap in the museums that might have been interesting machinesif whoever found them hadnt let the atmosphere in to squeeze them into junk if you hit the jackpot you can destroy in a second what has waited hundreds of thousands of years to be discovered we gathered around the shaft and i pointed down the augers had left a clean shaft about seventy centimeters by a little over a hundred with rounded edges at the bottom you could see the cold blue glow of the outside of the tunnel only pocked by the augers and blotched by the loose castings i hadnt bothered to get out now what cochenour demanded his voice was hoarse with excitementnatural enough i guessed now we burn our way in i backed my clients as far away as they could get inside the igloo pressed against the remaining heap of castings then i unlimbered the firejets id already hung shearlegs over the shaft the jets slipped right down on their cable until they were just a few centimeters above the round of the tunnel then i fired them up you wouldnt think that anything a human being might do would make anything hotter than venus does already but the firejets were something special in the small space of the igloo the heat flamed up and around us our heatsuit cooling systems were overwhelmed in a moment dorrie gasped oh ii think im going to cochenour grabbed her arm faint if you want to he said fiercely but dont get sick inside your suit waithers how bug does this go on it was as hard for me as it was for them practice doesnt get you used to something like standing in front of a blast furnace with the doors off the hinges maybe a minute i gasped hold on its all right it actually took a little more than that maybe ninety seconds my suit telltales were shouting overload alarm for more than half of that time but the suits were built for these temporary overloads as long as we didnt cook inside them the suits themselves would survive then we were through a halfmeter circular section of the tunnel roof sagged fell at one side and hung there swaying i turned off the jets we all breathed hard for a couple of minutes while the suit coolers gradually caught up with the load wow said dorotha that was pretty rough in the light that splashed up out of the shaft i could see that cochenour was frowning i didnt say anything i just gave the jets another fivesecond burn to cut away the rest of the circular section it fell free to the tunnel floor with a smack like rock then i turned on my helmet radio theres no pressure differential i said cochenours frown didnt change nor did he speak that means this one has been breached i went on somebody found it opened it upprobably cleaned it out if there ever was anything hereand just didnt report it lets go back to the airbody and get cleaned up dorotha shrieked audee whats the matter with you i want to go down there and see whats inside shut up dorrie cochenour said bitterly dont you hear what hes saying this ones a washout well theres always the chance that a breached tunnel might have been opened by some seismological event not a mazerat with a cutting torch if so there might possibly be something in it worth having anyway and i didnt have the heart to kill all dorothas enthusiasm with one blow so we did swing down the cable one by one into the heechee dig we looked around it was wholly bare as most of them are as far as we could see that wasnt actually very far the other thing wrong with a breached tunnel is that you need special equipment to explore it with the overloads theyd already had our suits were all right for another few hours but not much more than that so we tramped down the tunnel about a kilometer and found bare walls choppedoff struts on the glowing blue walls that might once have held somethingand nothing movable not even junk then they were both willing to tramp back and climb up the cable to the airbody cochenour made it on his own so did dorrie though i was standing by to help her she did it all hand over hand using the stirrups spaced along the cable we cleaned up and made ourselves a meal we had to eat but cochenour was not in a mood for his gourmet exhibition silently dorotha threw tablets into the cooker and we fed gloomily on prefabs well thats only the first one she said at last determined to be sunny about it and its only our second day cochenour said shut up dorrie if theres one thing im not its a good loser he was staring at the probe trace still displayed on the screen walthers how many tunnels are unmarked but empty like this one how do i know if theyre unmarked theres no record then those traces dont mean anything do they we might dig all eight and find every one a dud i nodded we surely might boyce he looked at me alertly and and thats not the worst part of it at least this trace was a real tunnel ive taken parties out who wouldve gone mad with joy to open even a breached tunnel after a couple of weeks of digging up dikes and intrusions its perfectly possible all seven of those others are nothing at all dont knock it boyce at least you got some action for your money he brushed that off you picked this spot walthers did you know what you were doing did i the only way to prove that to him would be to find a live one of course i could have told him about the months of studying records from the first landings on i could have mentioned how much trouble i went to and how many regulations i broke to get a look at the military survey reports or how far id traveled to talk to the defense crews whod been on some of the early digs i might have let him know how hard it had been to locate old jorolemon hegramet now teaching exotic archaeology back in tennessee but all i said was the fact that we found one tunnel shows that i know my business thats all you paid for its up to you whether we keep looking or not he gazed at his thumbnail considering buck up boyce dorrie said cheerfully look at the other chances weve still gotand even if we miss itll still be fun telling everybody about it back in cincinnati he didnt even look at her just said isnt there a way of telling whether or not a tunnel has been breached without going inside sure you can tell by tapping the outside shell you can hear the difference in the sound but you have to dig down to it first right we left it at that i got back into my heatsuit to strip away the now useless igloo so that we could move the drills i didnt really want to discuss it anymore because i didnt want him to ask me a question i might have to lie about i try the best i can to stick to the truth because its easier to remember what youve said that way on the other hand im not fanatic about it i dont see that its any of my business to correct a mistaken impression for instance obviously cochenour supposed i hadnt bothered to sound the tunnel before calling them in but of course i had that was the first thing i did as soon as the drill got down that far and when i heard the highpressure thunk it broke my heart i had to wait a couple of minutes before i could call them to announce that wed reached the outer casing at that time i had not quite faced up to the question of just what i would have done if it had turned out the tunnel was unbreached ix boyce cochenour and dorrie keefer were maybe the fiftieth or sixtieth party id taken on a heechee dig i wasnt surprised that they were willing to work like coolies i dont care how lazy and bored terry tourists start out by the time they actually come close to finding something that once belonged to an almost completely unknown alien race left there when the closest thing to a human being on earth was a sbopebrowed furry little beast whose best trick was killing other beasts by hitting them on the head with antelope bones by then they begin to burn with exploration fever so the two of them worked hard and they drove me hard and i was as eager as they maybe more so as the days went past and i found myself rubbing my right side just under the short ribs more and more of the time we got a couple looks from the defense boys they overfiew us in their highspeed airbodies half a dozen times in the first few days they didnt say much just formal radio requests for identification regulations say that if you find anything youre supposed to report it right away over cochenours objections i reported finding that first breached tunnel which surprised them a little i think thats all we had to report site b was a pegmatite dike the other two fairly bright ones that i called d and e showed nothing at all when we dugmeaning that the sound reflections had probably been caused by nothing more than invisible interfaces in rock or ash or gravel i vetoed trying to dig site c the best looking of the bunch cochenour gave me a hell of an argument about it but i held out the military were still looking in on us every now and then and i didnt want to get any closer to their perimeter than we already were i said maybe if we didnt have any luck elsewhere we could sneak back to c for a quick dig before returning to the spindle and we left it at that we lifted the airbody moved to a new position and set out a new pattern of probes by the end of the second week we had dug nine times and come up empty all nine we were getting low on igloos and probe percussers wed run out of tolerance for each other completely cochenour had turned sullen and savage i hadnt planned on being best buddies with the man when i first met him but i hadnt expected him to be as bad company as that i didnt think he had any right to take it so hard because it was obviously only a game with him with all his fortune the extra money he might pick up by discovering some new heechee artifacts couldnt have meant muchjust extra points on a scorepadbut he was playing for blood i wasnt particularly gracious myself for that matter the plain fact was that the pills from the quackery werent helping as much as they should my mouth tasted as though rats had nested in it i was getting headaches and every once in a while id be woozy enough to knock things over see the thing about the liver is that it sort of regulates your internal diet it filters out poisons it converts some of the carbohydrates into other carbohydrates that you can use it patches together amino acids into proteins if it isnt working you die the doctor had been all over it with me mazerats get liver trouble a lot it comes when you save yourself a little trouble by letting your internal suit pressure build upit sort of compresses the gas in your gut and squeezes the liver hed showed me pictures i could visualize what was going on in my insides with the mahoganyred liver cells dying and being replaced by clusters of fat and yellowish stuff it was an ugly picture the ugliest part was that there wasnt anything i could do about it only go on taking pills and they wouldnt work much longer i counted the days to byebye liver hello hepatic failure so we were a bad bunch i was being a bastard because i was beginning to feel sick and desperate cochenour was being a bastard because that was his nature the only decent human being aboard was the girl dorrie did her best she really did she was sometimes sweet and she was always ready to meet the power people cochenour and me more than halfway it was obvious that it was tough on her dorotha keefer was only a kid no matter how grownup she acted she just hadnt been alive long enough to grow defenses against concentrated meanness add in the fact that we were all beginning to hate the sight and sound and smell of each other and there wasnt much joy in this skylarking tour of venus for dorrie keefer or for any of us especially after i broke the news that we were down to our last igloo cochenour cleared his throat it wasnt a polite sound it was the beginning of a war cry he sounded like a fighterplane jockey blowing the covers off his guns in preparation for combat and dorne tried to head him off with a diversion audee she said brightly do you know what i think we could do we could go back to that site c the one that looked good near the military reservation it was the wrong diversion i shook my head no what the hell do you mean no cochenour rumbled revving up for battle what i said no its too close to the defense guys if theres a tunnel it will run right onto the reservation and theyll come down on us i tried to be persuasive thats a desperation trick and im not that desperate walthers he snarled youll be desperate if i tell you to be desperate i can still stop payment on that check i corrected him no you cant the union wont let you the regulations are very clear about that you pay up unless i disobey a lawful request what you want isnt lawful going inside the military reservation is extremely against the law he shifted over to cold war no he said softly youre wrong about that its only against the law if a court says it is after we do it youre only right if your lawyers are smarter than my lawyer honestly waithers they wont be i pay my lawyers to be the smartest there are i was not in a good bargaining position it wasnt just that what cochenour said was true enough he had help from a very powerful ally my liver was on his side i certainly could not spare time for arbitration because without the transplant his payment was going to buy i wouldnt live that long dorrie had been listening with her birdlike air of friendly inter est she got between us well then how about this we just got to where we are now why dont we wait and see what the probes show maybe well hit something even better than that site c there isnt going to be anything good here he said without taking his eyes off me why boyce how do you know that we havent even finished the soundings he said look dorotha listen close this one time and then shut up walthers is playing games with me do you see where we just put down he brushed past me and tapped out the command for a full map display which somewhat surprised me i hadnt known he knew how the charts sprang up they showed the virtual images of our position and of the shafts wed already cut and the great irregular border of the military reservationall overlaid on the plot of mascons and navigation aids do you see the picture were not even in the highdensity massconcentration areas now isnt that true walthers are you saying weve tried all the good locations around here and come up dry no i said that is youre partly right mr cochenour only partly im not playing any games with you this site is a good possibility you can see it on the map its true that were not right over any mascon but were right between those two right there that are pretty close together thats a good sign sometimes you find a dig that connects two complexes and it has happened that the connecting passage was closer to the surface there than any other part of the system i cant guarantee that well hit anything here but its worth a gamble its just damn unlikely right well no more unlikely than anywhere else i told you a week ago you got your moneys worth the first day just finding any heechee tunnel at all even a spoiled one there are mazerats in the spindle who went five years without seeing that much i thought for a minute ill make a deal with you i offered im listening were already on the ground here theres at beast a chance we can hit something lets try well deploy the probes and see what they turn up if we get a good trace well dig it if not well then ill think about going back to site c think about it he roared dont push me cochenour you dont know what youre getting into the military reservation is not to be fooled with those boys shoot first and ask later and there arent any policemen around to holler for help i dont know he said after a moments glowering thought no i told him you dont mr cochenour i do thats what youre paying me for he nodded yes you probably do know walthers but whether youre telling me the truth about what you know is another question hegramet never said anything about digging between mascons and then he looked at me with a completely opaque expression waiting to see whether i would catch him up on what hed just said i didnt respond i gave him an opaque look back i didnt say a word i only waited to see what would come next i was pretty sure it would not be any sort of explanation of how he happened to know professor hegramets name or what dealings he had had with the greatest earthside authority on heechee diggings it wasnt put out your probes he said at last well try it your way one more time i plopped the probes out got good penetration on all of them and started firing the noisemakers then i sat watching the first lines of the cast build up on the scan as though i expected them to carry useful information they werent going to for quite a while but i wanted to think privately for a bit cochenour needed to be thought about he hadnt come to venus just for the ride he had planned to dig for heechee tunnels before he ever left the earth he had gone to the trouble of briefing himself even on the instruments he would encounter in an airbo iy my sales talk about heechee treasures had been wasted on a customer whose mind had been made up to buy at least half a year earlier and tens of millions of miles away i understood all that but the more i understood the more i saw that i didnt understand i wished i could slip cochenour a couple of bucks and send him off to the games parlors for a while so i could talk privately to the girl unfortunately there wasnt anywhere to send him i forced a yawn complained about the boredom of waiting for the probe traces to build up and suggested we all take a nap not that i would have been real confident he would be the one to turn inbut he didnt even listen all i got out of that ploy was an offer from dorrie to watch the screen and wake me up if anything interesting developed so i said the hell with it and turned in myself i didnt sleep well because while i was lying there waiting for sleep to happen it gave me time to notice how truly lousy i was beginning to feel and in how many different ways there was a sort of permanent taste of bile in the back of my mouthnot so much as though i wanted to throw up as it was as though i just had my head ached my eyes were getting woozy i was beginning to see ghost images wandering fuzzily around my field of vision i roused myself to take a couple of my pills i didnt count the ones that were left i didnt want to know i set my private wakeup for three hours thinking maybe that would give cochenour time to get sleepy and turn in leaving dorne perhaps up and maybe feeling conversational but when i woke up there was the wideawake old man cooking himself a herb omelet with the last of our sterile eggs you were right walthers he grinned i was sleepy at that so i had a nice little onehour nap ready for anything now want some eggs actually i did want them a lot but of course i didnt dare eat them so i glumly swallowed the nutritious and very unsatisfying stuff the diet department of the quackery allowed me to have and watched him stuff himself it was unfair that a man of ninety could be so healthy that he didnt have to think about his digestion while i was well there wasnt any profit in that kind of thinking i offered to play some music to pass the time dorrie picked swan lake and i started it up and then i had an idea i headed for the tool lockers they didnt really need checking the auger heads were close to time for replacement but i wasnt going to replace them we were running low on spares the thing about the tool lockers was that they were about as far from the galley as you could get and still be inside the airbody i hoped dorrie would follow me and she did need any help audee glad to have it i told her here hold these for me dont get the grease on your clothes i didnt expect her to ask why they had to be held she didnt she only laughed at the idea of getting grease on her clothes i dont think id even notice a little extra grease dirty as i am i guess well all be glad to get back to civilization cochenour was frowning over the probe and paying no attention i said which kind of civilization do you mean the spindle or all the way back to earth what i had in mind was to start her talking about earth but she went the other way oh the spindle she said i never dreamed id get to this planet audee i loved it i thought it was fascinating the way everybody got along together and we really didnt see much of it especially the people like that indian fellow who ran the restaurant the cashier was his wife wasnt she she was one of them yes shes vastras numberone wife the waitress was number three and he has another one at home with the kids there are five kids all three wives involved but i wanted to turn the conversation around so i said its pretty much the same as on earth vastra would be running a tourist trap in benares if he wasnt running one here and he wouldnt be here if he hadn t shipped out with the military and terminated here i guess if i werent on venus id be guiding in texas if theres any open country left to guide hunters inmaybe up along the canadian river how about you all the time i was picking up the same four or five tools studying the serial numbers and putting them back she didnt notice how do you mean well what did you do on earth before you came here oh i worked in boyces office for a while that was encouraging maybe shed remember something about his connection with professor hegramet what were you a secret ary she gave me an unfriendly look something like that she said then i was embarrassed she thought i was pryingi was of course but i wasnt looking for sordid details about how a pretty young thing like her allowed herself to be seduced into being bedmate for a dirty old man not least because cochenour old though he was and nasty as he might be when he chose was also obviously a pretty powerfully attractive figure to women i said trying to be placating its none of my business of course no she said it isnt and then she said whats that that was an incoming call on the radio thats what that was so answer it cochenour snarled from across the airbody looking up from his eggs i was glad enough for the interruption the call was voiceonly which surprised me a little i kept it that way in fact i took the call on the earjack since it is my nature to be cautious about some things anyway there isnt much privacy in an airbody and i want what little crumbs of it i can find it was the base calling a communications sergeant i knew named littleknees i signed in irritably watching dorrie go back to sit protectively with boyce cochenour a private word for you audee said sergeant littleknees is your sahib lurking about littleknees and i had exchanged radio chatter for a long time there was something about the bright cheeriness of the tone that bothered me i turned my back on cochenour i knew he was listeningbut only to my side of the conversation of course because of the earjack in the area but not tuned in at present i said what have you got for me just a little news bulletin the sergeant purred it came in over the synsat a couple of minutes ago information only as far as we were concerned that means we dont have to do anything about it but maybe you do honey standing by i said studying the plastic housing of the radio the sergeant chuckled your sahibs charter captain would like to have a word with him when found its kind of urgent cause the captain isrighteously pissed off yes base i said your signals received strength ten sergeant amanda littleknees made an amused noise again but this time it wasnt a chuckle it was a downright giggle the thing is she said his check for the charter fee for the yuri gagarin went bouncybouncy do you want to know what the bank said youd never guess insufficient funds thats what they said the pain under my right lower ribs was permanent but right then it seemed to get a lot worse i gritted my teeth ah sergeant littleknees i croaked can you verify that estimate sorry honey she buzzed in my ear but theres no doubt in the world the captain got a credit report on your boyce cochenour fellow and it turned up ng when your customer gets back to the spindle therell be a warrant waiting for him thank you for the synoptic estimate i said hollowly i will verify departure time before we take off and i turned off the radio and gazed at my rich billionaire client what the hells the matter with you walthers he growled but i wasnt hearing his voice i was only hearing what my happy sawbones at the quackery had told me the equations were unforgettable cash new liver happy survival no cash total hepatic failure death and my cash supply had just dried up x when you get a really big piece of news you have to let it trickle through your system and get thoroughly absorbed before you do anything about it it isnt a matter of seeing the implications i saw those right away you bet i did its a matter of letting the system reach equilibrium so i puttered for a few minutes i listened to tchaikovskys swan hunters tooling up to meet the queen i made sure the radio switch was off so as not to waste power i checked the synoptic plot the thumpers were building up it would have been nice if there had been something wonderful beginning to show on it but the way things were going there wouldnt be of course there wasnt a few pale echoes were be ginning to form but nothing with the shape of a heechee tunnel and nothing very bright the data were still coming in but i knew there was no way for those feeble plots to develop into the mother lode that could save us all even crooked deadbroke bastard cochenour i even looked out at as much of the sky as i could manage through the windows to see how the weather was it didnt matter but some of the big white calomel clouds were scudding among the purples and yellows of the other mercury halides the sun was getting ready to rise in the west it was beautiful and i hated it cochenour had put away the last of his omelet and was watching me thoughtfully so was dorrie back at the parts rack once again holding the augers in their greasepaper wrap i grinned at her pretty i said referring to the music the auckland philharmonic was just getting to the part where the baby swans come out arm in arm and do a fast bouncy pas de quatre across the stage it has always been one of my favorite parts of swan lake but not now well listen to the rest of it later i said and switched the player off cochenour snapped all right waithers whats going on i sat down on an empty igloo pack and lit a cigarette because one of the adjustments my internal system had made was to calculate that we didnt need to worry much about coddling our oxygen supply anymore there are some questions that have been bothering me cochenour for one how did you happen to get in touch with professor hegramet he grinned and relaxed oh is that all thats on your mind no reason you shouldnt know that i did a lot of checking on venus before i came out herewhy not no reason except you let me think you didnt know a thing cochenour shrugged if you had any brains at all youd know i didnt get rich by being stupid you think id travel umptymillion miles without knowing what i was going to find when i got here no you wouldnt but you did your best to make me think you would no matter so you went looking for somebody who could point you to whatever was worth stealing on venus and then that person steered you to hegramet then what did hegramet tell you that i was dumb enough to be your boy cochenour wasnt quite as relaxed but he hadnt turned aggressive either he said mildly hegramet did mention your name yes he told me you were as good a guide as any if i wanted to look for a virgin tunnel then he answered a lot of questions for me about the heechee and so on so yes i knew who you were if you hadnt come to us i would have come to you you just saved me the trouble i said feeling a little surprise as i said it you know i think youre telling me the truth except that you left out one thing which was it wasnt the fun of making more money that you were after was it it was just money right money that you needed pretty badly i turned to dorotha standing frozen with the augers in her hands how about it dorrie did you know the old man was broke it wasnt too smart of me to put it to her like that i saw what she was about to do just before she did it and jumped off the igloo crate i was a little too late she dropped the augers before i could take them away from her but fortunately they landed flat and the blades werent chipped i picked them up and put them away she had answered the question well enough i see he didnt tell you about that i said thats tough on you doll his check to the captain of the gagarin is still bouncing and i would imagine the one he gave me isnt going to be much better i hope you got it all in fur and jewels dorrie my advice to you is to hide them before the creditors want them back she didnt even look at me she was only looking at cochenour whose expression was all the confirmation she needed i dont know what i expected from her rage or reproaches or tears what she did was whisper oh boyce dear im so sorry and she went over and put her arms around him i turned my back on them because i wasnt enjoying looking at the way he was the strapping ninetyyearold buck on full medical had turned into a defeated old man for the first time since hed walked cockily into the spindle he looked all of his age and maybe a little bit more the mouth was halfopen trembling the straight back was stooped the bright blue eyes were watering dorrie stroked him and crooned to him looking at me with an expression filled with pain it had never occurred to me that she might really care about the guy i turned and studied the synoptic web again for lack of anything better to do it was about as clear as it was ever going to get and it was empty we had a little overlap from one of our previous soundings so i could tell that the interestinglooking scratches on one edge were nothing to get excited about wed checked them out already they were only ghosts there was no instant salvation waiting for us there curiously i felt kind of relaxed there is something tranquilizing about the realization that you dont have anything much to lose anymore it puts things in a different perspective i dont mean to say that i had given up there were still things i could do they didnt have much to do with prolonging my life anymorethat was one of the things i had had to readjust tobut then the taste in my mouth and the pain in my gut werent letting me enjoy life very much anyway one thing i could do was to write good old audee walthers off since only a miracle could keep me from that famous total hepatic collapse in a week or two i could accept the fact that i wasnt going to be alive much longer so i could use what time i had left for something else what else well dorrie was not a bad kid i could fly the airbody back to the spindle turn cochenour over to the gendarthes and spend my last couple of walkingaround days introducing dorne to the people who could help her vastra or beegee would be willing to give her some kind of a start maybe she might not even have to go into prostitution or the rackets the high season wasnt all that far off and she had the kind of personality that might make a success out of a little booth of prayer fans and heechee lucky pieces for the terry tourists maybe that wasnt much from anyones point of view but the captain of the gagarin was surely not going to fly her back to cincinnati for nothing and scrounging in the spindle beat starving somewhat then maybe i didnt really have to give up on myself even i thought about that for a bit i could fling myself on the mercy of the quackery conceivably they might let me have a new liver on credit why not there was one good reason why not namely they never had or i could open the twofuel valves and let them mix for ten minutes or so before hitting the igniter the explosion wouldnt leave much of the airbodyor of usand nothing at all of our various problems or i sighed oh hell i said buck up cochenour were not dead yet he looked at me for a moment to see if id gone crazy then he patted dorries shoulder and pushed her away gently enough i will be soon enough im sorry about all this dorotha and im sorry about your check walthers i expect you needed the money you have no idea he said with some difficulty do you want me to try to explain i dont see that it makes any differencebut yes i admitted out of curiosity i do it didnt take him long once he started he was succinct and clear and he didnt leave any important things outalthough actually i could have guessed most of it the basic thing is that a man cochenours age has to be one of two things either hes very very rich or hes dead cochenours trouble was that he was only quite rich hed done his best to keep all his industries going with a depleted cash flow of what was left after he siphoned off the costs of transplants and treatments calciphylaxis and prosthesis protein regeneration here cholesterol flushing there a million for this a hundred grand a month for that oh it went fast enough i could see that you just dont know he said not pitifully just stating a fact what it takes to keep a hundredyearold man alive until you try it oh dont i just i said but not out loud i let him go on with the story of how the minority stockholders were getting inquisitive and the federal inspectors were closing in and so he skipped earth to make his fortune all over again on venus but i wasnt listening attentively anymore by the time he got to the end of it i didnt even pick up on the fact that hed been lying about his ageimagine that vanity thinking it was better to say he was ninety i had more important things to do than make cochenour squirm anymore instead of listening i was writing on the back of a navigation form when i was finished i passed it over to cochenour sign it i said what is it does it matter you dont have any choice that i can see but what it is is a release from the allrights section of our charter agreement you acknowledge that the charter is void that you have no claim that your check was rubber and that you voluntarily waive your ownership of anything we might find in my favor he was frowning whats this bit at the end thats where i agree to give you ten percent of my share of the profits on anything we find if we do find anything worth money thats charity he said looking up at me but he was already signing i dont mind taking a little charity especially since as you point out i dont have any choice but i can read that synoptic web over there as well as you can walthers theres nothing on it to find no there isnt i agreed folding the paper and putting it in my pocket that trace is as bare as your bank account but were not going to dig there what were going to do is go back and dig site c i lit another cigarettelung cancer was the least of my worries just thenand thought for a minute while they waited watching me i was wondering how much to tell them of what i had spent five years finding out and figuring out schooling myself not even to hint at it to anyone else i was sure in my mind that nothing i said would make a difference anymore even so the habits of years were strong the words didnt want to say themselves it took a real effort for me to make myself start you remember subhash vastra the fellow who ran the trap where i met you sub came to venus during his hitch with the military he was a weapons specialist there isnt any civilian career for a weapons specialist especially on venus so he went into the cafй business with most of his termination bonus when he got out then he sent for his wives with the rest of it but he was supposed to be pretty good at weaponry while he was in the service what are you saying audee dornie asked i never heard of any heechee weapons no nobody has ever found a heechee weapon but sub thinks they found targets it was actually physically difficult for me to force my lips to speak the next part but i got it out anyway sub vastra thought they were targets he said the higher brass didnt believe him and i think the matter has been pigeonholed on the reservation now but what they found was triangular pieces of heechee wall materialthat blue lightemitting stuff they lined the tunnels with there were dozens of the things they all had a pattern of radiating lines sub says they looked like targets to him and they had been drilled through by something that left the holes as chalky as talcum powder do you happen to know of anything that will do that to heechee wall material dornie was about to say she didnt but cochenour said it for her thats impossible he said flatly right thats what the brass told sub vastra they decided that the holes were made in the process of fabrication for some heechee purpose well never know vastra doesnt believe that vastra says he figured they were just about the same as the paper targets soldiers use on the firing range the holes werent all in the same place the lines looked to him like scoring markers thats all the evidence there is that vastras right not proof even vastra doesnt think its proof but its evidence anyway and you think you can find the gun that made those holes where we located site c cochenour asked i hesitated i wouldnt put it that strongly call it a hope maybe even a very outside hope but theres one more thing these targets or whatever they are were turned up by a prospector nearly forty years ago there wasnt any military reservation then he turned them in to see if anybody would buy them and nobody was very interested then he went out looking for something better and after a while he got himself killed that happened a lot in those days no one paid much attention to the things until some military types got a look at them and then somebody had the same idea vastra had years later so they got serious they identified the site where hed reported finding them near the south pole they staked off everything for a thousand kilometers around and labeled it off limits thats how come the reservation is where it is and they dug and dug they turned up about a dozen heechee tunnels but most of them were bare and the rest were cracked and spoiled they didnt find anything like a weapon then theres nothing there cochenour growled looking perplexed theres nothing they found i corrected him remember this was forty years ago cochenour looked at me puzzled then his expression cleared oh he said the location of the find i nodded thats right in those days prospectors lied a lotif they found something good they didnt want other people horning in so he gave the wrong location for his tunnel at that time he was shacked up with a young lady who later married a man named allemangher son booker is a friend of mine beegee you met him and he had a map cochenour was looking openly skeptical now oh right he said sourly the famous treasure map and he just gave it to you out of friendship he sold it to me i said wonderful how many copies do you suppose he sold other suckers not many i didnt blame cochenour for doubting the story but he was rubbing me the wrong way i got him right when he came back from trying to find it on his own he didnt have time to try anybody else i saw cochenour opening his mouth and went ahead to forestall him no he didnt find anything yes he thought he followed the map thats why i didnt have to pay much but you see i think he missed the right place the right location on the map as near as i can figurethe navigation systems then werent what they are nowis right about where we set down the first time give or take some i saw some digging marks a couple of times i think they were pretty old i slipped the little private magnetofiche out of my pocket while i was talking and put it into the virtual map display it showed one central mark an orange x thats where i think we might find the right tunnel somewhere near that x and as you can see thats pretty close to our old site c silence for a minute i listened to the distant outside rumble of the winds waiting for the others to say something dorrie was looking troubled i dont know if i like the idea of trying to find a new weapon she said itsits like bringing back the bad old days i shrugged cochenour was beginning to look more like himself again the point isnt whether we really want to find a weapon is it the point is that we want to find an untapped heechee dig for whatevers in it but the soldiers think there might be a weapon somewhere around so they arent going to let us dig right not think thought i doubt any of them believe it anymore all the same theyll shoot us first and ask questions later isnt that what you said thats what i said nobodys ever allowed on the reservation without clearance not because of heechee weapons theyve got lots of their own stuff there that they dont want people seeing he nodded so how do you propose to get around that little problem he asked if i were a completely truthful man i probably should have said that i wasnt sure i would get around it looked at honestly the odds were pretty poor we could easily get caught and although i didnt think it was certain very possibly shot but we had so little to lose cochenour and i at least that i didnt think that was important enough to mention i just said well try to fool them well send the airbody off you and i will stay behind to do the digging if they think were gone they won t be keeping us under surveillance all wed have to worry about is being picked up on a routine perimeter patrol but theyre fairly careless about those i hope audee the girl cried what are you talking about if you and boyce stay here whos going to run the airbody i cant no i agreed you cant or not very welleven after i give you a couple of lessons but you can let the thing fly itself oh youll waste fuel and youll get bounced around a lot but youll get where youre going on autopilot itll even land you on its own you havent landed that way cochenour pointed out i didnt say it would be a good landing youd better be strapped in what it would be of course was something more like a controlled crash i closed my mind to the thought of what an autopilot landing might do to my one and only airbody dorrie would survive it though ninetynine chances out of a hundred then what do i do dorrie asked there were big holes in my plan at that point too but i closed my mind to them as well that depends on where you go i think the best plan would be for you to head right back to the spindle and leave you here she demanded looking suddenly rebellious not permanently in the spindle you look up my friend beegee allemang and tell him whats been going on hell want a share naturally but thats all right we can give him twentyfive percent and hell be happy with that ill give you a note for him with all the coordinates and so on and hell fly the airbody right back here to pick us up say twentyfour hours later can we do all that in a day cochenour wanted to know sure we can we have to and what if dorrie cant find him or he gets lost or something shell find him and he wont get lost of course i admitted theres always the possibility of some something we have a little margin for error we can take tanks for extra air and powerwe should be all right for as much as fortyeight hours no more than that itll be cutting it very close but thats plenty of time i think if hes late of course were in trouble but he wont be what i really worry about is that well dig that tunnel and itll be no good then weve wasted our time but if we do find anything i left it there sounds pretty chancy cochenour observed but he was looking at dorrie not at me she shrugged i didnt say it was a guarantee i told him i only said it was a chance i was beginning to think very well of dorotha keefer she was a pretty nice person considering her age and circumstances and smart and strong too but one thing she lacked was selfconfidence she had just never been trained to it she had been getting it as a prosthesisfrom cochenour most recently i supposed before that maybe whoever preceded cochenour in her lifeat her age perhaps that had been her father she had the air of somebody whod been surrounded by dominating people for a long time that was the biggest problem persuading dorrie that she could do her part it wont work she kept saying as i went over the controls with her im sorry it isnt that i dont want to help i do but i cant it just wont work well it would have or at least i think it would have in the event we never got to try the plan out between us cochenour and i finally got dorrie to agree to give it a whirl we packed up what little salvageable gear wed put outside we flew back to the ravine landed and began to set up for a dig but i was feeling poorlythick headachy clumsyand i suppose cochenour had his own problems though i must admit he didnt complain between the two of us we managed to catch the casing of the drill in the exit port while we were offloading it and while i was jockeying it one way from above cochenour pulled the other way from beneath and the whole hard heavy thing came right down on top of him it didnt kill him it just gouged his suit and broke his leg and knocked him unconscious and that took care of any possibility of having him to help me dig site c xi the first thing i did was to check the drill to make sure it wasnt damaged it wasnt the second was to manhandle cochenour back into the airbody lock that took about everything i had with the combined weight of our suits and bodies getting the drill out of the way and my general physical condition but i managed it dorrie was great no hysteria no foolish questions we got him out of his heatsuit and looked him over the suit leg had been ruptured through eight or ten plies but there had been enough left to keep the air out if not all the pressure he was alive unconscious all right but breathing the leg fracture was compounded with bone showing through the bleeding flesh he was bleeding too from the mouth and nose and he had vomited inside his helmet all in all he was about the worstlooking hundredorwhateveryearold man youll ever seelive one anyway but he didnt seem to have taken enough heat to cook his brain his heart was still goingwell i mean whoevers heart it had been in the first place was still going it was a good investment because it was pumping right along we put compresses on everything we could find and most of the bleeding stopped by itself except from the nasty business on his leg for that we needed more expert help dorrie called the military reservation for me she got amanda littleknees and was put right through to the base surgeon colonel eve marcuse dr marcuse was a friend of my own quackery fellow id met her once or twice and she was good about telling me what to do at first colonel marcuse wanted me to pack up and bring cochenour right over i vetoed that i gave her satisfactory reasonsi wasnt in shape to pilot and it would be a rough ride for cochenour i certainly didnt give her the real reason namely that i didnt want to get into the reservation and have to explain my way out of it again so instead she gave me stepbystep instructions on what to do with the casualty they were easy enough to follow and i did all she commanded reduced the fracture packed the gash stuck cochenour with broadspectrum antibiotics closed the wound with surgical velcro and meat glue sprayed a bandage all around and poured on a cast it depleted our firstaid supplies pretty thoroughly and took about an hour of our time cochenour would have come to while we were doing it except that i had also given him a sleepy needle then he was stable enough from then on it was just a matter of taking pulse and respiration and bloodpressure readings to satisfy the surgeon and promising to get him back to the spindle pretty soon when dr marcuse was through still annoyed with me for not bringing cochenour in for her to play withi think she was fascinated by the idea of cutting into a man composed almost entirely of other peoples partssergeant littleknees came back on the circuit i could tell what was on her mind uh honey how did it happen exactly a great big heechee came exactly up out of the ground and bit him exactly on the leg i told her i know what youre thinking youve got an evil mind it was just an accident of course it was she said i just wanted you to know that i dont blame you a bit and she signed off dorrie was cleaning the old man off as best she couldpretty profligate with our spare sheets and towels i thought considering that my airbody didnt carry a washing machine aboard i left her to it while i made myself some coffee lit another cigarette and sat and thought up another plan by the time dorrie had done what she could for cochenour then cleaned up the worst of the mess then begun such remaining important tasks as the repair of her eye makeup i had thought up a dandy as the first step i gave cochenour a wakeup needle dorrie patted him and talked to him while he got his bearings she was not a girl who carried a grudge on the other hand i did a little i wasnt as tender as she as soon as he seemed coherent i got him up to try out his musclesa lot faster than he really wanted to his expression told me that they all ached they worked all right though and he could stump around on the cast he was even able to grin old bones he said i knew i should have gone for another recalciphylaxis thats what happens when you try to save a buck he sat down heavily wincing the leg stuck out in front of him he wrinkled his nose as he smelled himself sorry to have messed up your nice clean airbody he added its been messed up worse you want to finish cleaning yourself up he looked surprised well i guess id better pretty soon do it now i want to talk to you both he didnt argue he just stuck out his hand and dorrie took it with her help he stumped halfhopping toward the cleanup actually dorrie had already done the worst of the job of getting him clean before he woke up but he splashed a little water on his face and swished some around in his mouth he was pretty well recovered when he turned around to look at me all right walthers what is it do we give up and go back now no i said well do it a different way he cant audee dorrie cried look at him and the con dition his suit is in he couldnt last outside an hour much less help you dig i know that so well have to change the plan ill dig by myself the two of you will slope off in the airbody oh brave heroic man cochenour said flatly are you crazy who are you kidding thats a twoman job i did the first one by myself cochenour and came into the airbody to cool off every little while sure thats a whole other thing i hesitated itll be harder i admitted not impossible lone prospectors have dug out tunnels before though the problems were a little different i know itll be a rough fortyeight hours for me but well have to try itthere isnt any alternative wrong cochenour said he patted dorries rump solid muscle that girl is she isnt big but shes healthy takes after her grandmother dont argue walthers just think a little bit ill fly the airbody shell stick around to help you the job is as safe for dorrie as it is for you and with two of you to spell each other theres a chance you might make it before you pass out from heat prostration whats the chance by yourself any chance at all i didnt answer the last part for some reason his attitude put me in a bad temper you talk as though she didnt have anything to say about it well dorrie said sweetly enough come to that so do you audee boyce is right i appreciate your being all gallant and trying to make things easy for me but honestly i think youll need me ive learned a lot and if you want the truth you look a lot worse than i do i said with all the contemptuous command i could get into my voice forget it were going to do it my way you can both help me for an hour or so while i get set up then youre on your way no arguments lets get going well that made two mistakes the first was that we didnt get set up in an hour it took more than two and i was sweatingsick oily sweatlong before we finished i really felt bad i was past worrying about the way i felt i was only a little surprised and kind of grateful every time i noticed that my heart was still beating dorrie was as strong and willing as promised she did more of the muscle work than i did firing up the igloo and setting the equipment in place and cochenour checked over the instruments and made sure he knew what he had to do to make the airbody fly he flatly rejected the notion of going back to the spindle though he said he didnt want to risk the extra time when he could just as easily set down for twentyfour hours a few hundred kilometers away then i took two cups of strong coffee heavily laced with my private supply of gin smoked my last cigarette for a while and put in a call to the military reservation amanda littleknees was flirtatious but a little puzzled when i told her we were departing the vicinity no fixed destination but she didnt argue then dorrie and i tumbled out of the lock and closed it behind us leaving cochenour strapped in the drivers seat that was the other mistake i had made in spite of everything i had said we did it cochenours way after all i never agreed to it it just happened that way under the ashy sky dorrie just stood there for a moment looking forlorn but then she grabbed my hand and the two of us swam through the thick turbulent air toward the shelter of our last igloo she had remembered my coaching about the importance of staying out of the jet exhaust inside she flung herself flat and didnt move i was less cautious i couldnt help myself i had to see so as soon as i could judge from the flare that the jets were angled away from us i stuck my head up and watched cochenour take off in a sleet of ash it wasnt a bad takeoff in circumstances like that i define bad as total demolition of the airbody and the death or maiming of one or more persons he avoided that but as soon as he was out of the slight shelter of the arroyo the gusts caught him and the airbody skittered and slid wildly it was going to be a rough ride for him going just the few hundred kilometers north that would take him out of detection range i touched dorrie with my toe and she struggled to her feet i slipped the talk cord into the jack on her helmetradio was out because of possible eavesdropping from the perimeter patrols that we wouldnt be able to see have you changed your mind yet i asked it was a fairly obnoxious question but she took it nicely she giggled i could tell that because we were faceplate to faceplate and i could see her face shadowed inside the helmet but i couldnt hear what she was saying until she remembered to nudge her voice switch and then what i heard was romantic just the two of us well we didnt have time for that kind of chitchat i said irritably lets quit wasting time remember what i told you we have air water and power for fortyeight hours and thats it dont count on any margin the water might last a little longer than the others but you need the other two things to stay alive try not to work too hard the less you metabolize the less your wastedisposal system has to handle if we find a tunnel and get in maybe we can eat some of those emergency rations over thereprovided the tun nels unbreached and hasnt heated up too much in the last couple hundred thousand years otherwise dont even think about food as to sleeping forget it maybe while the drills are going we can catch a couple of naps but now whos wasting time youve told me all this stuff before but her voice was still cheery so we climbed into the igloo and started work the first thing we had to do was to clear out some of the tailings that had already begun to accumulate where wed left the drill going the usual way of course is to reverse and redirect the augers we couldnt waste drilling time that way it would have meant taking them away from cutting the shaft we had to do it the hard way namely manually it was hard all right heatsuits are uncomfortable to begin with when you have to work in them theyre miserable when the work is both hard physically and complicated by the cramped space inside an igloo that already contains two people and a working drill its next to impossible we did it anyway cochenour hadnt lied to me about dorrie she was as good a partner as any man id ever had the big question before us was whether that was going to be good enough because there was another question which was bothering me more and more every minute and that was whether i was still as good as a man lord knew i wasnt feeling good the headache was really pounding at me and when i moved suddenly i found myself close to blacking out it all seemed suspiciously like the prognosis theyd given me at the quackery to be sure theyd promised me three weeks before acute hepatic failure but that hadnt been meant to include this sort of bonebreaking work i had to figure that i was on plus time already that was a disconcerting way to figure especially when the first ten hours went by and i realized that our shaft was down lower than the soundings had shown the tunnel to be and no luminous blue tailings had come in sight we were drilling a dry hole now if we had had plenty of time and the airbody close by this would have been no more than an annoyance maybe a really big annoyance sure but nothing like a disaster all it would have meant was that id get back into the airbody clean up get a good nights sleep eat a meal and recheck the trace probably we were just digging in the wrong spot all right next step would be to dig in the right one study the terrain pick a spot ignite another igloo start up the drills and try try again thats what we would have done but we didnt have any of those advantages we didnt have the airbody we had no chance for food or a decent sleep we were out of igloos we didnt have the trace to look atand time was running out on us and i was feeling lousier every minute i crawled out of the igloo sat down in the next thing there was to the lee of the wind and stared up at the scudding yellowgreen sky there ought to be something to do if i could only think what it was i ordered myself to think lets see i said to myself could i maybe uproot the igloo and move it to another spot no that was a nogo i could break the igloo loose with the augers but the minute it was free the winds would catch it arid it would be goodbye charlie id never see that igloo again plus there would be no way to make it gastight anyway well then how about drilling without an igloo possible i judged pointless though suppose we did hit lucky and hole in without a sealed igloo to lock out those ninety thousand millibars of hot destructive air wed destroy anything fragile inside before we got a look at it i felt a nudge on my shoulder and discovered that dorrie was sitting next to me she didnt ask any questions didnt try to say anything at all i guess it was all clear enough without talking about it by my suit chronometer thirteen hours were gone that left thirtysome before cochenour would come back to get us i didnt see any point in spending it all sitting there but on the other hand i didnt see any point in doing anything else of course i thought i could always go to sleep for a while and then i woke up and realized that that was what i had been doing dorrie was curled up beside me also asleep you may wonder how a person can sleep in the teeth of a south polar thermal gale it isnt all that hard all it takes is that you be wholly worn out and wholly despairing sleeping isnt just to knit that old raveled sleave it is a good way to shut the world off when the world is too lousy to face as ours was but venus may be the last refuge of the puritan ethic on venus you work the ones who dont feel that way get selected out early because they dont survive it was crazy of course in any logical estimate i knew i was as good as dead but i felt i had to be doing something i eased away from dorrie making sure her suit was belted to the holdtight ring at the base of the igloo and stood up it took a great deal of concentration for me to be able to star d up that was all right it was almost as good as sleeping at keeping thoughts of the world out it occurred to mei admit that even then it seemed like no more than an outside possibilitythat something good had happened while dorrie and i were asleep something likeoh lets say oh maybe that there still might be eight or ten live heechee in the tunnel and maybe theyd heard us knocking and opened up the bottom of the shaft for us so i crawled into the igloo to see if they had nope they hadnt i peered down the shaft to make sure but it was still just a blind hole that disappeared into dirty dark at the end of the light from my head lamp i swore at the inhospitable heecheefor being nonexistent i guessand kicked some tailings down the hole onto their absent heads the puritan ethic was itching at me somewhere i wondered what i ought to be doing i couldnt think of too many choices die well sure but i was well on my way to doing that as fast as i could wasnt there something constructive the puritan ethic reminded me that you always ought to leave a place the way you found it so i hauled the drills up on the eighttoone winch and left them hanging neatly while i kicked some more tailings down the useless hole when i had made enough space for a place to sit i sat down and thought things over i mused about what we had done wrongnot with a view toward doing it right you see but more like an old chess puzzle how had we missed finding a tunnel after some time of cloudy cogitation i thought i knew the answer to that it had to do with what an autosonic trace was like people like dorrie and cochenour have the idea that a seismic trace is like one of those underground maps of downtown dallas that shows all the sewers and utility conduits and water pipes and subways marked so if you need to get into one of them you can just dig down where it says and youll find what you want right there it isnt exactly like that the trace is more probabilistic it comes out as a sort of hazy approximation it is built up minute by minute by the echoes from the pinger it looks like a band of spiderweb shadows much wider than any actual tunnel would be and very fuzzy at the edges when you look at the trace you know that the best its telling you is that theres something that makes the shadows maybe its a rock interface or a pocket of gravel hopefully its a heechee dig whatever it is its there somewhere but you dont know just where exactly if a tunnel is ten meters wide which is fair average for a heechee connecting link the shadow trace is sure to look like fifty and may appear to be a hundred so where do you dig thats where the art of prospecting comes in you have to make an informed guess maybe you dig in the exact geometrical centeras it is given you to see where the center is thats the easiest way or maybe you dig where the shadows are densest which is the way the most experienced prospectors do that works as well as anything else but thats not good enough for smart skilled old audee walthers i do it my own way what i do i try to think like a heechee i look at the trace as a whole and try to see what points the heechee might have been trying to connect then i plot an imaginary course between them where i would have put the tunnel if id been the heechee engineer in charge and i dig where i would have planted the thing in the first place thats what i had done evidently i had done it wrong of course there was one good way i could have gone wrong the trace could have been a pocket of gravel that was a really good possible explanation but not a useful one if there had never been a tunnel there in the first place we were just all out of luck what i wanted was a more hopeful answer and in a fuzzybrained sort of way i began to think i saw one i visualized the way the trace had looked on the scope i had set the airbody down as close to that as i could manage then of course i couldnt dig right there because the airbody was on top of it so id set the igloo up a few meters upslope i began to believe that those few meters were what made us miss that fuzzy conjecture pleased my fuzzy brain it explained everything it was admirable of me i told myself to figure it all out in my present state of course i couldnt see that it made any practical difference if id had another igloo i would have been glad to move back to where the airbody had been and try again assuming i could live long enough to get all that done but that didnt mean much because i didnt have another igloo so i sat on the edge of the dark shaft nodding approvingly to myself over the intelligent way i had thought the problem through dangling my legs and now and then sweeping some tailings back in i think all that was part of some kind of death wish because i know that i thought every once in a while that the nicest thing for me to do just then would be to jump in and pull the tailings down over me but the puritan ethic didnt want me to do that anyway i would have only solved my own personal problem that way it wouldnt have done a thing for young dorotha keefer snoring away outside in the thermal gale i worried about dorotha keefer i wanted something better for her than a life of chancy sordid scrounging in the spindle she was too sweet and kind and it struck me as a revelation that one of the reasons for my hostility to boyce cochenour had been that he had dorrie keefer and i didnt that was kind of interesting to think about too suppose i thought tasting the bad flavors inside my mouth and feeling my head begin to poundsuppose cochenours suit had ruptured when the drill fell on him and he had died right there suppose wed then found the tunnel and it was all we wanted from it and we went back to the spindle and got rich and dorrie and i had i spent a lot of time thinking about what dorrie and i might have done if things had gone just a little different way and all that had happened to be true but they hadnt and it wasnt i kicked some more scraps down into the shaft the tunnel i was now pretty well convinced couldnt be more than a few meters away from where that shaft had bottomed out empty i thought of climbing down into it and scraping away with my gloves it seemed like a good idea at the time im not sure how much of what i was thinking was plain daydreamy whimsy and how much the bizarre delusions of a very sick man i kept thinking strange things i thought how nice it would be if there were heechee still in there and when i climbed down to scratch my way to the tunnel i could just knock on the first blue wall material i came to and theyd open it up and let me in that would have been very nice i even had a picture of what they were going to look like sort of friendly and godlike maybe they would wear togas and offer me scented wines and rare fruits maybe they could even speak english so i could talk to them and ask some of the questions that were on my mind heechee what did you really use the prayer fans for i could ask him or listen heechee i hate to be a nuisance but do you have anything in your medicine chest that will keep me from dying or heechee im sorry we messed up your front yard and ill try to clean it up for you maybe it was that last thought that made me push more of the tailings back into the shaft i didnt have anything better to do and who could tell maybe theyd appreciate it after a while i had it more than half full and id run out of tailings except for the ones that were pushed outside the igloo i didnt have the strength to go after them i looked for something else to do i reset the augers replaced the dull blades with the last sharp ones we had pointed them in the general direction of a twentydegree offset angle downslope and turned them on it wasnt until i noticed that dorrie was standing next to me helping me steady the augers for the first meter or two of cut that i realized i had made a plan i didnt remember it i didnt even remember when dorrie had wakened and come into the igloo it probably wasnt a bad plan i thought why not try an offset cut did we have any better way to spend our time we did not we cut when the drills stopped bucking in our hands and settled down to chew through the rock and we could leave them i cleared a space at the side of the igloo and shoved tailings out for a while then we just sat there watching the drills spit rock chips out of the new hole we didnt speak presently i fell asleep again i didnt wake up until dorrie pounded on my helmet we were buried in tailings they glowed blue so bright they almost hurt my eyes the augers must have been scratching at the heechee wall material for an hour or more they had actually worn pits into it when we looked down we could see the round bright blue eye of the tunnel staring up at us she was a beauty all right we didnt speak somehow i managed to kick and wriggle my way through the drift to the crawlthrough i got the lock closed and sealed after kicking a couple of cubic meters of rock outside then i began fumbling through the pile of refuse for the flame drills ultimately i found them somehow ultimately i managed to get them shipped and primed we ducked back out of range as i fired them i watched the bright spot of light that bounced out of the shaft make a pattern on the roof of the igloo then there was a sudden short scream of gas and a clatter as the loose fragments at the bottom of the shaft dropped free we had cut into the heechee tunnel it was unbreached and waiting for us our beauty was a virgin we took her maidenhead with all love and reverence and entered into her xii i must have blacked out again because when i realized where i was i was on the floor of the tunnel my helmet was open so were the sidezips of my heatsuit i was breathing stale foul air that had to be a quarter of a million years old and smelled every minute of it but it was air it was denser than earthnormal and a lot less humid but the partial pressure of oxygen was close enough to the same i was proving that by the fact that i had been breathing it without dying next to me on the floor was dorrie keefer her helmet was open too the blue heechee wall light didnt flatter her complexion so she looked about as ghastly as a pretty girl can at first i wasnt sure she was breathing but in spite of the way she looked her pulse was going her lungs were functioning and when she felt me poking at her she opened her eyes god im beat she said but we made it i didnt say anything shed said it all for both of us we sat there grinning foolishly at each other looking like halloween masks in the blue heechee glow that was about all i was able to do just then i was feeling very lightheaded i had my hands full just comprehending the fact that i was alive i didnt want to endanger that oddsagainst precarious fact by moving around i wasnt comfortable though and after a moment i realized that i was very hot i closed up my helmet to shut out some of the heat but the smell inside was so bad that i opened it again figuring that the heat was better it then occurred to me to wonder why the heat was only unpleasant instead of instantly incineratingly fatal energy transport through a heechee wallmaterial surface is slow but not hundreds of thousands of years slow my sad sick old brain ruminated that thought around for a while and finally staggered to a conclusion at least until quite recently maybe some centuries or thousands of years at most this tunnel had been kept artificially cool so i told myself sagely there had to be some sort of automatic machinery wow i said to myself that ought to be worth finding all by itself broken down or not it could be the kind of thing fortunes are built on and that made me remember why we had come there in the first place i looked up the corridor and down hungry for the first site of the heechee loot that might make us all well again when i was a schoolkid in amarillo central my favorite teacher was a crippled lady named miss stevenson she used to tell us stories out of bulfinch and homer miss stevenson spoiled one whole weekend for me with the sad story of one greek fellow whose biggest ambition was to become a god i gathered that was a fairly ordinary goal for a bright young greek in those days though im not sure how often they made it this man started out with a few big steps up the ladderhe was already a king of a little place in lydiabut he wanted more he wanted divinity the gods even let him come to olympus and it looked as though he had it made until he fouled up i dont remember the details of what he did wrong except that it had something to do with a dog and some nasty trick he played on one of the gods by getting him to eat his own son those greeks had pretty primitive ideas of humor i guess whatever it was they punished him for it what he got was solitary confinementfor eternityand he served it standing neck deep in a cool lake in hell but unable to drink every time he opened his lips the water pulled away the fellows name was tantalus and in that heechee tunnel i thought i had a lot in common with him we found the treasure trove we were looking for all right but we couldnt reach it it seemed that what we had dug into wasnt the main tunnel after all it was a sort of rightangled thiellytube detour in the tunnel and it was blocked at both ends what do you suppose it is dorrie asked wistfully trying to peer through the gaps in the tenton slabs of heechee metal before us do you suppose it could be that weapon you were talking about i blinked my fuzzy eyes there were machines of all kinds there and irregular mounds of things that might have been containers for other things and some objects that seemed to have rotted and spilled their contents also rotted on the floor but we hadnt the strength to get at them i stood there with my helmet pressed against the side of one of the slabs feeling like alice peering into her tiny garden without the bottle of drinkme all i know for sure i said is that whatever it is theres more of it there than anybody ever found before and i slumped to the floor exhausted and sick and all the same feeling very contented with the world dorrie sat down next to me in front of that barred gate to eden and we rested for a moment gram wouldve been pleased she murmured oh sure i agreed feeling a little drunk gram my grandmother she explained and then maybe i blacked out again when i heard what she was saying again she was talking about how her grandmother had refused to marry cochenour long and long ago it seemed to matter to dorotha keefer so i tried politely to pay attention but some of it didnt make a lot of sense wait a minute i said she didnt want him because he was poor no no not because he was poor although he was that because he was going off to the oi fields and she wanted somebody steadier like my grandfather and then when boyce came by a year ago he gave you a job i said nodding to show i was following as his girlfriend no damn it she said annoyed with me in his office the other part came later we fell in love oh right i said i wasnt looking for an argument she said stiffly hes really a sweet man audee outside of business i mean and he wouldve done anything for me he couldve married you i pointed out just to keep the conversation going no audee she said seriously he couldnt he wanted to get married i was the one who said no she turned down all that money i blinked at her i didnt have to ask the question she knew what it was when i marry she said i want kids and boyce wouldnt hear of it he said if id caught him when he was a lot younger maybe seventyfive or eighty he mightve taken a chance but now he was just too old to be raising a family then you ought to be looking around for a replacement shouldnt you she looked at me in that blue glow he needs me she said simply now more than ever i mulled that over for a while then it occurred to me to check the time it was nearly fortysix hours since he had left us he was due back any time and if he came back while we were doddering around in here i realized foggily bit by bitthen ninety thousand millibars of poison gas would hammer in on us it would kill us if we had our suits open besides that it would damage our virgin tunnel the corrosive scouring of that implosion of gas might easily wreck all those lovely things behind the barrier we have to go back i told dorrie showing her the time she smiled temporarily she said and we got up took a last lodk at those treasures of tantalus behind the bars and started back to our shaft to the igloo after the cheerful blue glow of the heechee tunnel the igloo was more cramped and miserable than ever before what was worse was that my cloudy brain nagged me into remembering that we shouldnt even stay inside it cochenour might remember to lock in and out of both ends of the crawlthrough wh he got thereany minute nowbut he also might not couldnt take the chance on letting the hot hammer of air in on our p retti cs i tried to think of a way of plugging the shaft maybe by pushing all the tailings back in again but although my brain wasnt working very well i could see that that was stupid so the only way to solve that problem was for us to wait outside in the breezy venusian weather the one consolation was that it wouldnt be too much longer to wait the other part of that was that we werent equipped for a very long wait the little watch dial next to our lifesupport meters all running well into the warning red now showed that cochenour should in fact have arrived by now he wasnt there though i squeezed into the crawlthrough with dorrie locked us both through and we waited i felt a scratching on my helmet and discovered dorrie was plugging into my jack audee im really very tired she told me it didnt sound like a complaint only a factual report of something she thought i probably should know about you might as well go to sleep i told her ill keep watch cochenour will be here pretty soon and ill wake you up i suppose she took my advice because she lowered herself down pausing to let me take her talk line out of my helmet jack then she stretched out next to the tiedown clips and left me to think in peace i wasnt grateful i wasnt enjoying what i was beginning to think still cochenour didnt come i tried to think through the significance of that of course there could have been lots of reasons for a delay he couldve gotten lost he could have been challenged by the military he could have crashed the airbody but there was a much nastier possibility and it seemed to make more sense than all of them the time dial told me he was nearly five hours late and the lifesupport meters told me that we were right up against the empty line for power near it for air and well past it for water if we hadnt had the remaining tunnel gases to breathe for a few hours saving the air in our tanks we would have been dead by now cochenour couldnt have known that we would find breathable air in the heechee tunnel he must believe that we were dead the man hadnt lied about himself he had told me he was a bad loser so he had decided not to lose in spite of my fuzzy brain i could understand what had gone on in his when push came to shove the bastard in him won out he had worked out an endgame maneuver that would pull a win out of all his defeats i could visualize him as clearly as though i were in the airbody with him watching his clocks as our lives ticked away cooking himself an elegant little lunch playing the rest of the tchaikovsky ballet music maybe while he waited for us to get through dying it wasnt a really frightening thought to me i was close enough to being dead anyway for the difference to be pretty much of a technicality and tired enough of being trapped in that foul heatsuit to accept almost any deliverance even the final one but i wasnt the only person affected here the girl was also involved the one tiny little rational tho ight that stayed in my halfpoisoned brain was that it was just unfair for cochenour to let us both die me yes all right i could see that from his point of view i was easily expendable her no i realized i ought to do something and after considering what that might be for a while i beat on her suit until she moved a little after some talk through the phone jacks i managed to make her understand she had to go back down into the tunnel where at least she could breathe then i got ready for cochenours return there were two things he didnt know he didnt know wed found any breathable air and he didnt know we could tap the drill batteries for additional power in all the freakedout fury of my head i was still capable of that much consecutive thought i could surprise himif he didnt stay away too much longer anyway i could stay alive for a few hours yet and then when he came to find us dead and see what prize we had won for him he would find me waiting and so he did it must have been a terrible shock to him when he entered the crawlthrough to the igloo with the monkey wrench in his hand leaned over me and found i was still alive and able to move when he had expected only a welldone roast of meat if i had had any doubt about his intentions it was resolved when he swung immediately at my helmet age busted leg and surprise didnt slow his reflexes a bit but he had to change position to get a good swing in the cramped space inside the crawlthrough and being not only alive but pretty nearly conscious i managed to roll away in time and i already had the drill ready to go in my arms the drill caught him right in the chest i couldnt see his face but i can guess at his expression after that it was only a matter of doing five or six impossible things at once things like getting dorrie up out of the tunnel and into the airbody like getting myself in after her and sealing up and setting a course all those impossible things and one more that was harder than any of them but very important to me dorrie didnt know why i insisted on bringing cochenours body back i think she thought it was a kind gesture of reverence to the dead on my part but i didnt straighten her out just then i just about totaled the airbody when we landed but we were suited up and strapped in and when the ground crews came out from the spindle to investigate dorrie and i were still alive xiii they had to patch me and rehydrate me for three days before they could even think about putting my new liver in it was a wonder it had survived its ordeal but theyd whipped it out and put it on nutrient pumps as soon as they got their hands on it by the time it was ready to be transplanted into me it had had its allergenic nature tamed and was as good as any liver ever wasgood enough anyway to keep me alive they kept me sedated most of the time the quacks woke me up every couple of hours to give me another bout of feedback training on how to monitor my hepatic flowsthey said there was no point giving me a new liver if i didnt know how to use itand other people kept waking me up to ask me questions but it was all dreamlike i didnt much want to be awake just then being awake was all sickness and pain and nagging and i could have wished for the old days back againwhen they just would have knocked me out with anesthesia until they were throughexcept of course that in the old days i would have died but by the fourth day i hardly hurt at allwell except when i moved and they were letting me take my fluids by mouth instead of the other way i realized i was going to be alive for a while that was very good news and once i believed it i began to take more interest in what was going on the quackery was in its spring mood which i appreciated of course theres no such thing as a season in the spindle but the quacks get all sentimental about tradition and ties with the mother planet so they create seasons for themselves the current one was made by scenes of fleecy white clouds playing across the wall panels and the air from the ventilator ducts smelled of lilac and green leaves happy spring i said to dr morius while he was examining me shut up he said to me he shifted a couple of the needles that pincushioned my abdomen watching the readings on the telltales urn he muttered im glad you think so i said he disregarded my remark dr morius doesnt like humorous conversation unless it comes from him he pursed his lips and pulled out a couple of the needles well lets see waithers weve taken out the splenovenal shunt your new liver is functioning wellno sign of rejectionbut youre not flushing wastes through as fast as you ought to youll have to work on that weve got your ion levels back up to something like a human being and most of your tissues have a little moisture in them again altogether he said scratching his head in thought yes in general i would say youre alive so i think probably the operation was a success thats very witty i said youve got some people waiting for you he went on vastras third and your lady friend they brought you some clothes that interested me does that mean im getting out i asked like right now he told me theyll have to keep you in bed awhile but your rents run out we need the space for paying customers now one of the advantages of having clean blood in my brains instead of the poisonous soup it had been living on was that i could begin to think reasonably clearly so i knew right away that good old comical dr morius was making another of his little jokes paying customers i wouldnt have been there if i hadnt been a paying patient though i couldnt imagine what my bills were being paid with i was willing to keep my curiosity in check until i was outside the quackery that didnt take long the quacks packed me in wetsheets and dorrie and the third of vastras house rolled me through the spindle to sub vastras place dorrie was pale and tired stillthe last couple of weeks hadnt been much of a vacation for either of us but needing nothing more than a little rest she said subs first had kicked some of the kids out of a cubicle and cleared it out for us and his third fussed over both of us feeding us up on lamb broth and that flat hard bread they like before tucking us in for a good long rest there was only the one bed but dorrie didnt seem to mind anyway at that point the question was academic later on not so academic after a couple of days of that i was on my feet and as good as i ever was by then i found out who had paid my bill at the quackery for about a minute i had hoped it was mequickly filthy rich from the priceless spoils of our tunnelbut i knew that was an illusion the tunnel had been right on the military reservation nobody was ever going to own anything in it but the military if wed been hale and hearty we could have gotten around that with a little inventive lying we could have carted some of the things off to another tunnel and declared them and almost certainly we would have gotten away with it but not the way we were wed been a lot too near dead to conceal anything so the military had taken it all still theyd showed something i never had suspected they did have a kind of a heart atrophied and flinty yes but a heart theyd gone into the dig while i was still getting glucose enemas in my sleep and theyd been pleased with what theyd found they decided to pay me a kind of finders fee not much to be sure but enough to save my life enough to meet the quackerys bill for ll their carpentry on me and even enough left over to put some in the bank and pay the back rent on my own place so dorrie and i could move in when vastras house decided we were well enough to be on our own of course they hadnt had to pay for the transplant liver itself that hadnt cost anything at all for a while it bothered me that the military wouldnt say what theyd found i did my best to find out i even tried to get sergeant littleknees drunk so i could worm it out of her when she came to the spindle on furlough that didnt work dorrie was right there and how drunk can you get one girl when another girl is right there watching you probably amanda littleknees didnt know anyhow probably nobody did except a few specialists but it had to be something big because of the cash award and most of all because they didnt prosecute us for trespassing on the military reservation and so we get along all right the two of us or the three of us dorrie turned out to be really good at selling imitation prayer fans and firepearls to the terry tourists especially when her pregnancy began to show we were both kind of celebrities of course she kept us in eating money until the high season started and by then i had found out that my status as a famous tunnel discoverer was worth something so i parlayed it into a cash loan and a new airbody were doing pretty well for tunnelrats ive promised ill marry her if our kid turns out to be a boy but as a matter of fact im going to do it anyway she was a great help at the dig especially with my own private project dorrie couldnt have known just what i wanted to bring cochenours body back for she didnt argue though sick and wretched as she was she helped me get the cadaver into the airbody lock for the return to the spindle actually i wanted that body very muchone piece of it anyway its not really a new liver of course probably its not even secondhand heaven knows where cochenour bought it but im sure it wasnt his original equipment but it works and bastard though he was i kind of liked him in a way and i dont mind at all the fact that ive got a part of him with me always the greatest treasure the heechee tunnels on venus had to offer had already been discovered though the first discoverers didnt know it no one else knew eitherat least no one except a solitary tunnelrat named sylvester macklin and he was not in a position to tell anybody what he had found sylvester macklin had discovered a heechee spaceship if macklin had reported his find he would have become the richest man in the solar system he also would have lived to enjoy his wealth but sylvester macklin was as crotchety a loner as any other tunnelrat and he did something quite different he saw that the ship looked to be in good condition maybe he thought he could even fly it unfortunately for himself he succeeded macklins ship did exactly what any heechee ship was designed to do and the heechee were marvelously great designers no one knows exactly what processes of thought and experiment and deduction macklin went through when he blundered onto the wonderful find he didnt survive to tell anyone still obviously at some point he must have gotten into the ship and closed its hatch and begun poking and prodding at the things that looked as though they ought to be its controls as people later well learned on the board of every heechee ship is a thing shaped like a cows teat it is the thing that makes the ship go when it is squeezed it is like slipping an automaticshift car into drive the ship moves out where it goes to depends on what course was set into its automatic navigation systems mackim didnt do anything about setting any particular cour и naturally he didnt know how so the ship did what its heechee designers had programmed it to do in such an event it simply returned to the place it had come from when its heechee pilot had left it half a million years ago as it happened that place was an asteroid it was an odd asteroid in several respects astronomically it was odd because its orbit was at right angles to the ecliptic for that reason although it was a fairsized chunk of rock and not far from earths own orbit at times it had never been discovered by human astronomers the other odd thing about it was that it had been converted into a sort of parking garage for heechee spacecraft in total there were nearly a thousand of the ships there what there was not any of anywhere on the asteroid was anything to eat or drink so sylvester mackim who could have been the richest man in history wound up as just one more starvedtodeath corpse but before he died macklin managed to get off a signal to earth it wasnt a call for help no one could reach him in time to save his life mackim knew that he accepted the fact that he would die he just wanted people to know in what an unsuspected marvel of a place he was dying and after a while other astronauts flying the clumsy human rockets of the time came to investigate what they found was the gateway to the universe within the next decade the gateway asteroid had become the center of mankinds most profitable industry the exploration of the galaxy macklin didnt own the gateway asteroid of course in spite of the fact that he had discovered it his luck wasnt that good he didnt own anything being dead anyway it soon became obvious that gateway was much too important to be owned by any individual or even by any single nation the united nations fought over the question for years in security council and general assemblyand more than once almost with guns and aircraft outside the un itself what the world powers wound up with was the gateway corporation a fivepower consortium that was set up to control it the gateway asteroid was not a very congenial place for people to liveof course it had never been designed for human people it had been designed for the heechee and they had stripped it bare before they left it was a chunk of rock the size of manhattan laced through and through with tunnels and chambers and not much else the thing wasnt even round one gateway prospector described it as shaped more or less like a badly planned pear that the birds had been pecking at its internal structure resembled the layers of an onion the outer shell was where the heechee ships were docked their lander ports snuggled into hatch chambers then inside there were layers with great open spaces which the humans used for storing supplies and parts and for the large water reservoir they called lake superior closer to the center were the residential tunnels lined with small rooms like monastery cells where the humans lived while they waited for their ships in the heart of the asteroid was a spindleshaped cavern the heechee seemed to like spindleshaped spaces though no one knew why gateways tenants used this one for a meeting placeand drinking place and gambling place and a place to try to forget what lay ahead of them gateway didnt smell good air was precious it didnt feel good either at least not to fresh prospectors just up from earth the asteroid had a slow spin so there was a sort of microgravity but there wasnt much of it anyone who made a sudden move anywhere in gateway was likely to find himself floating away of course no one ever looked at the gateway asteroid as a resort paradise there was only one reason why any human being would be willing to put up with its expense its inaccessibility its discomforts and its stink and the reason was the heechee spaceships flying a heechee spaceship took a lot of courage and not much else each ship was like every other ship in its class the biggest of them the fives were not very bigabout the same volume of space as a hotel bathroom and that to be shared by five people the ships called the ones were not much bigger than the bathtub itself each ship contained a minimum of fittings and most of the fittings were of unknown importance there was always a golden coil that seemed to have something to do with the ships drive because it was observed to change color at start finish and turnaround of each trip there was always a diamondshaped golden box about the size of a coffin too in a few of the ships there was an even more mysterious device that looked like a twisted rod of crystal in a black ebon base it didnt seem to do anything at all no one knew exactly what was inside any of those things because whenever anyone tried to open one it exploded and then there was the control system with a curious painful forked bench to sit on before it knurled knobs flashing lights the goteatthey were what made the ship go of course the ships lacked a great many things that human beings really didnt want to get along without the people who ultimately flew them had some human furnishings added like freezers more comfortable seats bunks cooking toolsand a whole catalogue of cameras radio antennae and scientific instruments of all kinds there was nothing hard about flying a heechee ship anybody could learn as much as anybody else knew in half an hour you fiddled around with the coursesetting wheels pretty much at random because no one knew what the settings meant actually there were some separate destinations preprogrammed into the operable ships on the asteroidthere were about another ships that simply didnt work at all but it took a lot of time and a lot of lives to find out what some of those destinations were then when you had set up some combination you squeezed the goteat after that you were on your way that was all there was to it for that reason anybody could become a prospector anybody that is who was willing to pay his way to gateway and then to jay the steep charges for air food water and living space while he was in the asteroid and who was brave enough or desperate enough to take his chances on a highly likely and often very nasty death over the years a great many human beings escaped from their earthside poverty to take their chances in a gateway ship first and last there were of these goldrush gamblers in those chancy years before exact navigation of a heechee ship became possible and the random exploration program was discontinued quite a few of the prospectors survived many became famous a few became vastly rich and no one remembers the others when one of those bold faintly crazy early prospectors set out in a heechee spacecraft he didnt expect the ship to go exactly where he wanted it to go he could never coun on that for many reasons not least because none of those early prospectors had any idea what destinations were worth aiming for but that ignorance carried no penalty anyway since no gateway prospector knew how to navigate a heechee ship the first ships followed whatever destination settings had been left on the board by the last longago heechee pilot considering the risks it was a good thing for those early gateway prospectors that the heechee had been so much like human beings in important ways for instance the heechee had possessed the primatehuman itch of curiosityin fact they had a lot of it that meant that a lot of the preprogrammed destinations were to places that human beings also found interesting to look at they were just as interesting to human beings as they had been to the old heechee and the particular branch of the human race that delighted most in what the first waves of gateway explorers found was the astronomers those astronomical people had become very ingenious at teasing information from whatever photons landed in their instrumentswhether those photons were visible light xrays infrared whatever but photons couldnt tell them everything they wanted to know the human astronomers sighed over their knowledge that there was such a lot of stuff out there that didnt radiate at allblack holes planets heaven knew what they could only guess at such things now with the heechee spacecraft someone could go out and see them firsthand that was a pretty wonderful break for astronomers although often enough it turned out to be a lot less wonderful for the men and women who went out to look the trouble with astronomy from the point of view of the prospector who had just risked his life on a shotinthedark voyage on a heechee ship was that you couldnt sell a neutron star what the prospectors were after was money that meant that if they were lucky they might find some kind of hightech heechee gadgets that could be brought back and studied and copied and made into fortunes there wasnt any commercial market for a supernova shell or an interstellar gas cloud those things just didnt pay the bills to deal with that problem the gateway corporation started a program of paying science bonuses to the explorers who came back with great pictures and instrument readings but nothing commercial to sell that was virtuous of the gateway corporation to pay off for pure noncommercial knowledge it was also a good way of coaxing more hungry humans into those scary and often deadly little ships by the time the gateway corporation had been in operation for two full years more than one hundred trips had set out and sixtytwo of them had returned more or less safely the ships had visited at least forty different starsall kinds of stars baby bluewhite giants immense and shortlived like regulus and spica and altair yellow normalsequence stars like procyon a and their dwarf counterparts like procyon b staid gtype stars like the sun and their giant yellow relatives like capella the red giants of the types of aldebran and arcturus and their supergiant counterparts like betelgeuse and antares and their tiny reddwarf relatives like proxima centauri and wolf the astronomers were thrilled every trips harvest triumphantly supported much of what they thought they had known about the birth and death of starsand demanded quick revisions of much else that they thought they had known but hadnt the masters of the corporation were less delighted it was all very well to expand the horizons of astronomical science but the pictures of the twentieth white dwarf looked pretty much like the pictures of the first the hungry billions of earth could not be fed on astronomical photographs they already had a number of astronomical observatories in orbit they werent pleased to see their onceinalifetime treasure trove turned into just one more of them but even the corporation had to be pleased at some of the things the prospectors brought back mission pulsar the first big science bonus was paid to a man named chou yengbo and he might not have earned it if he hadnt happened to have taken a few elementary science courses before he discovered that even a college degree couldnt get you a decent job those days in shensi province when chous ship came out of the fasterthanlight drive chou had no trouble figuring out which objects the heechee had set the controls for actually there were three objects in view they were weird the first was wholly unlike anything chou had ever seen before even in the holograms of his astronomy course it wasnt quite like anything any other human being had e er seen before either except in imagination the object was an irregular coneshaped splash of light and even on the viewscreen its colors hurt his eyes what the thing looked like was a searchlight beam fanning out through patches of mist when chou looked more carefully magnifying the image he saw that there was another beam like it sketchier and fainter and fanning out in the opposite direction and between the two points of the cones formed by those beams the third object was something almost too tiny to see when he put the magnification up to max he saw that that something was a punylooking unhealthily colored little star it was much too small to be a normal star that limited the possibilities even so it took chou some time to realize that he was in the presence of a pulsar then those astronomy lessons came back to him it was subrahmanyan chandrasekhar back in the middle of the twentieth century who had calculated the genesis of neutron stars his model was simple a large star chandrasekhar said uses up its hydrogen fuel and then collapses it throws off most of the outer sections of itself as a supernova what is left falls in toward the stars center at almost the speed of light compressing most of the stars mass into a volume smaller than a planetsmaller in fact than some mountains this particular sort of collapse can only happen to big stars chandrasekhar calculated they had to be times as massive as earths sun at least and so that number was called chandrasekhars limit after that supernova explosion and collapse has happened the object that remainsstar heavy asteroid sizedis a neutron star it has been crushed together so violently by its own immense gravitation that the electrons of its atoms are driven into its protons creating the chargeless particles called neutrons its substance is so dense that a cubic inch of it weighs two million tons or so it is like compressing the hugest of earths old supertankers into something the size of a coin things do not leave a neutron star easily with that immense concentrated mass pulling things down to its surface escape velocity becomes something like miles a second more than that its rotational energy has been compressed too the bluewhite giant star that used to turn on its axis once a week is now a superheavy asteroidsized thing that whirls around many times a second chou knew there were observations that he had to make magnetic xray infrared and many others the magnetometer readings were the most important neutron stars have superfluid cores and so as they rotate they generate intense magnetic fieldsjust like the earth not really just like the earth though because the neutro stars magnetic field too is compressed it is one trillion times stronger than the earths and as it spins it generates radiation the radiation cant simply flow out from all parts of the star at once the lines of magnetic force confine it it can only escape at the neutron stars north and south magnetic poles the magnetic poles of any object arent necessarily in the same place as its poles of rotation so all the neutron stars radiated energy pours out in a beam around and around pointing a little or sometimes a lot away from its true rotational poles so that was the explanation of the thing chou was seeing the cones were the two polar beams from the star that lay between them north and south fanning out from its poles of course chou couldnt see the beams themselves what he saw were the places where they illuminated tenuous clouds of gas and dust as they spread out the important thing to chou was that no earthly astronomer had ever seen them that way the only way anyone on earth ever could see the beam from a neutron star was by the chance of being somewhere along the rim of the conical shape the beams described as they rotated and then what they saw was a highspeed flicker so fast and regular that the first observer to spot one thought it was the signal from an alien intelligence they called the signal an lgm until they figured out what was causing that sort of stellar behavior then they called the things pulsars chou got a fourhundredthousanddollar science bonus for what he had discovered he wasnt greedy he took it and returned to earth where he found a new career lecturing to womens clubs and college audiences on what it was like to be a heechee prospector he was a great success because he was one of the first of the breed to return to earth alive later returnees were less fortunate for instance there was mission halo in some ways mission halo was the saddest and most beautiful of all the mission had been written off as lost but that turned out to be wrong the ship wasnt lost only its crew was the ship was an unarmored three when it came back its arrival was a surprise to everyone the ship had been gone over three years it was a certainty that nobody could have survived so long a trip in fact no one had when the hatch crews on gateway got the ports open recoiling from the stench inside they discovered that jan mariekiewicz rolph stret and lech szelikowjtz had left a record of their experiences it was read with compassion by the other prospectors and with rejoicing by astronomers when we reached two hundred days without turnaround stret had written in his diary we knew we were out of luck we drew straws i won maybe i should say i lost but anyway jan and lech took their little suicide pills and i put their bodies in the freezer turnaround came finally at days i knew for sure that i wasnt going to make it either not even with only me alive in the ship so ive tried rigging everything on automatic i hope it works if the ship gets back please pass on our messages as it happened the messages the crew left never got delivered there was no one to deliver them to the messages were all ddressed to other gateway prospectors who had been part of the same shipment up from central europe and that batch wasnt one of the lucky ones every one of them had been lost in their own ships but the pictures the ship brought back belonged to the whole world strets juryrigging had worked the ship had stopped at its destination the instruments had thoroughly mapped everything in sight then the ships return had been triggered automatically while strets corpse lay bloating under the controls the record showed that their ship had been outside the milky way galaxy entirely it brought back the first pictures ever seen of our galaxy from outside it showed a couple of fairly nearby stars and one great distant globular clusterthe stars and clusters of the spherical halo that surrounds our galaxybut most of all it showed our milky way galaxy itself from core to farthest spiral wisp with its great familiar octopus arms the perseus arm the cygnus arm the sagittariuscarina arm as well as the large distant arm that earthly astronomers had never seen before they called it simply far arm at first but then it was renamed the stretmariekiewiczszelikowitz arm to honor the dead discoverers and in the center of it all was the great bellying octopusbody mass of core stars laced with gas and dust clouds showing the beginnings of the new growing spiral structures that might in another hundred million years become new arms themselves they also showed the effects of a structure more interesting still but not in enough detail to be recognized just thennot until some other events had taught human beings what to look for in the core all the same they were beautiful pictures since no one returned from mission halo alive there wasnt even a science bonus due but the gateway corporation voted a special exception to the rules five million dollars was voted for the heirs of mariekiewicz szelikowitz and stret it was a generous gesture but as it turned out a very inexpensive one the award went unclaimed like so many gateway prospectors the three who had manned the ship had no families that anyone could find and so the gateway corporations bursar quietly and philosophically returned the cash to the corporations general funds the first best and brightest hope of any exploration crew was to find a really nice planet with really nice treasures on it ultimately some of them did of course but it took a while for a good many orbits after the systematic exploration program began the crews went out and came back with nothing but pictures and hardluck storieswhen they came back at all but some of the things they had seen were wonderful volya shadchuk took a one into the heart of a planetary nebula greentinged with the radiation from oxygen atoms and collected fifty thousand dollars bill merrian saw a recurring nova system red giants gases being sucked onto a white dwarf luckily not enough matter had accreted while he was there to blow off in a noval explosion but he got the fifty thousand and ten percent more for danger bonus and then there were the grantlands there were five of the grantlandstwo brothers their wives and the eldest son of one of the couples they reached a globular clusterten thousand old stars mostly red mostly sliding toward the sunset at the lower right side of the hertzspungrussell diagram as they aged the cluster was in the galactic halo and of course the trip was a long one none of them survived the trip took days and all of them were alive at the time of arrival they took their pictures the last of them the young second wife of one of the brothers died thirtythree days into the return trip but the pictures they had taken survived the three schoen sisters were no luckier they didnt come back at all either again their ship did but thoroughly racked and scorched and of course their bodies inside were barely recognizable but they too had taken a few pictures before they died they had been in a reflection nebulaafter analysis it was determined that it was the great nebula in orion actually visible to the naked eye from earth the schoen sisters must have known they were in trouble as soon as they came out of drive because they werent really in space anymore oh it was close to a vacuumas people on earth measure a vacuumbut there were as many as three hundred atoms to the cubic centimeter hundreds of times as many as there should hav been in interstellar space still they looked around and they started their camerasjust barely they didnt have much time there are four bright young stars in the orion nebula the socalled trapezium it is in such nebulae that gas clouds fall together and are born as stars astronomers conjectured that the heechee knew this and the reason the ship had been set to go there was that heechee astronomers had been interested in studying the conditions that lead to star formation but the heechee had set that program half a million years before a lot had happened in those half million years there was now a fifth body an almost star in the orion nebula formed after the heechee had taken their last look at the area the new body was called the becklinneugebauer object it was in its early hydrogenburning stage less than a hundred thousand years old and it seemed that the schoen sisters had the bad luck to come almost inside it mission naked black hole the crew was william sakyetsu marianna morse hal mbuna richard smith and irma malatesta all of them had been out beforemalatesta had done it five timesbut luck hadnt favored any of their ventures none of them had yet made a big enough score to pay their gateway bills so for their mission they were careful to choose an armored five with a record of success the previous crew in that ship had earned a nova science bonus in it managing to come close enough to a recurring nova to get some good pictures though not so close that they didnt live through the experience they had collected a total of seven and a half million dollars in bonus money and had gone back to earth rejoicing but before they left they gave their ship a name they called it victory when sakyetsu and the others in his crew got to their destination they looked for the planetor the star or the heechee artifact or the object of any interesting sortthat might have been its target they were disappointed there wasnt anything like that to be found anywhere around there were stars in sight sure but the nearest of them was nearly eight lightyears away by all indications they had landed themselves in one of the most boringly empty regions of interstellar space in the galaxy they could not find even a nearby gas cloud they didnt give up they were experienced prospectors they spent a week checking out every possibility first they made sure they hadnt missed a nearby star with interferometry they could measure the apparent diameter of some of the brighter stars by spectral analysis they could determine their types combining the two gave them an estimate of distance their first impression had been right it was a pretty empty patch of sky they had landed in there was to be sure one really spectacular object in viewthe word marianna used was gloriousa globular cluster with thousands of bright stars interweaving their orbits in a volume a few hundred lightyears across it was certainly spectacular it dominated the sky it was much nearer to them than any such object had ever been to a human eye before but it was still at least a thousand lightyears away a globular cluster is an inspiring sight it was a long way from sakyetsu and his ship victory but by the standards of earthly astronomers that was nothing at all globular clusters live on the outer fringe of the galaxy there arent any in the crowded spiralarm regions like the neighborhood of earth there are almost none less than twenty thousand lightyears from earth and here was one a twentieth as farand thus by the law of inverse squares four hundred times as bright it was not an unusually large specimen as globular clusters go the big ones run upward of a million stars and this one was nowhere near that it was big enough to be exciting to look at all the same but it was neither big enough nor near enough for victorys instruments to reveal any more than earths own orbiting observatories with their far more powerful mirrors and optical systems had seen long ago so there was very little chance that the instruments on victory could earn them any kind of decent bonus still those instruments were all they had so the crew doggedly put them to work they photographed the cluster in red light blue light ultraviolet light and several bands of the infrared they measured its radio flux in a thousand frequencies and its gamma rays and xrays and then one sleeping period while only h tl mbuna was awake at the instruments he saw the thing that made the trip worthwhile his shout woke everybody up somethings eating the cluster marianna morse was the first to get to the screens with him but the whole crew flocked to see the fuzzy circle of the cluster wasnt a circle anymore an arc had been taken out of its lower rim it looked like a cookie a child had bitten into but it wasnt a bite as they watched they could see the differences the stars of the cluster werent disappearing they were just slowly moving out of the way ofsomething my god marianna whispered were in orbit around a black hole then they cursed the week they had wasted because they knew what that meant big money a black hole one of the rarest objects in the observable universebecause black holes are intrinsically unobservable a black hole isnt black in the sense that a dinner jacket or the ink on a piece of paper is black a black hole is a lot blacker than that no human being has ever seen real blackness because blackness is the absence of all light it cant be seen there is nothing to see the blackest dye reflects a little light a black hole reflects nothing at all if you tried to illuminate it with the brightest searchlight in the universeif you concentrated all the light of a quasar on it in a single beamyou would still see nothing the tremendous gravitational force of the black hole would suck all that light in and it would never come out again it cant it is a matter of escape velocity the escape velocity from the earth is seven miles a second from a neutron star as much as miles per second but the escape velocity from a black hole is greater than the speed of light the light doesnt fall back what happens to the light rays is that they are bent by the gravitational pull the radiation simply circles the black hole spiraling endlessly never getting free and when a black hole passes in front of say a globular cluster it doesnt hide the cluster it simply bends the clusters light around it if victorys crew had wasted seven days they still had five days worth of supplies left before they had to start back to gateway they used them all they took readings on the black hole even when they couldnt see it and when at last they got back to gateway they found that one just one of their pictures had paid off they shared a fivehundredthousanddollar bonus simply for the pictures of the globular cluster but the one picture that they hadnt even noticed when they took ita splitsecond frame taken automatically when no one happened to be watching the screen showed what happened when the black hole occluded a bright b star a few hundred lightyears away that star hadnt moved up or down by chance it had passed almost exactly behind the black hole its light had spread to surround the hole like a halo and that gave them a measure of the holes size and then long after they were back in gateway the research teams that studied their results awarded them another half a million and the information that they were very lucky marianna morse had wondered about that why had the heechee used an armored five to visit this harmless object answer it hadnt always been harmless most black holes are not safe to visit they pull in gases in accretion rings and the acceleration of the gases as they fall produces a hell of radiation once this one had but that was a long time ago now it had eaten all the gases in its neighborhood there was nothing left to fall and so generate the synchrotron flux of energy that might fry even an armored five if it lingered too long nearby and so the crew of victory without knowing it at the time had had an unexpected stroke of luck they arrived at the neighborhood of their black hole after its lethal feeding frenzy had ended and so they had come back alive in its first twenty years the gateway corporation handed out more than two hundred astronomical science bonuses for a total of nearly one billion dollars it paid off on double stars and supernova shells it paid off on at least the first examples of every type of star there was there are nine members of the catalogue of star types and they are easily remembered by the mnemonic pretty woman oh be a fine girl kiss me which runs the gamut from youngest to longestliving stars the stellar classes from a down to the dim small cool ms didnt earn any special science bonuses unless there was something truly remarkable about them because they were too common the vast majority of stars were dim small and cool contrariwise the os and bs were hot young stars and they always got bonuses because they were so few but the gateway corporation awarded double bonuses on the p and w classes p for gas clouds just condensing into stars w for the hot frightening wolfrayet type these were new stars often immense ones that could not be approached safely within billions of miles all those lucky prospectors collected science bonuses so did the ones who happened to find themselves near known objects at least if they were the first to claim the rewards wolfgang arretov was the first to arrive near the sirius system and earthly astronomers were delighted the stars sirius a and b had been studied intensively for centuries because the primary star is so bright in earthly skies arretovs data confirmed their deductions sirius a at solar masses b only about onebut a white dwarf with a surface temperature over twenty thousand degrees arretov got half a million for letting the astronomers know they had been right all along later sally kissendorf got a hundred thousand for the first good pictures of the tiny companion of zeta aurigae she would have gotten more if the companion had happened to flare while she was nearby but that might not have been worth her while since it was very likely she could not have survived the experience matt polofskys picture of little cygnus a only got him fifty thousand dollars thoughred dwarf stars simply werent that interesting even wellstudied nearby ones and rachel morgenstern with her husband and their three grown children shared half a million for the delta cepheid shots cepheids arent all that rare but the morgensterns happened to be there just when the stars surface layers were losing transparency through compression and then there were all the missions that woundup in oort clouds oort clouds are masses of comets that orbit a star very far out the oort in earths system doesnt get going until youre half a lightyear from the sun there are lots of comets in your average oort cloud trillions of them they generally mass as much as the aggregate of a stars planets and almost every star has an oort they seemed to fascinate the heechee in gateways first twenty years of operation no fewer than eightyfive missions wound up in an oort cloud and returned to tell of it that was a big disappointment to the prospectors involved be cause the gateway corporation stopped paying bonuses for oort data after the tenth such mission so those prospectors who came back from an oort complained a lot they couldnt understand why the heechee had targeted so many missions to the dumb things and naturally they had no idea how lucky they really were because it was a long time before anyone found out that for an astonishing reason most oort missions never got back to the gateway asteroid at all that billion dollars in astronomical science bonuses was welcome enough to the prospectors who got a share of it but really it was chicken feed what the gateway corporation was formed for was profit the prospectors had come to the asteroid for the same reason and big profit didnt come from taking instrument readings on something millions of miles away the big bucks came from finding a planet and landing on itand bringing back something that made money neither the gateway corporation nor the individual prospectors had much choice about that making a profit was the basic rule of survival and neither the prospectors nor the corporation made the rules those rules were made by the nature of the world they came from homo sapiens evolved on the planet earth and the process of evolution made it certain that every human trait was customengineered to fit earths conditions like a key in a lock with three billioh years of darwinian selection to make the fit perfect life on earth should have been pretty nearly heaven for its human inhabitants it wasnt not anymore for rich earth was getting close to filing for bankruptcy it had spent its wealth oh there were many millionaires on earth billionaires too people with more money than they could spend enough to hire a hundred servants enough to own a county for a backyard enough to pay for full medical insurance coverage so that for all their long lives they would have at their command the most wonderful of all the wonderful medical pharmaceutical and surgical techniques to keep them healthy and to make those lives very long there were hundreds of thousands of the very rich and many millions of the more or less well to do but there were ten billion others there were the ones who scratched out a living by farming on asian plains and african savannahs they made a crop when rain fell and wars stayed away and marauding insect pests devoured some other countryside than their own and when the crop failed they died there were the ones who lived in the barricaded slums of the big cities or the barrios outside latin metropolises or the teeming warrens of the urban areas of the orient these people worked when they could they lived on charity when there was any charity to be had they lived at the bottom of the food chainrice and beans yams and barley or if they had the money to pay for it singlecell proteins from the fossilfuel conversions of the food minesand they were very likely to be hungry throughout every hour of every day of their lives which were short the poor people couldnt afford the medical plans if they were very lucky there might be a free clinic or a cheap doctor to hand out pills and take out an appendix but when one of their organs wore out they had only two alternatives they managed to get along without it or they died the poor people could never afford organ transplants they were lucky if they werent caught in a dark alley some night and themselves converted into transplants for some richer person by some more desperate one so there were two kinds of human beings on earth if you owned a few thousand shares of petrofood or chemways you didnt lack for muchnot even health because then you could afford full medical but if you didnt if you didnt the next best thing was to have a job any kind of a job having a job was a dream of utopia for the billions who had none but for those who did have employment their work was generally a demeaning kind of drudgery that drowned the spirit and damaged the health the food mines employed many dipping fossil fuels out of the ground and breeding edible singlecell protein creatures on their hydrocarbon content but when you worked at a food mine you breathed those same hydrocarbons every dayit was like living in a closed garage with motors running all the timeand you probably died young factory work was better a little although the safest and most challenging parts of it were generally done by automatic machines for economic reasons because they were more expensive to acquire and to replace when damaged than people there was even domestic service as a possible career but to be a servant in the homes of the wealthy was to be a slave with a slaves intimate experience of luxury and plenty and a slaves despair at ever attaining those things for himself still the ones who had even those jobs were lucky for family agriculture was just a way of slowing down starvation and in the developed world unemployment was terribly high especially in the cities especially for the young so if you were one of the really rich or even just one of the welltodo splurging on a trip to new york or paris or beijing you usually saw the poor ones only when you walked out of your hotel between police barricades and into your waiting taxi you didnt have to do it that way the police barricades were all oneway if you chose to cross them the police would let you through a grizzled old cop might try to warn you that going out among the crowds was a bad idea if he happened to be charitably moved but none of them would stop you if you insisted then you were on your own which meant that you were immediately plunged into a noisy smelly dirty kind of unbarred zoo where you were immersed in a crowd of clamoring vendors of drugs of plastic reproductions of the great wall the eiffel tower or the new york bubble of handmade key charms and handcarved trinkets of guide services or discount coupons to night clubs of very oftenthemselves that was a scary experience for any member of the privileged classes encountering it for the first time it wasnt necessarily very dangerous though the police wouldnt actually let them murder you or snatch your walletas long as you were in sight anyway quite often the charging poor wouldnt harm you even if they succeeded in luring you away from the police cordons especially if you offered them some less chancy way of making money from you but that was not guaranteed most of the poor people were desperate for the rich of course the world was quite different it always is the rich lived long healthy lives with other peoples organs replacing any of their own that wore out they lived those lives in balmy climates under the domes of major cities if they chose or cruising the warm and stillunpolluted southern seas or even traveling in space for the pure joy of it when there were wars the rich went elsewhere until the wars were over they felt that was their due after all they were the ones who paid the taxesas much as they couldnt avoid anyway the main trouble with being rich was that not all of the poor people acquiesced in being poor quite a few tried to find ways to better themselves and sometimes they did so violently kidnapping became a growth industry in america again so did extortion you paid what they demanded or out of hiding someone would shoot away your kneecap few in the solvent classes would send their children to school without a bodyguard anymore that did have a useful side effect as it turned out it helped ease the unemployment situation a little as some millions of the extortionists put on uniforms and began drawing salaries to protect their employers against extortion and of course there was political terror too it flourished in the same soil that nurtured kidnapping and extortion and there was even more of it among the apathetic majority of the landless and the hungry there were always a few who banded together to work the vengeance of the havenots on the haves hostages were taken officials were shot from ambush aircraft were bombed out of the sky reservoirs were poisoned food supplies infected oh there were a thousand ingenious injurious tricks the terrorwielders devised and all of them devastatingat least to those who had something to lose in the first place nevertheless in spite of all the fears and inconveniences the haves had it made and most other people didnt even have hope then into the life of this seething overfull planet along came gateway for most of the ten billion people alive on the usedup planet of earth gateway was an unexpected hope of paradise like the goldrush miners of like the hungry irish fleeing their potato famine in the holds of immigrant ships like the sodbusting pioneers of the american west and human emigrants everywhere through all of history the povertystricken billions were willing to take any risk for the sake ofwell wealth if wealth could be had but at least for a chance to feed and clothe and house their children even the rich saw that this surprising new event might offer them a good chance to get even richer that made for a serious problem for a while the national governments who had built the space rockets that first visited other planets and later supported the gateway operation felt they were entitled to whatever profits came out of the gateway discoveries the rich people who owned the governments agreed but they couldnt all own it after all so there was a certain amount of buying and selling and horsetrading compromises were made bargains were struck and out of the competing greeds of all the claimants to the limitless wealth that the galaxy promised came the just or fairly just invention of the gateway corporation was gateway a benefit to earths poor at first not very much it gave each of them a little hopethe hope of a lottery ticket although few of them could raise the money even to buy that oneway ticket that might make them into winners but it was a long time before any stayathome peasant or slumdweller was a penny or a meal richer for anything the heechee had left behind in fact the knowledge that there were rich empty planets out there was more tantalizing than useful to earths teeming billions the livable planets were too far away they could only be reached by fasterthanlight travel although human beings actually improved on some heechee spacetravel techniques no one had the slightest idea of how to build a heechee shipand the ships on gateway were far too few and much too small to carry sizable migrant populations to the new planets so a few prospectors got rich when they didnt get dead instead a number of rich people got quickly richer but most of the penniless billions stayed on earth and in the cities like calcutta with its two hundred million paupers and on the starved farms and paddies of africa and the orient hunger remained a fact of life and terrorism and poverty got worse instead of better as our teachers keep telling us the longest journey begins with a single step that first step for the gateway asteroidthe first voyage of exploration any human being ever took in a heechee spaceship wasnt planned in advance it wasnt even authorized and it certainly wasnt prudent the name of the man who took that first trip into the unknown was lieutenant senior grade ernest t kaplan he was a marine officer from the us space navy cruiser roanoke kaplan wasnt a scientist he was so far from being a scientist that he had been given strict orders not to touch anything but anything on the gateway asteroid the only reason he was on the asteroid in the first place was that he had been ordered there as a guard to keep anyone else from touching anything while the scientists who came hurrying up from earth tried to figure out just what the devil they had here but kaplan had a mind full of itchy curiosity and whats more he had access to the parked ships and one day for lack of anything better to do he sat down in the one ship that happened to have been equipped with food lockers and air and water tanks just in case anyone got the locks closed and was trapped inside kaplan thought for a while about old sylvester macklin just for the fun of it he practiced opening and closing the locks a few times then he played with the knurled wheels for a while watching the changing colors then he squeezed the funnylooking little thing at the base that was what later more expert pilots would call the launch teat and as soon as he squeezed it lieutenant senior grade kaplan became the second human being to fly a heechee ship he was gone ninetyseven days later he was back at the gateway asteroid it was a miracle that hed managed to return it was even a bigger miracle that he was still alive the supplies in the ship had been meant to last for a few days not for months for drinking water he had been reduced to catching the condensation from his own sweat and emanations as it beaded the lander port for the last five weeks he hadnt eaten anything at all he was scrawny and filthy and half out of his mind but he had been there his ship had orbited a planet far out from a small reddish star a planet that had so little light that it seemed only grayish with swirling yellow cloudsa little the way jupiter or saturn or uranus might have appeared if their orbits had been as far from the sun as the twilit pluto the first reaction of the united states government was to courtmartial him he certainly deserved it he even expected it but before the court was convened the news services carried the word that the brazilian parliament carried away at the thought of sharing in the exploration of the galaxy had voted kaplan a milliondollar cash bonus then the soviets not only made him an honorary citizen but invited him to moscow to receive the order of lenin the dam had burst every talk show on every television network in the world was begging him to be a guest you couldnt courtmartial a hero so the american president jumped lieutenant kaplan to full colonel and then to general in the same orders that grounded colonel kaplan forever then the president called all the spacefaring nations together to decide just how to handle this situation the result was the gateway corporation colonel kaplan like everyone before him had failed to make one vital discovery and that was that each one of the heechee ships was actually two ships part one was the interstellar vessel that traveled faster than light to a programmed destination part two was the smaller simpler landing craft that nestled into the base of the ship itself the interstellar ships themselves with their unreproducible fasterthanlight drives were totally beyond the understanding of human scientists it was a long time before any earth person knew how they worked those who tried too hard to find out generally died because their drive engines blew up the landers were much simpler basically they were ordinary rockets true the guidance system was heechee but fortunately for the gateway prospectors the controls turned out to be even simpler to operate than the fasterthanlight vessels the prospectors could use the lander successfully even if they didnt know exactly how it worked just as any average seventeenyearold can learn to drive a car without any comprehension of the geometry of steering linkages or gear chains so when any gateway prospector came out of ftl drive and found himself in the vicinity of an interestinglooking planet he could use the lander for the purpose for which it was designed to go down to the surface of the planet and see what it had to offer that was what gateway was all about the planets were where you had to go because they were the most likely places to look for the kind of precious thing the prospector could bring back and turn in to make his fortuneand naturally to add to the corporations it was easy to describe the kind of planets they were looking for they were looking for another earth or something enough like earth anyway to support some form of organic life because inorganic processes hardly ever produced anything worth the carrying space it took to bring it home the most disappointing planets were the closest when the heechee came to earths solar system they gave it a good lookingover and some of the ships on the gateway asteroid reflected that they still had stored navigation codes for places so near that human be ings could have visited them on their ownif they wanted to some of them in fact had already been reached by the crude human rocketsplaces like venus the moon marss south polar ice cap some were hardly worth the trouble like saturns moon dione the prospectors were after bigger game than that they wanted planets no man or woman had ever seen they found a bewildering array of them the planets they reached in the magic mystery bus rides came in all shapes and sizes there were two basic types there were the orbiting rocks and then there were the wouldbe stars no gateway prospector ever landed on a gas giant of course they had nothing solid enough to land on it was the orbiting rocks that were prospected as vigorously as a few thousand scared hurried human beings could explore them there were plenty of the solid planets most of them had no apparent life at all unfortunately they were too far from their sun so they were eternally frozen or they were too close so they were as scorched as the planet mercury many of them had too little atmosphere like mars some of them had satellites of their own like the earths moon some of the target objects were satellites but big ones big enough to retain atmospheres and to land on there were something over two hundred billion stars in our own galaxy and a hellish lot of them possessed planets of one kind or another even the heechee ships werent programmed to set a course for all the possible planets to explore there were hardly course settings for one planet in a hundred thousand in fact still that left plenty for the gateway prospectors to visitmany more of them than a few thousand men and women could reach in the course of a few dozen years so the first discovery the gateway prospectors made was that there were plenty of planets to choose from human astronomers were glad to know that because theyd always wondered and the corporation didnt even have to pay a discovery bonus to find it out all they had to do was add up the findings of the returning explorers it developed that binary stars didnt ordinarily have planets solitary stars on the other hand generally did astronomers thought the reason for that probably had something to do with conserving rotational velocity when two stars condensed together out of a single gas cloud they seemed to take care of each others excess rotational energy bachelor stars apparently had to dissipate it on smaller satellites hardly any of the planets were really earthlike though there were a lot of tests for that sort of thing that could be applied from a considerable distance temperature sensing for one organic life didnt seem to develop except where water could exist in its liquid phase which was to say in the narrow degree band between about and kelvin at lower temperatures the stuff was useless ice at higher ones water wasnt usually there at afl because the heat vaporized it and the sunlightfrom whatever sun was nearbysplit the hydrogen out of the water molecule and it was lost into space that meant that each star had a quite narrow area of possible planetary orbits that might be worth investigating as planets didnt care whether or not they were going to be hospitable to life when they were condensing out of the interstellar gases most of them took orbits inside that life zone or in the cold spaces outside it most alien life like most earthly life was based on the chemistry of the carbon atoms carbon was the best of all possible elements for forming useful longchain compounds and happily it is so frequently found that it is the fourth most common element in the universe most alien life had something like dna too that wasnt for any panspermian reason but simply because systems like dna provided a cheap and efficient way for organisms to replicate themselves so most living things followed certain basic guidelines that was probably because they all started in pretty much the same way since there is a timetable to the development of life the first step is just chemistry inorganic chemicals get forced to react with each other under the spur of some sort of externally supplied energyusually the light from their nearby star then crude singlecelled little things appear these are only factories whose raw materials are the other inorganic chemicals in the soup that surrounds them they too use the energy of sunlight to process the inorganic chemicals into more of themselves and thats about all they do for a living since they are photosynthetic you might call them plants then these primitive plants themselves turn out to be pretty rich sources of assimilable chemicals since theyve gone to the trouble of concentrating the more appetizing inorganic compounds into a preprocessed form it is only a question of time until some of them learn a new diet these new ones dont eat the raw materials of the environment they eat their own weaker more primitive cousins call this new batch of creatures animals the first animals arent usually much they consist of a mouth at one end an anus at the other and some sort of processing system in between thats all they are but then thats all they need to be to feast on their neighbors then things get more complicated evolution begins to happen the fittest survive pretty much the way charles darwin figured it out as he fondled his captive finches on board the beagle the plants go on making appetizing chemicals for the animals to feast on and the animals go on feasting on the plants and on each otherbut some plants accidentally develop traits that give their predators trouble and so those plants survive and some animals learn tricks to get around those defenses later generations of animals develop senses to locate their prey more efficiently and musculatures to catch it and ultimately complex behavioral systems that make their predation more and more successful the competition never stops getting more intense and more sophisticated on all partsuntil finally some of the creatures become intelligent but they take a lot longer to evolve and it took the gateway prospectors a lot longer to find any of them too in the myriad worlds that the heechee had explored and to which the human gateway prospectors followed them hundreds of thousands of years laterall those basics of the evolution of life were played out a thousand times with a thousand variations the variations were sometimes quite surprising for instance earthly plants have one conspicuous trait in common they dont move but there wasnt any reason why that trait had to be universal and in fact it wasnt the gateway prospectors foux d bushes that rolled from place to place setting roots down to one side and pulling them up on the other like slowmotion tumbleweeds as they sought the richest soils and the best access to groundwater and the surest sunlight then too earthly animals dont normally bother with photosynthesis but in the seas of other worlds there were things like jellyfish that floated to the surface by day to generate their own hydrocarbons from the sun and the air and then sank down to feast on algal things at night earthly corals stay in one place prospectors found some unearthly onesor at least some unearthly things that looked more or less like coralsthat flew apart into their component little animals when the coast was clear to eat and mate and then returned to form collective rockhard fortresses when the prowling marine predators approached most of these things were useless to any prospector whose big interest was in making a fortune a few were not there was one good feature to finding an organism that was worth something and that was that it was an easy import you didnt have to bring tons of material back to gateway all you had to do was bring enough of some plant or animal back to breed others back on earth since living things were glad to reproduce themselves for you anywhere the zoos of earth began to expand and so did earths aquaria and its pet stores every fashionable family was sure to own its exotic windowbox of alien ferns or its furry little pet from the planet of some other star before the gateway prospectors could make an honest buck in the pet trade though they had to find the living things in the first place that wasnt easy even when life was apparently possible sometimes it was there and sometimes it was not the way to check for that was to look for chemical signatures in the atmosphere if the atmosphere turned out to contain reactive gases that hadnt reactedsay if it held free oxygen with reducing substances like carbon or iron somewhere availably aroundthen it stood to reason that something must be continually replenishing those gases that something was probably in some sense alive the very first planet that turned out to have living things on it was a solid ten when studied from orbit almost everything was there blue skies blue seas fleecy white clouds and plenty of oxygenmeaning some antientropic thing to keep it that way prospectors anatol and sherba mirsky and their partner leonie tilden slapped each others backs in exultation as they prepared to land it was their first missionand theyd hit the jackpot right away naturally they celebrated they opened the one bottle of wine theyd brought along ceremonially they made a recording announcing their discovery punctuating it with the pop of the wine cork they called the planet new earth everything was going their way they even thought it likely that they could figure out just where they were in the galaxy but they had spotted the magellanic clouds in one direction and the andromeda nebula in another and in still a third direction there was a tight bright cluster that they were nearly sure was the pleiades the celebration was a bit premature it had not occurred to them that one interesting color was missing in their view of new earth from space and that color was green when sherba mirsky and leonie tilden went down to the surface of new earth in the lander what they landed on was bare rock nothing grew there nothing moved nothing flew in the sky there were no flowering plants there were no plants at all at their elevation there wasnt any soil for them to grow in soil hadnt reached those parts of the world yet it was only one more disappointment to find that there wasnt much oxygen in its air eitherenough for a qualitative determination from orbit yes but nowhere near enough to breathe for although there certainly was life on new earth there just wasnt much of it yet most of what there was lived in the coastal shallows with a few hardy adventurers just making a start in colonizing the shoressimple prokaryotic and eukaryotic denizens of the sludgy seas with a few scraggly mossy things that had struggled out onto the littoral the trouble with new earth was that it was a lot too new it would take a billion years or so to get really interestingor to pay tilden the mirskys and the gateway corporation back for the trouble of looking it over although it was planets that offered profits planets were also the places where it was easiest to get killed as long as a gateway prospector stayed inside his ship he was well protected against most of the dangers of star wandering it was when he landed that he exposed himself to unknown environments and often very hostile ones for example there was mission pretty poison a fiftyyearold venezuelan named juan mendoza santamaria was the first gateway prospector to discover a really nicelooking planet it had taken him fortythree days to get there all alone in a one that was well within his margins he was not likely to run out of air food or water what he worried about running out of was money mendoza had spent the last of his credits on a farewell party before he left the asteroid if he came back emptyhanded to gateway his future was bleak so he crossed himself and whispered a prayer of gratitude as he stepped out of his lander onto the alien soil he was grateful but he wasnt stupid therefore he was also cautious mendoza knew very well that if anything went wrong he was in serious trouble there was no one within many lightyears who could help himin fact there wasnt anybody anywhere who even knew where he was so he wore his space suit at all times on the surface of the planet and that turned out to be very fortunate for juan mendoza the planet didnt look threatening at all the plants were an odd shade of orange the distant trees looked harmless and there were no obviously threatening large animals on the other hand there wasnt much to be seen that looked immediately profitable either there werent any signs of civilizationno great abandoned cities no friendly alien intelligences to welcome him no heechee artifacts lying about waiting to be picked up there wasnt even any kind of metallic structure natural or otherwise on the surface large enough to be detected by his landers sensors as he came down but mendoza reassured himself the fact that there was any kind of life ought to be worth at least a science bonus he identified both plant and animal life at least some of the things moved and some of them were firmly rooted in the soil he took some samples of the plants though they werent impressive he trekked painfully over to the trees and found that they were softbodied like mushrooms there werent any large ferns or true grasses but there was a kind of fuzzy moss that covered most of the soil and there were things that moved on it none of the moving things were very big the largest life form mendoza encountered was an arthropod about the size of his palm the little beasts moved about in little herds feeding on smaller beetly and buggy things and they were covered with a dense fur of glassy white spicules which made them look like herds of tiny sheep mendoza felt almost guilty as he trapped a few of the pretty little creatures killed them and put them with samples of the smaller creatures they preyed on in the sterile containers that would go back to gateway there wasnt anything else worth transporting what the planet had that was really worthwhile was beauty it had a lot of that it was quite nearmendoza estimated thirty or forty lightyearsa bright active gas cloud that he thought might be the orion nebula mendoza happened to land in the right season of the year to appreciate it best for as the planets sun set on one horizon the nebula rose on the other it came to fill the entire night sky like a luminous seagreen tapestry laced with diamonds edged in glowing royal maroon the diamondsthe brightest stars within the nebulawere orders of magnitude brighter even than venus or jupiter as seen from earth nearly as bright as earths full moon but they were point sources not disks like the moon and they were almost painful to look upon it was the beauty that struck mendoza he was not an articulate man when he got back and filed his report he referred to the planet as a pretty place and so it was logged in the gateway atlases as pretty place mendoza got what he was after a twomilliondollar science bonus for finding the planet at all and the promise of a royalty share on whatever subsequent missions might discover on pretty place that could have turned out to be really serious money according to gateway rules if the planet was colonizable mendoza would be collecting money from it for the rest of his life almost at once two other missions both fives copied his settings and made the same trip that was when they changed the name to pretty poison the followup parties were not as cautious as mendoza they didnt keep their space suits on they didnt have the natural protections that had been developed by pretty poisons own fauna either the local life had evolved to meet a real challenge those furry silicon spikes were not for ornament they were armor it was a pity mendoza hadnt completed his radiation checks because those bright young stars in the nebula were not radiating visible light alone they were powerful sources of ionizing radiation and hard ultraviolets four of the ten explorers came down with critical sunburn before they began to show signs of something worse all of them by the time they got back to gateway required total blood replacement and two of them died anyway it was a good thing that mendoza was a prudent man he hadnt spent his two million in wild carouse expecting the vast royalties that might come as his percentage of all that colonizing his planet would bring about the planet could not be inhabited by human beings the royalties never came mission burnout of the nearly thousand heechee vessels found on gateway only a few dozen were armored and most of those were fives an armored three was a rarity and when the crew of felicia monsanto greg running wolf and daniel pursy set out in one they knew there was a certain element of danger its course setting might take them to some really nasty place but when they came out of ftl and looked around they had a moment of total rapture the star they were near was quite sunlike a g the same size as earths sol they were orbiting a planet within the livable zone from the star and their detectors showed heechee metal in large quantities the biggest concentration was not on the planet it was an asteroid in an outofecliptic orbita lot like gatewayand it had to be another of those abandoned parking garages for heechee ships when they approached it they saw that the guess was correct but they also saw that the asteroid was empty there were no ships there were no artifacts at all it was riddled with tunnels just like gateway but the tunnels were vacant worse than that the whole asteroid seemed in very bad shape as though it were far older and had had a far harder life than gateway itself that puzzle cleared itself up when with the last of their resources two of the crew ventured down to the planet itself it had been a living planet once it had life now in fact but in scant numbers and only in its seasalgae and seabottom invertebrates nothing more somehow or other the planet had been seared and ravaged and the culprit was in view six and a half lightyears away from that system they discovered a neutron star like most neutron stars it was a pulsar but as their ship was nowhere near its axis of radiation they could hardly detect its jets but it was a radio source and their instruments showed that it was there the remnant of a supernova the rest of the story the experts on gateway filled in for them when they returned that solar system had been visited by the heechee but it was in a bad neighborhood after the heechee left probably knowing what was about to happenthe supernova exploded the planet had been baked its gases had been driven off and most of its seas boiled away as the hellish heat died away a thin new atmosphere was cooked out of the planets crust and the remaining water vapor had come down in incredible torrents of rain scouring away mountain valleys burying plains in silt leaving nothing and all of that had happened hundreds of thousands of years before monsanto running wolf and pursy got a science bonus for their missiona small one a hundred and sixty thousand dollars to be divided among the three of them by gateway standards that wasnt serious money it was enough to pay their bills on gateway for a few extra weeks it was not nearly enough to retire on all three of them shipped out again as soon as they found another berth and from their next voyage none of them ever returned probably the gateway prospectors should have taken it for granted that hospitable earthlike planets were bound to be a lot rarer than malignant ones their own solar system made that much clear anyway all those years of listening to project ozma radio signals should have taught them that much what they found out was that there was a myriad different kinds of hostile environments there was eta carina seven it was the right size it had air it even had waterwhen it wasnt frozen anyway but eta carina seven had a highly eccentric orbit it was pretty well iced over though still on its way to its frigid aphelion and there were terrible storms one lander never came back at all three of the others were damaged or lost at least one crew member mendoza was not the only one to find a planet that looked nice but turned out to be poison one pleasinglooking planet was well vegetated but the vegetation was all toxicodendrons they were far worse than earths poison ivy the slightest touch meant blisters agonizing itching pain and anaphylactic shock on the first mission to it everyone who landed on its surface died of allergic reactions and only the crew member who stayed with the ship in orbit was able to get back to gateway but once in a whileoh very seldomthere was a good one the happiest of all in the first decade of gateways operation was the mission of margaret brisch usually called peggy peggy brisch went out in a one she found what was really another earth in fact in some ways it was nicer than earth ever was not only were there no toxicodendrons to kill anyone who touched or any nearby star with lethal radiation there were not even any large dangerous animals there was only one thing wrong with peggys planet it would have been an ideal place to take earths overflow population if only it hadnt been located a good nineteen hundred lightyears away there was no way to get to it except on a heechee ship and the largest heechee ship carried only five people the colonization of peggys planet would have to wait first and last the gateway prospectors found more than two hundred planets with significant life it drove the taxonomists happily crazy generations of doctoral candidates had dissertation material that could not fail to win their degrees and hard work simply to find names for the thirty or forty million new species the prospectors found for them they didnt have that many names to spare of course the best they could do was assign classification numbers and note the descriptions there was no hope of establishing genera or even families although all the descriptions were fed into the databanks and a lot of computer time went into trying to discover relationships the best descriptions were generic dna or something like it was pretty nearly universal the next best were morphological most living things on earth share such common architectural features as the rod and the cylinder because they provide the most strength and carrying capacity you can get for the money for the same reasons so did most of the galaxys bestiary not always though arcangelo pelieris crew found a mute world full of softbodied things that had never developed bones or chitin soundless as earthworms or jellyfish opal cudwallader reached a planet where the scientists deduced repeated extinctions had kept knocking off land animals as they developed its principal creature like earthly pinnipeds and cetaceans was a former landdweller returned to the sea and nearly everything else was related it was as though darwins finches had colonized an entire planet and so on and so on until the explorers began to think they had found every possible variation on waterbased oxygenbreathing life perhaps they almost had but then they found the sluggardsthe same race the heechee had known as the slow swimmersand took another look at the hitherto unimagined possible flora and fauna of the gas giants so they had been wrong in their basic assumption that life required the chemistry of a solid planet to evolve that was a shock to their scientists but not nearly the shock that came a bit later when they discovered that life didnt require chemistry at all planets were nice and pictures of stars were nice but what everyone really wanted were some more samples of heechee technology there wasnt any doubt that there was some of the stuff waiting to be foundsomewhere the ships proved that the little morsels picked up in the tunnels of venus had proved it even earlier but they just whetted the human appetite for more of these wonders fourteen months after the program officially started a mission got lucky their ship was what was generally called a five but the system had not yet begun to operate in a standardized way this time only four volunteers went along they were officially chosen by the four earth powers that had established the gateway corporation and so they were an american a chinese a soviet and a brazilian they had learned from the experience of colonel kaplan and others who had gone before they brought along enough food water and oxygen to last them for six months they were taking no chances this time as it happened they didnt need all those provisions their ship brought them back in fortynine days and they didnt come back emptyhanded their destination had turned out to be an orbit around a planet about the size of the earth they had managed to make the lander work and three of them had actually used it to set foot on the surface of the planet for the first time in human history men walked on the surface of a heavenly body that was not part of the suns entourage first impressions were a bit disappointing the fourpower party discovered quickly enough that the planet had had some bad times its surface was seared as though by great heat and parts of it made their radiation detectors squeal they knew they could not stay there long but a mile or less from the lander down a barren slope from the mountaintop mesa where they had landed they found some rock and metal formations that looked artificial and poking around them they dug up three items they thought worth bringing home one was a flat tile with a triangular design still visible on its glazed surface the second was a ceramic object about the size of a cigar with thread markingsa bolt the third was a yardlong metal cylinder made of chromium and pierced with a couple of holes it could have been a musical instrument or part of a machineeven a hilsch tube whatever they were they were artifacts when the fourpower crew proudly displayed their trophies back on the gateway asteroid they created an immense stir none of the three looked like a major technological breakthrough nevertheless if such things could be found then there were certainly othersand no doubt things that would be of a lot more practical value that was when the interstellar gold rush began in earnest it was a long time before anyone got that lucky again overall the statistics on missions out of the gateway asteroid showed that four out of five trips came back with nothing to show but some pictures and instrument readings fifteen percent never came back at all it was only one ship out of twenty that brought back any tangible piece of heechee technology and most of those things were only curiositiesbut the very few that were more than curiosities were treasures beyond price they were few and far between to be sure the exploration of venus had shown that was probable for in all the hundreds of miles of heech e tunnels under the surface of the planet venus no more than a dozen gadgets had been found to be sure some of those meant big profits for those who learned to copy them the anisokinetic punch was a marvel hammer it on one end and the force of the blow came out at the side what was even more marvelous was that scientists managed to figure out how it worked and its principle had applications in every area of construction manufacture and even home repair the firepearls were a mystery so were the socalled prayer fans then of course humans reached the gateway asteroid and that fleet of ships was the biggest treasure trove of all but all there was on the asteroid were the ships themselves the ships were empty of anything but their operating gear the whole asteroid was empty almost surgically clean as though the heechee had deliberately left the ships but removed everything else that could be of value over a period of twenty years and more the gateway explorers went out to seek whatever could be found they came back with pictures and stories and kinds of living things and minerals but of heechee artifacts they found very few that was why so many gateway prospectors died pooror just died mission toolbox some also died rich without knowing they had become rich that was the case in one of the biggest finds unfortunately it did three of its five discoverers little good because they did not survive the trip the mission started with three austrians two brothers and an uncle using the last of an inheritance to pay their way to gateway they were determined to ship out only in an armored ship as the only such vessel available was a five at the last minute they recruited a south american manuel de los fintas and an american sheri loffat to go with them they reached a planet they landed on the planet they found nothing much there but their instruments showed heechee metal somewhere around and they tracked it down it was a lander it had been abandoned there heaven knew when but it was not empty the biggest thing they found in the lander was a stack of heechee metal hexagonal boxes not more than half a meter across and less than half that tall weight twentythree kilograms they were tools some of the items were familiar and useless as far as anyone had been able to tell almost a dozen little prayer fans of the kind that littered so many heechee tunnels and artifacts but there were also things like screwdrivers but with flexible shafts things like socket wrenches but made out of some soft material things that resembled electrical test probes but turned out to be spare parts for other heechee machines it was a grand success they wound up millionairesor at least the survivors did that find was lying right on the surface of the planet but before long the gateway prospectors learned that planet surfaces were not the most likely places to look for examples of heechee treasures under the surface was much much richer one thing was clear early on about the vanished heechee they liked tunnels the heechee tunnels that honeycombed parts of the planet venus werent unique as explorations retraced the old interstellar trails they found examples of them everywhere the heechee had gone the inside of the gateway asteroid was a maze of tunnels so were the other gateways that turned up as the explorations progressed nearly every planet the heechee had left any signs on at all had tunnels dug into it lined with heechee metal where the surface conditions were unpleasant the tunnels were extensive and complex but even so fair a world as peggys planet had a few of them the anthropologically trained scientists called heecheeologists trying passionately to figure out what these vanished people were like supposed that they came from a burrowing race like gophers rather than an arboreal one like people the heecheeologists turned out to be right but it was a long time before any of them were sure of it all the tunnels looked pretty much alike they were lined with a dense hard metallic substance that glowed in the dark it was called heechee metal in the first tunnels humans encountered on venus and on the gateway asteroid itself the glow was a pale blue blue was by far the commonest of heecheemetal colors but inside the heechee ships there were some parts that were made of a golden heechee metal and later on the explorers found heechee metal that glowed red or green no one really knew why heechee metal came in different colors the heecheeologists were not much help all they could tell about the occasional variation in the color of heechee metal was that it seemed clear that the tunnels of bluish metal were generally the ones poorest in heechee artifacts gold red and green almost always had more treasures to be found by the explorers of course until men and women began to learn how to explore the galaxy in the heechee ships they were limited to the blueglowing tunnels of gateway and venus and in them the treasures to be found were sparse though sometimes of great value in the tunnels found on the most productive planets the metal walls started out blue and then became another color just where the largest collections of useful tools were located no one knew why but then no one knew much about the heechee at all just then mission heater wu fengtse had chosen to ship out in a one that had its advantages and its faults the biggest advantage was that if there was nothing to land on and the only reward would be some kind of science bonus for observations he could keep it all himself it didnt happen that way though when he came out of ftl drive he found himself in orbit around a more or less earthtype planet so wu had to face the problem of every single prospector if he took his lander down to the surface of the planet no one would be left in the ship if anything happened to him on the surface no one would be there to rescue him he was completely on his own his other problem was that earthtype was only a very approximate description of the world he had to explore earthtype meant that the planet was about the right size and that it had an atmosphere and a temperature range that permitted water vapor in the air liquid water in its shallow seas and frozen water on its colder parts it wasnt heaven though its colder parts included nearly all of the planet its best zone was around the equator and that was not much unlike labrador if there ever had been anything on any other part of its surface it was now covered with thousands of feet of ice there was no point in landing on a glacier wu had no way of digging down to whatever lay under it after a lot of searching wu found a bare outcropping of rock and landed there by then he wasnt very optimistic anymore the environment did not look promisingbut his instruments gave him better news than he had expected there was a tunnel wu had practiced tunnel entry he even had the necessar y equipment sweating the big power drills into place and erecting the bubble shelter that would protect it from the outside air took all of his strength and enough time to use up the bulk of his supplies but he got in it was a bluelined tunnel that was discouraging but as he moved along it he caught glimpses of other colors when he got to a red segment he found a huge machinelater on experts decided from his description that it had been a tunnel diggerbut he didnt have the strength to lift it or the equipment to try to hack pieces off it in the green part of the tunnel were bolts of what wu first took to be cloth but turned out to be the crystalline sheeting the prayer fans were made of in the gold wasthe gold there were stacks and stacks of little hexagonal heecheemetal boxes all sealed all heavy wu couldnt carry them all and his energy was running out he managed to get two of them back to the lander and then took off with every intention of coming back in a five unfortunately when he was safely back on gateway it turned out that no five would accept the program that had brought him there neither would any of the threes or ones that were lying in their docks waiting for crews it seemed that only the one he had found the planet in would take him back that didnt work either before he could requisition it and ship out again someone else had taken his oneon a oneway trip all wu had then was the two little boxes but it was their contents that bought him a home in shensi province one of them contained heater coils they werent operating but they were close enough to working condition so that human scientists managed to tinker them going the other box contained a set of gauges for measuring microwave flux scientists puzzled over the gauges very diligently but they asked the wrong questions what they labored to ascertain was how they worked it did not occur to any of them just then to wonder why the heechee were so curious about millimeter microwave flux if it had it might have saved a lot of people a lot of unnecessary confusion it was in a tunnel on an otherwise unprepossessing planet that one prospector found the first specimen of the heechee tunneling machine it was in a tunnel on the lunalike satellite of a distant gas giant planet that another found the camera that the socalled firepearls served as film and it was in a tunnel that vitaly klemenkov found the little device that sparked a whole new industryand earned him only a pittance klemenkovs is a kind of hardluck story what he found was what human scientists came to call a piezophone its main operating part was a diaphragm made out of the same material as the blooddiamonds that had littered the tunnel of venus and many others the material was piezoelectric when squeezed it produced an electric current and vice versa of course there were plenty of blooddiamonds around though no one had known before klemenkov that they were basically raw material for piezoelectric devices klemenkov had visions of untold riches unfortunately the main communications laboratories on earth subsidiaries of the cable and telephone and satellite corporations developed the heechee model into something they could manufacture themselves klemenkov took it to court naturallybut who could fight the lawyers of the biggest corporations in the world so he settled for a small royaltyhardly more in fact than an average emperors income there was one other splendidly productive variety of place to find heechee treasures but no one knew that at first although if they had thought of the example of gateway itself they might have deduced it and certainly no one knew that these rich lodes were actually traps a woman named patricia bover was the first gateway prospector to report finding oneand as was so often the case it did her little good mission food factory patricia bover set out in a one she had no idea where she was going she was pleased that it was a relatively short tripturnaround in seven days destination in fourteenand astonished when her instruments told her that the tiny distant star that was the nearest to her was actually the old familiar sun she was in the oort cloud of comets far beyond the orbit of pluto and she was docking on what was clearly a heechee artifact a big one it was eight hundred feet long she estimated and it was like nothing anyone had ever before reported finding when bover got into the thing and looked around she realized she was rich the thing was absolutely stuffed with machines she had no idea what they did but there were so many of them that she had no doubt at all that some of them maybe many of them would be as valuable as any heater or tunneler or anisokinetic punch the bubble burst when she found out she couldnt get back to gateway her ship wouldnt move no matter what she did to the controls it remained inert it not only would not automatically return her to her port of origin it wouldnt go anywhere at all patricia bover was stuck some billions of miles from earth as it turned out the artifact was still operating in a part of it that pat bover never saw it was actually still producing food half a million years after it was left there by the heechee out of the raw materials of the comets themselvescarbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen the basic elements that make up most of human diet and body if pat had known thatif she had forced herself to investigate the thingshe might have lived quite long while there she didnt know that though what she knew was that she was in serious trouble what she did was send a long radio message to earth twentyfive lightdays away explaining where she was and what had happened then she got into her lander and launched it in the general direction of the sun she took a knockout pill and crawled into the freezer and died there she knew the odds were against her she wasnt properly frozen for any hope of revival and anyway the chances were small that anyone would ever find her frozen body and try to revive it and as a matter of fact no one ever did the food factory wasnt the only heechee artifact in space which doubled as a trap for the unwary there were altogether twentynine of these large objectsthey were called collection trapssomewhere in the galaxy patricia bovers illfated find in the oort cloud wasnt the only artifact the heechee had left up and running it wasnt even the only one to which a gateway spaceship had a preprogrammed course there was that other orbiting parking garage for spaceships that the heechee had left around another star far awayalmost as big as gateway humans called it gateway two and then there was ethels place ethels place was discovered by an early onewoman mission then it was rediscovered by a group of canadians in an armored three and rerediscovered by another one whose pilot was a man from cork ireland named terrance horran the canadians didnt just discover the artifact they also discovered ethel kiock because she was there when they arrived when horran arrived he discovered them all and later parties kept on discovering those who had come before because they all stayed right there as with pat bover on the food factory it was a oneway destination for them all there wasnt any return the boards on all the ships nulled themselves on arrival they had no way of getting off the artifact that was a great pity in the minds of all of them because ethels place was a wonder it was an object about the size of a cruise liner but without any engines of any kind that they could discover it had food machines and air and water regenerators and lights and they were all still operating even after all the millennia that had passed the heechee machines were built to last morever there were a lot of astronomical instruments on ethels place and they were working too the castaways had plenty of time to investigate their new home they had nothing else to do the food machines fed them their lives were not threatened they actually made quite a selfsufficient little colony they might even have made it a permanent one with generations of settlers coming along if klock had not been past the age of childbearing by the time the canadians got there or if the later arrivals had included any females they realized early that ethels place was a kind of astronomical observatory what the observatory had been put there to observe was obvious at once ethels place was in orbit at a distance of about a thousand au from a rather spectacular pair of astronomical objects binary stars werent particularly interesting this pair was unique one of them was a fafrly standard kind of star though a rarish onea hot pulsating supergiant specimen of the young and violent class called type f that by itself would have been worth a little bonus moneyif they had had any way of reporting itbut its companion was a lot stranger the typef star had a tilted ring of hot gas around it suggesting that it was still in the process of reaching its final stage of starhood the companion was all gas and not very hot gas at thatan immense nearly transparent disk of the stuff the more they looked at it the stranger it got stars were supposed to be spheres they werent supposed to be disks the diskshaped companion was hard to observe anyway even with heechee optics visually it looked like nothing more than a faint scarlet stain on the sky it was too cool to radiate much the heechee instruments couldnt tell them its temperature because the heechee had not been thoughtful enough to provide conversion tables into cel sius or kelvin or even fahrenheit scales klocks own best estimate was that it ran to maybe five hundred kfar cooler than the surface of venus for instance cooler even than a log burning in a fireplace on earth the best time to see it they discovered was when it was eclipsing the typef companion star because the orbit of ethels place was retrograde with respect to the disk such eclipses happened more often than they would have if their artifact had somehow been stationary in the sky they still did not happen very often ethel klock had observed one eclipse alone shortly after she landed by the time of the next eclipse she had the canadians and horran to share the sight with but that was more than twenty years later the story of ethels place did finally have a happy ending for its captiveswell fairly happy ultimately human beings did learn how to make heechee ships go where they wanted them to go shortly thereafter an exploring party in better command of its ship found the five castaways and they were rescued at last it was a little late by then ethel klock was in her seventyeighth year and even horran was nearly fifty they didnt even get their science bonuses either the gateway corporation had long since stopped issuing them because the gateway corporation no longer existed they would have been out of luck anyway they found because even if theyd gotten back early they would not have collected much in the way of financial rewards that binary star system was unfortunately not a new discovery indeed it turned out to be a system that had been very familiar to astronomers on earth because of those very puzzling characteristics the name of the star was epsilon aurigae and its mysteries were no secret they had been unlocked by human astronomers with conventional instruments when the binarys cool orbiting disk had passed between earth and its typef primary in the eclipse of the year ad it was more than fifty years between the time the first gateway prospector landed on one of those collection traps and the time the last of them was discovered as many as eight separate missions might converge on one of them when they did they couldntreturn most had food factories either built in or supplied with shipments of food by automatic spacecraft from an independent factory nearby so the castaways didnt starve nor did they lack for water or air a few did not have these amenitiesnot in working condition anymore at least in those cases all that was found were the abandoned heechee ships and a few desiccated corpses heecheeologists grew to believe that these collection traps served some purposemaybe several purposes though they could not be really sure what any of them were none were accessible to planet dwellers there were no tunnels on inhabited planets nor were there any treasures where they could be reached without the use of spacecraft it seemed to be a sort of intelligence test posed by these vanished aliens it was almost as though the heechee when they went to wherever they had gone had deliberately left clues to themselves but even the clues were hard to find no intelligent race could find one until it had first mastered at least primitive interplanetary travel on its own and the greatest prizes were even more thoroughly concealed as a matter of record it wasnt exactly a gateway prospector who made the first roundtrip expedition to the food factory pat bovers was only one way the expedition that made it possible for the heechee carbonhydrogenoxygennitrogen food to do something to help out hunger on earth arrived there in an earthly chemical rocket spiraling out into the outer reaches of the solar system and they did more than that because it was through the food factory that the second big discovery came along it was called heechee heaven it was the largest heecheemade artifact ever discovered more than half a mile long twice the size of an ocean liner it was shaped like a spindle and it was not uninhabited it held the descendants of the breeding group of australopithecines the heechee had captured on earths surface half a million years before it held one living human the son of a pair of prospectors who had reached heechee heaven in their gateway shipand been trapped there and it contained the stored minds of more then twenty gateway prospectors who had come there on oneway trips all that was wonderful it was more than wonderful though for the first time heechee technology was not only on hand but accessible at last some of it could be understood and copied and even improved those treasures were not just satisfying scratches for the scientists itch of curiosity or wealth for a few lucky discoverers they meant a better life for everyone and heechee heaven was not simply a space station it was a ship a vast one a ship big enough to transport human colonists in quantities sizable enough to begin to make a dent in human misery emigrants at a time anywhere they chose to goand keep on doing it once a month indefinitely and the colonization of the galaxy by the human race was possible at last the biggest science bonus the gateway corporation ever offeitd its prospectors wasnt really scientific it was emotional it proved that even the gateway corporation had some human feelings the bonus was waiting there for any explorer who discovered a living breathing heechee and it wasnt tiny it came to fifty million dollars that was the kind of bonus any desperate gateway explorer could dream about but hardly any of them ever expected to claim it maybe the corporate masters didnt expect ever to pay it out either they all well knew that every sign of the heechee anyone had ever found was hundreds of thousands of years old they also suspected very likely that there might not be much chance that anyone who did discover a live heechee would be allowed to come back and tell the human world what he had found but there were other bonuses in that same emotional area they were lesser but still very worthwhile the biggest one was the stand ing tenmilliondollar offer for the discovery of any intelligent race of aliens after a while that was made a little easier you could earn it by finding any living aliens at all who showed the faintest signs of smarts you could even earn money for dead ones there was a flat million posted for the discoverer of the first nonheechee artifact found and half a million or so for the discovery of any one of a variety of signaturesthat is to say of such unmistakable signs of intelligence as a clearly coded radio transmission or the detection of synthetic gases in some planetary atmosphere somewhere it stood to reason gateway prospectors told each other as they bought each other drinks in gateways blue hell that it was just about certain that somebody would find some of that kind of stuff somewhere sometime they had to everyone knew that there ought to be other intelligent races around the heechee couldnt possibly be the only other intelligent beings in the universe could they that wasnt a new idea as far back as the middle twentieth century scientists had been listening for signals from other civilizations in space and trying to calculate the probability of ever hearing one a fellow named stephen dole had calculated that there ought to be some lifesustaining planets in the galaxy later scientists on tougher assumptions cut the expected number down much lowerbut hardly any of them were willing to put it at zero almost everybody agreed there ought to be someand in fact gateway prospectors did keep turning up planets where things did live and if there was life of any kind it seemed a reasonable bet that sooner or later some of that life would evolve toward intelligence but where were they ultimately a couple of lucky breaks did begin to turn up a few such interesting discoveries though they were very sparse and slow in coming the first definite signs of an alien intelligence were detected by a threeperson crew from pasadena california earth they came out of fasterthanlight drive in orbit around a promisinglooking sun and discovered quickly that there was a goodsized planet right in the middle of the habitability zone the trouble was the planet was a mess most of one hemisphere was a patchwork of bare rock plains punctuated with volcanoes and the thing was hot it didnt have much in the way of oceans it didnt even have anything like as much of an atmosphere as its mass and constitution would have predicted however what it did have was a dam a big one the dam was on the less ruined side of the planet even so it was not at all in good shape it wasnt a very hightech dam for that matterhalf a kilometer of rock piled across a valley it had once been a river valley no doubt but there was nothing left of the river at all there wasnt much left of the dam for that matter but what there was could not have been natural someone had piled those rocks in that place for a definite purpose martin scranton and his two sisters tried to land on the planet they made a landing all right but the heat sensors in their lander began to squawk warnings as soon as they touched down the surface even around the dam was hotter than the boiling point of water they did they thought see traces of what might have been other stone structures on a few mountaintops but nothing in recognizable shape back on the gateway asteroid the scientists decided that that planet had had some bad luckbad enough to be struck by some wandering body probably something the size of callisto the impact had boiled off the seas buried much of the planet under molten rock driven the atmosphere into spaceand oh yes certainly killed every organic thing that had ever inhabited it so scranton hadnt found intelligent life he did claim that he had at least found a place where intelligent life had once been the gateway corporation couldnt call it a success in terms of the discovery bonus offered but still they took a long time to think it over then paid half the bonus for a good try the first living nonhuman intelligent race the human explorers found didnt count they werent all that nonhuman and they werent all that intelligent either what these particular aliens were were the remote descendants of a tribe of earthly australopithecines and the place they were found was on the big heechee ship orbiting out in sols oort cloud of comets called heechee heaven of course as we have seen those old australopithecines hadnt gotten there by themselves the heechee had taken them away for breeding stock in that longago visit to prehuman earth then they had left them to the care of machine nursemaidsfor half a million years and more the second race of aliens was better it took a long time before they were found but they were clearly the real thing at last they were definitely intelligentthey proved it by traveling through interstellar space on their own but they were a bit of a disappointment all the same they certainly werent much fun to talk to they werent exactly found by a gateway prospector either the whole gateway corporation was pretty nearly history by the time these folks got discovered it still existed of course but gateway no longer was where the action was for by then human beings had learned to copy a lot of heechee technology and were venturing into new areas of the galaxy on their own at that point one interstellar ship on what had become a fairly routine cruise detected an unfamiliar vessel it turned out to be a photonsail ship slowly chugging along between stars on a voyage of centuries that certainly was not heechee technology nor was it human not even australopithecine the longawaited truly alien race had at last been located but actually they had been discovered quite a while earlier it turned outby the heechee themselves in fact the sailboat people were the descendants of what the heechee had called the slow swimmers and human beings came to know as the sluggards they were definitely alien and definitely not heechee and definitely intelligent that was all they had to recommend them though the sluggards were sludge dwellers they lived in wandering arcologies in a semifrozen mush of methane and other gases and although they had really and truly managed to launch those photonsail spaceships they didnt have many other attractive qualities the worst thing was that they were terribly slow their metabolisms ran at the pace of freeradical reactions in the icy slush they lived in and so did their thoughts and their speech it took a long time before any human beings were able to establish any sort of useful communication with the snailspace sluggards and by then as it turned out it didnt really matter mission stinkpot the four people on this mission spent a lot of time and a lot of money in court what they were doing there was trying to win a suit against the gateway corporation for that tenmilliondollar bonus they thought they had a pretty good case they didnt have a very good planet though certainly it wasnt an attractive one it was small and it was hot its sun was a red dwarf only a quarter of an au away and the planet really stank that was what gave it its name the planet was also largely covered with waternot sparkling tropical seas but a sluggish ocean that bubbled methane into an atmosphere that was already mostly methane you couldnt breathe the stuff you wouldnt have wanted to if you could becauseof the stink and there was absolutely nothing of interest anywhere on the planets few dryland surfaces that wasnt good news for the people in the ship but it wasnt absolutely crushing either as it happened they had made some unusual preparations before they left gateway and thus they were equipped for more than the casual touchdownandlookaround of your average gateway crew they were a family and they came from singapore they were jimmy oh kip fwa his wife daisy mek tan dah and their two young daughters jenny oh sing dut and rosemary oh ting lu the oh family was very old in singapore they had once been very rich with a family fortune that had been made out of underwater mining when malaysia took the island over and expropriated all its industries the ohs stopped being rich but they had wisely socked away enough in switzerland and jakarta to finance their fares to gateway with enough left over to bring along some extra equipment it was gear for underwater exploration as jimmy oh told his family the ohs made a lot of money out of seabottoms once maybe we can do it again taking all that stuff with them meant that they could only fit four people in their five but then they didnt much want anyone else along anyway and when they saw what sort of planet they had reached through the luck of the draw madame mek was blessedly silentat lastand their daughter jenny said jesus pop youre not so dumb after all even the ohs hadnt brought along the kind of deepsea diving gear and instrumentation that would let them make a systematic survey of stinkpots sea bottom there was just too much sea bottom to explore and too little time what they had was half a dozen instrumented neutralbuoyancy balls they dropped them into the global ocean at half a dozen randomly chosen points then they went back to their orbiting ship and waited for transmissions as the buoys returned to the surface the ohs interrogated each one in turn about what it had found that was disappointing of heechee metal the instruments had detected none at all of the kind of transuranic or other radioactive elements that might just possibly be worth mining and shipping back to earth also nothing but the instruments had picked up some electrical potentials that didnt seem to have any identifiable source they were regular in a pleasingly irregular kind of way they made nice rounded waves on a crt and when jenny oh who had majored in cetacean ethology in school slowed the signals down and played them through a sound synthesizer they sounded alive were the signals language if so of what sort of living thing that was when the lawsuits started the oh family said that language definitely proved the existence of intelligent life the corporations lawyers said chirps and squeals werent language even if they did happen to be electromagnetic instead of acoustical the ohs said how could crickets communicate by electrical impulses unless they were smart enough to build something like radio sets the corporations lawyers said there wasnt any radio involved just electric fields and maybe the creatures had currentproducing organs like an electric eel the ohs said aha then you admit you owe us at least the alienlifediscovery bonus so pay it up right away the corporations lawyers said first show us your specimens or photographs or anything to prove these alien life forms are real of course all of this was in slow time each interchange in this dialogue took six or eight months of continuances and motion hearings and the taking of depositions after three litigious years the corporation grudgingly allowed a quartermilliondollar settlement which just about paid the ohs lawyer bills then years after that someone else repeated their trip with better equipment the new underwater probes had lights and cameras and they found what was making the signals it wasnt intelligence it was wormsten meters long eyeless living on the sulfurous exudation of undersea thermal vents the things turned out on dissection to have electrical systems just as the ohs had claimed that was all they did have that was of any interest at all nevertheless at least the ohs were clearly entitled to another couple of hundred thousand now that their discovery of life was confirmed they didnt get it though they were no longer in any position to collect any further bonuses having failed to return from their latest mission the intelligentalien bonus didnt go entirely unclaimed though two other parties of gateway explorers did in fact collect their ten million apiece they found what the corporation with some charity agreed to call intelligent aliens everyone admitted that the corporation was stretching a point here even the lucky explorers did though that didnt keep them from taking the money the voodoo pigs looked like blueskinned anteaters and wallowed in filth like domesticated earthly pigs what made them intelligent was that they had developed an art form they made little statuettes nibbling them into shape with their teeth and that was more than any earthly animal had ever done so the corporation philosophically paid off then there were the quancies they lived in the sea of a remote planet they had tiny flippers but no real hands they werent any good at manufacturing things for that reason and so no one considered them technological what they did have was a definite and even a more or less translatable language they were definitely smarter than say dolphins or whales or anything else on earth but man himselfand there too the corporation paid its bonus those were all the live ones there were to be sure traces of other civilizations that were gone a planet here and there had refined metal structures not yet completely rusted away others showed that somebody sometime had gone so far as to pollute its environment with certainly artificial radionuclides that was it and the more they found the more the wonder grew where were the old civilizations the ones who had reached earths stage of culture a million or a billion years before why hadnt they survived it was as though the first explorers into say the amazon jungle had found huts farms villages but instead of living denizens only corpses the explorers would certainly wonder what had killed all the people off so wondered the gateway prospectors they could have accepted it if they had found no traces of any other intelligence those members of the human race who cared about such things had been braced for that all along the seti searches and the cosmological estimates had prepared them for a lonely universe but there had been other creatures that appeared to have been capable of as much technology and as much wisdom as the human race they had existed and now they were gone what had happened it was a long time before the human race found out the answer to that and then they didnt like it at all while human beings were beginning to thread their way across the immensity of the galaxy the world they had left behind was beginning to change it took a long time but at last the heechee wonders the gateway prospectors had brought home were beginning to make a real change for the better in the condition of the peoples of the eartheven the poorest ones one key discovery unlocked all the rest that was learning how to read the heechee language the hardest part of that was finding any heechee language to read because the heechee did not seem to have been familiar with things like pencils paper or printing it was a surething bet in the opinion of everybody who ever gave it a thought that the heechee must have had some way of recording things but where was it when the answer turned up it was obvious enough the longmysterious prayer fans were actually heechee books that is it was obvious after the factthough the tricky bit was that the things couldnt be read without some hightech aid once the records were identified as records the rest was up to linguists it wasnt all that hard it certainly was no harder say than the longago decipherment of linear b and it was made easier by the fact that places were discovered on heechee heaven and elsewhere where parallel texts could be found in both languages when the prayer fans were interpreted some of the most intractable heechee mysteries became crystal clear not the least of them was how to reproduce the heechee fasterthanlight drive then colonization could really begin the great ship that had been called heechee heaven was the first to be used for that purpose because it was already there it ferried thousands of povertystricken emigrants at a time to new homes on places like peggys planet and that was only the beginning within five years that ship was joined by others now human madejust as fast even bigger and on the home planet itself on the home planet itself it was the chonfood factories that made the first big difference simply put what they did was end human starvation forever the heechees own chonfood factories orbited in cometary spacethat was the reason for the longbaffling heechee fascination with oort clouds now answered at last the humanmade copies of these factories could be sited anywherethat is anywhere there was a supply of the basic four elements the only other raw material they needed was enough of a salting of impurities to fill out the dietary needs so before long the chonfood factories sat on the shores of the great lakes in north america and lake victoria in africa and everywhere else where water and the four elements were present and people wanted to eat they were along the beaches of every sea no one starved anymore no one died of hunger before his timeand before long it was almost true that no one died at all this was for two reasons the first of them had to do with surgery and peculiarly with the chonfood factories as well for a long time human beings had known how to substitute transplants for any wornout organ now the replacement parts no longer had to be butchered out of cadavers the same system that made chonfood considerably refined could be induced to man ufacture tailormade human organs to implant into people in need nobody had to die because a heart lung kidney bowel or bladder wore out you just turned over your specifications to the people at the spareparts division of the chonfood factory and when they pulled your new organs out of their amniotic soup the surgeons popped them in place in fact all the life sciences flowered the heechee food factories made it possible to identify and then to reproduce or even create a thousand new biological agentsantiantigens antivirals selective enzymes cell replacements disease simply passed out of fashion even such longendured traumas as tooth decay childbirth and the common cold became history and then there was the second reason if in spite of everything a person did finally die of simple overall decay he didnt have to die completely at least there was another heechee inventionit had been first found on the ship called heechee heaventhat robbed death of some of its sting the heechees techniques for capturing a dead persons mind in machine storage produced the dead men on heechee heaven later on earth it produced the enterprise called hereafter inc the worldwide chain of operators that would take your deceased mother or spouse or friend put his or her memory into computer space and permit you to converse with him or her whenever you likedforever or as long as someone paid the storage charges for his or her datafile at first that certainly wasnt quite the same as being really alive but it was a whole lot better than being irrecoverably dead of course as the technology matured machine storage of human intelligence got easier and a great deal better when it got really good it began to raise some unexpected problems surprisingly the problems were theological the promises of earthly religions were being fulfilled in a way the religious leaders had never planned for indeed it seemed now to be true that life was only a sort of overture and that death was in fact nothing more than the stepping stone to eternal bliss in heaven the dying man who then woke up to find himself no more than a collection of bits in the datafile of the immense computer networks might well wonder why he had clung to life in his organic body so long for the machine afterlife had everything going for it he had lost nothing through death he still could feel the machinestored ate as much as they likedneither cost nor season were factors in planning a menuand if they chose they excreted too all the biological functions were possible he was deprived of none of the pleasures of the flesh he could even make love with his dearestprovided only that she had stored herself in the same netor with any number of dearests real and imaginary if that was how his tastes went if he wanted the society of the stillliving friends he had left behind there was nothing to stop him representing himself to them in order to have a conversation or a friendly game of cards there was also travel and perhaps most popular of all there was work after all the basic human work is only a kind of date processing humans dont dig the foundations for skyscrapers machines do that all the humans do is run the machines and that could be done as readily from machine storage as in the flesh all those books that the deceased had been meaning to read the plays the operas the ballets the orchestral performancesnow there was time to enjoy them as much time as he chose whenever he chose that svas heaven indeed the dead persons style of life was exactly what he wanted it to be he didnt have to worry about what he could afford or what was bad for him the only limit was his own desire if he wished to be cruising in the aegean or sipping cold rum drinks on a tropical beach he only had to order it then the datastores would summon up any surround he liked as detailed as any reality could be and just as rewarding it was almost like living in a perfect video game the operative word is perfect for the simulations were just as good as the reality in fact they were better tahiti without mosquitoes french cuisine without gaining weight the pleasure in the risks of mountainclimbing without the penalty of being killed in an accident the deceased could ski swim feast indulge in any pleasure and he never had a hangover some people are never happy there were a few of the formerly dead who werent satisfied sipping aperitifs at the cafй de la paix or rafting down the colorado river they would take note of the taste of the campari and the spray of the water and ask but is it real well what is real if a man whispers loving words to his sweetheart on the longdistance phone what is it that she really hears it isnt his own dear voice that was a mere shaking of the atmosphere it has been analyzed and graphed and converted into a string of digits what is reconstituted in the phone at her ear is an entirely different shaking of the air it is a simulation for that matter what did she hear even when her darlings lips were only inches away it was not her ear that heard the words all the ear does is register changes in pressure by their action on the little stirrup and anvil bones just as all the eye does is respond to changes in lightsensitive chemicals it is up to the nerves to report these things to the brain but they only report coded symbols of the things not the things themselves for the nerves cannot carry the sound of a voice or the sight of mont blanc all they transmit is impulses they are no more real than the digitized voice of a person on a phone it is up to the mind that inhabits the brain to assemble the e coded impulses into information or pleasure or beauty and a mind that happens to be inhabiting machine storage can do that just as well so the pleasure all the pleasures were as real as pleasure ever is and if the mere pursuit of pleasure began to pall after a millennium or two he could work some of the greatest music of the period was composed by ghosts and from them came some of the greatest advances in scientific theory it was really surprising that nevertheless so many people still preferred to cling to their organic lives all of this led to a rather surprising situation though it took awhile for anyone to realize it when the gateway explorers started bringing back useful heechee technology the world population on earth wasnt much more than ten billion that was only a tiny fraction of all the human beings who had ever lived of course the best guess anybody would make about the total census wasoh well maybelets say somewhere around a hundred billion people that included everybody it included you and your neighbor and your cousins barber it included the president of the united states and the pope and the woman who drove your school bus when you were nine it included all the casualties in the civil war the american revolution and the peloponnesian wars and their survivors too all the romanovs and hohenzollerns and ptolemys and all the jukes and kallikaks as well jesus christ caesar augustus and the innkeepers in bethlehem the first tribes to cross the land bridge from siberia to the new world and also the tribes who stayed behind q x and the original african eve what it included was everybody living or dead who was taxonomically human and born before that first year of gateway that came as we said to a grand total of people of whom the great majority were deceased then along came heechee or heecheeinspired medicine and things got started the numbers of the living meat people doubled and doubled again and kept on doubling and they lived longer too with modern medicine they didnt die before they wanted to with medical encouragement and no painful penalties they generally and generally lots of them and when they did well when they did die they also still lived in mechanical storage and among that growing electronic population there were no fatalities at all so the number of the living continued to increase while the number of the truly dead remained essentially static and the result was inevitable but when the point was reached it still took everyone by surprise for at last in human history the living outnumbered the dead all of that had some interesting consequences the eightyyearold woman writing her xrated memoirs of youthful indiscretions couldnt drop the names of video stars gangsters and bishops anymorenot unless the indiscretions had really happened anyway because the video stars gangsters and bishops were still around to correct the record it was a great plus for the oldest persons in machine storage though the names that they dropped from their meat days were well and truly dead and in no condition to dispute the stories it wasnt bad to be a meat person anymore hardly any of them were poor well they werent money poor not even on earth nor were they poor in possessions all their factories with all their clever robots were turning out smart kitchen appliances and fun game machines and talkanywhere videotelephones and they were doing it all the time the cities got really big detroit led the way in the old united states with its threehundredstory new renaissance megastructures that covered everything from wayne state university dormitories to the river a hundred and seventy million people lived in that crystal ziggurat and every one of them had personal tvs with three hundred channels and holographic vcrs to fill any gaps left by the networks out in the navajo reservation the tribe erected a morethanpaolosoleri arcology the lowest forty stories produced frozen diet meals clothing and woven rugs for the tourist trade and all above was filled with extended navajo families on the sands of the kalahari desert the kungs entered a life of plenty and ease china reached twenty billion that year each family with its fridge and electric wok even in moscow the shelves of the gum department store were loaded with clock radios playing cards and leisure suits there wasnt any problem producing anything anyone wanted anymore the energy was there the raw materials cascaded down from space agriculture had become as rationalized as industry at last robots planted the fields and robots harvested the cropsgenetically tailored crops enriched with artificial nonpolluting fertilizers and trickleirrigated drop by drop by smart automatic valves and the whole of course supplemented by the chonfood factories and if anyone still felt that earth was not giving him all he chose to desirethere was always the rest of the galaxy that was what the meat people had what the machinestored had of course was much more it was everything everything they had ever wanted and everything they could imagine really there was only one real problem with machine storage after death and that was relative time that couldnt be helped machines move faster than meat in the interactions between the machinestored and the meat persons they had left behind it was a considerable handicap to conversation the machinestored found the meat people desperately boring it was easy enough for the stillliving to talk with their dear departed but it was not a lot of fun it was as bad as trying to make small talk with the sluggards all over again while the fleshandblood person was struggling to complete a single question his machinestored departed had time to eat a meal play a few rounds of golf and read war and peace the fact that the machinestored moved so much faster brought about some emotional problems for their meat relicts too it was particularly disconcerting right after a death by the time the funeral was over and the bereft put in a call for the one who had gone before the one who had gone on had likely gone to take a relaxing if simulated cruise through the norwegian fjords learned to play the violin and made a hundred new machinestored friends the survivors might still have tear stains on their cheeks but the deceased had almost forgotten his dying in fact when he thought about his life in the flesh his feelings were probably nostalgic but also quite glad all that was overlike any elderly adult remembering his own blundering confused worried childhood as one small consequence machinestorage put the undertakers out of business the machinestored did not need a mausoleum to be remembered deaths were still marked by ceremonies but they were more like a wedding reception than a wake the business went to caterers rather than funeral directors psychologists worried about this for a while with the dead still alive and even reachable how would the bereaved manage their grief when push came to shove the answer was obvious grief wasnt a problem there wasnt much to grieve unfortunately full stomachs and comfortable lives do not necessarily make human beings good such things probably do help a little nevertheless the worms of ambition and envy that live in the human mind are not easily sated as far back as the twentieth century it was observed that the manual laborer who managed to promote himself from coldwater flat to a ranch house with a vcr and a sports car could still feel pangs of envy toward his neighbor with the jacuzzi and the thirtytwofoot cabin cruiser the human race didnt change just because they had acquired heechee technology there were still people who wanted what other people had badly enough to try to take it away from them so theft did not disappear nor did thwarted lovers or brooding victims or simple psychopaths who tried to heal their grievances by means of rape assault or murder an earlier age took care of such people either by caging them in penitentiaries or turning them over to the executioner the age of gold had better ways they were less revengeful and maybe less satisfying to some of the punishmentminded but they worked society was at last fully protected from its renegades if there were still prisons they were manned by computerdriven robot guards who neither slept nor took bribes better than prisons there were planets of exile where severe offenders could be deported a criminal dropped on a lowtech planet could probably feed himself and continue to live but there was no way he could ever build himself an interstellar spaceship to get back to civilization and for the worst cases there was hereafter their minds faithfully reproduced in machine storage their bodies no longer mattered they could be disposed of without a qualm it was capital punishment without its depressingly final aspects after the sentence was carried out the criminals werent dead they were still aliveafter a fashion anywaybut they were rendered permanently harmless from that sort of prison no one ever was paroled and no one could ever manage to escape all it required in order to make all these things happen given the knowledge of the devices themselves was energy there too the heechee came through the secret of heechee power generation came out of study of the core of the food factory and it was cold fusion it was the same compression of two atoms of hydrogen into one of helium that went on in the core of any star but not at those same temperatures the output heat of the reaction came at about celsiusa nearly ideal temperature for generating electricityand the process was safe so the power was there it was cheap and it put ten thousand fuelburning power plants out of business so that the carbondioxide greenhouse warmup of the earth came to a halt and the pollution of earths air stopped overnight small vehicles burned hydrogen or ran by flywheel kineticenergy storage everything else took its power off the grids things were really getting to be very nice on earth because human technology hadnt stopped either for not everything in mankinds flowering of science and technology was a gift from the heechee there were computers for instance human computers were intrinsically better and more advanced than those of the heechee because the heechee had never gone the addingmachinetomainframe route their methods of dealing with data handling were quite different and in some ways not as good once the human scientists had begun to figure ways of adding heechee refinements to the already powerful human machines there was an explosion of knowledge that sparked new technologies in every part of human life quantumeffect devices had long since replaced the clumsy doped silicon microchips and so computers had become orders of magnitude faster and better no one had to tap out a program on a keypad any more he told the computer what he wanted done and the computer did it if the instructions were inadequate the computer asked the right questions to clear it upit was facetoface communication a machinegenerated hologram speaking to its fleshandblood master heechee food and heechee power human computers heechee biochemistry allied to human medicine the human world at last allowed true humanity to every persoh who lived on it and if even so any human wanted more there was a whole galaxy waiting for him that was now within his reach there remained the burning and neverforgotten question of the heechee themselves they were elusive their works were everywhere but no one had ever seen a living heechee though every last gateway explorer had wanted to look and almost every human on earth dreamed of what they would be like when found arguments raged answers were scarce the prevailing theory was that somehow in some tragic way the heechee had died off perhaps they had killed themselves in a catastrophic war perhaps they had for reasons not known emigrated to a distant galaxy perhaps they had suffered a universal plagueor reverted to barbarismor simply decided that they no longer wanted to bother with traveling through interstellar space what everyone agreed on at last was that the heechee were gone and that was just where everyone was very wrong it was not true that the heechee had died certainly not as a race and funnily enough in an astonishing number of cases they hadnt even died as individuals the heechees were very much alive and well the reason they were not found was simply that they didnt want to be for good and sufficient reasons of their own they had decided to conceal themselves from any unwelcome attention for a few hundred thousand years the place where the heechee hid was in the core of the galaxy within an immense black holea black hole so enormous that it contained thousands of stars and planets and satellites and asteroids all orbiting together in a space so small that their combined mass had pulled space in around them the heechee were all there several billion of them living on some roofedover planets inside their core to create their immense hideyhole the heechee had tugged together individual stars together with their appurtenant planets and other orbiting objects that gave them among other things some really spectacular nighttime skies from the surface of the earth human beings can see at most maybe four thousand stars with the naked eye ranging from fiery bluewhite sirius all the way down to the sixthmagnitude ones that lie on the squinting border of visibility the heechee had more than twice that many to look at and they were easier to see because they were a whole hell of a lot closerblue ones far brighter than that familiar sirius ruby ones almost as bright as earths moon asterisms of a hundred stars in a bunch and all wondrously bright of course that same stellar population density kept the heechee from having much in the way of nights except when the clouds were thick they just werent used to much darkness on their planets inside the core there was seldom a time when the collective stellar effulgence didnt give them light enough at least to read by with all those stars they had plenty of planets to live on the heechee only occupied a fraction of the available planets but they had made the ones they chose to live on very homey naturally a very high proportion of those planets were temperately warm benign in atmosphere and rightsized for the kind of surface gravity the heechee enjoyed that wasnt any accident they had naturally chosen the cream of the crop to shift into their core colony so they could inhabit them there they built their cities and their factories and laid out their farms and cultivated their oceanic fish pondsnone of those things looked exactly like the human equivalents but they all worked just as well generally they worked a lot better all of this building and making and growing was so thriftily done that the heechee avoided pollution and everything unsightly they were as snug as bugs in a rug it wasnt quite perfect but then nothing is jamaica has hurricanes southern california has its santa ana winds even tahiti has its rainy seasons the most nearly ideal of climates generally has a few unpleasant kinds of weather the heechee had their own weather problems in their core hideaway for them it wasnt rain or wind it was the builtin nastiness of any black hole black holes pull whatever happens to be nearby into themselves they do o with great force producing high velocities and a lot of turmoil this expresses itself in radiation it was only from this production of radiation that black holes were first detected by human astronomers and it is deadly ionizing stuff so everywhere in the core there was a permanent shower of damaging charged particles which meant that the heechee usually had to roof over their worlds the crystal spheres that surrounded every planet kept out the more dangerous radiation from all those nasty sources meanwhile the schwarzschild radius of their immense black hole kept out something they feared even more that was why they had retreated the way they had now they were waiting of course the heechee needed a way in and out of their great black hole and of course they had one human beings had the same thing too in some of those abandoned heechee ships they had found but it didnt do them much good because they didnt know they had it that was a general problem with heechee technology when human beings found pieces of it they also found a lot of confusion the heechee had not been kind enough to leave operating manuals for the humans to pore over they hadnt even put labels on the machinesat least not in any way that human beings could read the best way for human beings to find out what all those gizmos and gadgets were for was what used to be called reverse engineering which basically meant taking them apart to see how they worked the trouble with that was that when engineers tried it the damned things often blew up so they tended to treat the machinery with caution and if they didnt know what it was for and couldnt figure out any way of trying it out they tended to leave it alone take that crystally twisty rod sort of thing that was part of the furnishings of some but not all heechee ships they knew it had a purpose they didnt know what it was if anyone on earth had known where the heechee lived they might have guessed that one a lot sooner but no one did and so the human race had in its hands an instrument for penetrating black holes long before anyone knew what it could do it was a while before any human being knew exactly what a heechee looked like for that matter still they are easy enough to describe a male heechee is about five feet tall on average his head is the aryan ideal nordic squaredoff block only a little more so though his skin color isnt nordic at all if he is male it is probably a sort of oakbark brown if female she is generally somewhat paler the heechee skin looks as though it were carved out of shiny plas tic a dense fine growth of hair covers his scalp or would if he didnt keep it cropped very short he smells ammoniacal to human beingsthe heechee themselves dont notice it there is no iris to his eyes there isnt really even a pupil just a vaguely xshaped dark blotch in the middle of a pinkish eyeball his tongue is forked and his general build well what you would think of a heechees bodily build would depend on whether you were looking at him from the front or from the side if a human being were squeezed flat he would come out of it looking like a heechee viewed from the front your heechee would look formidable from the side quite frail what he would most look like would be the cardboardcutout skeletons children decorate their schoolrooms with at halloween this was especially true around the hip and leg joints because the heechee pelvis was structurally rather different from the human the legs attached directly to the ends of the pelvis like a crocodiles so there was a considerable space between the legs as a heechee stood e r ct the heechee didnt waste that space it was the most convenient place for a heechee to carry anything so the sorts of loads human beings would be likely to lug in their arms or on their shoulders the heechee carried slung between their legs in fact all civilized heechee carried a large tapering pouch there in it they kept two main itemsthe microwave generators they needed for their comfort and the storage facilities for the ancient ancestors whose minds they carried around with them as a human being might carry a pocket calculatoras well as their equivalents of fountain pens and credit cards and photos of their near and dear and when the heechee sat down what they sat on was the pouch although hard and shiny the heechee integument was not thick you could see the movement of the bones through it you could even see the muscles and tendons working especially when the heechee was excitedit was a kind of body language something like a humans grinding his teeth their speech was somewhat hissy their gestures were not at all like those of earthmen they didnt shake their heads in negation they flapped their wrists instead the heechee had descended from a race of burrowers like prairie dogs rather than arboreal tree climbers moved to the plains as people had therefore the heechee possessed several traits that their heredity had laid on them no heechee ever suffered from claustrophobia they liked being in enclosed spaces their family lives were not exactly like those of humans nor were their occupations nor were their equivalents of politics fashion and religion they had two sexes like people and sex was sometimes obsessive in their mindsas with peoplebut for long periods they hardly thought about the subject strangely they had never evolved equivalents of such human institutions as a government bureaucracy or a financial economy humans didnt understand how they could operate without these things but the heechee thought that in those respects human ways were pretty repulsive too since by the time human beings got far enough out into space to have some chance of encountering heechee most employed human persons were in these whitecollar occupations they were startled to find that most heechee were in their view unemployed it wasnt just that the human polisci and sociology professors wondered how the heechee managed to get along without kings presidents or maximum leaders even on earth generations of anarchists libertarians and smallisbeautiful philosophers had been claiming that human beings didnt need such things either the real puzzle was how the heechee had escaped having them anyway it took a number of anthropologists and cultural behaviorists a long time to come up with an explanatory theory that phenomenon too seemed to have an evolutionary basis it came from the fact that the preheechee nonsapientsthe primitive species they labeled heecheeidshad burrowed in the ground like prairie dogs or trapdoor spiders they did not form tribes they staked out territories therefore heecheeids did not conduct tribal wars or struggle for succession to a throne there wasnt any throne to succeed to no heecheeid ever had any need or desire that conflicted with any other heecheeas long as the other guy stayed out of his territory of course you cant build a hightech spacefaring civilization out of solitary noninterfering individuals but by the time the primitive heechee had reached the point of projects so ambitious that they required the cooperation of many their habits were set they had never formed the custom of patriotism they didnt have nations to be patriotic to they did have a code of behaviorlawsand institutions to codify and enforce them but that was about it earthly governments spent mst of their energies defending themselves against the attacks ofor waging their own attacks againstthe governments of other nations when the reciprocal threat was physical the method of doing so was military when the threat was economic the effort was expressed in subsidies tariffs and embargoes the heechee didnt need such national enterprises having no nations to compete with each other and so the heechees lived in their crowded core contentedly enough while they waited to be discovered their lives within the core were not entirely normal by human standards however there was one significant divergence from normality the heechee had been living there for some half a million yearssince not long after they visited the early earth and carried away a handful of australopithecines to see what the stupid little beasts might develop into given a chancebut it didnt seem that long to them albert einstein would have immediately understood why that was in fact he had predicted something like it the heechee were within a black hole therefore they obeyed the cosmological rules governing black holes including the phenomenon of time dilation time that sped along in the outer galaxy passed with glacial slowness inside the core the ratio was something like to that was a very great differenceso great that many of the heechees who had left their ships on gateway were still alive inside the core oh they had grown a bit older yes time hadnt stopped but for them only a few decades had passed not half a million years and when the heechee ran away and hid they left sentinels behind them they had a plan there was an unfortunate element of risk to their plan the heechee could not be certain that some other intelligent spacefaring race would evolve and find the artifacts they had left and use them and if those things didnt happen the plan was wasted still that was the way to bet it they counted on it in fact and so the heechee had set robot sentinels in concealed places in the galaxy to find these new races when they showed up when the human race began to make noise in the galaxy the heechees watchmen heard it the heechee then employed that twisted crystal and ebon rod that they called the heechee equivalent of can opener to come out and check their collection traps to see just what had begun to happen in the galaxy in the last few centuries as a normal precaution the heechee sent a routine scouting party out to investigate but that is really quite another story
