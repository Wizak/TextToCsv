nora roberts irish hearts irish hearts book irish thoroughbread chapter adelia cunnane stared out the window without seeing the magic layer of clouds some formed into mountains others glaciers flattening and thinning into an iceencrusted lake but for one experiencing her first air journey she found the view uninspiring her mind was crowded with doubts and uncertainties that merged with a strong pang of homesickness for a small farm in ireland but both farm and ireland were now very far away and every minute that crawled by brought her closer to america and strangers she knew with a sigh of frustration that nothing in her life had ever prepared her properly to cope with either her parents had been killed in a lorry accident leaving her an orphan at the tender age of ten in the weeks that followed her parents death adelia had drifted though a fog of shock turning inward to ward off the agony of separation the strange and terrifying feeling of desertion slowly a wall had been constructed around the pain and she had thrown herself into the work of the farm with an adults dedication her fathers sister lettie cunnane had taken over both child and farm running both with a firm hand although never unkind neither had she been affectionate she had possessed little patience or understanding for the unpredictable often tempestuous child the farm had been the only common ground between them and woman and child had built their relationship with the dark fertile soil and the hours of labor it required they had lived and worked together for nearly thirteen years then lettie had suffered a paralyzing stroke and adelia had been forced to divide her time between the duties of the farm and caring for an invalids needs days and nights had merged together as she waged the determined battle to shoulder the increasing responsibility her enemies had been the lack of time and the lack of money when after six long months she was again left alone adelia was near the point of exhausted desperation her aunt was gone and though she had worked unceasingly the farm had had to be sold for taxes she had written to her only remaining relative her fathers elder brother padrick who had emigrated to america twenty years previously informing him of his sisters death his answer had been immediate the letter warm and loving asking her to join him the last sentence of the missive was a simple gentle command come to america your home is with me now so she had packed her few belongings sold or given away what could not be taken with her and said goodbye to skibbereen and the only home she had ever known a sudden movement of the plane jolted adelia back from memory she sat back against the cushions of her seat fingering the small gold cross she always wore around her neck there was nothing left for her in ireland she told herself fighting against the flutters of her stomach everything she had loved there was dead and padrick cunnane was the only family she had left the only link with what she had once had she pushed back a surge of sudden unaccustomed fear america irelandwhat difference did it make her shoulders moved restlessly she would manage hadnt she always managed she was determined not to be a burden to her uncle the vague shadowy man she knew only from letters whom she had last seen when barely three there would be work for her she reasoned perhaps on the horse farm her uncle had written of so often over the years her ability to work with animals was innate and she had absorbed a varied knowledge of medicine through her experiences her skill being such that she had often been called on to aid in a difficult calving or stitch up a rent hide she was strong despite her diminutive statureand she reminded herself with an unconscious squaring of shoulders she was a cunnane surely she told herself with more confidence there would be a place for her at royal meadows where her uncle worked as trainer for the thoroughbred racing stock thered be no fields needing plowing no cows needing milking but shed earn her bread and butter if she had to work as a scullery maid she wondered suddenly with a small frown if they had scullery maids in america the plane touched down and adelia disembarked and entered the dulles terminal in virginia where she found herself gaping in confusion fascinated by the scene confused by the babble of foreign tongues the odd mixture of people her eyes lingered over an east indian family in full native dress she turned to observe two teenagers in faded denims strolling by hand in hand followed by a scurrying middleaged businessman clutching a leather briefcase later standing in the lobby she looked around hoping to see a familiar face everyone rushing and hurrying she thought a body could be trampled and never seen again dee little dee a man hurried toward her a stockily built compact man with a full thatch of curling gray hair and she caught a glimpse of eyes as bright and blue as her fathers before she was enveloped in a warm crushing hug the thought occurred to her that it had been a lifetime since anyone had held her so close little dee i would have known you anywhere he pulled back and studied her face eyes misty smile tender its like looking into kates face againits the image of your mother you are he continued to stare at her while she searched for her voice his gaze taking in the deep rich auburn hair falling in gleaming waves to her shoulders the large deep green of thickly lashed eyes the tiptilted nose and full mouth which aunt lettie had described as impudent the face now of a startled pixie what a beautiful sight you are he said at last on a sigh of pure pleasure uncle padrick she asked finding a multitude of questions and emotions racing through her and who else would you be thinking i might be he looked down at her with those wellremembered eyes filled with love and laughter and doubts fears and questions vanished in a wave of joy uncle paddy she whispered as she flung her arms around his neck as they drove along the highway from the airport adelia stared about her in fresh amazement never had she seen so many cars and all flying by at an outrageous speed everything moved so fast and the noise she marveled silently the noise was enough to wake the dead shaking her head she began to bombard her uncle with questions how far was it they were going did everyone drive so fast in america how many horses were at royal meadows when could she see them questions buzzed in her mind and through her lips and paddy answered them tolerantly finding the soft lilt of her voice as sweet as a summer breeze where is it ill be working he removed his eyes from the road a moment and glanced at her theres no need for you to be working dee oh but uncle paddy i must she disagreed turning to face him i could work with the horses ive a way with animals thick gray brows drew together in a doubtful frown i didnt bring you all this way to be putting you to work before she could protest he went on and i dont know what travis would be thinking about me hiring my own niece oh but id do anything she brushed back masses of chestnut hair groom the horses muck out the stalls cart hayit doesnt matter unknowingly she used her eyes in an outrageous manner please uncle paddy its crazy id be in a week not having some sort of work to do her eyes won the small battle and paddy squeezed her hand well see so engrossed had she been in their conversation and the fascinating stream of traffic that she had lost all track of time when paddy pulled into a drive and halted the car adelia gazed about her with new wonder royal meadows dee he announced with a sweeping gesture of his hand your new home the entrance to the long winding drive was flanked by two tall stone pillars and bushes studded with the promise of flowering buds continued along its path as far as she could see the grass was brilliantly green over softly rolling hills and horses grazed lazily in the distance the finest horse farm in all of maryland sure as faith paddy added with possessive pride as he proceeded along the curving drive andin padrick cunnanes opinionthe finest in the whole of america the car rounded a bend in the drive and adelia caught her breath as the main house came into view an immense structure or so it seemed to her with three magnificent stories of old and muted stone dozens of windows winked in the gleaming sun like large clear eyes wide and boldly glistening they were a sharp contrast to the stones mellowness skirting the top two stories were balconies the design of wrought iron as intricate and delicate as the finest lace the house stood on a gently sloping lawn of closecropped green graced with bushes and stately trees just awakening from their winter sleep beautiful isnt it dee aye she agreed awed by its size and elegance the grandest house ive ever seen well our house isnt so grand as this he turned the car left as the drive forked past the stone building but its a fine place and i hope youll be happy there adelia turned her attention to her uncle with a smile that transformed her face into a work of art ill be happy uncle paddy as long as youre with me letting impulse guide her movements she leaned over and kissed his cheek ah dee im glad youre here he took her hand in a firm grip youve brought the spring with you the car came to a halt and adelia turned to look out the front window her mouth falling open at what greeted her eyes an oval track commanded her view and across from it stood a large white building which paddy identified as the stables fences and paddocks checkerboarded the area and the scent of hay and horses drifted through the air in solemn amazement she gazed about and the thought sped through her brain that she had not moved from one farm to another but from one world to another at home the farm had meant the earth with its blessings and curses a small barn in constant need of repair a strip of pasture here the space alone made her eyes widen so much space to belong to one man but as well as space she recognized the efficiency and the order in fresh white buildings and splitrail fences in the distance where the hills began their soft roll she saw mares grazing while their foals frolicked with the joy of spring and youth travis grant she mused recalling the name of the owner from paddys letters travis grant knows how to care for what he owns theres my house now paddy pointed out the opposite window our house now following his direction she let out a cry of pleasure the first story of the building was a large white garage which she learned later serviced the trailers and trucks used for transporting the thoroughbreds atop this was a stone structure nearly twice as large as the farmhouse in which she had spent her life it was a miniature replica of the main house with the same native stonework and glistening windows graced with balconies come inside dee get a look at your new home he led her down a narrow crushed stone path and up the stairs to the front door opening it wide and nudging her ahead of him a bright cozy room welcomed her with pale green walls and a shining oak floor a brightly checked sofa and matching chair invited her to sit in front of the raised hearth when the weather was cool or contemplate rambling hills through wide sheerdraped windows oh uncle paddy she sighed making an inadequate but expressive movement of her hands come dee ill show you the rest he led her through the house her wide eyes growing larger with each new discovery from the kitchen with its sunny yellow fixtures and spotless counters to the bath where creamy ivory tiles made her dream of languishing for hours in hot soapy water this is your room darlin he opened the door across from the bath and adelia stepped inside it was not an overly large room but to her inexperienced eyes it was huge indeed the walls were painted a robinsegg blue and sheer white curtains billowed and swayed at two opened windows the soft blue and white was repeated in the flower print of the bedspread and a fluffy white rug lay on the wooden floor the mirror over the maple dresser reflected the expression of stunned pleasure on her face the knowledge that the room was to be hers brought unaccustomed tears to her eyes blinking them away she turned and threw her arms around her uncles neck later they strolled across the lawn toward the stables adelia had changed from the dress she had worn for the trip and was now clad in her more customary attire of jeans and cotton shut with her auburn curls pulled up and covered by a faded blue hat she had convinced her uncle that rest was not what she needed and that seeing the horses was what she wanted above all else with her face glowing and eyes pleading paddy would have found it impossible to deny her anything approaching the stables they spotted a small group gathered around a chestnut thoroughbred the raised voices reached uncle and niece before their presence was noted and what might be the problem here paddy demanded paddy glad youre back a tall husky man greeted him with obvious relief majesty just had one of his spells gave tom a bad kick paddy transferred his attention to a small spare young man seated on the ground nursing his thigh and muttering how bad is it lad did you break anything naw nothing broke disgust was more evident than pain in both voice and face but i dont guess ill be riding for a couple of days looking over at the dark chestnut he shook his head with a mixture of resentment and reluctant amusement that horse may be the fastest thing on four legs but hes meaner than a stompedon cat his eyes arent mean adelia commented and several pairs of eyes focused on her for the first time this is adelia my niece dee this is hank manners assistant trainer tom buckley on the ground there is an exercise boy and george johnson and stan beall grooms after the introductions had been completed adelia quickly turned her attention back to the horse they dont understand you do they ah but youre a fine fellow miss hank cautioned as she lifted a hand to stroke his muzzle i wouldnt do that hes not in the best of moods to begin with and he doesnt take to strangers ooch but its not strangers well be for long smiling she stroked the length of his strong muzzle and majesty blew from wide nostrils paddy hank began in cautious warning but the other man lifted a hand to silence him a fine beautiful horse you are ive never seen another to compare with you and thats the truth of it she continued to speak as she ran her hands over his smooth neck and side youre built for runningstrong long legs and a fine wide chest her hands moved over him freely as the horse remained still ears at attention she fondled his nose before resting her cheek against his neck i bet youre lonely for someone to talk to ill be switched hank observed adelias confident handling of the frisky colt and shook his head hes never let anyone do that before not even you paddy animals have feelings as well mr manners she brought her face from the thoroughbreds neck and turned around he wants some pampering well little lady you certainly seem to have a way with him he gave her a grin expressive of both amusement and admiration before turning his attention to paddy he still needs to be exercised ill give steve a call uncle paddy adelia grabbed his arm on impulse eyes shining with excitement i can do it let me take him out i dont think a little lady like you could handle a big firebreather like majesty hank put in before paddy could speak and adelia drew herself up to the full of her five feet two inches and tilted her chin theres nothing on four legs i cant ride is travis back yet paddy concealed his smile and addressed hank no he eyed paddy through narrowed lids youre not thinking of letting her take him out id say shes about the right sizecouldnt weigh over a hundred pounds he gave his niece a thorough survey one hand rubbing his chin paddy hanks hand descended on his shoulder only to be ignored youre a cunnane arent you lass if you say you can handle him then by the saints you can adelia beamed at her uncle and told him firmly she was indeed a cunnane god knows what the boss is going to say when he finds out hank muttered finding himself against a solid wall of family alliance just leave travis to me paddy answered with calm authority with a shrug of his shoulders and another incoherent mutter hank resigned himself to paddys loss of common sense once around the track dee her uncle instructed pace him to what you can handle i can see from the look of him he wants his head pulling her cap lower she nodded watching the welltrimmed hooves paw the ground in impatience with an easy vault she was in the saddle and as hank opened the wide gate she took majesty onto the dirt track leaning forward she whispered in his ear as he sidestepped and strained to be off ready dee paddy called as an afterthought he pulled out his stopwatch aye were ready straightening she took a deep breath go he shouted and horse and rider lunged down the track crouching low over the thoroughbreds neck she urged him on to the speed for which he thirsted the wind beat against her face stinging her eyes as they tore over the dirt at a pace she had never experienced never imagined but somehow had craved it was a wild exhilarating adventure both horse and rider reveled in the unbridled sensation as they sped as one around the oval track sun wind and speed their companions she laughed and shouted to her partner a new sense of freedom liberating her from the concerns and worries that had been a part of her life for so long for a few short moments she was riding the clouds away from pressure away from responsibility in a glorious haven that returned her to carefree childhood when they came to the end of the run she slowed the horse gradually to a halt and flung her arms around his gleaming neck ill be a son of a gun hank said in simple astonishment what were you expecting paddy questioned feeling as proud as a peacock with two tails shes a cunnane he held out the stopwatch for hank to see not a bad time either with a final smile he strutted over as adelia slipped to the ground oh uncle paddy her eyes gleamed like emeralds against her flushed face and she pulled off her cap flourishing it in excitement hes the grandest horse in the world it was like riding pegasus himself that was nice riding little lady hank extended his hand shaking his head in admiration both for her ability and for the gleaming hair that now spilled over her shoulders thank you mr manners she accepted his hand with a smile hank she grinned hank well adelia cunnane paddy slipped his arm around her shoulders royal meadows just hired another exercise boy youve got yourself a job lying in her bed that night adelia stared wideeyed at the ceiling so many things had happened in so short a time that her mind refused to relax and allow her body rest after her ride on the thoroughbred she had been taken through the stables introduced to more hands and more horses shown into a tackroom that contained more leather than she had ever seen in one place at one time and exposed to more people and more things than she believed she had ever been exposed to in her life and all in the course of one day paddy had prepared their dinner firmly refusing assistance and she had merely watched as he bustled around the kitchen the stove she decided had more to do with magic than technology and a machine that washed and dried the dishes at a touch of a buttonmarvels hearing abut such things and reading about them was one matter but seeing them with your own eyes it was easier to believe in the pooka and the little people when with a sigh she said as much to her uncle he threw back his head and laughed until tears flowed down his cheeks then enveloped her in a hug as crushing as the one he had greeted her with at the airport they had eaten at the small dinette set by the kitchen window and she had answered all his questions about skibbereen the meal was full of talking and laughing and paddys eyes twinkled continually at her colorful descriptions and outrageous stories she elaborated here and there her hands working with her words brows raising over guileless eyes as she stretched truth into an obvious exaggeration her uncle had noticed the faint shadows under them however and urged her to retire early overcoming her protests with the deft suggestion that she had need to be fresh in the morning so adelia had obeyed drawing a steaming tub and wallowing in unfamiliar luxury for what she knew aunt lettie would have considered a sinful amount of time when at last she lay between the cool fresh sheets she found it impossible to relax her mind was full crowded with new sensations new images and her body so used to complete exhaustion before sleep was unable to cope with the lack of physical exertion easing out of bed she exchanged her nightdress for jeans and shirt and piling her hair once more under the absurd cap slipped noiselessly from the sleeping house the night was clear cool and quiet a vague breeze sweetening the air only the bright insistent call of a whippoorwill breaking the stillness the light of the half moon guided her toward the stables as she strolled without thought of destination over the smooth new grass the stillness the familiar scent of animals reminded her of home and suddenly she felt a contentment and peace she had not even known she had lived without hesitating outside the door of the large white stables she debated whether she dare enter and spend the last of her evening with the horses having decided there was no harm in it she was reaching out for the handle when an iron grip closed around her arm and whirled her around and she was lifted off her feet for a moment like a rag doll just what do you think youre doing and how did you get in here she stared wordlessly at the owner of the harsh angry voice a vague shadow silhouetted in the dim moonlight looming over her like an avenging giant she searched for her own voice but the combination of shock and pain had stolen it her words slipped down her throat as she felt herself being dragged into the building here lets have a look at you the voice growled as its owner switched on the lights he spun her around dislodging her cap and the glory of her hair escaped its confinement to form a fiery cascade down her back what the youre a girl he released his firm hold and adelia stepped back and began to give him both sides of her irish tongue sure and its observant you are to be noticing that she rubbed her arm vigorously while her green eyes glared up at her astonished assailant and who are you to come around grabbing innocent people and crushing their bones a great hulking bully you are sneaking up on a body and dragging and pulling them about a horsewhipping is what youre deserving for scaring the life from me and nearly breaking my arm in the process you may be pintsized but youre packed with dynamite the man observed obviously amused he wondered as he looked over her softly rounded shape how he could have mistaken her for a boy from your accent i could make a guess that youre little dee paddys niece im adelia cunnane but its not your little dee i am she regarded him with unconcealed resentment and its not me whos having the accent its you he threw back his head and roared with laughter increasing adelias fury oh i am glad to have made you so happy folding her arms across her chest she tossed her head rich dark curls swinging wildly and who in the world are you id like to know im travis he answered still grinning travis grant chapter it was adelias turn to gape at her companion as the mists of fury cleared from her eyes she saw him clearly for the first time he was tall and powerfully built and the sleeves of his shirt were carelessly rolled above his elbows revealing deeply tanned muscular arms he had chiseled features clear and sharp and his eyes were so blue against the brown of his skin that they startled the casual onlooker his hair was rich and full thick black curls in a disarming disarray to his collar and the mouth that continued to grin at her was well formed showing strong white teeth this was the man she was to work for this was the man she needed to impress adelias brain registered numbly and she had just raked him clean with her furious tongue jakers she whispered shutting her eyes a moment and wishing she could disappear in a puff of smoke im sorry we met under such uhhe hesitated his mouth twitching againconfusing circumstances adelia paddys been on top of the world since he made arrangements to bring you over from ireland i didnt expect to be meeting you till tomorrow mr grant she clung desperately to pride and kept her voice even uncle paddy said you wouldnt be back i didnt expect to find a halfpint fairy invading my stables travis returned grinning once again adelia straightened her spine and threw him a haughty look i couldnt sleep so i came for a walk i was thinking i might look in on majesty majestys a very highstrung animal travis admonished his gaze roaming over her from top to bottom youd best keep a respectable distance and how will i be doing that she demanded imperiously disconcerted by his masculine appraisal im to be exercising him regularly the devil you are his eyes rose to hers and narrowed if you think id let a slip of a thing like you on my prize colt youve lost your senses ive already been on your prize colt anger returned and her head tossed with it i rode around your track on him in fine time i dont believe it he took a step toward her and her head was forced to tilt still further paddy wouldnt let you up on majesty im not in the habit of lying mr grant adelia retorted with great dignity the boy tom got a kick for his trouble so i rode majesty instead you rode majesty travis repeated in slow even tones that i did she agreed then noting the anger hardening the blue eyes sped on hes a beauty rides like the wind but hes not badtempered he wouldnt have been kicking tom if the boy had understood him better she was speaking rapidly not giving travis an opportunity to comment the poor thing just needed someone to talk to him someone to show him he was loved and appreciated and you can talk to horses traviss lips curved on the question aye she agreed unaware of the mocking gleam that lit his eyes anyone can if theyve a mind to i know animals mr grant i worked with the vet back in skibbereen and i know a bit about healing as well i would never do anything to bring harm to majesty or any of your other horses uncle paddy trusted me you mustnt be angry with him he said nothing to this only took his time studying her as her extraordinary eyes unknowingly employed their power as his silence and intense regard continued she felt a small tingle of fear mixed with another sensation strange and foreign that she was unable to decipher mr grant she began swallowing pride to plead please give me a chancea fortnight no more she took a deep breath and moistened her lips if you dont want me after that just tell me and ill abide by your decision ill tell uncle paddy im not happy with the job that i want to be doing something else why would you do that his head tilted as if to gain a new perspective its what id have to do she returned with a shrug and a push at her tumbled hair otherwise id be putting him in the middle hes devoted to you and to this placei know that from the letters he wrote mebut hes taken me on as his responsibility now if i told him you had fired me his loyalties would be torn in two ill not be the cause of that will you give me a twoweek trial mr grant pride goeth before destruction she quoted silently trying to remember aunt letties lectures on humility she stood determined not to squirm under his silent contemplation wishing he would not look at her as if he could read the thoughts running through her brain all right adelia he said at length youll have your twoweek trial just between us a brilliant smile lit her face and she extended her hand thank you mr grant im grateful to you he accepted her hand but his returning smile faded a frown replacing it as he turned her palm up and examined it her hand was exquisitely small fingers long and tapering but it was rough and calloused from years of the abuse of labor the continued contact was sending odd tingles through her body and she looked down helplessly at the hand under his critical scrutiny is something the matter she asked in a voice she barely recognized he raised his eyes and looked into hers with an expression she could not fathom its a crime for such a tiny hand to be as hard and rough as any ditchdiggers unaccountably stung by his softly spoken words she jerked her hand away holding it behind her back im sorry theyre not as soft as a lily mr grant but its not ladys hands ill be needing for the job im doing for you if youll excuse me now ill be going in she moved past him quickly and he watched her run like a rabbit across the grass and out of sight birdcalls broke the nights slumber and adelia woke with the sun she dressed quickly happy with the anticipation of beginning her job a job which was to her more of a magic wish granted than labor she was sure she could prove herself to travis grant a new home a new life a new beginning she stared out at the infant sun and knew it would bring nothing but wonders the scent of frying bacon led paddy to the kitchen and he stood for a moment watching her movements while she remained unaware of his presence she was humming an old tune he remembered from childhood and she seemed to him the essence of shining unspoiled youth sure and its the most beautiful sight these old eyes have awakened to in many a year she turned to him her smile dimming the sunlight into insignificance good morning to you uncle paddy its a fine beautiful day while they were eating adelia casually mentioned that she had met travis grant the previous night during her nocturnal wanderings i was hoping to introduce you myself this morning he took a bit of crisp bacon and raised his brows what did you think of him she tactfully kept her opinion to herself and answered with a move of her shoulders im sure hes a fine good man uncle paddy but i wasnt with him long enough to make judgments big arrogant bully her mind added but i did tell him about toms accident and that id been taken on as an exercise boy did you now a slow smile formed as he added jam to his bread and what did he say to that hes smart enough to trust padrick cunnanes opinion her fingers crossed under the table and she wondered if she had earned another black mark in aunt letties often mentioned record book of the angels a short time later adelia stood in front of majesty rubbing his muzzle and holding an intimate conversation unaware her actions were being observed by a pair of deep blue eyes morning paddy i hear youve taken on a new hand paddy broke off his conversation with hank and greeted the tall lean man good morning to you travis dee told me she met you last night did she his lips curved as he continued to regard woman and horse wait till you see that little lady ride hank put in shaking his head could have knocked me over with a feather travis inclined his head well soon see he moved to where adelia still stood speaking softly to the large thoroughbred hello again halfpint does your friend ever answer you she whirled caught off guard and regarded his amusement with indignation aye that he does mr grant in his own way she brushed past him to mount and travis stopped her with a hand on her wrist good lord did i do that he ran a finger over the dark smudge of bruises on her arm and adelia followed his glance before raising her eyes to his that you did his eyes narrowed a moment his fingers still light on her wrist well have to be more careful with you in the future wont we little dee not the first bruising ive had nor likely to be the last but youll not be having any more occasion to be grabbing at me mr grant with this she swung herself astride majesty and rode him onto the track at paddys signal the pair sprinted forward and galloped around the oval in a clean steady rhythm you wouldnt have been thinking id lost my senses hiring my niece now would you lad ill admit when she told me shed been hired i had a moment of doubt about your sanity travis answered keeping his eyes on the small woman glued to the speeding horse but ive always trusted your judgment paddy youve never let me down later that morning adelia worked in the stables insisting over paddys objections that she assist in the grooming of some of the horses a sound behind her caused her to turn her head and she encountered two small boys one the mirror image of the other she closed her eyes in mock alarm saints preserve us sure and its losing my mind i am im seeing double the boys collapsed into giggles and spoke in unison were twins is that the truth she breathed a deep sigh of relief well im glad to know it i was afraid a spell had been put on me you talk just like paddy one boy observed eyeing her with unrestrained curiosity do i now she smiled down at their identical faces the boys were about eight she hazarded dark as gypsies with snapping brown eyes the reason for that may be im his niece adelia cunnane just arrived from ireland two faced creased in two doubtful frowns he calls you little dee but youre not little youre all grown up one boy complained the other nodding in agreement that i am as far as i ever will be im afraid but i was just a wee babe when i last saw uncle paddy and i never did grow very tall so im little dee to him and what might your names be she questioned putting down the currycomb that she had been using mark and mike they announced again in one voice dont be telling me whos who she commanded narrowing dark green eyes ill guess im mighty good at guessing she circled them as they resumed giggling youd be mark and youd be mike she pronounced placing a hand on each head two pair of eyes stared at her in amazement how did you know mark demanded im irish she stated simply controlling a grin theres many of us from ireland whos fey feywhats that mike chimed in eyes wide and curious that means i have strange secret powers adelia claimed with a dramatic sweep of her hand the two boys looked at each other and back at adelia suitably impressed mark mike a woman entered the stables and shook her head in despair i should have know the pair of you would be here adelia stared at the newcomer stunned by her beauty and elegance she was tall and slender clad in a simple but to adelias untrained eye overwhelmingly beautiful outfit of dark blue slacks and white silk blouse black silky hair curled back from her face soft rosetinted lips and a classic straight nose led to a pair of heavily lashed deep blue eyes that adelia identified as traviss i hope they havent been bothering you the woman peered down in indulgent exasperation theyre impossible to keep track of no missus adelia said wondering if there had ever been a lovelier woman theyre fine lads weve just been getting acquainted you must be paddys niece adelia the generous mouth curved in a smile aye missus adelia managed a smile of her own and wondered what it would be like to be as graceful as a willow limb im trish collins traviss sister she extended her hand and adelia gaped at it in horror after traviss words of the previous night she was selfconscious about the state of her hands and her mind began to work swiftly how could she put her hard rough hand into such a lovely soft one yet there was no way out without being pointedly rude so wiping her palm on her jeans she joined it with the one trish offered the other woman had noted adelias hesitation and concluded the reason for it when their hands met but she made no comment at that moment travis entered the building along with paddy and a small spare man adelia did not recognize paddy the twins launched themselves at the stocky figure well if it isnt tweedledee and tweedledum and what mischief have you been up to this fine day we came to meet dee mark announced she guessed which one of us was which shes fey mike added soberly paddy nodded equally grave his eyes twinkling as they met adelias over the two small heads aye thats a fact theres been many a cunnane whos had the sight adelia cunnanetravis made introductions a light smile playing over his mouthdr robert loman our vet pleased to meet you doctor adelia greeted him strategically keeping her hands behind her back robs come to look over solomy paddy explained shell be foaling soon the pixie face lit with pleasure and looking down at her travis raised his brows would you like to see her adelia very much she beamed him a smile previous animosity forgotten shes foaling quite late travis commented as the group walked down the long length of stalls a thoroughbreds official birthday is january the first and normally we breed with that in mind we just acquired solomy six months ago and of course she was already in foal shes from a good line and the stud she was bred to is by the same sire as majesty then you must have big hopes for the foal adelia returned thinking of majestys style and speed i think he said with a smile you could safely say we had hopes for this foal placing a hand on her shoulder he turned her toward an enclosure adelia travis said with amused formality meet solomy she sighed with delight at the animal a dark gleaming bay mare with a mane of flowing black silk running her hand down the stark flash of white on the forehead she looked into dark intelligent eyes youre a fine beautiful lady the caressing of the smooth hide was met with a whinny of approval i suppose youd like a closer look travis observed opening the stall door and gesturing for her to enter she preceded him and the vet into the stall carrying on a low conversation with solomy as she explored the swollen belly probing with gentle capable fingers after a few moments she stopped and turned concerned eyes to traviss laughing ones the foals turned wrong the blue eyes lost their laughter and studied her intently quite right miss cunnane robert loman agreed with a professional nod a quick diagnosis entering the stall he too ran hands over the mares belly were hoping the foal will turn before shes full term but youre not thinking its likely her times almost here no were not he turned back to her faintly surprised and greatly curious as to her knowledge we have to deal with the possibility of a breech have you had any training more doing than training she shrugged uncomfortable at having the attention focused on her i worked with a vet back in ireland ive done some birthings and some stitching and splinting she stepped out of the stall to stand beside paddy watching as the vet proceeded with his work paddys arm slipped around her shoulders and she rested her head against him i hate to think what a hard time shell be having we had a mare that carried breech once and i had to turn the babe she sighed with the memory i can still see her poor trusting eyes on me how i hated to hurt her you turned a foal by yourself travis demanded drawing her attention from the past thats a difficult enough job for a fullgrown man let alone a little thing like you she bristled bringing herself up to the full of her meager height it may be that im small mr grant but im strong enough to do what needs to be done she glared up at him her pride under attack and stuck out her chin ill tell you this for all our difference in size i can work the day through with you stifling a snort of laughter paddy focused on a spot on the ceiling as travis regarded her indignation with cool steady eyes after a moment she turned and began to walk toward the front of the building did you really see a horse being born dee the twins tagged after her full of excitement many a time and cows and pigs and the like she took a small hand in each of hers and continued over the concrete floor there was a time i birthed twin lambs and that was the prettiest sight travis continued to stare after her as her voice trailed off in the distance the next few days passed easily for adelia as she became accustomed to a new life and new surroundings on the occasions she spoke to travis she continually struggled to hold back the tongue he seemed to have a habit of provoking he stirred strange feelings in her feelings she could neither comprehend nor prevent and her defense against them took shape in a quick retort and flashing eyes though she gave herself nightly lectures on the evils of temper when confronted with him during the daylight hours her vow of restraint slipped through her fingers she found herself watching him once as he strode toward the stables his blue denim work shirt straining over broad shoulders as he moved over the grass he seemed to eat up the ground with a careless vitality there was a strange pull at her heart and she sighed then bit her lip in annoyance it was only that he was such a fine strongly built man she told herself lean and powerful she dismounted from the thoroughbred she had been exercising and rubbed his neck vigorously she had always admired strength and power the same way she admired this strong wellproportioned animal everyone she had met held travis grant in great respect and admiration when he gave an order it was carried out without question only paddy it seemed had the right to advise or question but she was adelia cunnane she reminded herself and no man would get the better of her she would not play peasant to his squire and pull her forelock when he passed by she did her job and did it well he would have no cause to complain in that field but she would speak her piece if shed a mind to and the devil take him if he didnt like it late each afternoon adelia visited solomy she was sure the mare would deliver any day and knowing the birth would be a difficult one she spent her visits comforting the mare and gaining her confidence soon youll be having a fine strong son or daughter adelia told her as she closed the stall door after her visit id like to take you and the babe and bundle you off with me what do you think himself would do about that he might be tempted to have you hanged for horse thieving she spun around her eyes encountering traviss powerful form resting idly against the next stall its a bad habit you have of sneaking up and scaring a body to death she snapped at him assuming that the uneven beat of her heart was the result of surprise i do happen to own this place adelia he returned in low calm tones that only increased her agitation thats a fact im not likely to forget theres no need to remind me she tilted her chin in defiance of him and the continuing flutter of her stomach knowing she should guard her words and knowing the power to do so was beyond her i give you your days work but maybe you think im forgetting my place should i be bobbing a curtsy mr grant you impudent little wench travis muttered straightening from his relaxed position im getting a bit weary of being stabbed by that sharp tongue of yours well its sorry i am about that the best advice i can give is that you not be conversing with me thats the best idea youve had he grabbed her around the waist lifting her a foot off the ground as their eyes warred with each other ive been wanting to do this since the first time you slashed at me with your sharp irish tongue he crushed her mouth with his cutting off a heated retort too surprised by his action to resist immediately adelia began to experience unfamiliar and disturbing sensations a heat and weakness that she might feel on a day spent working in the field his hands were like steel around her small waist holding her body suspended in the air while his lips assaulted hers entering her mouth with his tongue in a kiss that was both devastating and totally foreign to any she had ever known pressed hard against him lips joined she felt his warmth his essence seeping into her demanding and receiving her merging she could feel the authority in the arms that held her taste the knowledge on the lips that claimed hers and body and mind surrendered to both unable to combat the turbulence of the unexplored she felt it whirl her like a cyclone spinning her toward the sun until the heat threatened to become fire and as each of her senses were assaulted and conquered he continued to explore her mouth feasting on it as a man who knew a womans flavor he took and she knew nothing of the richness of the banquet she gave him warm and ripe and fresh after a lifetime he released her dropping her back to the ground as she stared at him mutely eyes huge with confusion well halfpint this is the first time ive seen you at a loss for words he mocked her openly the lips that had just conquered hers lifted in a smug satisfied smile his taunt broke the strange hold over her mind and tongue and her eyes lit with molten green fire you son of the devil she began in a rich explosion and what followed was a raging stream of irish curses and dire predictions delivered in so strong an accent that it was nearly impossible to comprehend the words when her imagination had at last run dry and she could only stand staring at him breathlessly he threw back his head and laughed until she thought he would burst oh dee youre a fabulous sight when youre breathing fire he took no trouble to hide his amusement an infuriating grin glued to his face the madder you get the thicker the brogue im going to have to provoke you more often im giving you warning she returned in an ominous voice which only widened the grin if you ever molest me again its more than my tongue youll be feeling lifting her head she strode out of the stables clutching the last threads of her dignity around her she said nothing to paddy about her scene with travis and instead banged around the kitchen as she prepared dinner muttering incoherent sentences about great arrogant beasts and strongarm bullies her fury with travis was intermingled with fury with herself the fact that his touch had brought both excitement and unexplained pleasure angered her further and she berated herself for the uncontrollable attraction she felt for him chapter by the next day adelias anger had faded she was not given to prolonged periods of ill humor rather she exploded like a burst of flame simmered then slowly cooled down there remained however a disturbing new awareness an awareness both of herself and the unfamiliar longings of womanhood and of the frustrating attractive man who had released them she managed to avoid any facetoface contact with travis during the morning going about her duties in the normal fashion while she kept a cautious eye alert for his approach duties complete she strolled back for her daily visit with solomy instead of leaning over the low barrier to greet her as was solomys habit adelia found her lying on her side in the hay breathing heavily by all the saints and apostles rushing inside she knelt beside the raggedly breathing mare your times come darlin she crooned running her hands over the large mounded belly just rest easy now ill be back springing up she sped from the stables she spotted tom in the far paddock and cupping her hands shouted solomys times here get traviscall the vet be quick without waiting for an answer she ran back inside to comfort the laboring horse she was murmuring and stroking the sweating hide when travis and paddy joined her soft words and gentle hands had calmed the mare whose deep brown eyes were riveted on adelias dark green ones travis knelt beside her his hand joining hers on the gleaming skin and though adelia spoke to him her eyes never left the mares the foals still the wrong way it must be turned and quickly wheres dr loman hes had an emergencycant be here for half an hour his voice was clipped his own attention on solomy she turned her head and captured his gaze mr grant im telling you she doesnt have that long the foal has to be turned now or well lose them both i can do it ive done it before its gods truth mr grant she hasnt much time they stared at each other for a long moment adelias eyes wide and pleading his narrowed and intense solomy let out an agonizing whinny as a new contraction began there my love adelia switched her attention back to the mare murmuring words of comfort all right travis agreed a long breath escaping through his teeth but ill turn it paddy call in some of the men to hold her down no adelias protest caused the mare to start and she spoke quietly again using hands and voice to soothe youll not bring a bunch of bruisers in here forcing her down and frightening her again she raised her eyes to traviss and spoke with calm assurance shell hold for me i know how travis paddy intervened as he started to speak dee knows what shes about nodding travis moved off to scrub his hands and arms have a care she warned as he prepared to begin the babes hooves will be sharp and the womb can close on your hand quickly taking a deep breath she lay her cheek against the mares hands circling the damp flesh in a steady rhythm as she began to croon in quiet gaelic the mare shivered as travis entered her but remained still listening to adelias comforting voice the air seemed to grow closer heavy with solomys breathing and the mystical beauty of the ancient tongue adelia murmured it brought a heavy warmth to the spring afternoon isolating them from all but the struggle for life ive got him travis announced sweat running unheeded down his face his breath came quickly and he muttered a steady stream of soft curses but adelia heard nothing giving herself over to the mare its done he rested back on his heels turning his attention to the woman at his side she gave no sign to him only continued her slow rhythmic crooning hands gently caressing face buried in the mares neck here it comes paddy cried and she turned her head to watch the miracle of birth when the foal finally emerged into the world both woman and horse sighed and shuddered its a fine strong son you have solomy ah sure and theres no more beautiful sight in the world than an innocent new life she turned her glowing face to travis and gave him a smile that rivaled the sun their eyes met and the look deepened until it seemed to adelia that time had stopped she felt herself being drawn into fathoms of dark blue unable to breathe or speak as if some invisible shield had descended insulating them from all but each other can love come in an instant her numbed brain demanded or has it been there forever the answer was forestalled as robert loman arrived shattering the magic that had held her suspended she stood up quickly as the vet began to question travis on the colts delivery a wave of giddiness washed over her as she rose and she sank her teeth into her lower lip to combat the weakness keeping the mare calm had been an enormous strain almost as if she had experienced each pang of labor and the unexpected rush of emotion when travis had held her eyes had left her drained and dizzy what is it dee paddys voice was full of concern as he took her arm nothing she placed her palm to her spinning head just a bit of a headache take her home travis commanded regarding her closely her eyes were bright and enormous against her pallor and she appeared suddenly small and helpless rising he moved toward her and she stepped back terrified he would touch her theres no need she kept her voice calm and even ill just go up and have a wash im fine uncle paddy she smiled into his frowning face avoiding traviss at all costs dont you worry stepping from the stall she moved quickly from the building filling her lungs with fresh clean air that evening found adelia quiet and pensive she was unused to confusion and uncertainty characteristically knowing what needed to be done and doing it her life had always been basic the fundamental existence of meeting demands as they came there had been no room for indecision or clouded reasoning in a world that was essentially black or white she lingered in the kitchen after dinner reasoning with herself with firm common sense the foaling had been difficult the strain emptying her body of its strength and the sight of the new colt had fogged her brain these were the reasons she had reacted so strongly to travis she could hardly be in love with him she barely knew him and what she did know was not altogether to her taste he was too big too strong too selfconfident and too arrogant he reminded her of a feudal lord and adelia was too irish to have any liking for landed gentry however after her work was done and selfanalysis complete she remained oddly weary and disturbed sitting down on the floor at paddys feet she laid her head in his lap with a deep sigh little dee he murmured stroking the thick auburn curls youre working too hard what nonsense she disagreed snuggling deeper into the still newness of comfort i havent worked a full day since i arrived the day would not nearly be over yet if i was back on the farm was it hard for you lass he asked thinking she might now be ready to talk of it again adelia sighed moving her shoulders restlessly i wouldnt say hard uncle paddy but everything changed after mother and da died poor little dee such a wee thing to be losing so much i thought my world had ended when they died she whispered hardly aware she was speaking aloud im thinking i died myself for a time so angry and frightened i was then numb feeling nothing but i began remembering how they were together no two people could have loved each other more such a fine full loving they had even a child could see it so engrossed were the man and woman in the words being spoken that neither heard the sound of feet climbing the stairs travis halted in his action of knocking dropping his hand as he watched the poignant picture and adelias words drifted through the screen the only thing i could give them was the farm and it was all i had left of them poor aunt lettie she worked so hard and i was a constant cross for her to bear she laughed as memory flickered through her mind she never could understand why i had to ride so fast sure and its your neck youll be breaking she used to call after me shaking her fist wholl be helping with the plowing if you bash in your head on the road then when id have one of my rages and go off shouting and cursingand its often im afraid i did just thatshed cross herself and start praying for my doomed soul takers but we worked with a long breath she shut her eyes but it was too much for one woman and a halfgrown girl and not enough money to hire help and none to be made without it do you know how it is uncle paddy when you see the thing you need but the closer you get the further away it is always moving away from you always just out of your reach sometimes when i look back i cant tell one day from the rest then aunt lettie had that stroke and how she hated to be lying there helpless day after day why did you never let me know how things were paddy questioned looking down at her dark head i could have helped yousent you money or come back myself she raised her head and smiled at him aye thats just what you would have done and to what good throwing your money away taking yourself from the life youd chosen id not have had that for a minute and neither would aunt lettie or mother and da the farms gone just as they are and so is ireland now i have you im not needing another thing looking into his eyes seeing the concern and regret written there she wished suddenly she had kept her own counsel how is it padrick cunnane that a fine handsome man like yourself never took a wife her grin turned impish and devils danced in her eyes there must have been dozens of ladies willing have you never found a woman to love he touched her cheek giving her a wistful smile aye lass that i did but she chose your father deep green eyes filled with surprise that melted into sympathy oh uncle paddy she flung her arms around him and travis turned from the door and walked silently down the stairs the next morning the air seemed to sigh with spring whispering promises of flowers and cool leafy trees to adelia it brought memories of other springs spring was the time the earth asked to be replenished and grew pregnant with new life her world had always revolved around the earth its gifts and hardships its demands and promises from the balcony of paddys house she surveyed the land that was traviss it seemed to stretch on and on with the easy gentle roll of a calm sea green and brown waves were dotted not with boats but with finely sculptured thoroughbreds it ran through her mind that she had no conception of what lay over the last hill this land was still a stranger from the moment of her arrival in america she had seen little else but what belonged to travis grant over the pure sweet air floated an occasional whinny or the quick call of a bird but for this there was silence there was no strident call of rooster announcing the new day no fields turned up waiting to receive seed no weeds demanding uprooting all at once homesickness washed over her so intensely that she could only shut her eyes and weather the storm so much is gone she thought and her hands hugged her elbows as if in comfort ill never be able to go back never see the farm again sighing she opened her eyes and tried to shake off the melancholy theres nothing to be done about it the bridges are burned this is home now and if its not really mine its the closest ill come where are you lass adelia started slightly as paddys arm slipped around her then she sighed again and rested against his shoulder back on the farm i suppose thinking about spring planting its a day for it isnt it that airs cool and the suns warm he gave her shoulder a small squeeze then clucked his tongue as if in regret ive got to go into town today its a pity a pity i was hoping to get some seeds in around the walkway thought i might make a flower bed in front of the house too he shook his head and sighed just dont know when ill find the time oh ill do it uncle paddy ive plenty of time drawing away she looked at him with such innocent acceptance of his trumpedup excuse that he nearly broke into a grin little dee i couldnt ask you to do all that on your day off he creased his face into doubtful lines and patted her cheek no its too much ill get to it as soon as i find a bit of time uncle paddy dont be silly id love to do it her smile was blooming again chasing the clouds from her eyes just show me what you want done well he permitted her to argue a few more minutes before allowing himself to be persuaded armed with a myriad of seed packs and a small spade adelia stood on the patch of lawn surrounding paddys house and mentally mapped out her landscaping petunias along the walk asters and marigolds against the house impatiens for the border and sweet peas she thought with a smile for the trellis she had asked paddy to buy in the fall she decided ill plant bulbs as many as the ground will hold daffodils and tulips satisfied with her planning she began to turn the earth the sun grew warmer and her sleeves were soon pushed past her elbows in the distance she could hear the sounds of men and horses going through their daily routine a shout laughter the thud of hooves on dirt but soon lost in her planting she drifted apart softly she began to sing a song remembered from childhood the words soothing and familiar the scent of fresh earth eased the ache with which she had awakened a shadow fell across her twisting her head she dropped the spade nervously as travis looked down at her ive made you stop im sorry he seemed impossibly tall as he stood over her she craned her neck and squinted against the sun it glowed in an aura around his head and for one fanciful moment she thought he looked like a knight on his way to vanquish dragons no you just startled me picking up the spade adelia told herself she was a fool and began to work again i didnt mean the planting he crouched down beside her his shoulder brushing hers i mean the song it sounded very old and very sad aye its both she inched away carefully patting soil over seeds a lot of gaelic songs are old and sad folding his legs under him he sat easily on the grass and watched her whats it about oh love of course the saddest songs are always about love she lifted her head to smile at him his face was close his mouth a breath away the spade hung suspended in her hand as she only stared wondering what she would do if the whisper of space was gone and his mouth found hers is love always sad adelia his voice was as soft as the breeze that danced around them i dont know i she felt the weakness growing stronger and tore her eyes from his we were talking about songs so we were travis murmured then brushed back the hair that curtained her face she swallowed and began digging with renewed interest i never thanked you properly for your help yesterday with solomy oh well moving her shoulders she kept her eyes on the ground i didnt do that much im just glad solomy and the foal are well do you like flowers mr grant she asked needing to change the subject yes i like flowers what are you planting his voice was casual as he lifted a package of seeds all different kinds she told him this time able to raise her head and smile theyll be a lovely sight by summer your soils rich mr grant it wants to give she squeezed a handful of earth then held it out in her palm youd know more about that than i taking her fingertips he studied the soil in her hand youre the farmer i was she amended and tried to free her hand im afraid i dont know much about plantingvegetables or flowers he ignored her attempts to pull her fingers away and brought his eyes to hers i suppose its a gift it just takes time and effort like anything else here concluding that if she gave him something to do her hand would be released she held out some seeds just drop a few in and cover them up dont crowd them she instructed as he obeyed they want room to spread now you cover them up and let nature take over smiling she absently brushed a hand across her cheek no matter what you do nature has the last word in any case a farmer knows that here the same way a farmer knows that in ireland so now that ive put them in he concluded with a grin i just sit back and watch them grow well she said tilting her head and giving him a sober stare there might be a thing or two more like watering or weeding these seeds will take quick and the flowers will pop up before you know it im putting in sweet peas there she pointed across the lawn forgetting that she still held the soil in her other hand when the breeze comes up at night the scent will drift through the windows theres something special about sweet peas they start off so small but theyll just keep climbing as long as theres something to hold on to there should be a rosebush she murmured almost to herself when the scents mingle together its like nothing else on earth red roses just starting to open up are you homesick dee the question was low and gentle but her head whipped back around in surprise i shrugging she bent her face to her work again uncomfortable that he had read her emotions so clearly its quite natural he lifted her chin with his hand until their eyes met again its not easy to leave behind everything youve ever known no moving her shoulders again she turned away and began to spread marigold seeds but i made the choice and it truly was what i wanted its what i want she amended with more firmness i cant say ive been unhappy a moment since i got off the plane i cant go back and i dont really know if id want to if i could ive a new life now tossing back her hair she smiled at him i like it here the people the work the horses the land her hand made a wide encompassing gesture youve a beautiful home mr grant anyone could be happy here he brushed a trace of dirt from her cheek and returned her smile im glad you think so but its your home too youre a generous man mr grant she kept her gaze level with his but her smile was suddenly sad and sweet theres not many whod say that and mean it and im grateful to you but for better or worse the farm was mine sighing she traced a finger through the soil it was mine late the next morning when adelia turned one of the thoroughbreds she had been exercising over to a groom trish collins approached her with a friendly smile hello adelia how are you settling in fine missus and good morning to you she regarded trishs dark beauty with fresh admiration and where are the lads this morning in school but theyll be here tomorrow theyre half crazy to get a look at the new foal a beautiful sight he is yes ive just had a peek at him travis told me how marvelous you were with the mare her mouth dropped open a moment surprised and inordinately pleased that travis should have praised her i was glad to help missus solomy did all the work call me trish she requested with a shake of her head missus makes me feel old and crotchety oh no missus youre not old at all she blurted out horrified i wouldnt like to think so travis and i wont be thirtyone until october trish laughed at the stricken face so youre twins as well adelia concluded feeling more at ease i suppose thats why i saw your brothers eyes the first time i met you yes we do bear a strong resemblance to each other which is why i constantly tell him how handsome he is she smiled at adelias light musical laugh am i holding you up are you busy no missus at the raised brow she amended no trish i was about to take my break and fix a cup of tea would you like one yes thank you i would they paused at the top of the stairs to the garage house as adelia bent to pick up a long narrow white box now what might this be flowers would be my guess trish concluded indicating the printed name of a local florist what would they be doing here she frowned down at the box as they stepped inside someone must have left them at the wrong house you might open them and find out trish suggested amused by the frown of concentration as your names on the box they just might be for you auburn curls danced as she shook her head and chuckled now whod be sending me flowers setting the box on a table she opened the lid and gave a small cry of pleasure oh just look have you ever seen such a sight the box was filled with longstemmed roses deep blood red their halfclosed petals soft as velvet to her hesitant fingers lifting one out she held it under her nose ah she breathed and passed the bloom to trish straight from heaven then shrugging she returned to practical matters who could they be for there should be a card locating the small white note adelia read it silently and her green eyes widened as she read the words a second time she brought her gaze from the slip of paper to meet an openly curious regard theyre for me her voice mirrored disbelief as she handed trish the card your brother sent them to thank me for helping with solomy dee to thank you for your help with the new foal travis trish read aloud and added under her breath you certainly wax poetic on occasion brother in my whole life adelia murmured touching a silky petal no one has ever given me flowers trish looked over quickly observing the shimmering eyes and the stunned pleasure passing over adelias features pushing tears back adelia spoke on a sigh this was a lovely time for your brother to do i had a rosebush at homered roses they were too my mother planted it she smiled feeling incredibly happy it makes them that much more special later they walked back to the stables as they drew near travis and paddy emerged from the building and the irishman greeted them both with a beaming smile travis weve died and gone to heaven sure and its two angels coming to greet us uncle paddy adelia tweaked his cheek living in america hasnt lessened your gift for blarney looking up at the man who towered above the rest of them she treated him to the pure honest smile of a child i want to thank you for the flowers mr grant theyre lovely im glad you liked them he answered enjoying the smile it was little enough after what you did heres something more for you dee paddy reached into his pocket and withdrew a piece of paper your first weeks wages oh adelia said with a grin its the first time ive been paid in money for doing anything she frowned at the check confused and traviss brows rose in amusement at her expression is something wrong with it adelia yesnoi she stumbled and brought her eyes to paddy youre wondering what it is in pounds he concluded grinning merrily i dont think i figured it right she answered embarrassed under traviss gaze chuckling he did some mental arithmetic and told her confusion changed to astonishment and something close to terror what would i be doing with that kind of money first time anyone around here complained about being overpaid travis commented and received a baleful glance here adelia turned her attention back to her uncle and held the check out to him you take it now why would i be doing that dee its your money you earned it but ive never had so much money at one time in my whole life she sent him a pleading look what will i do with it go out and buy some of those female trappings and folderol he suggested vaguely waving his hand then pushing the check back at her treat yourself to something the good lord knows its about time but uncle paddy why dont you buy yourself a dress dee travis inserted with a grin im curious to see if youve got legs under those jeans adelias head snapped up and she eyed travis with a dangerous gleam aye ive legs mr grant and ive been told a time or two its not a trial to look at them but youll not have to be worrying yourself its not dresses i need to tend your horses his grin only widened as he gave a negligent shrug it doesnt matter to me if you want to be taken for a boy her wrath increased as he had meant it to and her eyes fired sharp green daggers theres only one who ever made that mistake he being an illmannered badtempered brute of a man without a brain working in his empty head shoppings a marvelous idea trish broke in deciding it was time to play peacemaker as a matter of fact travisshe smiled and fluttered her lashesdees taking the rest of the day off so we can do just that oh really he returned dryly folding his arms across his chest yes really come on dee but i havent finished trish linked her arm through the still protesting adelias and propelled her to a latemodel compact before she had time to think things through adelia had an account at a local bank a checkbook and more cash than her apprehensive brain could comprehend nowtrish backed the compact from its parking spacewere going shopping but what will i buy she stared at trishs clear profile in complete consternation stopping at a red light trish turned to her anxious face whens the last time you bought something for yourself for the fun of it have you ever bought something because you wanted it instead of just needing it the light changed and as she joined the flow of traffic she sighed at adelias blank expression dont misunderstand im not saying people should just throw their money away but its high time you did something for yourself glancing at adelias furrowed brow she smiled and shook her head you can afford to slow down dee take a day off buy something foolish stretch your wings take a breath she grinned as adelia merely stared at her the sky will not fall if adelia cunnane takes time off to have some fun no one was more surprised than adelia when in fact she did have fun the large mall fascinated her with its various small specialty shops and large department stores there were more clothes than she had ever seen in colors and soft materials that had her staring and touching in frank admiration while adelia gazed around her trish examined garments critically going from rack to rack dismissing dozens of dresses skirts and blouses occasionally removing an item and hanging it over her arm finding herself in a changing room adelia could only stare at the garments trish had placed on a hook then taking a deep breath she stripped off her shirt and jeans and slipped on a soft jersey dress in muted shades of green the silky material felt strange and wonderful to her skin clinging to gentle curves and falling gracefully below her knees she gaped at the stranger in the mirror her hand seeking the cross at her throat to assure herself that she was still the same person dee trish called from outside the curtain have you got one on yet aye she answered slowly and trish pulled the curtain aside smiling in triumph at the reflection in the fulllength mirror i knew that dress was you the minute i saw it it doesnt feel like me adelia mumbled then turned to face trish directly its beautiful but what would i do with so grand a dress i exercise horses i work in a stable dee trish interrupted firmly whatever your occupation youre still a human being youre still a woman an exceptionally beautiful woman adelias eyes widened and her mouth opened to protest but before the words could be uttered trish took her by the shoulders and turned her to face her reflection look at yourself really look she ordered in nononsense terms then shifted to gentler tones therell be times when youll want only to be a woman this dress is for those times now she said with practical authority as she released her try something else on for the rest of the afternoon adelia allowed trish to take command for the first time in more than a decade she permitted someone else to make all the decisions and somehow she found she was having fun they halted in front of a cosmetics counter and trish began spraying scents until adelia grumbled in protest this trish selected one of the bottles she had sampled light and delicate with just a touch of spirit paying for the cologne she handed the package to adelia a present oh but i cant yes you can friends get pleasure from giving presents now that marvelous skin of yours doesnt need any help but i think well accent your eyesand some lipstick nothing too dramatic she stopped and laughed im bullying you arent i aye adelia agreed feeling caught up in a genial whirlwind and finding she liked it well you needed it trish said firmly is there anything else you want she hesitated then blurted out quickly something for my hands your brother said ive hands like a ditchdiggers that man she exclaimed in disgust hes the epitome of tact and diplomacy trish hello adelia turned to see a flash of amazing silverblond hair before trish was enveloped in an exuberant embrace adelias first startled impression was of lavish curls and musky scent im so glad to see you darling a high bubbly voice drifted with the scent its been weeks hello laura with an affectionate smile trish disentangled herself its good to see you too laura bowersadelia cunnane how do you do mistress bowers the greeting was returned with a flash of beautiful white teeth before lauras attention returned to trish darling how is that fabulous brother of yours fabulous trish returned giving adelia a quick grin of mischief dont tell me hes not pining after margot laura sighed and gave a flutter of extensive lashes i was so hoping to offer him my comfort not even a tear or two to be dried he seems to be bearing up under the strain trish returned hearing the unexpected sarcasm adelia glanced at her in surprise oh well if he doesnt need comfort laura continued obviously not affected by trishs tone hes still at loose ends so to speak if dear margot overplayed her hand by whisking off to europe i for one am not above volunteering to fill the gap heard from her lately not a peep well then ill take it that no news is good news she gave trish a wink and tossed her brilliant curls such a gorgeous man do you know travis adelaide adelia trish corrected before adelia could do so herself yes dee knows travis very well charming man laura bubbled now that margots out of the picture at least temporarily ill just have to give him a ring do tell him ill call wont you with another flurry of curls she pecked both of trishs cheeks i hate to darling but i simply must run dont forget to give travis my very best so nice to have met you amanda adelia opened her mouth then closed it again as laura scurried off in a wave of musk sorry amanda trish grinned and patted adelias cheek lauras really very sweet and basically kind but shes a bit short of brains she has such beautiful hair tearing her gaze from lauras retreating coiffure adelia turned back to trish ive never seen hair that color before she must be very proud of it trish laughed until she was forced to wipe away tears as adelia looked on in puzzlement oh dee i adore you come on well get that hand cream then ill buy you a cup of tea waiting patiently while her mentor weighed the pros and cons of various lotions adelia reflected on laura bowerss conversation margot she repeated nibbling absently on her bottom lip who is this margot and what is she to travis for a moment she struggled with the urge to ask trish outright then remembering her manner she kept silent perhaps hes in love with her this thought brought such a sharp unexpected pain that she nearly gasped aloud but hes not a part of her insisted if travis grant were ever to love a woman he would never let her go he would go to the ends of the earth to bring her back unless of course he had been rejected his pride would never allow him to pursue a woman who had refused him but who would ever refuse such a man its not my concern she told herself fiercely forcing herself to concentrate on trishs detailed description of various hand lotions at last trish was satisfied adelia was suitably outfitted and had all the cosmetics that trish thought were necessary laden with parcels the two women headed back to the car for once adelia was reduced to silence she sat bolt upright on the front seat as trish drove swiftly over the winding country roads she was even too excited to enjoy the rolling hills and the horses grazing in the meadows now softly outlined by the sinking afternoon sun paddy was there to open the door when adelia burst in with her new treasures little dee youre looking as happy as the first time you rode majesty round the track he said observing her flushed happy face this was nearly as exciting uncle paddy she laughed and stepped through the doorway never have i seen so many clothes so many people do you know i think everyone in america is in a constant hurry driving rushing through the storesnothing ever seems to move slowly this place trish took me was amazingall these shops in one big building and it had fountains right inside she sighed then shrugged and grinned i know i should be ashamed for squandering money the way i did but im not i had a fine time it was due time lass due time he kissed her cheek as they entered the living room well paddy shes lost her innocence travis rose from an armchair and grinned down at adelia and her packages trish corrupted her i knew i shouldnt have let that sister of mine get hold of her your sister is a wonderful lady mr grant adelia tossed back her head to meet his eyes chestnut curls falling back from her face she has a sweet and generous soul and a good deal more in the way of manners than some i could name his brow lifted and he glanced over her head to look at paddy as the older man struggled not to grin it appears trish has a champion and one i dont think i care to challenge he shifted his gaze back to adelias irate face at least he added with a slow enigmatic smile not today chapter saturday dawned sunny and unseasonably warm the trees were now in full leaf and the air carried the sweet scent of flowers as spring approached midterm adelia sang happily as she groomed fortune a sturdy threeyearold colt who listened with approval to her high lilting voice as she brushed him dee dee she whirled around to see mark and mike scurrying into the stables mom said we could come down and see you and the new foal too good day to you gentlemen its pleased i am to have you visiting me will you show us the foal mike demanded and she smiled at his enthusiasm that i will master michael as soon as ive finished with my friend here now she set down the brush and reached a hand into her back pocket where is it that i put that hoof pick her pockets were empty and she searched the ground frowning its the little people at work again we didnt take it mark objected people are always blaming kids for everything mike complained righteously oh but its not children im speaking of adelia corrected its leprechauns leprechauns the twins chorused whats a leprechaun could it be youre telling me youve never heard of leprechauns she asked in amazement the boys shook their identical heads and she folded her arms across her chest well your educations sadly lacking lads its a sorry thing to remain ignorant of the little people tell us dee they demanded pulling at her hands in excitement that i will she hauled herself up to sit on a bench as the two boys squatted on the floor at her feet now the leprechaun is a strange fellow his father being an evil spirit and his mother a fairy fallen from grace by nature hes a mischiefmaker he only grows to be about three feet high no matter how old he happens to be some say he likes to be riding on sheep or goats so a man knows if his stock is tired and weary of a morning that the little people have been up to their tricks and using them for some errand where they didnt want to travel on foot they can be lazy when theyve a mind to they love to be making mischief about the house as well why a leprechaunll make a pot boil over on the stove or keep it from boiling at all as his whim suits him or hell steal the bacon or toss the furniture about for the sheer love of the confusion other times hell drink his fill of the milk or poteen and fill up the bottle with water now she continued her eyes bright with excitement as the two boys clung to her words to catch a leprechaun would bring certain fortune to the one who had the wit to hold him the only time you can catch him is when hes sitting down and he never sits unless his brogues want mending hes forever running about so that he wears them out and when he feels his feet on the ground he sits behind a hedge or in the tall grass of a meadow and takes them off to mend them thenshe lowered her voice to a dramatic whisper and the two heads inched forwardyou creep up quiet as a cat and grab him tight in your arms she flung her arms around an imaginary leprechaun and shouted give me your gold you say ive got no gold says he releasing her invisible captive she gave the boys a roguish smile now theres gold by the ton and thats the truth of it and he can tell you where its to be found but he wont till you make him now some try choking him or threatening him but whatever you do you mustnt for a moment take your eyes from him if you do that hes gone in a flash and youll not be seeing him again the scheming devil has a pocketful of tricks for getting away and he can charm the birds from the trees if hes a mind to but if you hold your ground and keep your eye on him his gold is yours and your fortunes made did you ever see a leprechaun dee mark asked bouncing with excitement by the saints i thought i did a time or two she nodded sagely but i never got close enough before they had vanished quick as you please soshe jumped from the bench and tousled two dark headsunless im finding me one whos traveled to america ill have to be working for my living she picked up a hoof pick from the bench and thats what im doing now or ill be fired for laziness and be begging for pennies we wouldnt let it come to that would we boys adelia spun around her color rising as she met traviss mocking smile the thumping in her heart she attributed to surprise and she was forced to swallow nervously before speaking its a habit youre making of creeping up on a body and frightening the wits from them mr grant maybe i mistook you for a leprechaun dee his grin was annoying but she refused to be baited and bent to lift fortunes hoof he led the twins down to visit the new foal and she set down the horses leg and watched his broad back retreat down the passage why did he always send her into a flutter she wondered why did her pulses begin to race at a speed that rivaled majestys whenever she looked up and met those surprisingly blue eyes she leaned her cheek against fortunes sturdy neck and sighed shed lost she conceded shed lost the battle and though she fought against it she was in love with travis grant it was impossible she admitted nothing could ever develop between the owner of royal meadows and an insignificant stablehand besides she whispered to the understanding colt hes an arrogant brute of a man and i dont believe i like him one little bit hearing the boys approach she bent quickly and lifted another hoof for cleaning run along outside boys i want a word with dee at traviss command the twins scrambled past chattering and exclaiming over the foal she set down the horses leg and straightened to face him the color fading from her cheeks blast my cursed tongue she thought in desperate condemnation aunt lettie told me a thousand times where my temper would take me ihave i done something wrong mr grant she stammered slightly and bit her lip in frustration no dee he answered slowly searching her troubled face did you think i was going to fire you his voice was oddly gentle and she felt a tremor at the unfamiliar tone you did say i could have a fortnight and ive a few days left before theres no need for a trial he interrupted ive already decided to keep you on oh thank you mr grant she began overcome with relief im grateful to you your way with horses is quite phenomenal a strange sort of empathy he stroked fortunes flank then fixed his eyes on her again it would be impossible to complain about your work except that theres too much of it i dont want to hear about you cleaning tack at ten oclock at night anymore oh well turning back to the bench adelia gave intense concentration to placing the hoof pick in its proper spot i just dont argue and dont do it again he commanded and she felt his hands descend to her shoulders you know you seem to split your time between working and arguing well have to see if we can find another outlet for all that energy i dont argue exactly well perhaps sometimes she shrugged and wished she had the courage to turn and face him the decision was taken out of her hands as she found herself being turned then lifted until she once again sat on the bench perhaps sometimes travis agreed and she found it disconcerting that his smile was so close his hands still circling her waist mr grant she began then swallowed as he reached up to pluck her cap from her hair freeing the rich cloud of auburn mr grant ive work to do mmm his comment was absent as he became involved with the winding of curls around his fingers ive always had a fondness for chestnuts grinning he gave her hair a firm tug until her face lifted to his a very particular fondness would you like to check my teeth seeking a defense against a swift wave of longing adelia stiffened and sent him what she hoped was a lethal glare his burst of unrestrained laughter caused the glare to light with green fire and she struggled to slide from the bench oh no he held her still with minimum effort you should realize by now that i find it impossible to restrain myself when you start spitting fire he took her mouth quickly one hand still tangled in her hair the other slipping under her shirt to claim the smooth skin of her back she found her second trip through the storm no less devastating than the first and while her will melted under its force her senses sharpened the scent of leather horses and masculinity rose and surrounded her a strange intoxicating scent she knew she would always associate with him she could feel his strength as he plunged her deeper into the kiss demanding every drop of sweetness from her mouth hard and seeking his lips parted hers his tongue teasing hers into mobility until she was pliant and yielding against him for the first time she felt the pain and demand of womanhood the slow ache growing in the center of her being and spreading to encompass her entirely until there was nothing but the need and the man who could assuage it she heard a soft moan as her lips were freed not aware it was her own weak protest at liberation and her lids opened slowly to reveal eyes dark and slumberous with desire i find travis commented in a low lazy voice that is a more productive use of time than arguing adelia watched his eyes drop to the lips still warm from his and felt his hand tighten on her hair it relaxed slowly and a smile moved across his face as his eyes rose to hers it also appears to be the only way to shut you up for any amount of time he dropped her cap back on her head then traced her cheek with his finger i find irish tempers have definite advantages he strode away and adelia contemplated his long graceful stride in confusion reaching up one hand to press the cheek his finger had touched pushing away a puzzle she could not solve she spent the rest of the day in a state of euphoria she was staying she had found her place on the mammoth horse farm and an uncle who wanted as well as needed her and a job that was a dream realized and at least she thought happily she would be close to travis seeing him almost daily feeding her need on the sight of his tall powerful form on a few snatched words of conversation that was enough for the present and the future was something to be faced when it arrived long after her uncle had retired adelia remained wide awake she had tried to relax with a book but her spirits were too high for sitting idly and she closed it and slipped outside she decided to walk to the stables promising herself she would not touch one bridle but merely look in on the horses the night remained warm the sky blanketed with stars so clear and vivid that she reached up imagining she could pluck one from the soft black curtain at peace with the world she meandered toward the large white building entering she switched on a low light to dispel the unrelieved darkness she had gone no more than twenty feet when a soft moaning sound caught her attention and she whirled in the direction of an empty stall a man lay in a crumpled heap and she caught her breath in alarm merciful heavens she hurried in and bent over him whats happened oh she uttered in disgust and stood hands on hips you are drunk george johnson and a pitiful sight indeed you smell like a poteen factory what do you mean drinking yourself into such a state and lying about in the stables so its pretty little dee george mumbled thickly hauling himself into a halfsitting position did you come for a visit come to share my bottle adelia had found herself avoiding the groom she had often found his eyes on her and his leering smile had caused her to recoil instinctively now however she was angry and disgusted and she took no pains to hide it no ill not be sharing a bottle with the likes of youive no patience for drunken sods haul yourself up and be on your way youve no business in here with your mind fuddled with whiskey giving orders now little dee he struggled to his feet and faced her too good to drink with me he raked her from head to foot with bleary eyes pausing on the swell of her breast and moistening his lips maybe you dont want to drink when theres more interesting things to do he grabbed her shoulders and closed his mouth over hers the strong smell of whiskey assaulting her senses as she pushed against him you filthy pig of a man she spat infuriated that he had touched her you great sniveling drunken buzzard dont you ever put your hands on me again you guzzling serpent ill kick you into next week if you touch me again she ranted at him until he grabbed her with such force that her breath caught in her throat ill do more than touch you his hand clamped over her mouth and he pushed her down roughly in the strawfilled stall she fought in wild fury kicking and scratching as his hands began to bruise her body choking back the sickness that rose as his lips violated hers her blouse ripped away from the shoulder the sound exploding in her ear anger gave way to terror and she struggled more violently her nails dug into his arms tearing his skin and as he cursed with pain and raised his head her scream pierced the still night a hand slapped hard across her cheek numbing her face as he closed his palm over her mouth again she continued to thrash out as his free hand captured her breast and moved over her with cruel purpose her strength was ebbing and she realized she was helpless against the violation that was to come he was tugging at her jeans his drunkenness causing his fingers to fumble at the snap the hand over her mouth was depriving her of air and a foggy dimness floated in front of her eyes please somebody help me she prayed desperately as nausea swamped her suddenly she was released from his crushing weight she heard a muffled curse and the soft thud of flesh on flesh crawling to the stalls opening she breathed deep to force back the queasiness travis she thought dizzily as she made out his powerful figure in the dimly lit stable he was beating the smaller man with a ruthless determination knocking him to the floor with crushing blows only to drag him up again by the shirtfront and send him sprawling once more george offered no resistance indeed he could not she realized as her mind cleared he was already unconscious still traviss fist pounded pulling the man up on his watery legs again and again hes killing him she thought suddenly and sprang to her feet running toward them no travis youre killing him she grabbed the hard muscular arm for the love of god travisyoure killing him he jerked back and for a moment she feared he would brush her off like a fly and finish the man who now lay in a motionless heap on the stable floor as he turned to face her adelia stepped away frightened by his expression of rage his face seemed to be carved from granite his eyes steely blue and penetrating as he stared at her she trembled at the strong harsh mask and offered up a silent prayer that she would never have that deadly fury directed at her are you all right his voice was clipped his eyes boring into hers aye she swallowed convulsively dropping her eyes from his stare oh travis your hands without thought she took them in her own theyre bleeding youll have to tend to them i have some salve thats damn it dee he yanked his hands away from hers taking her by the shoulders and tilting her head back so her eyes once more met the icy fury in his he surveyed the torn blouse the bruises already in evidence on the creamy skin the rich hair tousled around her pale face how badly did he hurt you his voice was low and uneven dee struggled to keep her own voice calm and not give way to the hysteria bubbling below the surface not badlyhe just frightened me he only hit me once his face suffused with color dark and angry at her words his hands tightening uncontrollably on her shoulders is he alive she asked her voice barely audible travis let out a long breath released her and turned to study the crumpled form yes mores the pity heaven knows he wouldnt have been if you hadnt intervened the police will see to him now no her cry of protest brought traviss attention back to her adelia he began slowly the man tried to rape you dont you understand i know very well what his intentions were she hugged herself to control the spasmodic trembling assailing her but we cant call the police she rushed on as travis made to protest i dont want uncle paddy to know about this i wont have him worrying and upset because of me im not hurt and i wont have uncle paddy upseti tell you i wont her voice rose and he slipped a gentle arm around her shoulders all right dee all right he soothed tightening his grip around her shuddering frame ill call a couple of men and have him taken off the property no police he began to lead her from the stables come on ill take you home the room began to lurch sickeningly as a roaring sound filled her brain the dim light ebbing until she could barely see travis her voice sounded strange and far away over the deafening roar in her head im sorry but im going to faint as she spoke the darkness closed in and swallowed her adelia opened her eyes slowly experimentally there was something cool and wonderful on her forehead and someone was stroking her cheek and speaking her name she sighed and closed her eyes again enjoying the new sensation of pampering before opening them once more to focus on her surroundings the room was lit with a warm glow the walls a cool soft ivory trimmed with carved dark wood she made out a wingbacked chair and a dark mahogany table on which stood an antique globed lamp that softly lit the room her eyes traveled over to the man who knelt beside her and rested on traviss face im in the main house she stated matteroffactly and his expression of concern was transformed into an amused smile leave it to you not to say the usual where am i he removed the wet cloth from her head and sat down beside her on the long sofa i dont know anyone else who could calmly announce she was sorry she was going to faint and then proceed to do so ive never fainted before in my life she told him mystified im sure i dont like it well your colors better now ive never seen anyone go so white you scared the daylights out of me im sorry she gave him a weak smile and sat up it was a foolish thing to do and she stopped suddenly as her hand went to her throat only to find the cross that always hung there missing my cross she stammered looking down to where her hand rested i must have lost it in the stables ive got to go find it he pushed her back firmly as she attempted to rise youre in no shape to go out there now dee he began but she cut him off struggling against his hold ive got to find it it cant be gone her color had drained again and he pushed her back on the sofa dee for heavens sake youll fall flat on your face let me go i cant lose it he tried to keep his words soothing feeling helpless against her rising hysteria he had seen her flaming angry and deeply moved but never incoherently desperate and he struggled to hold both her and his own temper in check dee he said shortly giving her a small shake get a grip on yourself its just a cross it was my mothers ive got to have itits all i have left of her its all i have she was trembling violently and he drew her into the warm circle of his arms and began the ageless comfort of rocking ill find it for you dont worry ill go back and find it tonight resting against his strong shoulder she felt strangely content and both panic and the threatened tears dissolved do you promise yes dee i promise he rubbed his cheek against the silk curtain of her hair and she wondered suddenly what it was about a man that made it so good to be held by oneor was it just one man sighing she allowed herself another moments luxury pressed against him im all right now mr grant she drew herself away as far as his arms would permit im sorry i acted like that you dont have to be sorry dee his hand lifted to brush back the full thick waves that tumbled around her face and it was travis before lets leave it at that i rather like the way you say it she felt her pulse respond to his soft words and gentle touch her awareness of him growing until she thought her veins would burst from the pressure iis it that youre implying i have an accent her brows lifted in mock censure as a defense against the suddenly dangerous atmosphere no im the one with the accent his smile drew one of her own but the innocent intimacy only heightened her confusion and she felt her color rise in an unaccustomed blush her lashes sweeping down like fragile shutters he grinned at the uncharacteristic shyness before he rose and moved to a small bar across the room i think you could use a drink before i take you home he lifted a crystal decanter some brandy brandys a stranger to me but perhaps if youve some irish she sat up straighter grateful for the distance between them id be hard pressed not to with paddy as my trainer he commented pouring a small measure of whiskey into a glass here he walked back to her and offered the glass this should steady you and keep you from falling into my arms again and what would you be finding so funny tilting her head she regarded him with curious eyes that a halfpint like you could down two fingers of whiskey as though it were a cup of tea aye well it comes with the blood i suppose im not one that drinks often but when i do i can handle my liquorwhich is more than can be said of that slimy pig of a groom he turned back to set the empty glass on the bar so that she was unaware of the hardening of his features travis she said hesitating over his name and he turned relaxing his face into calm lines im grateful to you for what you did standing she moved until she stood in front of him im owing you travis though god himself knows how ill ever repay you his eyes were intense for a moment brooding over the face she turned up to his then his features relaxed into a smile and he ran his finger down her cheek perhaps one day ill call in the debt the sun streamed onto the kitchen table as adelia removed the postbreakfast clutter she was grateful paddy had noticed nothing amiss having been fast asleep when late and disheveled she had arrived back home he had greeted her that morning with his usual cheery smile and she had mirrored it firmly blocking the memory of her nights encounter from her mind hearing footsteps approach the kitchen she closed the door on the dishwasher im just coming uncle paddy ive got the buttons all figured out now its amazing howoh she stopped as she turned and saw travis leaning against the doorway good morning she pushed at her hair as her thought processes skidded to a halt how are you he walked toward her eyes traveling in an intense survey im ffine just ffine she stammered and despised herself will i always behave like this when he comes on me unexpectedly she demanded of herself and determinedly offered a slight smile his hand cupped her chin and adelia held very still as he searched her face are you sure she nodded then realizing she had been holding her breath she let it out slowly im fine really her eyes traveled past him and he read her concern easily paddys already gone i told him i needed to speak with you for a minute releasing her chin travis reached into his pocket and pulled out her cross and chain oh you found it her face lifted to his illuminating the room more brilliantly than the sun thank you travis for troubling it means a great deal to me theres no need to thank me dee and it wasnt a question of troubling he tucked a strand of hair behind her ear in a gentle gesture that threatened to dissolve her knees the clasp is broken ill have it repaired for you you dont have to do that i can i said ill have it repaired his voice was firm and her brows drew together at the underlying anger in his tone letting out a long breath he slipped the cross back into his pocket then carefully framed her face with his hands adelia im responsible for what happened last night no dont argue he commanded as her mouth opened to contradict what happens to youto the people who work for me he amended is my responsibility i wanted you to know id found your cross so you wouldnt worry ill have the chain repaired and get it back to you as soon as possible all right she murmured finding currents of pleasure brushing along her skin as his hands continued to cup her face as if it were something fragile and precious he smiled and his thumb traced her lips with a teasing lightness at times dee you can be surprisingly docile then just when i think youve been halter broke you start bucking again drawing away adelia straightened her shoulders im not a mare to be pulled about on a lead line smile became grin travis tousled her hair before taking her hand and pulling her from the room maybe youll find it depends whos holding the line the days passed slowly for adelia as the two main men in her life were absent for a time paddy had accompanied majesty to florida in preparation for the flamingo stakes she found for one who had always taken her own selfsufficiency for granted that the nights grew longer without paddys company the house seemed large and quiet and empty alone in the evening she reflected how easily a heart could be lost to another in less time than it takes for the moon to go from full glory to a sliver of light love had swept over her leaving her vulnerable love for paddy a sweet full warmth of belonging and love for travis an aching spreading need she built a fire though the spring air was kind through opened windows and curled up in front of its company her head resting on the arm of her chair paddy would be home the next day and she found the knowledge comforting for with his presence there would not be so many hours alone so many hours to think travis would not leave her thoughts or her heart and seeing him daily brought as much torment as it did delight as the fire grew soft and low in the grate her mind drifted to him her lashes fluttering down to conceal her dreams her hair falling in a curtain against her cheek dee she stirred in the twilight world of dreams sighing as a hand brushed through her hair dee wake up lids opened slowly and eyes misted with sleep focused on travis her hand lifted to touch his cheek before fantasy was completely dimmed oh dropping her hand she struggled to sit up pushing back her hair to look up at him travis she felt fresh color warm her sleepflushed cheeks and pulled the neck of her faded blue robe closer together i must have fallen asleep if i could have understood how anyone could be comfortable in that position i would have left you alone smiling he moved from his crouched position to sit on the arm where her cheek had rested desperately aware of his nearness adelia pushed far into the corner of the chair her hands clasped in her lap i was just thinking that uncle paddy would be home tomorrow she said with partial honesty yes id like to have gone with him but i just couldnt get away he laid a finger under her chin and lifted it the dying power of the fire danced in her hair youve missed him aye her smile spread as her eyes traveled over his face and majesty as well his smile answered hers and as the moment grew long she felt the need to abort the contact im sorry majesty didnt win his race her fingers smoothed the skirts of her robe hmm his hands were exploring the flickers of light in her hair and she repeated her statement in a rush of words oh well he placed and made a good run winning takes time dee with a laugh travis ruffled her hair time patience and strategy look i have something for you reaching into his pocket he drew out her cross i didnt have the opportunity to give it to you earlier today oh travis thank you she lifted her face again to smile it means a great deal i know instead of handing it to her travis opened the clasp and slipped the chain around her neck his fingers on her skin were warm and gentle and adelia lowered her eyes struggling not to tremble better he asked when the clasp was secured and she nodded swallowing before the words would come much better thank you travis he studied her bent head a moment then taking her hand he pulled her to her feet come on close the door behind me and go to bed youre tired reaching the door he paused one hand on the knob you look like a child her chestnut hair hung loose and heavy over the shoulders of her robe and he ran a hand down the length of it a child cant be bundled off to bed without a goodnight kiss he said softly before she could step away his hand had circled her neck his mouth lowering to linger on her cheek while her lips parted in hunger her hunger was to go unsatisfied for his mouth barely brushed her other cheek as in a dream she watched him straighten then turn to leave closing the door gently behind him with paddys return royal meadows threw itself into preparing majesty for the bluegrass stakes the race was a preliminary for the most prestigious race in the country the kentucky derby majestys record was impressive and his good showing in florida had hopes running high for his next venture on the track adelia leaned on the fence surrounding the track chin resting on crossed arms as steve parker the young jockey raced majesty around the large oval there had been an immediate liking between her and the small man an easy rapport born of a mutual love of horses she watched their progress around the track enjoying their fluid harmony pushing the button on the stopwatch he was holding paddy let out a loud whoop of approval before he handed it to travis if he runs like that in kentucky theres not another horse will come within five lengths of him at the finish he holds the turns like a lover aye and he runs for the sheer love of it adelia murmured sighing as steve brought the colt toward them in a slow walk lets hope he loves it as much in kentucky travis put in and sauntered over to speak to his jockey are you excited about your first race little dee paddy asked ruffling her hair you might say im a bit excited she returned with a grin my eyes will be glued to the television not even a ton of dynamite could blast me away television paddy repeated the skin crinkling around his eyes as he narrowed them whats put it in your mind about television youll be coming with us coming with you she stared back in confusion of course adelia she spun around at traviss voice her eyes making contact with his hard chest before she tilted her head back to meet his calm controlled gaze now why would i be doing that because he answered evenly i say so is that the way of it she demanded infuriated by the tone of command in his voice well if its a groom you need theres others whove been here longer stan or tom deserves to go more than me but dee steve protested with a wide grin as he joined them youre much prettier than those two id rather look at youyoull give me inspiration inspiration is it she returned amused by the compliment youre mad as a hatter she turned to travis again shifting her eye level by several long inches i think youd best take one of the men she began but he cut her off narrowing his eyes and grabbing her hand excuse us he called over his shoulder as he began to stride off dragging adelia in his wake when at last he stopped some distance away she rounded on him furiously what the devil do you mean racing off like that and carting me behind you she panted outraged your legs are almost as long as my whole body and i had to fair run to keep up with you she glared up at him a picture of righteous indignation i prefer to argue in private adelia travis said coolly meeting her mutinous face with nonchalant command i run royal meadows and i give the orders even through her own anger adelia could see the signs of temper held in check his eyes hard and direct he was suddenly the essence of the master i will not have you countermanding my orders privately and most certainly not publicly his words annoyed her further simply because she knew he was right youre going to have to get it through that stubborn head of yours that you are no longer in solitary control of what is to be done now i believe the issue here is your presence in kentucky he went on calmly his face expressionless i was telling you im telling you he interrupted imperiously youre going her eyes flashed at the order why she thought if its gods pleasure for me not to be forever bursting with temper did he give me such a demanding one majesty responds better to you than anyone else travis went on i want you tending to him anger receded slowly at his words and she dropped her eyes staring at the ground while she considered his statement youll come to kentucky because it suits me to have you there and im accustomed to having what suits me his smile spread in a rapid change of mood as her head snapped up with fresh anger his hands claimed her waist then trailed slowly upward resting on the sides of her firm young breasts as her anger faded into confusion lingering his thumbs caressed in a slow circle then trailed once in a lazy arch over the subtle curves pausing at their fullness before moving to rest under their soft swell her lips parted but she found no strength to protest against the unfamiliar intimacy her body responding to his touch eclipsing her will she felt herself rising from the ground and her hands went to his shoulders automatically to compensate for the loss of gravity put me down the order emerged as a trembling whisper and his smile grew wider before his mouth lowered in a minute his mouth was dominant and sure and her fingers dug into his shoulders as the force of the kiss held her in its prison with a final flash of lucidity she knew she could never fight travis on these terms then all was lost in the dark demand of need steves right he murmured his teeth nibbling at her lip and sending shooting sparks of flame through her veins you are prettier than tom or stan with a final hard brief kiss he dropped her back to the ground to stride away with casual arrogance whistling the first few bars of my wild irish rose adelia stood gaping after him trembling with a confusing mixture of indignation and longing chapter adelia found herself on a plane for the second time in her life this plane however was vastly different from the crowded economy section of the passenger jet in which she had traveled over the atlantic now she was passing over the relatively short distance between maryland and kentucky in the lush comfort of traviss specially equipped private jet adelias attitude during this flight was also a marked variation from her first she stared mesmerized from the window fascinated by the topography of fardistant west virginia she looked down on patchworks of green and umber dotted by small houses toytrain cities and gray ribbons of roads snaking and winding to connect them there were rivers and pinetopped mountains their colors soft from her eagle view and she thought with pleasure that the world was indeed a wondrous place engrossed in her new discoveries she did not notice when travis sat next to her enjoying the view dee he asked at length smiling at the way she pressed her forehead to the glass like a child at a bakery window she started at his voice then turned her head to face him pushing back the chestnut curls that spilled over her face at the movement merciful heavens youre forever surprising me you move like the wind through a willow sorry ill practice stomping he grinned and shifted in his seat to regard her more directly ive often thought you move like one of those fairies irelands so famous for or maybe one of your leprechauns oh well it cant be both a leprechauns not considered a fit associate for a reputable fairy only a disreputable fairy he returned amused at the sobriety of her statement aye and for the most part theyre on their good behavior hoping to be readmitted to paradise on the last day tossed out were they when satan was rebelling they stood back from the fighting not wanting to take sides till they knew how it would end but since that was their only offense they were banished to earth instead of tossed into the pit with the rebels seems fair travis concluded with a nod as i recall they have the rather awesome power to turn one into a dog or a pig or something equally undesirable but are normally disposed to good deeds if treated with the proper respect thats right she agreed how did you know that paddy saw to the holes in my education he leaned over her smiling and she pressed back into the cushions green eyes growing wide relax his voice tightened in annoyance im not going to eat you he fastened the seat belt around her waist and leaned back well be landing in a minute so soon she controlled her voice to casualness while the beating of her heart vibrated in her ears thats right he answered matching her tone as he secured his own belt youve been staring down at kentucky for some time now with amazing organization and economy of movement the plane was landed majesty was unloaded and transferred to a waiting van and the travelers were on their way to churchill downs adelias impression of louisville was vague her mind was in the back of the van with majesty she worried that he might be frightened and confused by the strange sights and long transport when she voiced her concern she was rewarded with a deep full laugh from travis the ominous gleam in her eye was ignored as chuckling he informed her that majesty was a seasoned traveler and took it in his stride her irritation had faded by the time the van reached the extensive stables at churchill downs travis immediately confirmed the arrangements that had been made for majestys stall space and feed travis grant was well known and highly respected in racing circles adelia noted that he was greeted with warmth by the men and women milling around the stable area he stood head and shoulders above the group exuding power and a virile masculinity which she observed with a rude stab of jealousy was obviously appreciated by the women who greeted him infuriated with herself for her own weakness adelia turned sharply back to majesty and led the gleaming colt into his stall time passed swiftly as she tended to the animals needs brushing and soothing as she kept up a flow of onesided chatter as she was completing her duties she heard loud footsteps approaching and turned around to see who was causing the din loud enough travis grinned at her with unexpected boyishness aye she agreed and gave him a solemn nod you sounded like a herd of great african elephants youre a funny man travis she commented tilting her head to the side and studying him am i dee how theres times youre like the local squire tossing orders about and the steel in your eyes could freeze a man in his tracks then i think youre a hard man but then sometimes faltering she shrugged and turned back to majesty dont stop now deliberately he turned her back to face him a faint smile playing on his mouth youve intrigued me she was uncomfortable now and wishing with a full heart that she would learn to think before speaking but travis ignored her expression of embarrassment hands light but firm on her shoulders eyes demanding her elaboration sometimes ive seen you laughing and talking with the men or carting one of the twins about on your shoulders and i see the way it is between you and uncle paddy and the way you treat your horses i think then maybe theres a gentle side and maybe youre not so hard after all she finished in a rush wishing she had never started and turned back to give majesty unnecessary additional attention with the brush thats very interesting he commented taking the brush from her hand and continuing the grooming himself shes spoiling you he addressed majesty running an affectionate hand along his flank shed stand in here rubbing you down for the next hour if i let her she tore her eyes from traviss fingers as they stroked the rich chestnut hide i dont spoil him it was just love and care i was giving we all need that from time to time he turned his head and met her eyes with a long level look yes we all need that from time to time that night awake in the unfamiliar hotel room adelia tossed and turned ultimately rolling over and pounding her innocent pillow love was decidedly uncomfortable unpredictable and unwelcome sighing she hugged the pillow she had just beaten determined to erase incredibly blue eyes from her dreams the next morning adelia had her first real look at churchill downs leading majesty from the stables she stopped as she came to the track her companion waiting with calm indulgence as she stared in open amazement the grounds were enormous the wide mileandaquarter track encircling a grass field bordered by fences and graced with wellshaped shrubs and flower beds of brilliant color moving her eyes over the vast expanse of stands she wondered somewhat whimsically who would be left to tend to the outside world when they were filled with people the tops of the stands were roofed crowned with spires she noted something wrong dee her observations were interrupted by traviss question and she jumped in surprise sorry he said without bothering to conceal a grin forgot to stomp i should be getting used to it by now she sighed and began to lead majesty along once more what a grand place this is her hand swept in an expressive arch as he fell into step beside her its one of my favorites the architectures basically the same as it was when it was built over a hundred years ago and as you well know its the most famous track of all because it is here that the derby is run and the derby everyone remembers on the first saturday in may this ribbon of track is gold and for a few minutes the world stops and its only the race he turned to her with a smile it all conies down to the challenge at the turn for home when the goal is still a quarter of a mile away since eighteen seventyfive the best horses have run here and the best horses have won here its not only the classic race its a breeders race and there isnt anyone in the states who wouldnt rather produce a winner in this than in any other contest the winner of a derby becomes the horse to beat for the rest of the season the magic stays with him and this he continued giving majesty a friendly slap on the flank is one who likes to win aye that he does she agreed giving majesty an indulgent smile and hes not shy about his own capabilities hes feeling pretty sure of himself he wants the bluegrass stakes out of the way so he can move on to the derby does he the corner of his mouth tilted as majesty nuzzled adelias shoulder and how do you feel his finger touched her cheek and she turned to face him do you want the prep race out of the way so you can dive into the derby im not ready for the first one yet adelia shrugged nearly stumbling as majestys head nudged at her back its him thats in the hurry but i like the looks of this place again she encompassed churchill downs with a sweep of the hand i like knowing it hasnt changed much in all these years she began to walk again at majestys urging never did i think to see such a place there are other tracks that are perhaps more eyecatching he commented following her fascinated gaze at hialeah in florida they have hundreds of pink flamingos in the centerfield lake stopping she turned to him with wide eyes i should like to see that im sure you will he murmured twining his fingers in the ends of her long silky waves then pulling the brim of her cap down over her eyes he repeated in a lighter tone yes dee im sure you will the week moved swiftly hours crammed with duties and activities most of adelias time was given to majestys care talking and fondling as much as grooming and seeing to his more practical needs she spent much of her free time with steve parker teasing him about his girlfriends or watching from the rail as he accustomed majesty to the track other times she spent with paddy discussing the thoroughbreds qualities and the style of the other colts who would compete in the qualifying race the colt that wins is automatically eligible for the derby he informed her giving majesty a thorough examination as she watched from the stall door of course travis nominated this fellow right after he was born the same way hes entered solomys foal and kept up with the nomination as he got older he knows when hes got a winner travis is a man who keeps one eye on the future hes good with the horses adelia commented the obvious pride and affection in paddys voice warmed her you can see he cares for them its not just a matter of the money theyll bring him aye he cares paddy agreed giving majesty an affectionate slap on the flank and hes fierce on the matter of using painkillers or drugs as others have been known to do if one of traviss horses isnt up for the race he doesnt run and thats that of course moneys not a problem with travis but it wouldnt make any difference if it was because thats the man he is now he has a practical side as well he moved from the stall to join adelia and slipped an arm around her shoulder investmentsand hes mighty crafty about them he knows how to take a purse or the sale of a foal and turn it into more hes got the touch paddy added with a wise nod and a time or two hes stretched my pennies for me though not on as grand a scale as his travis takes care of his own squeezing her shoulder paddy led adelia out into the flash of sunlight she remained silent thinking of this new aspect of the man she loved the sky was overcast on the day of the bluegrass stakes the air was heavy leadgray clouds lay thick as a blanket overhead tension seemed to start at adelias brow and spread down to her toes the stillness of the air weighed like a stone at the nape of her neck to take her thoughts off the coming race she kept both hands and mind busy glancing up she saw travis enter the building she smiled as he approached i believe that if you could youd get into the silks and ride him today the truth of it is she began finding the ease of his smile soothing i think id be less terrified that way but i dont think steve would care for it no the syllable was accompanied by a slow grave nod i dont think he would come up to the stands with me paddyll take over now oh but her objection was neatly cut off as he captured her arm and propelled her to the door wait she cried and pivoted to run swiftly back to majesty throwing her arms around his neck and whispering in his ear when she rejoined travis he stared down at her both amused and frankly curious what did you tell him she gave him a mysterious smile for an answer as they approached the stands she dug into her back pocket and thrust some bills into his hands will you place a wager for me i dont know how to go about it a wager he repeated looking down at the two dollars in his hand looking up his features were entirely too serious who do you want to bet on majesty of course she frowned at the question her expression lightening as she recalled some of the terms she had heard tossed around the stables to win on the nose to his credit traviss features remained grave i see well lets see his odds are five to two at the moment brows drawn he studied the odds board now number three there is ten to one but thats not too long for a gambler number six is two to one thats rather conservative i dont know about all that she interrupted with a frustrated wave of her hand its just all a bunch of numbers adelia he said her name slowly giving her a small pat on the shoulder one must never bet unless one knows the odds ignoring her he glanced back up at the flashing numbers its three to one on number two a nice safe choice for win place or show its eight to five on number one travis youre making my head spin with all of this i just want to and fifteen to one on number five he looked down at the two crumpled bills you could amass a small fortune if that one came in its not for the money her breath came out in one impatient huff its for the luck ah i see he returned with a solemn nod before the grin escaped and spread irish luck is not to be scoffed at though she scowled quite fiercely for a moment he slipped his arm over her shoulders and led her to the twodollar window before long she was standing next to him and gaping openly at the masses of people filling the stands the enormous stadium would hold one hundred and twentyfive thousand travis had informed her and to her astonished eyes there seemed to be no less than that several people greeted travis and she felt an occasional twinge of discomfort as eyes often passed over her in speculation embarrassment was soon eclipsed by excitement as post time approached she watched the horses step onto the track her eyes immediately focusing on majesty and the rider in brilliant red and gold silks on his back as majestys name was announced adelia closed her eyes finding the combination of excitement and nerves nearly overpowering he looked ready travis commented casually then laughed as she jolted at his words relax dee its just another race ill never be easy about it if i see a hundred she vowed oh here comes uncle paddy is it going to start for answer he pointed and she watched the horses being loaded into the starting gate her hand clutched at the cross at her neck and she felt traviss arm slip over her shoulder as the bell sounded and ten powerful forms lunged forward it seemed to her a mass of flying hooves and thunderous noise the pack clinging together in one speeding block still her eyes were glued on majesty as though he were racing alone her hand reached up of its own accord to grasp the one on her shoulder tightening as she urged the colt to greater speed steadily he moved forward as if following her remotecontrol command persistently passing one then another until he emerged alone from the field suddenly the long legs increased their stride streaking across the dirt track until his competitors were left with the sight of his massive hindquarters as he lunged under the wire traviss arm encircled her and adelia found herself crushed to his hard chest sandwiched between his lean body and her uncles stocky frame it was like being caught fast between two unmoving loving walls and she found the sensation tortuously wonderful a heady mixture of scents and textures her uncles voice was raised in excitement in her ear and her head was snuggled as if it belonged against traviss chest majestys win she decided closing her eyes was the best present she had ever had every man woman and child in louisville ate slept and breathed the kentucky derby as the days dwindled the very air seemed to shimmer with anticipation adelia saw travis sporadically their conversations revolved around the colt the only personal aspect of their relationship being the abstracted pat on the head he would give her from time to time she began to think that quarreling with him had had its advantages and she relieved her frustrations by spending more time with majesty youre a fine great horse she told him holding his muzzle and looking into his intelligent eyes but you mustnt let all of this go to your head youve a job to do come saturday and its a big one now im going out for a few minutes and i want you to rest yourself then perhaps well see about a currying satisfied with majestys silent agreement adelia stepped out of the stables into the bright may sun and found herself surrounded by reporters are you the groom in charge of royal meadows majesty the question was fired out by one of the people who suddenly cut her off from the rest of the world with a wall of bodies the sensation was disconcerting and she was thinking wistfully of the dim solitude of the stables when she heard another voice you dont see many grooms that look like this one she rounded on the man who had spoken squinting against the sun to see more clearly is that the truth now she demanded discomfort replaced by annoyance i thought red hair was common enough in america the group roared with laughter and the man at whom her remark had been directed responded with a goodnatured grin questions were fired at her and for a few moments she surrendered to the pressure and answered valiantly attempting to keep one query separate from the next by the saints she threw up her hands in dismay shaking her head youre all speaking in a muddle pushing the brim of her cap back from her head she took a deep breath if its more information youre wanting youd best ask mr grant or majestys trainer she pushed through them with determination turning when she felt a hand on her arm and finding herself facing the reporter who had made the personal observation miss cunnane sorry if we were a little rough on you he smiled with considerable charm and adelia found herself smiling back no harm was done im jack gordon maybe youd let me make it up to you by taking you out to dinner tonight she was both surprised and flattered by the invitation gaining the pure feminine pleasure of having an attractive man pay her specific attention he was however a stranger and she was opening her mouth to decline when a voice sounded behind her sorry my grooms off limits she whirled around to see travis watching them blue eyes cool and direct fury bubbled inside her reflecting plainly in her flashing eyes dont you have some work to do adelia he asked with an imperial lift of brows the eyes that met his told him without words what she thought of his question before she wheeled around and stalked to the stables some fifteen minutes later travis disengaged himself from the avid reporters and joined her she watched as he strode toward her hands carelessly thrust in the pockets of slimfitting jeans dont you know better than to make dates with strange men adelia his tone was deliberate superior and infuriating my personal life is my own affair she raged at him youve no right to interfere as long as youre in my employ and responsible for my horses your life is my affair aye master grant she tossed back undaunted by the narrowing of his eyes ill be certain to ask your permission before i take my next breath her foot stomped in temper i didnt arrive on this earth yesterday i can take care of myself were you taking care of yourself in the stables a couple of weeks ago she paled at this and turned away with a muttered curse he turned her around to face him dee im sorry that wasnt fair no it wasnt she jerked away eyes bright with angry tears but it doesnt surprise me youd be saying it youve a habit of putting me in my place master grant and ive been reminded theres work to be done so be off with you and let me be about it removing her cap she dropped a curtsy if it please your honor ive had just about enough you greeneyed witch he muttered taking a step toward her id like to haul you over my knee for the spanking you deserve but ill get more out of this sort of punishment he had her crushed against him with a speed that allowed her only a short gasp of protest before his mouth descended hard then demanding then possessing in rapid succession when he lifted his mouth she felt him drawing her soul through her eyes im not going to make a habit of this he muttered and took her lips again his fingers tangling in her hair then moving over her back until she thought she would perish from the heat featherlight tremors followed the trail of his hand along her spine touching her with an exquisite fear she felt the pressure of his arms bending her back his mouth hard on hers demanding not response but submission she became aware of her own slightness a fragility she had never known was part of her as his strength overpowered even the thought of struggle lucidity drifted from her leaving only the feel of a hard body and a demanding mouth which took from her until even breathing was impossible drawing away travis held dee steady as she staggered he stood a moment looking down thoughtfully into her flushed face you know dee he said at length his voice as calm and unperturbed as she was ruffled and confused youre too little to possess such a dangerous temper flicking a friendly finger down her nose he strode out into the sunshine the day of the derby was an advertisement for spring warm with a soft scented breeze under a clear cloudless sky the perfection of the weather meant nothing to adelia whose nerves were so tightly coiled that it could have easily been midwinter seeing travis several times during the morning and early afternoon she was both envious and annoyed by his calm easygoing manner while she remained a massive bundle of quivering nerves between the lingering sensation of her last encounter with him and the prospect of the race she found functioning at even borderline normality an effort waiting through the preliminary races was sheer torture she found herself beside travis in the stands thinking that if the race did not begin soon she would have to be carted away and locked up until it was over here adelia glanced down at the glass he offered before raising her eyes to his what is it a mint julep taking her hand he placed the glass in it and curled her fingers around it drink it he commanded then smiled at the frown she gave it the purpose is twofold one its traditional and you can keep the glass to remember your first derby and two he continued grinning you need something to calm your nerves im afraid youre going to keel over so am i she admitted and sipped gingerly from the glass travis i would swear there are more people here than the last time where do they all come from everywhere he returned easily following her fascinated gaze the run for the roses is the most important race of the season why do they call it that she asked finding the combination of conversation and mint julep soothing the winners draped with a blanket of red roses in the winners circle and the jockey gets an armful so he concluded and lifted his own glass its the run for the roses thats nice she approved lifting the brim of her cap further on her head majesty will like red roses im sure hell be crazy about them travis agreed with suspicious sobriety and adelias dignified retort was interrupted by the first strains of my old kentucky home oh travis the parades starting she fastened her eyes on majesty and the small man on his back clad in colorful red and gold silks the others with their brilliant contrasts of blues and greens and yellows paled before her eyes to her there was not another animal to compare in power and beauty with traviss thoroughbred coltand judging by the way majesty pranced he agreed completely saints preserve us uncle paddy she murmured as he appeared at her side my hearts pounding so im sure itll burst i dont think im made for this her eyes never left majestys form as he was loaded into the gate her senses swam with the blare of the trumpets and the roar of the crowd with a swiftness that took her breath away the doors were released and the horses sprang forward in a turbulent herd her eyes followed the colt as he galloped with steady assurance around the track she was not even aware that as the bell had rung she had grabbed traviss hand in a viselike grip squeezing tighter as each heartpounding second passed the air shivered with the voice of the crowd individual calls and shouts melding into one trembling roar she rode every inch of the track on majestys back feeling the rush of wind on her face and the strong rhythm of the colts gait under her as they rounded the second turn steve brought majesty to the inside rail and the colt took his head and left the field with long smooth strides the gap between the chestnut and his nearest competitor widened with what appeared to be effortless ease as he streaked down the back stretch into the home stretch and under the wire more than four lengths in the lead without hesitation adelia threw herself into traviss arms clinging with a joy which she could only express physically by babbling incoherent and selfinterrupted sentences to both him and her uncle who was improvising an enthusiastic jig beside her come on travis tossed an arm around paddys shoulders weve got to get down to the winners circle before the crowds too thick ill wait for you adelia pulled back stooping to retrieve her dislodged cap i dont like all those reporters staring and snapping and jumping all over me with their questions ill wait on the outside and take majesty along when its over all right travis agreed but tonight we celebrate what do you say paddy i say ive just acquired a strong yearning for champagne the two men grinned at each other that evening adelia stared at the reflection in the fulllength mirror of her room her hair lay full and lush on her shoulders shining like newly minted copper against the muted greens of her dress well adelia cunnane look at you she smiled with satisfaction into the mirror theres not a one back in skibbereen whod be knowing you in such a dress and thats the truth of it a knock sounded at her door and she plucked her key from the dresser im coming uncle paddy opening the door with a dazzling smile she was not greeted by her merryfaced uncle but by an incredibly attractive travis in a dark dinner suit the white silk of his shirt startling against his deep tan they stood silently for a moment as his gaze roamed over her from shining hair and deep green eyes to the soft rounded curves outlined by the clinging jersey his gaze rose to her face again but still he did not smile well adelia youre astonishingly beautiful her eyes widened at the compliment and she searched for something suitable to say thank you she finally managed i thought youd be uncle paddy his eyes continued to hold her in the doorway and she moistened her lips with the tip of her tongue in an innocently inviting gesture paddys meeting us downstairs with steve the singleminded intensity with which she was being studied was rapidly stripping her of all composure and her words tumbled out quickly wed best be joining themtheyll be waiting travis merely nodded a slight inclination of his head and she took a step toward him only to stop nervously when he made no move to let her pass raising her eyes from his shirtfront to his face she opened her mouth to speak only to find her mind a vacuum he gazed down at her for another unnerving moment then held up a single red rose placing it in her hand majesty sent it he says youre fond of red roses oh he was not smiling with the whimsy of his words and her mind fidgeted for something to ease the sudden awareness the physical strength of his gaze i didnt know you talked to horses im learning he answered simply and ran a finger over her bare shoulder my teachers an expert she dropped her eyes to the bloom in her hand thinking that twice in her life she had been given flowers and both times they had come from travis both times they had been red roses she smiled knowing she would never again see a red rose without thinking of him that was a gift more precious than jewels open and innocent her smile lifted for him thank you travis for bringing it to me on impulse she rose to her toes and kissed his cheek he stared down at her and for a moment adelia thought she saw some hesitation some indecision flicker in his eyes before his features relaxed into a smile youre welcome dee bring it alongit suits you taking the key from her hand he placed it in his pocket and led her to the elevator the celebration dinner was a new experience for adelia the elegant restaurant the unaccustomed dishes and her first encounter with champagne combined to give her a glowing sense of unreality the tension brought on by the few moments alone with travis was dispelled by his casually friendly attitude during the meal it was almost as though the awareness that had passed between them had never taken place the evening drifted by in a haze of happiness the following week however found her back in maryland in jeans and cap busily fulfilling her duties and thrusting elegant meals and fancy dresses from her mind long hours of grooming exercising and training filled the days giving her little time to dwell on the strange new emotions travis had aroused she avoided the reporters who were often hovering around the track and stables not wishing to be cornered again and bombarded with questions at night however she was less successful in avoiding the dreams that assaulted her awakened senses days passed into weeks and although adelia gave all the thoroughbreds love and attention she continued to dote on majesty dont forget yourself just because youve had your picture in some fancy magazines she admonished him failing to keep her voice stern as she completed his grooming paddy strolled into the stables and laid a hand on her shoulder keeping him in line are you little dee dont want him too big for his breeches do we that we dont turning she smiled at her uncle then studied him carefully you look tired uncle paddy arent you feeling well im fine dee just fine he patted her rosy cheek and winked at her i think ill sleep for a week when the belmonts come and gone youve earned a rest youve been working hard and long youre a bit pale are you sure now dont fuss he interrupted with a goodnatured scowl nothing worse than a fussing woman just be keeping your mind on this lad here he patted majestys side dont you worry about paddy cunnane she let this pass vowing silently to keep her eye on him uncle paddy is the belmont important every race is important darlin and this is one of the top now this fellow here with that barrel of a chesthe inclined his head toward majesty and winked againhell do well there its a long race a mile and a half and thats what he was bred for a distance runner and one of the finest not like fortune mind you hes a sprinter and can beat almost anything at a shorter distance travis is smart enough to breed horses with both distance and sprinting in mind thats why he put fortune in the preakness at pimlico and he was second by half a length and thats just fine but this ones for the belmont he shook majestys head lightly by the muzzle and so are you he added giving adelia a pat on the head me am i going as well thats right hasnt travis told you well no i havent seen much of him since we got back from kentucky hes been busy her answer was absent as she considered the wisdom of attempting to refuse recalling the result of her previous attempt adelia thought new york might be a fine place to visit belmont park on long island was alive with reporters adelia managed to stay in the background the majority of the time and when cornered she escaped as soon as possible she was unaware of the speculation about her and her relationship with the owner of royal meadows majesty the casual attire of jeans and shut did nothing to conceal the appeal of her beauty and her reluctance to speak with the press added a mystery that acted as a meaty bone to the hungry pack of reporters at times she felt hounded and wished she had stood firm and refused to come then she would see travis as he moved toward the stables hands in pockets hair ruffled by the breeze she would admit though it brought little comfort that she would have gone mad had she been left behind newspapers and nagging reporters were not in adelias thoughts as she joined travis for the third time in the crowded stands she noticed with some discomfort that belmont and its occupants were more sophisticated than churchill downs there size had been offset by an oldworld charm the soft lazy accent of louisville somehow belmont seemed more vast more intimidating and beside the sophistication of the elegantly groomed women who occupied the stands and clubhouse adelia felt inadequate and naive silly she told herself and straightened her shoulders i cant be like them and theyre certainly taking no notice of me in any case most of these fine ladies cant keep their eyes off travis i suppose these are the kind of ladies he sees at his country club or takes out for a quiet dinner depression threatened to settle over her like a black cloud but she took a deep breath and blew it away adelia had lectured herself that by this time she should be accustomed to the tension and the crush of people but as post time drew closer she found the familiar anxiety and undeniable excitement capture her she could find neither words nor ability to speak and stood gripping the rail with both hands as majesty strutted to the starting gate he was impatient she observed sidestepping and lifting his front legs in small nervous prancing steps as steve struggled to control him urging him forward into his place in the starting gate ill have to bring you to the track more often dee travis gave her shoulder a small squeeze in a couple of months youll be a veteran ill never be a veteran im afraid because each time it seems like the first i can hardly bear it im going to keep bringing you in any case he informed her tangling his fingers for a moment in the ends of her hair you bring the excitement back i believe id been taking it for granted she turned to him nonplussed by the gentle tone of his voice and had opened her mouth to speak when the bell shrilled with the roar of the crowd brilliant silks were now a soft blur as thoroughbreds thundered around the track after the first turn the field dispersed transforming from a single mound of speeding legs to a zigzagging cluster of gleaming bodies to adelia majesty seemed to weave his way through them like a fiery comet passing one after another until he bore down on the leader then as if a switch had been flicked came the power the lengthening of stride the rippling of muscles the steady increase of his lead until majesty flew down the home stretch capturing the coveted belmont with power and style the crowd went wild cheering and shouting with one deafening voice adelias feet left the ground as travis lifted her swinging her in circles as she clung to his neck he continued to hold her as paddys arms came around them both drawing them all together in joy and excitement the words shouted were senseless to her and she told herself later that it was the temporary insanity of the moment that had caused her to meet traviss lips with hers even on later reflection she was unclear who had initiated the kiss but she knew she had responded she had flung her arms around his neck and the thrill that had coursed through her had eclipsed even the rushing flurry of the race when her feet touched the ground and travis lifted his mouth from hers her head was still spinning with light and color her body trembling with the backlash of emotion the tidal wave of sensation she could do no more than stare up at him for a moment it was the same as the day the foal had been born and the crowded noisy stands of belmont park faded into a solitary private world she was oblivious to the throng and the curious stares aware only of his arms around her and the feeling that she was slowly helplessly drowning in his eyes wed best be going down lad paddy made a business of clearing his throat before he laid a hand on traviss shoulder her knees weakened as his eyes left hers to meet her uncles she felt the sudden dizziness and disorientation of one who had been awakened from a dream too quickly yes travis grinned the quickspreading grin of a boy lets go congratulate the winner come on spinning adelia around he began to lead her away im not going down there she objected making a futile attempt to hold her ground yes you are he disagreed not bothering to glance back at her i let you have your way before not this time youre coming down to help majesty accept his flowers white carnations this time and ones for you her sputtering objections and attempts to disentangle herself went unheeded and she found herself in the winners circle with the others there were microphones and the flash of lights and she faded into the background as far as possible she was still shaken by the intensity of need that had flowed through her in traviss embrace a strong wild desire to belong to him completely it was like being assailed with an unquenchable thirst and the sensation terrified her her morals were deeply rooted a melding of religious and personal beliefs she knew however that her longing for travis her love for him made her weak and any resistance would melt as quickly as springtime snow if he pressed his advantage she must stay away from him she determined avoid situations where they would be alone and she would be vulnerable to his experience and her frailty as she glanced over at his tall lean frame their eyes locked and she trembled her lashes swept down and she realized helplessly what a rabbit feels when cornered by a strong sleek fox chapter back at the hotel adelia accompanied paddy to his room having no wish to be alone with her thoughts travis walked down the carpeted hall with them pausing at the doorway as they slipped through ive made reservations for us his teeth flashed in a grin steves doing his own celebrating with a little lady whos been dogging his footsteps since the derby ah travis paddy sat down heavily on the bed youll have to do without this tired old man im weary to the bone he gave a smile and a shake of his head ive had all the excitement i can stand for today ill play lord of the manor and have my dinner in bed like royalty uncle paddy adelia moved closer dropping a hand on his brow youre not feeling well ill stay with you go on with you he made a dismissing gesture with his hand fussing like your grandmother used to its tired i am not sick the next thing i know youll be pouring some strange remedy down my throat or threatening me with a poultice he glanced up at travis with a longsuffering sigh shes a worrisome bundle lad take her off my hands and give these old bones a rest with a nod of masculine understanding travis turned to adelia be ready in fortyfive minutes he stated simply i dont like to be late do this do that she fumed throwing up her hands never a will you or may i im not in the stables now travis grant and i dont fancy being ordered about she tossed back her fiery curls and folded her arms across her chest travis raised a quizzical eyebrow before he moved to the door wear that green thing dee i like it he closed the door against any possible further outbursts dee was ready at the appointed time having been cajoled by her uncle to leave him and celebrate majestys victory telling herself she was only going out with the arrogant brute for paddys sake she zipped herself into the green dress as a knock sounded at her door muttering disjointedly about the devils own spawn she swung open the door and glared good evening adelia he greeted her obviously unconcerned by her warlike stance youre looking lovely are you ready she glowered at him for another moment wishing she had something handy to throw at him tilting her chin she stepped into the hall closing the door with force behind her she clung to her stubborn silence as the taxi drove through surging traffic but travis remained unperturbed chatting amiably and pointing out various spots of interest he was making it very difficult for her to keep her anger on the boil defiance wavered as they entered the restaurant grander than she could ever have imagined wideeyed she gazed around her at the sophisticated patrons in their evening dress she allowed herself to be led unresisting to a quiet corner table greatly impressed by the elegance of the maitre d softly lit and situated for privacy the table sat high above the throbbing city the lights blinking and speeding below a direct contrast to their quiet seclusion she glanced up as their waiter requested her choice of cocktail then looked across at travis with a helpless shake of her head smiling he ordered champagne its a shame we couldnt bring majesty with us she commented then grinned animosity forgotten he did all the work and were drinking the champagne i very much doubt hed appreciate it even if we took him back a bottle for a royal steed he has the taste of a peasant sohe paused allowing his finger to rub gently over her hand as it rested on the clothits up to us to drink to his victory did you know adelia the candlelight scatters gold through your eyes surprised by his sudden observation she merely stared greatly relieved when the arrival of the champagne saved her from inventing a response shall we have a toast dee lifting the slenderstemmed glass she smiled more at ease to majesty the winner of the belmont stakes his lips curved as he copied her gesture to winning hungry he asked after an interlude of quiet conversation whats your pleasure well it wont be mutton and potatoes she murmured absently sighing at the strange workings of the world that had shifted her into a new life her attention came to a full stop as she glanced over the menu her eyes lifting to his wide and astonished is something wrong its robbery sure as faith theres not another word for it he leaned forward taking both her hands in his and grinning at her anxious expression are you sure theres no scots blood in you adelia opened her mouth to retort highly insulted but he raised her hands to his lips causing the words to die before they were born dont get your irish up dee he smiled over their joined hands and overlook the prices im able to deal with them she shook her head i cant look at it againit makes my head spin ill have what you have chuckling he ordered the meal and more wine as his hands held hers captive when they were once more alone he turned her hands over examining her palms ignoring the sharp jerk she made to release herself youre taking better care of them he murmured rubbing his thumb over her skin aye she retorted embarrassed and resentful theyre not quite as bad as a ditchdiggers these days he raised his eyes to hers watching her a moment without speaking i offended you that night im sorry his gentle tone tilted her balance and she felt the familiar weakness flowing into her it doesnt matter she stammered and shrugged and tugged at her hands again he ignored both verbal and physical protests you have fascinating hands ive made quite a study of them small exquisite and totally capablethe three rarely go together capable adelia he murmured before his eyes fastened on hers again with an intensity that caught her off guard you had a bad time on that farm didnt you ino no we got along got along he repeated and she felt his eyes searching her face for the words she was not saying we did what needed to be done she spoke lightly not sure what it was he wanted from her aunt lettie was a strong stubborn woman and not one to be beaten easily i often thought it strange how little she was like da she continued her expression drifting into introspection and now i see how little she was like uncle paddy for all she was their sister perhaps it was the demands of having to take on me and the farm that left her so little time for the gentler things such small things a kiss goodnight a word of affection a child can starve with a full plate she brought herself back with a shake of the head surprised by her own words and uneasy under his glance she groped for some way to turn the subject i only had the farm to concern me she had the farm and me and i think i was more trouble than the farm she smiled willing him to lighten his features with one of his own she told me a time or two i had too loose a grip on my temper but of course ive tightened the hold now have you at last the smile curved his mouth oh aye she gave him a solemn and guileless nod im a very mild sort of person the smile spread to a grin as their meal was set before them as they ate conversation drifted into generalities an easy flow of words as undemanding and soothing as the wine that accompanied the food come he said suddenly and rose dance with me before she could voice agreement or protest she found herself being led to the dance floor and enfolded in his all too familiar arms her first stiffness at the contact melted as she relaxed against him surrendering herself to his movements and the quiet music surely she decided allowing both mind and body to float everyones entitled to a taste of heaven tonight im taking mine tomorrow will come all too soon the night was magic as if a fairy had granted her a wish and the very briefness of it heightened her senses she tucked all the sights and sensations into a corner of her mind to be treasured and sighed over when day broke the spell it was late when they stepped into the warm night and though adelias eyes were heavy she wished the evening were just beginning clinging to the last enchanted minutes she made no objection when travis drew her close to his side in the cab tired dee he murmured his lips brushing the top of her head so lightly she was not sure she hadnt imagined it no she said on a sigh thinking how right her head felt cushioned against his shoulder he laughed softly his voice slow and warm and his fingers stroked through the silk of her hair until her mind drifted into the world of halfdreams dee she heard her name but loath to rouse herself from the heavenly comfort she made a small murmur of protest were back travis announced lifting her chin with his finger back her heavy lids opened and she stared at the face so close to hers dreams and reality mixed into confusion at the hotel he explained brushing tumbled hair back from her face oh she sat up realizing the dream was over he was silent on the elevator ride to their floor and adelia used the time to regain her grip on reality they moved to her door and travis removed her key from his pocket to unlock it as she raised her head to thank him the smile she meant to accompany her thanks faded as she met his eyes the concentrated steady look caused her to step backward only to find herself trapped against the doorframe while he closed the distance without seeming to move at all his hand slipped beneath the curtain of her hair while he caressed her neck in a slow lazy motion they gazed silently at each other then very slowly he lowered his head and pressed his mouth to hers in a kiss that was as soft as a summer breeze unlike the others he had given and ultimately more devastating she clung to the lapels of his jacket trying to steady her world but soon gave up all such efforts and moved her arms to encircle his neck rising on her toes to meet him demand for demand his lips moved to trail along her face brushing easily along cheeks and closed lids as if savoring the taste trembling heat was replaced by a new and poignant languor a weak giddiness induced by a far more potent potion than champagne her hands moved to tangle in his hair as her body melted to his submitting to whatever he would ask willing to give whatever he would take she felt his hunger when his mouth took hers again the hardness of his body as he pressed her more urgently against him and with a moan of pleasure at the new demand she drew him yet closer the longing to be possessed insistent and clamorous raged through her like fire she strained against him her heart throbbing and echoing in her ears as she felt him devour what was offered then demand more abruptly he released her mouth his hand moving to brush against her cheek and linger a moment and she closed her eyes again inviting his lips to claim hers goodnight dee he murmured and giving her a nudge into the room he closed the door between them adelia stared at the smooth empty panel bringing her hands to burning cheeks stunned both by her unprecedented actions and by the sudden rejection she found it impossible to move she had offered and he had refused even in her inexperience she knew her willingness could not have been mistaken for anything other than full surrender but he had not wanted her not completely her own standards had dissolved in his arms but he had walked away and left her alone and how else could it be she asked herself shutting eyes tight on threatening moisture i could never be anything to him but a groom for his horses someone who amuses him from time to time he was only being kind to me trying to show me a pleasant evening she trembled once i should be content with that and stop searching for what can never be mine glancing down at the soft folds of her dress adelia reminded herself she was not cinderella and in any case it was long past midnight they boarded the plane the next morning in a warm light drizzle again reporters hounded them adelia scurried up the ramp leaving the men to deal with them shaking raindrops from her hair and her creamcolored skirt she pressed her face to a window and watched travis disengage himself from the press during the flight she skimmed through a magazine reluctant to enter into conversation traviss attitude toward her that morning had been casual friendly and vaguely preoccupied and the stirring need in her that lingered from their previous evening made it a strain for her to mirror his mood when he disappeared into the forward cabin with steve she let out a deep breath and began to pace the lounge what am i to do she asked herself desperately how can i control the way he makes me feel ill be making a fool of myself over him hes bound to see the way i love him then hell be feeling sorry for me and i couldnt stand that ill just have to find a way to keep more distance between us her gaze wandered over to her uncle all thoughts of her problem fleeing her mind as she observed the unhealthy cast to his normally ruddy skin uncle paddy she moved to him cupping his face in her hands and studying him carefully youre not well what is it nothing dee the strain in his voice drew her brows together im just tired youre like ice she knelt down in front of him so that their faces were level you see a doctor the minute we get home it wont be long now ill fetch you a cover and a cup of tea now dee im just feeling my age he stopped and grimaced in pain what is it she demanded hands already searching to comfort where are you hurting just a twinge the words came out in jerks before he began to gasp for air uncle paddy merciful heaven uncle paddy she clutched at him as he collapsed falling forward out of the chair and into her arms she was not even aware that she shouted for travis over and over desperately helplessly as she lowered her uncle onto the floor but suddenly he was there brushing her hands aside his head lowering to the stocky chest tell john to radio ahead for an ambulance he called to steve over his shoulder his hands beginning to push in a steady rhythm on paddys chest hes had a heart attack with a moan adelia clutched paddys hand to her own heart as if to transfer her strength travis in the name of heaventravis is he dying oh please he cant be dying stop it he commanded sharply the words as effective as a slap pull yourself together i cant deal with this and hysterics as well one breath came and went quickly then she took several more deep and steady her hand clutching and unclutching convulsively over paddys slowly the hysteria was buried under a wall of control and she began to stroke her uncles head and speak in soft reassuring tones though she knew he probably couldnt hear her seconds dragged and minutes crawled with travis continually monitoring the unconscious mans pulse only adelias murmurs breaking the silence she felt the change in the planes speed and the loss of altitude heard the whine of the landing gear and felt the jerk of wheels on ground but her flow of words continued and she kept her uncles hand firmly in hers she watched through a haze of unreality as paramedics worked on him before transferring him to the waiting ambulance as she made to join them travis took her arm telling her they would follow in the car she went without protest her mind and heart encased in the numbing ice of fear she responded only in vague monosyllables to his attempts at consolation and after a glance at her pale waxen features he concentrated on weaving through the traffic toward the hospital the long wait began in a small cheerless lounge scattered with ancient magazines which some read to pass the time and others stared at in desperation adelia did neither but sat still as a stone her hands gripped together in her lap neither moving nor speaking as travis paced the room like a caged tiger her mind was screaming in protest searching for the power to pray as fear devoured her her control was tight stretching at the seams like an illfitting coat as the minutes passed when at last a whitecoated figure approached travis whirled and advanced on him youre padrick cunnanes family the doctor asked glancing from the tall powerful man to the small pale woman yes his answer was curt as he too glanced at adelia whats going on how is he he suffered a coronarynot a massive attack he is conscious now but his condition is aggravated by anxiety over someone named dee adelia brought her head up im dee is he going to die the doctor studied the pale composed features and took a step closer to her were doing all we can to stabilize his condition but his own anxiety is a factor in his recovery his concern is focused on you im going to let you see him you must do nothing to upset him persuade him to relax he turned back to the dark man whose eyes were fixed on the woman are you travis at his nod the doctor continued he wants to see you too come with me travis took adelias hand and lifted her from the chair leading her after the retreating white coat five minutes the doctor cautioned and led them into the cardiac care unit her hand tightened in traviss as she saw her uncle in the hospital bed wires and tubes joining him to machines that whirled and buzzed he was pale and drawn and suddenly old and her mind screamed in revolt as she struggled for control dee the voice was weak and unsteady and she moved close to take his hand in hers uncle paddy kissing the hand she held it to her cheek everythings going to be fine theyll be taking good care of you and soon youll be home again i want a priest dee all right dont worry a cold hand gripped and squeezed her heart and she felt the trembling start in her knees but forced it away its you im worried for you cant be left all alone again not again his voice was rasping and she soothed and murmured travis is travis here he continued to fret and she turned fear shining from her eyes right here paddy he moved to stand next to adelia youve got to take care of her for me travis im giving her to you shell be all alone again if anything happens to me such a wee thing she is and so young its been too hard for her i should have been there for her before i was going to make it up to her he made a feeble gesture with his free hand i want your word youll be taking care of her i can trust you travis with whats mine ill take care of her you have my word his answer was calm and steady his hand closing over the two that were joined you dont have to worry about dee im going to marry her the relaxation in the taut face was visible his breathing slowing you take care of my little dee then i want to see the two of you married will you bring a priest here and let me see it done ill arrange it but youll have to relax and rest let the doctors do their job dee and i will be married right here this afternoon all i need is a judge to sign a waiver of the twoday waiting period aye ill rest till you come back till you come back dee she forced her lips into a smile and placed a kiss on his brow before she followed the doctor and travis from the room she whirled on him as soon as the door closed behind them not here travis commanded gripping her arm is there somewhere private we can talk he asked the doctor in calm tones after directing them to an office the doctor closed the door and discreetly left them alone chapter adelia jerked out of traviss hold as the door shut fear and despair bubbling into fury how could you do that how could you tell uncle paddy you were going to marry me how could you lie to him that way i didnt lie adelia travis returned evenly i have every intention of marrying you what are you thinking of saying such things she continued as if he had not spoken its cruel with him lying there sick and helpless and trusting you you had no right to make such a promise youll break his heart you get hold of yourself travis commanded taking her shoulders and administering a brisk shake i told him what he needed to hear and by god youll do what he wants if it helps save him ill not be a party to such a cruel lie the grip on her shoulders increased but she was beyond physical pain doesnt he mean anything to you are you so selfish and hardheaded that you cant make a small sacrifice to help him she flinched as if he had struck her and turned blindly away her hands gripping the back of a chair well stand in that room this afternoon and well be married and youll make him believe its what you want when we know hes strong enough you can get a divorce and end it she drew her hands over her eyes pain washing over her in turbulent waves uncle paddy lying there half deadtravis telling me were marrying and divorcing in the same breath oh i need someone to tell me what to do she thought frantically to be his wife to belong to himshed wanted it so badly that she hadnt even dared to think of it and now he was telling her that it was going to happen that it had to happen she was hurt beyond words it would have been easier to go through life without him than to be his wife for an hour without his love divorcehe had said it so easily he was talking of divorce before he had even put the ring on her finger taking a deep breath she tried to force herself to think clearly but she was too overcome by the bleak realization that he was not talking of a real marriage a marriage of love that he didnt want her for herself but rather for her uncles sake there must be another way there had to be another way she swallowed painfully to steady her voice im catholic i cant get a divorce she said dully an annulment then she stared at him in horrified silence an annulment yes an annulment it should not be any problem if the marriage isnt consummated it will simply be a matter of a little paperwork he spoke in calm businesslike tones and her hands tightened on the chair as she attempted to fight her way through to reason for petes sake dee he said impatiently cant you go through the motions of a ceremony for paddys sake it wont cost you anything it could make the difference between his living and dying he took her shoulders again spinning her around checking his anger as he studied the transparent glow to her skin the fear in her eyes that stared back at him he could feel the trembling begin under his hands and watched as she shut her eyes and tried to stem it he muttered an oath then drew her against him and wrapped his arms around her im sorry dee shouting at you is hardly going to make it any easier is it come on sit down leading her to a sofa he sat beside her keeping her close inside his arms youve been hanging on to control for too long have a good cry then well talk no i dont cry i never cry it doesnt help she held herself rigid in his grasp but he continued to hold her close please let me go she felt her control slipping and struggled against the arms that would not give way i have to think if i just knew what to do her breath came in short gasps the trembling no longer controllable and her hands clutched at his shirtfront to keep from falling travis im so afraid she burst into violent sobs and his arms tightened around her once the tears escaped she could not stop them held in check for more than a dozen lonely years they now flowed freely down her face pressed into traviss chest he kept silent one hand stroking her hair and let the storm run its course the sobs lost their force subsiding to soft whimpering until she lay quiet in his arms empty and spent she gave one long shuddering sigh ill do whatever you think has to be done how travis arranged the paperwork so quickly she never questioned she had been too numb to deal with technicalities the only stand she had made was to refuse to leave the hospital even for a quick rest or a meal determinedly she had planted herself in the waiting room and refused to budge she signed her name on the license where she was told greeted the slender young priest who would make her traviss wife and accepted a handful of flowers from a friendly nurse who claimed a woman couldnt be a bride without a bouquet she smiled at this a small frozen smile that hurt her cheeks knowing she was not really a bride legally she would bear the name of the man she loved but the vows they would exchange would mean nothing to him the words and motions were only a charade to bring comfort to a sick man they stood side by side in the stark room surrounded by machines the air heavy with the smell of medicine and became husband and wife adelia repeated the priests words in a calm clear voice and looked blankly at the signet ring travis slipped on her finger before closing her fist over it it hung loose on her finger and lay like a stone on her heart in less than ten minutes it was all over and she accepted his light brief kiss without demur adelia cunnane grant bent over and kissed her uncles brow he smiled up at her his eyes lighting with a suggestion of their usual merriment she knew in that instant that travis had been right little dee he murmured seeking her hand and clinging to it youll be happy now travis is a good man she forced a smile and patted his cheek aye uncle paddy youll rest now and well be able to bring you home soon ill rest he agreed and his eyes raised above her head to meet traviss treat her with care lad shes a thoroughbred they drove home in silence the sun broke through patches of clouds to filter on the road adelia watched the play of light and kept her mind a blank pulling up in front of the main house travis broke the heavy silence i called ahead and informed my housekeeper of the wedding shell have prepared your room by now your things have been brought over she frowned im not for the time being he cut in his eyes narrowing you are my wife and as such you will live in my house well keep separate bedrooms he added in a tone that caused her mouth to shut quickly we will however maintain the outward appearance of a married couple there is no reason for the present that anyone other than you and i know of this arrangement explanations now would only complicate matters i see youre right of course he sighed at the strain in her voice and went on in gentler tones ill make it as easy on you as possible dee i only ask that you play your part otherwise youll be free to do as you please therell be no need for you to work i cant work with the horses adelia broke in eyes widening in dismay but travis adelia listen to me he cupped her face in his hand you can do as you like you dont even know what that means do you his brows drew together at her blank bewildered face if you want to work with the horses youre free to do so but not as my employee as my wife you can spend your time lounging around the country club or cleaning out stallsits up to you all right slowly she unclenched the fists that were tight in her lap ill do my best to make it easy on you as well i know you were right to do this for uncle paddy and im grateful to you he stared at her for another moment then shrugged and slipped from the car when they entered the house a plump grayhaired woman bustled into the hall to greet them wiping her hands on a full white apron hannah this is adelia my wife warm hazel eyes inspected adelia and smiled in approval welcome mrs grant its about time a lovely young thing lured my travis to the altar adelia murmured something she hoped was appropriate im sorry to hear about paddy were all fond of him the treacherous tears started again and adelia closed her eyes against them oh the poor things dead on her feet travis take her up the rooms ready for her she started the climb up the staircase which seemed to take on the proportions of mount olympus without a word travis swept her into his arms and carried her up the remaining steps and down a long carpeted hallway entering a bedroom he crossed the floor and laid her on a huge fourposter bed im sorry she lifted her hand and dropped it again there seemed to be nothing further to say he sat next to her and brushed the hair from her cheeks adelia when will you learn weakness is not always a flaw darned irish stubbornness he muttered frowning down at her id swear nothing else kept you on your feet this long there hasnt been a whisper of color in your cheeks for the past six hours she stared up at him wanting to pull him down to her and feel the comfort of his warmth he turned abruptly and moved to a large cherrywood wardrobe i dont know where hannah put your night clothes pulling open the double doors he exposed the meager contents good heavens is this all you have she tried to snap at him but found gathering the strength too great an effort moving over to a mirrored triple dresser he began opening drawers muttering and swearing and she lay back and watched him too weary to be embarrassed that he should handle her clothes with such familiarity he pulled out a plain highnecked cotton gown and after a brief disparaging scrutiny brought it to her tomorrow for heavens sake go shopping and buy some clothes dont you order me about travis grant she sat up unable to keep quiet any longer and snapped at him with a ghost of her usual spirit he stared down at her without expression while were married adelia well be expected to socialize and youll have to dress properly well see to it tomorrow now can you manage to change by yourself or do you need some help snatching the gown from his hands she spoke stiffly i can manage very well good change and get some rest you wont do paddy any good if you make yourself ill without waiting for her reply he turned and strode from the room shutting the door behind him too tired to appreciate the beauty of the light airy room she slipped off the skirt and blouse which had served as her wedding dress and pulled the cotton nightgown over her head folding down the mintgreen spread she crawled between the smooth sheets and fell instantly into the deep dreamless sleep of exhaustion the birds woke her as was their habit chattering and chirping outside the window opening her eyes she focused on the unfamiliar surroundings and remembered she relaxed the fist that had remained tight over her wedding ring throughout the night while her eyes made a slow survey of the room she had thought her bedroom in the garage house large but she estimated this would hold two rooms that size the walls were muted green and white striped paper trimmed with dark woodwork the furniture was cherry both the large wardrobe and dresser in which travis had rummaged the evening before and a small writing desk two night tables and a small piecrust table which served a tuftedback chair on the small table was a vase bursting with fresh flowers their scent drifted to her as she sat up in bed hugging her knees close she sighed as she gazed at the tall french windows which led to the balcony thinking she had never seen such a lovely room how happy i could be here if only uncle paddy was well and travis she tried to clear her mind of such negative thoughts thrusting back the covers she jumped out of bed after showering and dressing in her only remaining skirt she ventured downstairs hoping she could locate the kitchen in the strange house which was now her home good morning dee travis appeared from a room off the downstairs hall which she later learned was his office feeling better aye she answered suddenly shy and uncertain in front of the man who was her husband i dont know when ive slept so long you were exhausted she kept herself still as he lifted her chin and examined her face like a parent seeking to find signs of ill health in a child your colors back he said at length and smiled im fine she managed to remain passive as his hand continued to hold her chin i was wondering if i could call the hospital and see if uncle paddy her hands fluttered then clung together in front of her ive already called his condition has stabilized his hands moved to rest on her shoulders he spent a peaceful night a tremor passed through her she shut her eyes and buried her face against traviss chest after a moment she felt his arms encircle her lightly oh travis i thought he was going to die i was afraid we would lose him he held her away until she tilted her head to look up at him hes going to be all right with a little time and care and no worries his features relaxed of course when he gets home hell have to slow down well have to bully him into it aye her smile was like the stars through the clouds but theres two of us so there are he murmured then tousled her hair i imagine youre starving i couldnt wake you for dinner last night i feel like i havent eaten in a week with a sigh she pushed at the hair he had just ruffled if youll show me the kitchen ill start breakfast hannahs seeing to it he informed her taking her arm and leading her into a large dining room noticing the expression on her face he whispered confidentially in her ear as he pulled out a chair dont worry ive been eating her cooking all my life oh i didnt meani meant no disrespect its only that im not used to having someone fix my meals her expression bordered on horror and he leaned back in his chair and laughed dont look so stricken dee hannah will think im beating you already well i wouldnt want you to think that i meant she fumbled for something to say which would release her from her awkwardness the room you gave me is lovely i want to thank you im glad you like it at his careless response she was grateful for hannahs entrance with a steaming breakfast platter good morning mrs grant i hope youre feeling better after a good nights rest she set the platter on the table and adelia smiled up at her thank you i feel fine she was careful not to start at her new title hungry though ill be bound nodding she studied the pixielike face travis told me you ate next to nothing yesterday so ill expect you to do full justice to your breakfast you should be warned dee not to trifle with hannah travis put in from across the table she can be ferocious personally she terrifies me dont you listen to his nonsense mrs grant she sent travis a scowl before giving her attention back to adelia youll be busy for a while with paddy in the hospital but once youre settled you let me know how you want things done for now if its agreeable ill just plan your meals around your visits to the hospital iwhatever you think best well have plenty of time to talk about it the housekeeper concluded now you get to your breakfast while its hot with this she bustled from the room adelia listened to traviss breakfast conversation answering only when it was required while she slowly took in her surroundings the dining room was large with dark wainscoting and elegantly patterned wallpaper the furniture was heavy gleaming oak everywhere was the glow of silver and glimmer of crystal travis she said suddenly and his brows rose in acknowledgment as he sipped his coffee i dont fit into all this i havent the way or the experience to know whats expected of me i dont want to be an embarrassment to you and im mortally afraid ill do or say something horrible and adelia the one word stopped her rambling she saw from his expression that she had already made a mistake from the way his face was set she waited for him to rant at her but when he spoke his voice was calm and precise you will not embarrass me you could not embarrass me relax and be what you are thats whats expected of you they lapsed into silence adelia toyed with the remainder of her eggs by the way travis began and she raised her eyes and saw he was smiling youve had your picture in the paper my picture yes his smile widened at her frowning expression two pictures as a matter of fact theres one of you and steve with the two of you sitting on the paddock fence and theres one of you and me taken after the belmont stakes i cant imagine travis returned his lips curving again it appears that the press has had a splendid time speculating about the romances of my attractive groom her eyes widened and the color ebbed and flowed again are you meaning oh what a passel of nonsense steve and i are friends and you and i she faltered sputtered and fell into excruciating silence married adelia is what we are friends or not with what she thought was a very odd smile he drained his coffee and rose i dont suppose it will sound like such a passel of nonsense to the press when our current relationship is leaked to them i can keep it out of the papers for a while but well have to deal with it sooner or later i take it youre done since youve been playing with your fork for the last ten minutes securing her arm he brought her to her feet now if youll take that frown off your face ill drive you to the hospital any anxiety adelia still harbored was dispelled by the appearance of her uncle the color in his cheeks which had appeared a ghastly gray the day before was now closer to his normal ruddy hue his eyes twinkled as travis brought her into the room his voice was weak rather than booming but steady and unforced when he complained about being hooked up to blasted noisy machines her concern melted into laughter and kissing the hand she held in hers she felt the last vestige of tension dissolve after a short visit travis drew her into the hall you wont be able to stay too long this time the doctor says he tires easily and needs his rest that and seeing you is the best medicine he can get i wont tire him travis she promised hes looking so much better i can hardly believe my eyes ill only stay a little while more as soon as i see hes tiring ill go he looked down at her smiling face his fingers tangling absently with the ends of her hair i have to get back now but trish will be along soon to take you shopping his hand dropped and he stared past her as if suddenly preoccupied shell know best what you need and if you like she can bring you back here for a while longer this afternoon its kind of you to be doing all this travis she touched his arm to bring his attention back to her i dont know how to repay you for all that youve done already its nothing he shrugged off her thanks and drawing out his wallet handed her some bills ive made arrangements for you to charge whatever you need trish will be there to see to the details but youll need some cash as well but travis its so much i cant dont argue just take it he closed her hands over the bills in a final impatient gesture give it to trish to hold for you and for heavens sake dee he added with exasperation buy yourself a purse ill see you this evening he strode down the long corridor leaving adelia staring after him chapter when trish arrived she greeted paddy with an affectionate kiss and told him firmly that anyone could see he was faking and enjoying being the center of attention after a brief visit she hurried adelia out into the corridor and hugged her with enthusiasm im so happy about you and travis her eyes shone with affection adelia began to feel the first weight of guilt now i have the little sister i always wanted adelia was treated to yet another hug jerry sends his best she referred to her husband her face wreathed in smiles the twins went wild when i told them that dee was now their aunt they claim that makes them irish and soon theyll be fey too adelia responded with smiles and agreeable murmurs hating herself for the deception and wishing with all her heart that she could confide in the woman whom she felt was a true friend but she had given travis her word and she would keep it hooking her arm through adelias trish began to stroll toward the elevator travis has given me firm instructions to see that you buy a complete wardrobe she grinned with obvious pleasure as the elevator began its slow descent to the ground floor of course i told him that i would be more than happy to follow orders and spend his money with abandon he said you should hold this for me dee handed trish the wad of bills which she accepted and placed absently in her tan leather bag this is going to be fun adelia smiled faintly if adelia was under the impression that this shopping expedition would follow along the lines of her first she was soon enlightened to the contrary trish ignored department stores for the more exclusive shops adelia began to feel as if she were caught in the backlash of a tropical storm she was whirled through shops while trish made selections dismissed or accepted articles with a nod or murmur to the sales clerks purchases mounted into an alarming mountain leaving adelia dizzy and confused evening dresses that shimmered and flowed sportswear adelia considered suitable for royalty soft cobwebby lingerie that seemed too fragile to be real all were tried on inspected thoroughly by trishs critical eye then approved or rejected italian shoes and handbags french scarves and negligees were included with a nod for foreign craftsmanship trish surely travis didnt mean for me to buy all this adelia objected looking uneasily at the stacks of boxes and bags one person couldnt live long enough to wear all those clothes youd be surprised trish murmured absently as she surveyed a long sweeping evening gown in brilliant green silk youll be doing a lot of traveling and there are parties and official functions her voice trailed off as she held the gown in front of adelia and narrowed her eyes in consideration travis was very specific he told me to see to it that you have everything necessary and to ignore the arguments you were sure to give me that is precisely what im doing here she thrust the gown into adelias hands go try this on green is your color we cant buy anything else adelia stated flatly attempting to hold her ground therell be no room in the car for us when the packages are put in then little sister well hire a van giving her a shove into the dressing room trish gave her attention to a white linen blouse late that afternoon adelia stared at the packages that lay piled high on her bed with a weary sigh she turned and left the room hannah greeted her as she stood in the downstairs hall unsure whether she should stay in the house or seek out travis at the stables mrs grant hows paddy hes looking just wonderful i left him only an hour ago you poor thing you look all in ive been shopping i think cleaning out the entire stable would be less of a chore hannah chuckled a cup of tea is what you need just sit down and ill bring you one hannah she stopped the plump woman before she could bustle away could i would you mind if i came into the kitchen and had one with you she made a small helpless gesture with her hands im not used to being waited on the round face brightened and a motherly arm slipped around adelias waist just you come with me missy well have a nice cup of tea and a little chat it was there travis found them together an hour later he stood in the doorway watching in amused amazement as adelia and hannah worked on dinner preparations chattering like lifelong partners well well well a miracle in this day and age two heads turned toward him as he gave his brief charming grin i never thought id live to see the day when youd let anyone work in your kitchen hannah he glanced from his housekeeper to the small woman at her side what kind of irish charm did you use on her dee just her charming self you young rascal hannah stated with great dignity now missyshe removed the vegetable parer from adelias handyou just run along now and keep that man out from under my feet hes always been a nuisance in the kitchen travis grinned again serenely unperturbed come out on the terrace dee he invited and captured her hand its too nice to stay indoors he led her out through wide french doors and onto the smooth stone surface of the terrace the sweet scent of plants and flowers filled the june evening the sun still cast a warm golden light scattering shadows on the stone so dee he began seating her in a striped cushioned chair and dropping down in an identical one across from her did you get everything you needed everything she repeated she closed her eyes and shuddered never in my life have i ever seen so many clothes much less put them on trying on this taking off that opening her eyes again she met his wide smile with a look of disdain you wont be smiling when you have to build another room to hold them all your sister is a stubborn woman travis grant she just kept tossing things at me and shoving me into dressing rooms i couldnt make her listen to reason i thought trish might be helpful helpful she gave a longsuffering sigh i felt like i was being blown about by a whirlwind packages growing like a great mountain and trish smiling and finding something else she had a fine time she added mystified yes i imagine she did i dont see her having much trouble filling out your wardrobe he smiled at the picture and leaned back in his chair travis she began after a small pause whatever will i do with all those things you might try wearing them he suggested its the usual procedure thats fine for a time i understand i cant go about in my old clothes with things as they are now but after when she stumbled and searched for the right words when things are back as they were before i the clothes are yours adelia he interrupted with a quick gesture of his hand youll keep them whatever happens i certainly have no use for them rising he paced the length of the terrace and stared out over the smooth expanse of lawn adelia sat silently concerned by his anger and bewildered over how she had caused it she stood and approached him laying a tentative hand on his arm im sorry travis that sounded ungrateful i didnt mean it to everythings happening so fast i dont want to take advantage of what youre doing for me one can hardly call it taking advantage when its like pulling teeth to get you to accept anything his shoulders moved and he turned to face her adelia he said with a sigh somewhere between impatience and amusement you are so artless she did not question the ambiguity of his words so relieved was she that his anger had faded and he was smiling at her again i have something for you reaching into his pocket he drew out a small box my signet ring was fine in an emergency but it looks big enough to fit on your wrist oh she found nothing else to say as she opened the box and found a small band studded with winking diamonds and glowing emeralds he removed the large masculine ring from her finger and replaced it with the jeweled wedding band id say that suits a bit better it fits she murmured inadequately overcome with the longing to throw her arms around him and cry out her love ive studied those hands enough to make an educated guess as to your ring size he spoke lightly and dropping her hand moved back to his chair swallowing the obstruction in her throat she followed him travis she stood in front of his chair feeling the strangeness of looking down at him travis youre doing all the giving and i have nothing for you i want to is there nothing i can do for you is there nothing you want from me he met her eyes with a long unfathomable stare until she thought he would not speak at all for now dee he said at length the best thing you can do for me is to accept whats given and not question it she sighed at his answer all right travis if it pleasures you he stood and took her hand a finger running over her wedding band yes it pleasures me come inside and well eat and ill tell you how majesty sulked for you today the next two weeks passed quickly adelias days full between the hospital and the stables paddy was moved into a regular hospital room no longer attached to machines he improved daily complaining vigorously about being stuck in bed and poked with needles the easy friendliness of the men at the stables and the soothing routine of riding and grooming brought a sense of normalcy back to adelias life and at times she almost forgot she was mrs travis grant travis was kind and casually affectionate speaking of paddys recovery and on the general topic of horses when they took meals together he left adelia free to pursue whatever project she chose making no demands his attitude tolerant generous and distant she was aware of a subtle change in their relationship and she found it did not please her he never raised his voice or criticized and he never touched her in any way unless strictly necessary she wished fervently that he would yell at her or shake her or do something to lose his cool composed manner their relationship was now far less personal than it had been when they had been employer and employee she was returning to the house one afternoon wondering if travis had returned from a business appointment when she stopped and gaped at a large dirty gray mound of fur exploring a bed of marigolds after a careful study she concluded that under the grubby fur was a dog of rather alarming size i wouldnt do that if i were you she said in a quiet voice that had the dogs head jerking up now dont be running off i wont hurt you the dog hesitated eyeing her warily and she kept the distance between them and continued to speak its just that ive seen traviss gardenera terrifying man he is and one that wouldnt take kindly to anyone digging at his flowers she crouched down and they studied each other eye to eye are you lost then or just roaming i can see by your eyes youre hungry ive been hungry myself a time or two wait here she ordered and stood ill fetch you something entering the kitchen she commandeered a large hunk of roast beef the whine of the vacuum cleaner was audible from the living room and deciding it would be foolish to disturb hannah and vowing to apologize to her after the deed was done adelia slipped back outside its prime beef my lad and from the looks of you youve not seen its kind before she placed the offering on the grass and stepped back a few paces he came forward slowly at first eyes shifting from the beef to his benefactor until either his confidence or his hunger grew and he threw himself on the unexpected meal she watched him polish off what would have fed three hungry men finding enormous pleasure in his appetite well now youve made a pig of yourself and thats the truth and you dont look a bit ashamed she grinned and watched the long tail thump in agreement pleased with yourself are you before she could move she found herself flat on her back trapped under a hundred pounds of appreciation her face being drenched by a large wet tongue get off me you great hairy brute laughing she pushed to no avail and tried to turn her face from the moisture surely theres not a rib thats not cracked and its gods truth youve not had a bath since the day you were born after much pleading and wriggling she managed to release herself staggered to her feet and surveyed the damage her shirt and jeans were covered with dirt her arms smeared with it she pushed at her disordered hair and stared down at the dog that sat at her feet his tongue hanging out in adoration well both be needing a bath now well she let out a deep breath tilted her head and considered you wait here and ill see what can be done about you it might be best if you were cleaned up a bit before i introduce you on the way back to the house she paused on the terrace to brush at the dirt that covered her dee what happened were you thrown are you hurt travis rushed to her his hands claiming her shoulders then moving to stroke her face she shook her head thrown off balance by the frantic tone of his voice no im not hurt travis you mustnt touch meyoull get your suit filthy she tried to take a step away only to be caught closer the devil with the suit his voice was edged with anger as he pressed her against him one hand cradling her head the small intimacy after so many days of impersonal distance swamped her with pleasure and her arms encircled his waist before she could lecture herself on the wisdom of the action she felt his lips tarry in her hair and she thought with a brief flash of joy that if she could only have this much of him from time to time she would be content suddenly one hand gripped her shoulder while the other tilted her face back and she saw temper flame in his face what in heavens name have you done to yourself i havent done anything to myself she said with a show of dignity shaking off his hand weve company she gestured to the lawn his eyes moved past her narrowed then returned adelia what in the name of heaven is that its a dog travis though i wasnt sure myself at first the poor thing was half starving thats whyshe paused and braced herself for the confessionthats why i gave him the roast beef you fed him travis asked in low even tones surely you wouldnt begrudge the poor thing a bit of food i i dont care a whit about the food adelia he shook her briefly dont you have any more sense than to fool with a strange dog you could have been bitten straightening she glared at the censure in his voice i know what im about and i was careful he needed food so i gave it to himthe same as id give it to anyone who needed it and as for that he hasnt a thought in his head about biting anyone glancing over she watched the dogs tail begin to thump the ground again thereshe pointed triumphantlyyou see i see it appears youve made another conquest now he said and turned her firmly to face him directly just how did you get in this condition oh well she looked up at travis back to the dog and back to travis again you see after hed finished eating he was overcome with gratitude and hewell he forgot himself for a minute and knocked me down and sort of thanked me in his way hes a bit dirtyas you can see he knocked you down travis repeated incredulously at his tone adelia hurried on hes very affectionate and he didnt mean any harm really travis dont be angry with him see how pretty he is sitting there now she glanced over at the dog and saw he was smart enough to blink soulful eyes in traviss direction i told him to wait and thats just what hes doing he only wants a bit of affection travis turned back and gave adelia a long look im getting the impression you intend to keep him well i dont know about keeping him exactly she dropped her eyes from him stared at a spot of dirt on traviss jacket and brushed it away whats his name finnegan she responded immediately then seeing she had fallen into the trap looked up frowning finnegan travis repeated with a sober nod how did you come by that he reminds me of father finnegan back in skibbereen oversized and clumsy but with much inner dignity i see he moved over crouched down and inspected finnegan to adelias relief the dog remembered his manners when travis returned to her she moistened her lips and launched into her campaign ill take care of him travis he wont be any trouble i wont let him come in the house and get in hannahs way theres no need to use your eyes adelia at her bewildered frown he laughed and tugged her hair lord help the world if you ever realize what youre doing youre perfectly free to keep him if thats what you want oh i do thank you travis there are however two conditions he interrupted before she could finish being grateful one that you teach him not to knock you down hes every bit as big as you are and two that he has a bath he glanced over at finnegan and shook his head or several baths i think im due for one myself she brushed again without success at the clinging dirt then lifted her face with a smile the smile wavered as she found travis looking down at her strangely you know dee im tempted to stuff you in my pocket where i wont have to worry about you im small she agreed finding it suddenly difficult to breathe but i think im rather too big for that your size is intimidating she frowned wondering what he could find intimidating about a bare five feet two his hand wandered through her hair gently for a moment then tousling it with casual friendliness he added i believe it would be easier if you didnt continually look fifteen instead of twentythree i guess i had better change my clothes before i give you a hand bathing that mountain as her marriage approached its third week adelia sat in her uncles hospital room smiling at him as he spoke with excitement of his discharge scheduled for the following day anyone would think theyd been torturing you and starving you to death uncle paddy oh no its a fine place with good and kind people he protested but a hospitals for the sick and never have i felt better in my life you are better and it makes me happier than i can say butshe paused and gave him a stern lookyouve still got to rest for a while and do as the doctors tell you youre coming home to stay with travis and me for a few days till you can get by on your own now dee i cant do that paddy objected patting her hand you two should be off on your honeymoon not worrying about the likes of me with a great deal of selfcontrol she managed not to wince at the word honeymoon and went on in calm but firm tones youll be coming back with us and thats the end of it i didnt even have to asktravis suggested it himself lying back against the pillows paddy smiled aye he would travis is a fine man that he is adelia agreed with a sigh she forced a bright smile and continued hes fond of you uncle paddy i knew as soon as i saw the two of you together aye he murmured travis and i go back a long way just a lad he was when i came to work for his father poor motherless child so solemn and straight he was adelias mind wandered as she tried to picture travis as a small boy wondering if he was tall even then stuart grant was a hard man paddy went on he ran the lad harder than the horses he raised trish he left to hannah barely showing the girl a passing interest but the boy he wanted molded in his image always giving orders with never a kind word or a dab of affection i found myself taking the lad in telling him stories and making games out of the work we did he grinned lost in memory paddys shadow the hands called him cause he took to following me about whenever his father wasnt there he worked hard and he knew the horses even then a fine good lad he was but the old man couldnt see it always finding fault i wondered sometimes when he grew older why he didnt lay the old man out goodness knows he was big enough and the temper was there but he took the abuse the old man handed him and only looked at him with his eyes so cold paddy paused and let out a long breath travis was away at college when the old man passed on that would be about ten years ago he stood there looking down at the grave and i went over and laid my hand on his shoulder im sorry about your father lad says i and he turned and looked down at me he was never my father paddy says he just as calm as you please youve been my father since i was ten years old if you hadnt been there id have left a long time ago and never looked back the room was suddenly silent adelia gripped the hand that lay in hers tighter as paddys eyes grew moist with memory and now the two of you are together i couldnt have wished it any better youll stay with him uncle paddy always no matter what youll promise me that he turned to her surprised by the urgency in her tone of course little dee where else would i be going chapter the following evening after paddy was comfortably settled into his room in the main house travis announced plans for a party its expected after majestys win but with paddys heart attack its had to be postponed he swirled a glass of afterdinner brandy his eyes sweeping over her resting for a moment on her hair shimmering on the shoulders of her nile blue dress our marriage has of course leaked to the press and it will seem odd if we dont have some sort of gathering where you can meet some of my friends and business associates aye adelia agreed unconsciously nibbling on her lip as she turned to gaze out the window and so they can get a look at me that too he answered in solemn tones dont worry dee as long as you dont trip over your feet and fall on your face you should get by fairly well she whirled around to rage at him that she wasnt exactly a clumsy fool but his goodnatured grin stopped her thank you very much master grant she smiled back at him its a great comfort you are to me she gasped out loud at the length of the list travis gave her for the projected reception there couldnt be less than a hundred she estimated staring at the paper youve nothing to worry about he assured her hannah will handle the details youre only expected to make polite conversation the attempt at reassurance hurt her pride ill have you know im not a complete cabbagehead travis grant im well capable of helping hannah and i wont be making a fool of myself in front of your fancy friends youre the one who said she was afraid of making a fool of herself not me travis reminded her reasonably its not what i said that matters she concluded with her own brand of logic its what im saying tossing her head she turned and stalked into the kitchen despite her proud claims adelia found herself terrified on the evening of the party there had been no time for nervousness in the days before she had been too busy with plans and preparations but now alone in her room with only the prospect of dressing ahead of her she began to feel the first flutter of anxiety she chose the green silk gown that trish had insisted she buy and slipped it carefully over her head its classic lines accentuated her softly rounded figure its deeply scooped neckline revealed a teasing hint of her firm breasts the silk glowed against the creamy health of her skin she arranged her hair on top of her head trying for a more sophisticated style but gave up in disgust and allowed it to fall loose and full to her shoulders a fiery auburn waterfall voices were audible in the living room as she descended the stairs she took several deep breaths before joining travis and paddy travis broke off what he had been saying as she entered the room he rose from his chair she sought his eyes for approval but found them strangely veiled and unreadable she wished that she had chosen one of the other gowns that now hung in the large cherry wardrobe ah now isnt that a beautiful sight lad paddy said surveying adelia with uninhibited pride why there wont be another woman here tonight will hold a candle to my little dee its a lucky man you are travis uncle paddy she smiled and moved to kiss his cheek what wonderful blarney but dont stopi need it i have to be honest and say im scared witless theres no need for that dee taking her hand travis turned her toward him youll have them eating out of your hand you look incredible he smiled at her his free hand brushing through her hair briefly before he turned away to replenish his drink love me travis her mind shouted suddenly id give the world and more if youd only love me half as much as i love you as he turned back his eyes captured hers he paused unreadable emotion flickering over his face dee he began his voice questioning but before she could speak the doorbell pealed and their guests began to arrive it was infinitely easier than adelia had imagined after the first wave of guests she felt her tension dissolve and met the few speculative glances with characteristic boldness the house was soon filled with people and chatter and laughter and the chink of glasses it was apparent that travis was well liked and respected by his associates and his choice of bride met with acceptance and approval if not immediately then shortly after exposure to adelias natural honest charm one sleekly coiffured woman who had cornered adelia halted travis as he passed travis your wife is refreshing and charming and more than likely too good for you she smiled with the privilege of old friendship i believe it would be a treat just to listen to her read the telephone directory such a marvelous accent careful carla travis admonished slipping an arm around adelias shoulder in the casual way she had missed in the past few weeks dee claims were the ones with the accentand for all her sweet looks her temper is not to be trifled with travis darling the trio turned and adelia caught a glimpse of swirling white as the owner of the voice embraced her husband i just got back in town darling and heard about your little party i hope you dont mind of course not margot its always a pleasure to see you he turned and adelia noted that he didnt dislodge the redtipped hand from his arm margot wintersmy wife adelia margot turned and adelia nearly gasped aloud she was staring right at the most beautiful woman she had ever seen tall and slender she was elegantly draped in a cool white sheath ashgold hair curled softly around an oval face her skin was the color of rich cream longlashed gray eyes as clear and cool as a mountain lake looked over and beyond adelia why travis shes adorable the gray eyes focused now on adelia making her feel small and inadequate but shes little more than a child barely out of the schoolroom the sweet tone was patently patronizing im allowed up with the grownups now and again adelia said evenly her chin tilting to meet margots gaze i hung up my book strap some time back my margot observed over carlas chuckle youre irish arent you aye the quicksilver temper began its swift rise as paddys pig tell me mistress winters what are you dee trish spoke from behind laying a hand on adelias arm will you come out here for a minute i need you to help me adelia was pulled out on the terrace and after she had shut the doors trish dissolved into a fit of laughter oh dee she managed between giggles how i would have loved to have left you there and watched you lay into her i just didnt think it was quite the right time oh she wiped at her eyes did you see carla i thought she was going to explode she kept choking on her drink and trying to keep a straight face i wouldnt have missed that for the world how travis could ever have been involved with that woman is beyond me shes a coldblooded snob travis and margo winters adelia asked attempting to keep her voice casual oh yes i thought you knew trish gave a deep sigh wiped her eyes again and grimaced i dont really think he was ever serious about heri give him more credit than that she would have given one of her tiffany baubles to have him look at her the way he looks at you trish smiled and adelia made a valiant effort to respond they had this big blowup a few months ago it seems she resented all the time he spent with the horses she gave a snort of disgust and straightened her skirts she wanted him to sit back and let others do all the work while he spent his time entertaining her she gave him some kind of ultimatum and took off for europe in a cloud of expensive french perfume trish laughed in pure delight her little ploy failed miserably and now her nose is out of joint instead of pining for her travis is happily married to you she linked her arm with her sisterinlaws aye adelia murmured now hes married to me her tone was melancholy and trish glanced at her sharply but dee refused to meet her eyes paddy moved back to his own house a few days later and adelia missed his presence keenly he found finnegan a congenial companion and the dog divided his time between them he would accompany paddy as he grumbled inside for his afternoon rest and adelia was never quite sure whether finnegans motives were duty or laziness travis made no mention of margot winters or adelias comments to her and she found their relationship drifting away again until she felt more like his ward than his wife when they attended social functions he treated her with the warm attentiveness expected of a newly married husband but once they were alone again in their own home he was distant showing her only the casual affection he might give to a favored cousin the depression and frustration this caused in her adelia hid with apparent success responding as she believed he desired and maintaining the same casualness he directed toward her rarely did her temper flare and she was aware his was under strict control at times she imagined they were only polite puppets pulled on invisible strings desperately she wondered how long they could go on one afternoon as july brought summers throbbing heat to the air adelia answered the summons of the bell and found herself confronted with the elegantly clad form of margot winters her finely penciled brows lifted at adelias attire of jeans and shirt she glided over the threshold without invitation good afternoon to you mistress winters adelia greeted her determined to act the part of hostess please come in and sit down travis is down at the stables but ill be glad to send for him thats not necessary adelia margot strolled into the living room and seated herself in a wingbacked chair as if she belonged there i came to have a little chat with you hannahshe glanced over at the housekeeper who had entered behind adeliaill have some tea hannah looked pointedly at adelia who merely nodded and moved to join her uninvited guest i shall come straight to the point margot began sitting back and linking her fingers together in an imperious gesture im sure youre aware that travis and i were about to be married before we had a slight disagreement a few months ago is that the truth of it adelia asked with apparently idle interest yes it was common knowledge margot stated with a regal wave of her hand i thought to teach travis a lesson by going to europe and giving him time to think things through hes a very stubborn man she gave adelia a small knowing smile when i saw the picture of him in the paper kissing this little ragamuffin i thought nothing of it the press will blow these things out of proportion but when i heard hed actually married some little stablehandshe shivered delicatelyi knew it was time to come back and set things straight and may the stablehand ask how you mean to do that when this little interlude is finished travis and i can proceed as planned and by interlude i suppose youre meaning my marriage adelia inquired her voice lowering to an ominous level well of course slender shoulders moved at the inevitable just look at you its obvious travis only married you to bring me back you cant possibly hope to hold him for very long you havent the breeding or style thats necessary to move in society straightening her spine adelia hid her pain with dignity im telling you this as a fact mistress winters you had nothing to do with the reason that travis and i were married its true i havent your elegance or manner of speaking but theres one thing i have youre lacking ive traviss ring on my finger and youll be having a good long wait before you can add his name to yours hannah entered bearing a tea tray and adelia rose and turned to her mistress winters wont be staying for tea after all hannah she was just leaving play the lady of the house while you can margot advised rising and gliding past adelias stiff form youll be back in the stables sooner than you think when the door closed with a sharp bang adelia let out a deep breath shes got her nerve coming here and talking that way an irate hannah sputtered well be paying her no mind she patted the housekeepers arm and well keep this visit between the two of us hannah if thats the way you want it missy hannah agreed with obvious reluctance aye she replied staring off into space thats the way i want it adelias nerves remained on edge for several days and showed all too plainly in increased temper the atmosphere in the house went from a nearstagnant calm to volatile motion travis greeted her change in attitude with absent tolerance that changed to strained patience she paced the living room after dinner one evening while he sat on the sofa and brooded over his brandy im going to take finnegan and go for a walk she announced suddenly unable to bear the silence between them any longer do as you like he answered with a shrug do as you like she whirled and snapped at him nerves as tight as an overwound watch its sick to death i am of hearing you say that i will not do as i like i dont want to do as i like do you hear what you just said he demanded setting down his brandy and staring at her that is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard its not ridiculous its perfectly clear if you had the sense to understand it whats gotten into you you make more sense when you mutter in gaelic nothing she returned shortly theres not a thing wrong with me then stop behaving like a shrew im tired of putting up with your foul temper a shrew am i her color rose precisely he agreed with infuriating calm well if youre tired of listening to me ill keep well out of your way storming from the room she flew past an astonished hannah out the back door and into the warm summer night she awoke the next morning ashamed disgusted and contrite she had spent an uneasy night struggling with the aftermath of temper and the realization that not only had she been unreasonable she had made a fool of herself as well one was as difficult to take as the other travis has done nothing to deserve the way ive been treating him she decided pulling on her working uniform of jeans and shirt and hurrying downstairs she determined to apologize and make a study of being as sweet and mild a wife as any man could want hannah informed her that travis had breakfasted early and gone out so adelia sat down in solitary misery unable to ease her conscience she worked hard in the stables that morning doing selfimposed penance for her faults and as morning melted into early afternoon the manual labor began to erase the depression she carried with her dee travis spoke from outside the tackroom where she was busily hanging bridles come out here i want to show you something travis she ran after him as he strode away travis catching up to him she tugged on his arm in an attempt to make him slow his pace im sorry travis im sorry for the way ive been behaving and for raging at you last night when i had no cause to i know ive been mean and spiteful and no fun to have around but if youll forgive me ill what are you smiling like that for the smile spread to a grin you apologize just as emphatically as you rage its fascinating now forget it halfpint he ruffled her hair and slipped an arm around her shoulders everyone has their black moods look he said simply and pointed she gave a cry of pleasure at the glossy chestnut mare prancing around inside the paddock fence moving over she stood on the first rung of fence and scanned the strong clean lines oh travis shes beautifulthe most beautiful horse ive ever seen you say that about all of them she smiled at him then back at the horse with a deep sigh of pleasure aye and its always true who will you breed her with thats not up to me shes yours adelia turned wide unbelieving eyes to his mine i had thought to give her to you next month for your birthday buthe shrugged and brushed a lock of hair from her facei thought your spirits needed a lift so shes yours a bit early she shook her head the still unfamiliar tears filling her eyes but after the way ive been acting you should have been beating me instead of buying me a present the thought entered my mind last night but this seemed a better solution oh travis she flung herself into his arms without restraint no ones ever given me such a grand present and i dont deserve it she drew her face from his cheek and pressed her lips to his his arms tightened around her the kiss changing from one of gratitude to one of smoldering passion and she offered herself lips parting and bones melting travis she murmured as his face lifted his cheek brushing hers he set her away from him abruptly youd better get acquainted with your mare dee ill see you at dinner she watched him stride away biting her lip to prevent herself from calling him back finnegan bounded over and she swallowed the tears of rejection burying her face in his fur i dont have any appeal for him she told her sympathetic companion and i dont know how to go about making him see me as a womanmuch less a wife chapter adelia woke to a blinding flash of lightning and a burst of thunder the room glowed with brief intensity as the sky was broken with spiderwebs of light and the wind moaned like a man mourning tossing back the covers she rose from the bed and threw open the french doors leading to her balcony to let the storm enter the room the hands of the wind pulled at her hair and whipped the soft material of her thin nightgown molding it against her rain fell in torrents like angry tears from the heavens and she raised her arms wide laughing in sheer delight at the raging elements dee she turned her head and saw travis silhouetted in the doorway i thought you might be frightened the electricitys out and the storms loud enough to wake the dead aye she agreed triumphantly its wonderful so much for finding you shaking with fear under the covers he returned with a dry smile and stepped back oh travis come look she cried as another bolt of lightning illuminated the murky sky and was followed by a deafening roar of thunder he watched her slimness outlined against the blackness the fullness of her hair flying riotously around her bare shoulders he opened his mouth to speak but adelia cried out again oh come just look at it taking a deep breath he moved to join her its so wild so strong and powerful and free she lifted her face to feel the full force of the wind on her cheeks its angry as the devil and doesnt give a hoot what anyone thinks listen to the wind screaming like a banshee oooh but i love a storm that blows free she turned and found his eyes on her lightning flooded the room and she saw the naked desire darkening his unblinking blue stare her smile faded her heart pounded in her ears drowning out the turbulence of the storm as he pulled her against him and crushed her lips in a violent hungry kiss her arms clutched around his waist as they fused together and she felt the need in him she had not known existed and knew a moments delirious pleasure that it was for her fire ignited fire her response was abandoned and uninhibited his mouth ravished hers hard and bruising and she opened under the pressure like a flower to the sun his hand slid to her shoulders and the soft material of her nightgown sighed to the floor her hands fumbled with the belt of his robe until no barrier of silk came between them with a swift desperate gesture he lifted her and carried her to the bed the passionate violence of the storm paled against the turbulence of their lovemaking his lips moved over hers slowly his hands roaming with gentle experience over her trembling body releasing her desire while he kept his own in check when he made her his she surrendered drawing her pleasure from the gift she gave later she slept in the warm circle of his arms the deep peaceful sleep of one who has been lost and searching and finally found home sunlight streamed warm and loving on adelias face and she opened her eyes traviss face lay close to hers and she studied it thoroughly and sighed her love nearly bursting her heart his breathing was slow and even the deep blue of his eyes hidden by lowered lids and lashes which seemed incredibly long and thick against the strongly masculine face her hand lifted and stroked the dark curls away from his forehead and she snuggled closer murmuring his name his eyes opened at her movements and smiled into hers hello he said simply as his arm tightened around her waist do you always look this beautiful first thing in the morning i dont know she answered its the first time ive ever woken with a man on my pillow she rolled on top of him and peered down at his face critically youre not a hard sight on the eyes either grinning she rubbed a hand over his chin though its a fact youre needing a shave he tugged the hair that fell streaming from her head to his shoulders and brought her face down claiming her lips after a moment she lay her head in the curve of his shoulder sighing with absolute contentment as he caressed her back with slow idle movements travis she said curiously that clock says its after ten he twisted to see for himself and groaned thats what it says but it cant be adelia objected raising herself up in indignation why never in my life have i slept as late as that well you did this time he grinned even you cant argue the day back ill pretend i didnt see it she decided and snuggled against his warmth as much as id like to do the same i have an appointment and im already going to be late he kissed her again rolling her over and she clung to him moving her hands over the rippling muscles of his back ive got to go his lips tarried a moment at the curve of her neck before he disentangled himself he rose and slipped on his robe turning back to gaze at her slim form scantily covered by rumpled sheets if you stay there for a couple of hours ill be back you could stay now and be a bit later for your appointment she suggested with a smile as she sat up clutching the sheet to her breast dont tempt me moving over he kissed her brow ill be back as soon as i can when the door closed behind him she lay back with a blissful sigh and stretched im truly his wife now she thought closing her eyes as memories of the previous night ran through her mind im a married woman and travis is my husband but he never said he loved me she sighed and shook her head he said he needed me and thats enough for now ill make him love me in time ill make our marriage work and hell not be thinking of ending it ill make him so happy hell think hes found heaven she jumped from the bed full of confidence and danced into the adjoining bathroom to shower later she paused halfway down the stairs her face lighting with pleasure as she heard traviss voice coming from the living room before she could begin the rapid descent she had intended another voice floated to her and she stopped the smile fading as she recognized margot winterss voice raised in exasperation travis you know very well i never meant those things i said before i left i only went away so that youd miss me and come after me did you expect me to drop everything and run off to europe chasing you margot adelia heard the slight amusement in his tone and bit her lip oh darling i know it was foolish the voice became low and seductive i never meant to hurt you im so terribly sorry i know you married that little groom to make me jealous is that so the answer was calm and adelias hand tightened on the banister at his cool dispassionate discussion of her of course darling and it worked beautifully now all you have to do is arrange for a quick divorce and give her a nice little settlement and well get things back to normal that may be difficult margot adelias catholic shed never divorce me her stomach lurched at the easy remark and she wrapped her arms around herself to ward off the sharp piercing stab of pain well then darling youll just have to divorce her on what grounds traviss voice sounded reasonable for heavens sake travis the feminine voice rose in annoyance you can arrange something give her some money shell do what you want adelia could stand no more covering her ears with her hands she ran up the carpeted stairs and into her room ohtis a fool you are adelia cunnane she berated herself leaning against her door he doesnt love you and he never will your marriage was just makebelieve all along she dashed away the tears and straightened her shoulders nows the time to end it she decided firmly uncle paddys strong enough and i cant go on this way any longer she packed only her old clothes and those bought with her own earnings in the wellbattered case she had carried from ireland then sat at the writing desk and penned notes to her uncle and husband please understand uncle paddy she pleaded placing the two envelopes on the smooth surface of the desk i cant be going on with this anymore i cant stay here so close to travis not now not after all thats happened she slipped downstairs and taking a deep breath walked outside to await her taxi the airport was as busy as it had been on her arrival throngs of people rushing around her and shaking her confidence for a moment she felt achingly lost and alone sighting the ticket counter she drew herself up and headed toward it a hand gripped her arm and spun her around she dropped her case to the tiled floor with a thud what do you think youre doing she began indignantly stopping openmouthed as she looked up into traviss furious face thats precisely what i wanted to ask you he tossed back his eyes boring into hers with a hard blue light where do you think youre going to ireland back to skibbereen are you stupid enough to think id let you get on that plane without a word he demanded his grip on her arm increasing she winced at his bruising fingers but answered evenly i left you a note i saw your note he hissed between his teeth its a good thing i got back early or id be chasing you across the atlantic theres no need for you to be chasing me anywhere adelia insisted pulling at her arm as the circulation began to slow down youre breaking my arm travis grant take your hand off me youre lucky its not your neck he muttered and lifting her case with his free hand he began to pull her after him im not going with youim going back to ireland you are coming with me he corrected and you can walk on your own two feet or ill cart you out like a sack of irish potatoes a sack of irish potatoes is it she spat at him but as he towered over her formidable and powerful she tossed her head and went on calmly aye ill walk master grant therell be other planes muttering an oath he strode purposefully out to his waiting car towing her with him he opened the door and gave her a none too gentle shove inside youve got a lot of explaining to do adelia he said as he started the engine she opened her mouth to retort but he cut her off with a deadly look save it until we get home i have no desire to commit murder publicly she remained silent on the drive home stubbornly staring out the side window pulling up in front of the large stone house travis got out of the car slamming his door with such force adelia was amazed that the glass remained intact he pulled adelia out and dragged her inside were not to be disturbed he announced to a gaping hannah as he hauled adelia up the staircase pushing her into her room he slammed the door and locked it now lets hear it ive an earful for you travis grant she raged you great thundering blackguard im sick to death of your shoving me and pushing me and tearing my arms from my sockets i warn you you blackhearted son of the devil youll not be battering me about any longer unless youve a mind to have a few bruises of your own if youve finished he returned evenly id like to see you use that doubleedged tongue of yours for an explanation ive no need to explain a blessed thing to the likes of you her eyes glittered bright green in her furious face i told you plain in the note i want nothing from you ive my pride if nothing else yes you and your irish pride travis growled stepping forward and taking her by the shoulders id like to strangle you with your pride what was all that about divorce and annulments i thought my wording clear enough she jerked away and backed up i said that as an annulment was no longer possible i was leaving and youd be free to divorce me i wanted none of your money and would pay you back for what i took with me and you expect me to accept that he shouted at her and she backed up another step just calmly read your little note and go from marriage to divorce in one easy step dont you shout at me she snapped back it was agreed when she started that this marriage was only for uncle paddy and wed have an annulment when he was better now that cant be so youll have to divorce me im not able to do it myself you can talk of annulments and divorce after last night he threw back bitterly i thought it meant something to you i can speak of it i can speak of it she roared out of control you dare say that to me the devil take you travis grant for your hypocrisy youd no more than left the bed when you spoke of divorcing me with your fine lady give me money to buy me off will you you low sneaking buzzard i would rather die than touch one penny of your money you lowlying snake dee is that why you left travis demanded shaking her as she resorted to gaelic curses aye her small fists beat uselessly at his chest take your hands off me you cursed brute ill not wait around to be bought off like some cheap fancy lady he picked her up bodily tucking her like a football under his arm and ignoring the flailing fists laid her gently on the bed so its back to bed again is it ill not lie in this bed with the likes of you again a curse on you travis grant be quiet you little fool travis captured her mouth shutting off the stream of gaelic and held it until her furious struggles lost their force did you think id let you go after all ive been through to get you he cut off her reply with another breathtaking kiss now you little spitfire keep your mouth shut and listen margot came here this morning without invitation she brought up the subject of divorce not i in the first placekeep still he warned as she squirmed beside him or ill have to get tough he demonstrated by closing his mouth over hers until for a moment her struggles lost their force in the first place he began again i had never considered marrying her any plans in that direction were her own we had a fairly compatible relationship for a whileadelia hold still youre going to hurt yourself he shifted his weight took both of her wrists in his hand and held them over her head she got it into her head that i should marry her and give up my work here with some crazy notion about traveling the world and living in high style i told her she was out of her mind and she took off for europe telling me it was her or the horses he grinned down at adelias flushed face the horses won hands down she got it stuck in that small brain of hers that i married you to spite her and when she came here this morning going on about divorce and settlements i let her ramble curious to see how big a fool shed make of herself he took adelias chin in his free hand and held her head still now if you had listened to the entire conversation you would have heard me tell her that i had no intention of divorcing a wife i loved now or any time within the next thousand years you said that all struggles stopped or words to that effect the meaning was clear iwell you might have told your wife you loved her it would have saved a great deal of trouble how could i tell her i loved her five minutes after she raged at me standing there looking like an outraged urchin he brushed her curls aside to kiss the creamy skin of her throat my first thought was to gentle you so you could stand the sight of me and go from there did you really think i took you to kentucky and new york just for majesty his lips explored her smooth skin i didnt dare let you out of my sight someone might have come along and snatched you away i decided to wear you down slowly his mouth moved over her face with slow lingering kisses i thought i was making some headway but paddys heart attack changed everything i felt the best way to help him was to assure him of your welfare so i railroaded you into marriage with the promise of an annulment of coursehis free hand began fresh explorationsi never intended to give you one let go of my hands she demanded and he raised his head and shook it not if i have to keep you here for the next twenty years you thickbrained idiot couldnt you see how i was dying for loving you let go of my hands blast your eyes and kiss me she pulled his head to hers with her freed hands and buried her face in the strong column of his neck it appears he murmured in her scented hair weve wasted a great deal of time you seemed so far away all those weeks you never even touched me you never even said you loved me last night i didnt dare touch you i wanted you so much it was driving me mad if i had told you i loved you last nightand how i wanted toyou might have thought i said it just to keep you in bed i wont think that now travis let me hear you say it ive been needing to hear you say it for such a long time he obliged her telling her over and over until his lips sought hers and told her silently travis she finally whispered against his ear im wondering if you could arrange another thunderstorm irish rose chapter her name was erin like her country and like her country she was a maze of contradictionsrebellion and poetry passion and moodiness she was strong enough to fight for her beliefs stubborn enough to fight on after a cause was lost and generous enough to give whatever she had she was a woman with soft skin and a tough mind she had sweet dreams and towering ambitions her name was erin erin mckinnon and she was nervous as a cat it was true that this was only the third time in her life shed been in the airport at cork or any airport for that matter still it wasnt the crowds or the noise that made her jumpy the fact was she liked hearing the announcements of planes coming and going she liked thinking about all the people going places london new york paris through the thick glass she could watch the big sleek planes rise up nose first and imagine their destinations perhaps one day shed board one herself and experience that stomachfluttering anticipation as the plane climbed up and up she shook her head it wasnt a plane going up that had her nervous now but one coming in and it was due any minute erin caught herself before she dragged a hand through her hair it wouldnt do a bit of good to be poking and pulling at herself after thirty seconds more she shifted her bag from hand to hand then tugged at her jacket she didnt want to look disheveled or tense or poor she added as she ran a hand down her skirt to smooth it thank god her mother was so clever with a needle the deep blue of the skirt and matching jacket was flattering to her pale complexion the cut and style were perhaps a bit conservative for erins taste but the color did match her eyes she wanted to look competent capable and had even managed to tame her unruly hair into a tidy coil of dark red the style made her look older she thought she hoped it made her look sophisticated too shed toned down the dusting of freckles and had deepened the color of her lips eye makeup had been applied with a careful hand and she wore nannys old and lovely gold crescents at her ears the last thing she wanted was to look plain and dowdy the poor relation even the echo of the phrase in her head caused her teeth to clench pity even sympathy were emotions she wanted none of she was a mckinnon and perhaps fortune hadnt smiled on her as it had her cousin but she was determined to make her own way here they were she thought and had to swallow a ball of nerves in her throat erin watched the plane that had brought them from curragh taxi toward the gatethe small sleek plane people of wealth and power could afford to charter she could imagine what it would be like to sit inside to drink champagne or nibble on something exotic imagination had always been hers in quantity all shed lacked was the means to make what she could imagine come true an elderly woman stepped off the plane first leading a small girl by the hand the woman had cloudwhite hair and a solid sturdy build beside her the little girl looked like a pixie carrottopped and compact the moment theyd stepped to the ground a boy of five or six leaped off after them even through the thick glass erin could all but hear the womans scolding she snatched his hand with her free one and he flashed her a wicked grin erin felt immediate kinship if shed gauged the age right that would be brendon adelias oldest the girl who held the womans hand and clutched a battered doll in the other would be keeley younger by a year or so the man came next the man erin recognized as travis grant her cousins husband of seven years owner of thoroughbreds and master of royal meadows he was tall and broadshouldered and was laughing down at his son who waited impatiently on the tarmac the smile was nice she thought the kind that made a woman look twice without being sure whether to relax or brace herself erin had met him once briefly when hed brought his wife back to ireland four years before quietly domineering shed thought then the kind of man a woman could depend on as long as she could stand toetotoe with him on his hip he carried another child a boy with hair as dark and thick as his fathers he was grinning too but not down at his brother and sister his face was tilted up toward the sky from which hed just come travis handed him down then turned and held out a hand as adelia stepped through the opening the sun struck her hair with arrows of light the rich chestnut shone around her face and shoulders she too was laughing even with the distance erin could see the glow she was a small woman when travis caught her by the waist and lifted her to the ground she didnt reach his shoulder he kept his arm around her erin noticed not so much possessive as protective of her and perhaps of the child that was growing inside her while erin watched adelia tilted her face touched a hand to her husbands cheek and kissed him not like a longtime wife erin thought but like a lover a little ripple of envy moved through her erin didnt try to avoid it she never attempted to avoid any of her feelings but let them come let them race to the limit whatever the consequences and why shouldnt she envy dee erin asked herself adelia cunnane the little orphan from skibbereen had not only pulled herself up by the bootstraps but had tugged hard enough to land on top of the pile more power to her erin thought she intended to do the same herself erin squared her shoulders and started to step forward as another figure emerged from the plane another servant she thought then took a long thorough look no this man would serve no one he leaped lightly to the ground with a slim unlit cigar clamped between his teeth slowly even warily he looked around as a cat might she thought a cat that had just leaped from cliff to cliff she couldnt see his eyes for he wore tinted glasses but she had the quick impression that they would be sharp intense and not entirely comfortable to look into he was as tall as travis but leaner sparer tough the adjective came to her as she pursed her lips and continued to stare he bent down to speak to one of the children and the move was lazy but not careless his dark hair was straight and long enough to hang over the collar of his denim shirt he wore boots and faded jeans but she rejected the idea that he was a farmer he didnt look like a man who tilled the soil but like one who owned it what was a man like this doing traveling with her cousins family another relative she wondered and shifted uncomfortably it didnt matter who he was erin checked the pins in her hair found two loose and shoved them into place if he was some relation of travis grants then that was fine but he didnt look like kin of her cousins husband the coloring might be similar but any resemblance ended there the stranger had a rawboned sharpedged look to him she remembered the picture books in catechism class and the drawings of satan better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven yes for the first time a smile moved on her lips he looked like a man whod have similar sentiments taking a deep breath erin moved forward to greet her family the boy brendon came first barreling through the doorway with one shoe untied and eyes alight with curiosity the whitehaired women came in behind him moving with surprising speed stand still you scamp im not going to lose track of you again i just want to see hannah there was a laugh in his voice and no contrition at all when she caught his hand in hers youll see soon enough no need to worry your mother to death keeley you stay close now i will the little girl looked around as avidly as her brother but seemed more content to stay in the same place then she spotted erin there she is thats our cousin erin just like the picture without a hint of reserve the girl crossed over and smiled youre our cousin erin arent you im keeley momma said youd be wailing for us aye im erin charmed erin bent down to catch the little girls chin in her hand nerves vanished into genuine pleasure and the last time i saw you you were just a wee thing all bundled in a blanket against the rain and bawling fit to wake the dead keeleys eyes widened she talks just like momma she announced hannah come see she talks just like momma miss mckinnon hannah kept one hand firmly on brendons shoulder and offered the other its nice to meet you im hannah blakely your cousins housekeeper housekeeper erin thought as she put her hand in hannahs weathered one the cunnanes shed known might have been housekeepers but theyd never had one welcome to ireland and youd be brendon ive been to ireland before he said importantly but this time i flew the plane did you now she saw her cousin in him the pixielike features and deep green eyes hed be a handful she thought as her mother claimed adelia had always been well youre all grown up since i saw you last im the oldest bradys the baby now erin she glanced over in time to see adelia rush forward even heavy with child she moved lightly and when she wound her arms around erin there was strength in them the recognition came stronglyfamily to family roots to roots oh erin its so good to be back so good to see you let me look at you she hadnt changed a bit erin thought adelia would be nearly thirty now but she looked years younger her complexion was smooth and flawless glowing against the glossy mane of hair she still wore long and loose the pleasure in her face was so real so vital that erin felt it seeping through her own reserve you look wonderful dee americas been good for you and the prettiest girl in skibbereens become a beautiful woman oh erin she kissed both her cousins cheeks laughed and kissed them again you look like home with erins hand still held tightly in hers she turned you remember travis of course its good to see you again youve grown up in four years he kissed her cheek in turn you didnt meet brady the last time no i didnt the child kept an arm around his fathers neck and eyed erin owlishly faith hes the image of you its a handsome boy you are cousin brady brady smiled then turned to bury his face in his fathers neck and shy adelia commented stroking a hand down his hair unlike his da erin its so kind of you to offer to meet us and take us to the inn we dont often get visitors ive got the minibus you know from the last time you came that renting a car is tricky so ill be leaving it with you while youre here while she spoke erin felt an itch at the base of her neck a tingle or a warning deliberately she turned and stared back at the leanfaced man shed seen step off the plane erin this is burke adelia placed a hand on her skirt at the stirrings within her womb burke logan my cousin erin mckinnon mr logan erin said with a slight nod determined not to flinch at her own reflection in his mirrored glasses miss mckinnon he smiled slowly then clamped his cigar between his teeth again she still couldnt see his eyes but had the uneasy feeling that the glasses were no barrier to what he saw im sure youre tired she said to adelia but kept her gaze stubbornly on burkes the bus is right out front ill take you out then well deal with the luggage burke kept himself just a little apart as they walked through the small terminal he preferred it that way the better to observe and figure angles just now he was figuring erin mckinnon a tidy little package he mused watching the way her long athletic legs moved beneath her conservative skirt neat as a pin and nervous as a filly at the starting gate just what kind of race did she intend to run he wondered he knew snatches of the background from conversations on the trip from the states and from curragh to this little spot on the map the mckinnons and cunnanes werent first cousins as near as could be figured adelias mother and the mother of the very interesting erin mckinnon had been third cousins who had grown up on neighboring farms burke smiled as erin looked uneasily over her shoulder in his direction if adelia cunnane grant figured that made her and the mckinnons family he wouldnt argue for himself he spent more time avoiding family connections than searching them out if he didnt stop staring at her like that he was going to get a piece of her mind erin told herself as she slid the van into gear the luggage was loaded the children chattering and she had to keep her wits about her to navigate out of the airport she could see him in the rearview mirror legs spread out in the narrow aisle one arm tossed over the worn seatand his eyes on her try as she might she couldnt concentrate on adelias questions about her family as she wound the van onto the road she listened with half an ear and gave her cousin the best answers she could everyone was fine the farm was doing well enough as she began to relax behind the wheel she dug deep for bits and pieces of gossip still he kept staring at her let him then she decided the man obviously had the manners of a plow mule and was no concern of hers stubbornly avoiding another glance in the rearview mirror she jabbed another loose pin back in her hair she had questions of her own erin expertly avoided the worst of the bumps on the road and trained her eyes straight ahead the first of them would be who the hell was this burke logan still she smiled on cue and assured her cousin again that her family was fit and fine so cullens not married yet cullen despite her determination erins gaze had drifted back to the mirror and burke she cursed herself no much to my mothers regret hes still single he goes into dublin now and again to sing his songs and play she hit a rough patch that sent the van vibrating im sorry its all right turning her head she studied adelia with genuine concern are you sure im wondering if you should be traveling at all im healthy as one of traviss horses in a habitual gesture adelia put a hand on her rounded belly and ive months to go before theyre born they twins this time the smile lit up her face ive been hoping twins erin repeated under her breath not sure whether she should be amazed or amused adelia shifted into a more comfortable position glancing back she saw that her two youngest were dozing and that brendon was putting up a courageous if failing battle to keep his eyes open ive always wanted a big family like yours erin grinned at her as the van putted into the village it looks like youre going to match it and may the sweet lord have mercy on you with a chuckle adelia shifted again to absorb the sights and sounds of the village she remembered from childhood the small buildings were still neat if a bit rough around the edges patches of grass were deep and green shimmering against dark brown dirt the sign on the village pub the shamrock creaked and groaned in a breeze that tasted of rain from the sea she could almost smell it and remembered it easily here the cliffs were sheer and towering slicing down to a wild sea she could remember the times shed stood on the rock watching the fishing boats seeing them come in with their days catch to dry their nets and cool dry throats at the pub the talk here was of fishing and farming of babies and sweethearts it was home adelia rested a hand against the open window and looked out it was homea way of life a place shed never been able to close out of her heart there was a wagon filled with hay its color no brighter its scent no sweeter than that of the hay in her own stables in america but this was ireland and her heart had never stopped looking back here it hasnt changed erin eased the vehicle to a stop and glanced around she knew every square inch of the village and every farm for a hundred miles around in truth shed never known anything else did you expect it would nothing ever changes here theres odonnellys the dry goods dee stepped out of the van foolishly she wanted to have her feet on the ground of her youth she wanted to fill her lungs with the air of skibbereen is he still there the old goat will die behind the counter still counting his last pence with a laugh dee took brady from travis and cuddled him as he yawned and settled against her shoulder aye then he hasnt changed either travis you see the church there wed come in every sunday for mass old father finnegan would drone on and on does he still erin erin slipped the keys of the van in the pocket of her purse he died dee better than a year ago because the light went out of her cousins eyes erin lifted a hand to her cheek he was more than eighty if you remember and died quietly in his sleep life went on she knew and people passed out of it whether you wanted them to or not dee glanced back at the church it would never seem exactly the same again he buried mother and da i cant forget how kind he was to me weve a young priest now erin began briskly sent from cork a hellraiser he is and not a soul sleeps through one of his sermons put the fear of god into michael ryan so the man comes sober to mass every sunday morning she turned to help with the luggage and slammed solidly into burke he put a hand on her shoulder as if to steady her but it lingered too long i beg your pardon she couldnt stop her chin from tilting forward or her eyes from spitting at him he only smiled my fault grabbing two hefty cases he swung them out of the van why dont you take dee and the kids in travis ill deal with this normally travis wouldnt have left another with the bulk of the work but he knew his wifes strength was flagging he also knew she was stubborn and the only way to get her into bed for a nap was to put her there himself thanks ill take care of checking in erin well see you and your family tonight theyll be here on impulse she kissed dees cheek youll rest now otherwise mother will fuss and drive you mad that i can promise do you have to go now couldnt you come in ive some things to see to go on now or your children will be asleep in the street ill see you soon over brandons protest hannah bundled them inside erin turned to grip another pair of cases by the handles and began unloading it passed through her mind that expensive clothes must weigh more when she found herself facing burke again theres just a few more she muttered and deliberately breezed by him inside the inn was dim but far from quiet the excitement of having visitors from america had kept the small staff on their toes all week wood had been polished floors had been scrubbed even now old mrs malloy was leading dee up the stairs and keeping up a solid stream of reminiscence the children were cooed over and hot tea and soda bread were offered deciding shed left her charges in good hands erin walked outside again the day was cool and clear the early clouds had long since been blown away by the westerly wind so that the light as it often was in ireland was luminescent and pearly erin took a moment to study the village that had so fascinated her cousin it was ordinary slow quiet filled with workingmen and women and often smelling of fish from almost any point in town you could see the small harbor where the boats came in with their daily catch the storefronts were kept neat that was a matter of pride the doors were left unlocked that was a matter of custom there was no one there who didnt know her no one she didnt know whatever secrets there were were never secrets for long but were passed out like small treasures to be savored and sighed over god she wanted to see something else before her life was done she wanted to see big cities where life whirled by fast and hot and anonymous she wanted to walk down a street where no one knew who she was and no one cared just once just once in her life she wanted to do something wild and impulsive that wouldnt echo back to her on the tongues of family and neighbors just once the van door slammed and jolted her back to reality again she found herself looking at burke logan theyre all settled then she asked struggling to be polite looks like he leaned back against the van with his ankles crossed he pulled out a lighter and lit his cigar he never smoked around adelia out of respect for her condition his eyes never left erins not much family resemblance between you and mrs grant is there it was the first time hed spoken more than two words at a time erin noted that his accent wasnt like traviss his words came more slowly as if he saw no reason to hurry them theres the hair he continued when erin didnt speak but hers is more like traviss prize chestnut colt and yours he took another puff as he deliberated yours is something like the mahogany stand in my bedroom he grinned the cigar still clamped between his teeth i thought it was mighty pretty when i bought it thats a lovely thought mr logan but im not a horse or a table reaching into her pocket she held out the keys ill be leaving these with you then instead of taking them he simply closed his hand over hers cradling the keys between them his palm was hard and rough as the rocks in the cliffs that dropped toward the sea he enjoyed the way she held her ground the way she lifted her brow more in disdain than offense is there something else youre wanting mr logan ill give you a lift he said simply its not necessary she clenched her teeth and nodded as two of the towns busiest gossips passed behind her the evening news would have erin mckinnon holding hands with a stranger in the street sure as faith ive only to ask for a ride home to get one youve got one already with his hand still on hers he pushed away from the van i told travis id see to it after releasing her hand he gestured toward the door dont worry ive nearly got the hang on driving on the wrong side of the road its you who drive on the wrong side after only a brief hesitation erin climbed in the day was passing her by and shed have to make every minute count just to catch up burke settled behind the wheel and turned the key in the ignition youre losing your pins he said mildly erin reached behind her and shoved them into place as he drove out of the village youll take the left fork when you come to it after that its only four or five kilometers erin folded her hands deciding shed granted him enough conversation pretty country burke commented glancing out at the green windswept hills there were blackthorns bent a bit from the continual stream of the westerly breeze heather grew in a soft purple cloud while in the distance the mountains rose dark and eerie in the light youre close to the sea close enough dont you like americans with her hands still folded primly she turned to look at him i dont like men who stare at me burke tapped his cigar ash out the window that would narrow the field considerably the men i know have manners mr logan he liked the way she said his name with just a hint of spit in it too bad i was taught to take a good long look at something that interested me im sure you consider that a compliment just an observation this the fork aye she drew a long breath knowing she had no reason to set her temper loose and every reason to hold it do you work for travis no he grinned as the van shimmied over ruts you might say travis and i are associates he liked the smell here the rich wet scent of ireland and the warm earthy scent of the woman beside him i own the farm that borders his you race horses she lifted a brow again compelled to study him at the moment erins lips pursed as she considered she could picture him at the track with the noise and the smells of the horses try as she might she couldnt put him behind a desk balancing accounts and ledgers traviss farm is quite successful his lips curved again is that your way of asking about mine her chin angled as she looked away its certainly none of my concern no its not but i do well enough i wasnt born into it like travis but i find it suits mefor now theyd take you back with them if you asked at first it didnt sink in then her lips parted in surprise as she turned to him again i recognize a restless soul when i see one burke blew out smoke so that it trailed through the window and disappeared youre straining at the bit to get out of this little smudge on the map though if you ask me it has its charm no one asked you true enough but its hard not to notice when you stand on the curb and look around as though you wished the whole village to hell thats not true the guilt rose in her because for a moment just a moment shed come close to wishing it so all right well alter that to you wishing yourself anywhere else i know the feeling irish you dont know what i feel you dont know me at all better than you think he murmured feeling trapped stifled smothered she said nothing this time looking at the same space you saw the day you were born and wondering if its the last thing youll see before you die wondering why you dont walk out stick out your thumb and head whichever way the winds blowing how old are you erin mckinnon what he was saying hit too close to the bone for comfort im twentyfive and what of it i was five years younger when i stuck my thumb out he turned to her but again she saw only her own reflection cant say i ever regretted it well its happy i am for you mr logan now if youll slow down the lanes there just pull to the side i can walk from here suit yourself when he stopped the van he put a hand on her arm before she could climb out he wasnt sure why hed offered to drive her or why hed started this line of conversation he was following a hunch as he had for most of his life i know ambition when i see it because it looks back at me out of the mirror most mornings some consider it a sin ive always thought of it as a blessing what was it about him that made her throat dry up and her nerves stretch have you a point mr logan i like your looks erin id hate to see them wrinkled up with discontent he grinned again and tipped an invisible hat top of the morning to you unsure whether she was running from him or her own demons erin got out of the van slammed the door and hurried down the lane chapter she had a great deal to think about erin sat through dinner at the inn with her family talking on top of each other with laughter rolling into laughter voices were raised to be heard over the clatter of tableware the scrape of chair legs the occasional shout scents were a mixture of good hot food and whiskey the lights had been turned up high in celebration the group filled mrs malloys dining room at the inn but wasnt so very much bigger than a sunday supper at the farm erin ate little herself not because one of her brothers seemed to interrupt constantly to have her pass this or that but because she couldnt stop thinking about what burke had said to her that afternoon she was dissatisfied though she didnt like the idea that a stranger could see it as easily as her family had always overlooked it years before shed convinced herself it wasnt wrong to be so how could it be wrong to feel what was so natural true shed been taught that envy was a sin but damn it all she wasnt a saint and wouldnt choose to be one the envy she felt for dee sitting cozily beside her husband felt healthy not sinful after all it wasnt as if she wished her cousin didnt have it was only that she wished she had as well she doubted a body burned in hell for wishes but she didnt think they grew wings for them either in truth she was glad the grants had come back to visit for a few days she could listen to their stories of america and picture it she could ask questions and imagine the big stone house dee lived in now and almost catch glimpses of the excitement and power of the racing world when they left again everything would settle back to routine but not forever erin promised herself no not forever in a year maybe two she would have saved enough and then it would be off to dublin shed get a job in some big office and have a flat of her own of her very own no one was going to stop her her lips started to curve at the thought but then her gaze met burkes across the table he wasnt wearing those concealing glasses now she almost wished he was theyd been disturbing but not nearly as disturbing as his eyesdark gray intense eyes a wolf would have eyes like that smoky and patient and cunning he had no business looking at her like that she thought then stubbornly stared right back at him the noise and confusion of the table continued around them but she lost track of it was it the amusement in his eyes that drew her or the arrogance perhaps it was because both added up to a peculiar kind of knowledge she wasnt sure but she felt something for him at that moment something she knew she shouldnt feel and was even more certain shed regret an irish rose burke thought he wasnt sure hed ever seen one but was certain they would have thorns thick ones with sharp edges an irish rose a wild rose wouldnt be fragile or require careful handling it would be sturdy strong and stubborn enough to grow through briers it was a flower he thought he could respect he liked her family they would be called salt of the earth he supposed simple but not simpleminded apparently their farm did well enough as long as they worked seven days a week mary mckinnon had a dressmaking business on the side but seemed more interested in discussing children with dee than fashion the brothers were fair except for the oldest cullen who had the looks of a black irish warrior and the voice of a poet unless burke missed his guess erin had her softest spot there throughout the meal he watched her curious to see what other soft spots he might discover by the time dinner was over burke was glad hed let travis talk him into an extra few days in ireland the trip had been profitable the visit to the track at curragh educational and now it seemed it was time to mix business with a little pleasure youll play for us wont you cullen adelia was already reaching across the table to grip erins oldest brothers hand for old times sake hell take little enough persuading mary mckinnon put in youd best clear a space she gestured to her two youngest sons its only fitting that we dance off a meal like that i just happen to have my pipe cullen reached in his vest pocket and drew out the slim reed he stood a big man with broad shoulders and lean hips the fingers of his workingmans hands slid over the holes as he lifted the instrument to his lips it surprised burke that such a big roughlooking man could make such delicate music he settled back in his chair savored the kick of his irish whiskey and watched mary mckinnon placed her hand in her youngest sons and without seeming to move at all set her feet in time to the music it seemed a very restrained dance to burke with a complicated pattern of heels and toes and shuffles then the pace began to pick upslowly almost unnoticeably the others were keeping time with their hands or occasional hoots when he glanced at erin she was standing with a hand on her fathers shoulder and smiling as he hadnt seen her smile before something shimmered a bit inside himshimmered then strained then quieted all in the space of two heartbeats she still moves like a girl matthew mckinnon said of his wife and shes still beautiful erin watched her mother whirl in her sons arms then spin with a flare of skirt and a flash of leg can you keep up with a laugh that was only slightly wistful erin shook her head ive never been able to come now her father slid an arm around her waist my moneys on you before she could protest matthew had spun her out his grin was broad as he held her hand high and picked up the rhythm of the timeless folk dance shed been taught as soon as she could walk the pipe music was cheerful and challenging caught up in it and her familys enthusiasm erin began to move instinctively she put her hands on her hips and tossed up her chin can you manage it adelia looked up at her eighteenyearold cousin can i manage it she repeated with her eyes narrowed the day hasnt come when i cant manage a jig boyo travis started to protest as she joined her cousins on the floor but then he subsided if there was one thing his dee knew it was her own strength the depth of it continued to surprise him quite a group arent they he murmured to burke theyre all of that he drew out a cigar but his eyes remained on erin i take it you dont jig with a chuckle travis leaned back against the wall dees tried to teach me and labeled me hopeless im inclined to believe you have to be born to it he saw brendon go out to take his place as his mothers partner his mothers son travis thought with a ripple of pride of all their children brendon was the most strongwilled and hardheaded she needed this more than i realized burke managed to tear his eyes from erin long enough to study traviss profile most people get homesick now and again shes only come back twice in seven years travis watched her now her cheeks pink with pleasure her eyes laughing down at brendon as he copied her moves its not enough you know shell take you to the wall in an argumenthalf the time an argument no sane man can understand but she never complains and she never asks for a moment burke said nothing it still surprised him after four years that his friendship with travis had become so close so quickly hed never considered himself the kind of man to make friends and in truth had never wanted the responsibility of one hed spent almost half his thirtytwo years on his own needing no one wanting no one with the grants it had just happened i dont know much about women at traviss slow smile burke corrected himself wives but id say yours is happy whether shes here or in the states the fact is travis if she loved you less i might have made a play for her myself travis continued to watch her as his mind played back the years the first time i saw her i thought she was a boy burke drew the cigar out of his mouth youre joking it was dark a poor excuse his chuckle was warm and easy as he looked back she seemed to think so too nearly took my head off i think i fell for her then and there he heard her laugh and looked over as she shook her head and stepped away from the dancers she came to him hands outstretched the jeweled ring hed put on her finger years before still glimmered i could go for hours she claimed a little breathlessly but these two have had enough with her free hands she covered her babies are you going to try it burke not on your life she laughed again and put a hand on his arm with the simple generosity hed never quite gotten used to if a man doesnt make a fool of himself now and again hes not living she took a couple of deep steadying breaths but couldnt keep her foot from tapping oh its like magic when cullen plays and all the more magic to be here hearing it she brought traviss hand to her lips then rested her cheek on it mary mckinnon can still outdance anyone in the county but erins wonderful too isnt she burke took a long sip of whiskey its not a hardship to watch her laughing again adelia rested her head against her husbands arm i suppose as her elder cousin i should warn her about your reputation with women burke swirled the whiskey in his glass and gave her a bland look what reputation is that with her head still nestled against travis she smiled up at him oh i hear things mr logan fascinating things the racing worlds a tight little group you know ive heard murmurs that a man not only has to watch his daughters but his wife when youre about if i was interested in another mans wife youd be the first to know he took her hand and brought it to his lips her eyes laughed at him travis i think burkes flirting with me apparently he agreed and kissed the top of her head a warning mr logan its easy enough to flirt with a woman whos five months along with twins and who knows youre a scoundrel but mind your step the irish are a clever lot she stood on her toes and kissed his cheek if you keep staring at her like that matthew mckinnons going to load his shotgun he glanced back as erin stepped away from the group no law against looking there should be when it comes to you she snuggled against travis again looks like erins going outside for a breath of air when burke merely lifted a brow she smiled youd probably like to light that cigar maybe take a little walk in the night air yourself as a matter of fact i would he nodded to her then sauntered to the door were you warning him off or egging him on travis wanted to know just enjoying the view love she turned her mouth up for a kiss erin drew her jacket tightly around her nights were coldest in february but she didnt mind now the air was bracing and the moon halffull she was glad her father had pressured her to dance it seemed too seldom now that there was time for small celebrations there was so much work to be done and not as many hands to do it now that frank had married and started his own family and within a year she expected sean to marry the hennessy girl with cullen more interested in his music than milking that left only joe and brian and herself the family was growing but at the same time spreading out the farm had to survive erin knew that was indisputable her father would simply wither away without it just as she knew she would wither away if she stayed much longer the only solution was to find a way to ensure both she hugged herself with her arms to ward off the wind it brought with it the scent of mrs malloys wild roses and rhododendrons she wouldnt think of it now in a short time the grants would be gone and her own yearnings for more would fade a bit when the time was right something would happen she looked up at the moon and smiled hadnt she promised herself that shed make something happen she heard the scrape and flare of a lighter and braced herself nice night she didnt turn the little jolt to her system teased her no she hadnt wanted him to come out she told herself why should she since he had she would hold her own its a bit cold you look warm enough she wouldnt give an inch it only gave him the pleasure of taking it from her i liked the dancing she turned to walk slowly away from the inn it didnt surprise her when he fell into step beside her youre missing it you stopped the end of his cigar grew bright and red as he took another puff your brother has a gift aye she listened now as the music turned from jaunty to sad he wrote this one hearing its like hearing a heart break music like this always made her long and fear and wonder what it would be like to feel so strongly about another are you a music lover mr logan when the tunes right this one was a waltz a slow weepy one on impulse he slipped his arms around her and picked up the time what are you doing dancing he said simply a mans supposed to ask but she didnt pull away and her steps matched his easily the motion and the music made her smile she turned her face up to his the grass was soft beneath her feet the moonlight sweet you dont look like the kind of man who can waltz one of my few cultural accomplishments she fit nicely into his arms slender but not fragile soft but not malleable and it seems to be a night for dancing she said nothing for a moment there was magic here starlight roses and sad music the flutter in her stomach the warmth along her skin warned her that a woman took chances waltzing under the night sky with a stranger but still she moved with him the tunes changed she murmured and drew out of his arms relieved regretful that he didnt keep her there she turned once again to walk why did you come here to look at horses i bought a pair in kildare he took a puff on his cigar hed yet to realize himself what his horses and farm had come to mean to him theres no match for the thoroughbreds at the irish national stud you pay for them god knows but ive never minded putting my money on a winner so you came to buy horses it interested her though she didnt want it to and to watch a few races ever been to curragh no she glanced up at the moon again curragh kilkenny kildare all of them might have been as far away as the white slash in the sky you wont find thoroughbreds here in skibbereen no he smiled at her in the moonlight and the smile made her uneasy then lets say im just along for the ride its my first time in ireland and what do you think of it she stopped now unwilling to pass out of the range of the music ive found it beautiful and contradictory with a name like logan youd have some irish in you unsmiling he glanced down at his cigar its possible probable she said lightly you know you said you were a neighbor of traviss but you dont sound like him your accent accent his mood changed again with a grin i guess if you want to call it that it comes from the west the west it took her a moment the american west cowboys this time he laughed a full rich laugh so that she was distracted enough not to protest when his hand touched her cheek we dont carry sixguns as a rule these days her feathers were ruffled you dont have to make fun of me was i because her skin had felt so cool and so smooth he touched it again and what would you say if i asked you about leprechauns and banshees she had to smile id say the last to have seen a leprechaun in these parts was michael ryan after a pint of irish you dont believe in legends erin he stepped closer so that he could see the moonlight reflected in her eyes like light in a lake no she didnt step back it wasnt her nature to retreat even when she felt the warning shiver race up her spine whether you won or went down in defeat it was best to do it with feet firmly planted i believe in what i can see and touch the rest is for dreamers pity he murmured though he had always felt the same lifes a bit softer the other way ive never wanted softness then what he touched a finger to the hair that curled at her cheekbones i have to go back it wasnt a retreat she told herself she felt cold all at once cold to the bone but even as she started to turn he closed a hand over her arm she looked at him eyes clear not so much angry as assessing youll excuse me mr logan the winds up i noticed you didnt answer my question no because its no concern of yours dont she said when his fingers closed lightly over her chin but she didnt jerk away im interested when a man meets someone he recognizes hes interested we dont know each other but she understood him when hed brought his arms around her in the waltz shed known him there was something something in both of them that mirrored back whatever it was had her heart beating hard now and her skin chilling and if its rude i have to be then ill say it plain i dont care to know you do you usually have such a strong reaction to a stranger she tossed her head but his fingers stayed in place the only reaction im having at the moment is annoyance which was one of the biggest lies she could remember telling shed already looked at his mouth and wondered what it would be like to be kissed by him im sure you think i should be flattered that youre willing to spend time with me but im not a silly farm girl who kisses a man because theres a moon and music he lifted a brow erin if id intended to kiss you id have done so already i never waste timewith a woman she felt abruptly as foolish as shed claimed not to be damn it she would have kissed him and she knew he was well aware of it well youre wasting mine now ill say goodnight why hadnt he kissed her burke asked himself as he watched her rush back to the inn hed wanted to badly hed imagined it clearly for a moment when the moonlight had fallen over her face and her face had lifted to his hed all but tasted her but he hadnt kissed her something had warned him that it would take only that to change the order of things for both of them he wasnt ready for it he wasnt sure he could avoid it taking a last puff he sent the cigar in an arch into the night hed come to ireland for horses hed be better off being content with that but he was a man on whom contentment rarely sat easily shed come late on purpose erin rolled her bike to the kitchen entrance of the inn and parked it she knew it was prideful but she simply didnt want dee to know she worked there it wasnt the paperwork and bookkeeping that bothered her that made her feel accomplished it was her kitchen duties she preferred to keep to herself mrs malloy had promised not to mention it but she tuttutted about it erin shrugged that off as she entered the kitchen let her tuttut as long as that was all she let out of her mouth dee and her family were visiting in town through the morning that had given erin time to clear up her chores at home then ride leisurely from the farm to handle the breakfast dishes and the daily cleaning since the books were in order shed be able to take a few hours that afternoon to drive out to the farm where her cousin had grown up it wasnt being deceitful she told herself as she filled the big sink with water and if it was it couldnt be helped she wouldnt have dee feeling sorry for her she was working for the money it was as simple as that once enough was made she could move on to that office position in cork or dublin by the saints the only dishes shed have to clean then would be her own she started to hum as she scrubbed the inns serviceable plates shed learned young when there was work to be done to make the best of it because as sure as the sun rose it would be there again tomorrow she looked out the window as she worked across the field where shed walked with burke the night before where shed danced with him in the moonlight she thought then caught herself foolishness he was just a man dallying with what was available she might not be traveled or have seen big cities but she wasnt naive if shed felt anything in those few minutes alone with him it had been the novelty he was different but that didnt make him special and it certainly didnt warrant her thinking of him in broad daylight with her arms up to the elbows in soapy water she heard the door open behind her and began to scrub faster i know im late mrs malloy but ill have it cleared up before lunch shes at the market fussing over vegetables at burkes voice erin simply closed her eyes when he crossed over and put a hand on her shoulder she began to scrub with a vengeance what are you doing id think youd have eyes to see that she set one plate to drain and attacked another if youll excuse me im behind saying nothing he walked over to the stove and poured the coffee that was always kept warm there she was wearing overalls baggy ones that might have belonged to one of her brothers her hair was down and longer than hed imagined it shed pulled it back with a band to keep it out of her face but it was thick and curly beyond her shoulders he sipped watching her he didnt quite know what his own feelings were at finding her at the sink but he was well aware of hers embarrassment you didnt mention you worked here no i didnt erin slammed another plate onto the drainboard and id be obliged if you didnt either why its honest work isnt it id prefer it if dee didnt know i was washing up after her pride was another emotion he understood well all right she sent him a cautious look over her shoulder you wont tell her i said i wouldnt he could smell the detergent in the hot water despite the years that had passed it was still a scent that annoyed mm erins shoulders relaxed a bit thank you want some coffee she hadnt expected him to make it easy for her still cautious but less reserved she smiled no i havent the time she turned away again because he was much easier to look at than she wanted him to be i ah thought youd be out by now im back he said simply hed intended to grab a quick cup and leave take a leisurely walk around town or duck into the local pub for conversation he studied her her back straight at the sink her arms plunged deep into the soapy water want a hand she stared at him this time caught between astonishment and horror no no drink your coffee im sure therere muffins in the pantry if you like or you might want to go out and walk its a fine day trying to get rid of me again he strolled over and picked up a dishcloth please mrs malloy is at the market he picked up a dish and began to polish it dry he was standing close now nearly hiptohip with her erin resisted the urge to shift away or was it to shift closer she plunged her hands into the water again i dont need any help he set down the first dish and picked up another ive got nothing else to do frowning she lifted out a plate i dont like it when youre nice dont worry im not often so what else do you do except wash dishes and dance it was a matter of pride she knew but she turned to him with her eyes blazing i keep books if you want to know i keep them for the inn and for the dry goods and for the farm sounds like youre busy he murmured and began to consider are you any good ive heard no complaints im going to get a job in dublin next year in an office i cant see it she had a castiron skillet in her hand now and was tempted i didnt ask you to too many walls in an office he explained and lowered the pan into the water himself youd go crazy thats for me to worry about she gripped the scouring pad like a weapon i was wrong when i said i didnt like you when you were nice i dont like you at all you know youve only to ask and dee would take you to america she tossed the pad into the water and suds lapped up over the rim of the sink and what live off her charity is that what you think i want to take what someone is kind enough to give me no he stacked the next plate i just wanted to see you flare up again youre a bastard mr logan true enough and now that were on intimate terms you ought to call me burke theres plenty id like to be calling you why dont you be on your way and let me finish here ive got no time for the likes of you then youll have to make some he caught her off guard though she told herself later she should have been expecting it with her arms still elbow deep in water he curled a hand around her neck and kissed her it was quick but a great deal more of a threat than a promise his lips were hard and firm and surprisingly warm as he pressed them against hers for a second for two she didnt have time to react and certainly no time to think before hed released her again and picked up another dish she swallowed and beneath the soapy water her hands were fists youve a nerve you do a man doesnt get very far without anyor a woman just remember this if i want you touching me ill let you know your eyes say plenty irish its a pleasure to watch them she wouldnt argue she wouldnt demean herself by making an issue of it instead she pulled the plug on the sink ive the floor to do youll have to get your feet off it then i guess id better take that walk he laid the cloth down spread open so it would dry without another word or another glance he strolled out the back door erin waited a full ten seconds then gave herself the satisfaction of heaving a wet rag after him two hours later after a quick change into a skirt and sweater erin met the grants in the public room of the inn joes overalls were bundled into a sack tied on the back of her bike and shed used some of mrs malloys precious cream to offset the daily damage she did to her hands burke was there of course he was she thought and deliberately ignored him as he bounced young brady on his knee ma sent this erin handed dee a plate wrapped tightly in a cloth its her raisin cake she didnt want you to think mrs malloy could outcook her i remember your mothers raisin cake dee lifted the corner of the cloth to sniff now and then shed bake an extra and have one of you bring it by the farm the scent brought back memoriessome sweet some painful she covered the cake again im glad you could come with us today you remember its only on the condition that you come by and visit mas counting on it then wed best be rounding up the brood burke if you give the lad chocolate you deserve to have him smear it on you brendon keeley into the van now were going for a ride they didnt have to be told twice first they went to the cemetery where the grass was high and green and the stones weathered and gray flowers grew wild adding the promise of life some of erins family were buried there most she barely remembered shed never lost anyone close or grieved deeply but she loved deeply when it came to her family and thought she could understand how wrenching it would be to lose them yet it had been so long ago erin thought as she watched her cousin stand between the graves of her parents didnt a loss like that begin to fade with time adelia had been only a child when theyd died nine or ten wouldnt her memory of them have dimmed still though she could imagine a world away from her family she couldnt imagine one where they didnt exist it still hurts dee murmured as she looked down at the stones that bore her parents names i know travis ran a hand down her hair i remember father finnegan telling me after it happened that it was gods will and thinking to myself that it didnt seem right it still doesnt she sighed and looked up at him ill never be able to figure it out will i no he took her hand in his there was a part of him that wanted to gather her up and take her away from the grief and a part of him that understood shed been strong enough to deal with it years before theyd even met i wish id known them theyd have loved you she let the tears come but smiled with them and the children theyd have fussed over the children spoiled them more than hannah does it comforts me that theyre together i believe that you know but its painful that they missed knowing you and the babies dont cry momma keeley slipped a hand into adelias look i made a flower burke showed me he said theyd like it even though theyre in heaven dee looked at the little wreath fashioned of twigs and wild grass its lovely lets put it right in the middle like this bending she placed it between the graves aye im sure theyll like this what a strange man he was erin thought as she sat beside burke in the van and listened to brendons chattering shed seen him sit in the grass and twine twigs together for keeley though shed kept herself distant enough that she hadnt heard what hed said shed been aware that the girl had listened attentively and had looked at him with absolute trust he didnt seem to be a man to inspire trust she knew the road that led to the farm that had been the cunnanes she remembered dees parents only as the vaguest of shadows but she did remember lettie cunnane well the aunt dee had lived with when shed been orphaned shed been a tough sternfaced woman and because of her erin had kept her visits to the farm few and far between that was behind them now she reminded herself as she gestured toward the window for brendon you see just over this hill is where your mother grew up on a farm he said knowledgeably the patches of green pasture and yellow gorse meant little to him we have a farm the best one in maryland he grinned at burke as if it was an old joke itll still be the second best when im finished burke answered willing to rise to the bait royal meadows has been around for genergener generations burke supplied yeah and youre still wet behind the ears cause uncle paddy said so brendon patrick grant it was all the warning hannah had to give she turned her stern eye on burke and you should know better than to encourage him burke merely grinned and tousled the boys hair doesnt take much burke won his farm in a poker game brendon supplied as the van shuddered to a halt hes teaching me to play thats so when royal meadows belongs to you i can win that too he pushed open the sliding door then grabbed the giggling boy around the waist did he really erin asked in an undertone as hannah took keeleys hand win his horse farm gambling so im told hannah stepped a bit wearily out of the van rumor is hes lost and won more than that she glanced over as burke settled brendon on his shoulders its hard to hold it against him she wouldnt erin thought as she joined the others she was too irish to turn her nose up at a gambler especially a successful one trailing behind dee she looked over the rise to the farm below it hadnt changed much not in her memory oh the milking parlor was new and a fresh coat of paint had been slapped on the barn a year or so before it was the only farm in sight to the east the hills rose up and blocked the view the vegetable garden was already tilled and planted and a smattering of the dairy cows could be seen in the strip of pasture there was smoke spiraling out of the chimney of the little stone cottage which was a great deal like her own the good rich smell of peat carried on the wind the sweeneys are a nice family she said at length because her cousin stared down so long without speaking i know they wouldnt mind if you wanted to go down and look about no she said it too quickly then softened the refusal with a touch of her hand i dont mind looking from here the truth was she couldnt bear to go any closer to what had been and was no longer her own do you remember erin when aunt lettie was so sick and you and your mother came visiting yes you gave ma one of the roses from the bush there the bush had been her mothers erin remembered and she linked her fingers briefly with dees the roses still bloom every summer she smiled at that such a little place smaller now than even i remember look keeley see that window there she crouched down to show her daughter that was my room when i was your age adelia stood again there was only she and travis now as the others strolled down the side of the road dee ive told you before you can have it back if you want we can make the sweeneys a good offer for it she continued to look down remembering then with a little sigh she slipped an arm around traviss waist you know when i left here all those years ago i thought id lost everything she tilted her head back and kissed him i was wrong lets walk a little ways its such a beautiful day erin watched them there was a small meadow that was green now but would be choked with wildflowers in only a matter of weeks she heard burke behind her and spoke without thinking if i were to go to leave here and find something else id never look back if you dont look over your shoulder once in a while things catch up with you faster than you think i dont understand you she turned and her hair fluttered around her face and shoulders free of bonds one minute you sound like a man without any roots at all and the next you sound as though youve just transplanted them where its convenient but not too deep he caught the ends of her hair in his fingers he was becoming more and more fascinated by it it wasnt silk it was too wild and untamed for silk maybe thats the trick irish not letting them sink too deep you can yank yours up because youll damn well strangle if you dont but youll take some of this with you he reached down and took up a handful of soil seems like a good enough base and whats yours he looked down at the rich dirt in his hand have you ever seen the sand in the desert irish no no you havent its thin itll slip right out of your hands no matter how hard you hold on to it grains of sand have a habit of clinging to the skin and are easily brushed away he glanced around as brady let out a squeal of laughter at a gull that had glided in from the sea why did you kiss me before she hadnt wanted to ask rather she hadnt wanted him to know it mattered he smiled at her again slowly with the amusement only a hint in his eyes a woman should never wonder why a man kisses her annoyed with herself she shrugged and turned away it wasnt a proper one anyway you want a proper one no she continued to walk but the devil on her shoulder took over she glanced around a half smile on her face ill let you know when i do chapter here was a storm coming erin could feel it brewing inside her just as she could see it brewing in the clouds that buried the sun and hung gloomily over the hills she worked quickly routinely pulling the pins off the line and dropping the dry billowing clothes in the basket at her feet she didnt mind this kind of monotonous mindless work it left her brain free to think and remember and plan just now with the wind tossing sheets away from her and the sky boiling she liked the simple outside chore she wanted to see the storm break to be a part of it when the wind and rain raised hell when it was over things would settle back into the quiet routine she knew was slowly driving her mad what was wrong with her erin yanked one of her brothers work shirts from the line and out of ingrained habit folded it to ward off wrinkles she loved her family had friends and work to keep the wolf from the door so why was she so restless so edgy she couldnt blame it all on her cousins visit or on the unexpected appearance of one burke logan shed been feeling restless before theyd come but for some reason their presencehis presenceintensified it she couldnt talk to her mother about it erin stripped down one of her mothers aprons and buried her face in the cool fresh scent of the material her mother simply couldnt understand discontent or yearnings for more not when there was a sturdy roof over the head and food enough for everyone time and again erin had wished herself as serene a heart as her mothers but it wasnt meant to be she couldnt go to her father though erin knew he would understand the storm inside her he wasnt a calm easy man from the stories shed heard hed been a hellion in his youth and it had taken marriage to his mary and a couple of babies before hed begun to take hold but while her father would understand erin knew he would also be distressed if she wanted more needed more he would take it to mean he hadnt given her enough there was cullen shed always been able to talk to cullen but he was so busy just now and her feelings were so mixed the longings so indistinct that she wasnt sure she could articulate them in any case so she would wait let the storm come and the wind blow hed been watching her for some time burke never considered that it was rude to stand and observe people without their knowledge you learned more about people when they thought they were alone she moved well even doing something so simple there was an innate sensuality in her movements she had more fire than showed in her hair inside her there was a flame smoldering he recognized it because hed been born with one himself that kind of heat of passion could and would break free it only took the right elements falling into place time place circumstance she didnt hum as she worked now but occasionally looked up at the sky as if daring it to open and pour its fury on her her hair blew back from her face fighting against the band that held it just as she fought whatever held her hed wondered what the results would be when she finally broke free hed already decided he wanted to be around to see for himself i havent seen a woman do that for a long time erin spun around her heels digging into the soft ground a pillowcase clutched in her hand he looked so at home she thought with the collar of his jacket up against the wind the buttons undone in contradiction he had his thumbs hooked in his pockets and that damned devil smile on his face shed never known a man to look better or more suited to the raw air and the warring skies she turned away to snatch another clothespin because she knew her reaction to him would bring her nothing but trouble dont women take down the wash where you come from progress often stamps out tradition he moved to her with the easy strides of a man used to walking toward what he wanted he unhooked a cotton slipher cotton slipfolded it and dropped it in the basket erin clamped her teeth together and told herself only a foolish chucklehead would be embarrassed theres no need for you to be putting your hands on the wash dont worry theyre clean enough as if to prove it he held them out for the first time she noticed a thin jagged scar across his knuckles what are you doing here i came to see you she said nothing for a moment he didnt make it easy when he didnt invent comfortable excuses why because i wanted to he took down a pair of serviceable white panties folded those too without a blush then laid them on top of the slip erin felt a slow uncomfortable curling in her stomach shouldnt you be with travis and dee i think theyll survive the afternoon without me i liked your farm when we were here yesterday he glanced around now at the neat buildings the cottage was nearly half again as large as the one where adelia grant had grown up but the roof had the same bleached yellow thatching and sturdy stone walls there were flowers here as well the irish seemed happy to let them grow as they chosegay untamed and sturdy a hedge of wild fuchsia was already blooming it made him think of home and the snow covering the fields the roof of the barn showed fresh patching the paint on the silo was peeling and no longer white but the chickens in the coop were fat and clucking he imagined the mckinnons worked seven days a week to maintain the place such was the life of a farmer this is a fine piece of land apparently your father knows what to do with it its his life erin said simply as she took down the last of the wash what about yours i dont know what you mean he lifted the basket before she could its a good farm a good life for some you werent meant for it you dont know me well enough to say what im meant for she took the basket from him and walked toward the kitchen door but ive already told you im going north to an office job in a year or so taking a deep breath she swung the door open her mother would be horrified if she didnt ask the man in and at least offer him a cup of tea she turned to him but before she could issue the invitation he was taking the first step lets take a walk i have a proposition for you erin leaned back against the door and studied him coolly oh ill just bet you do he took the basket from her again set it inside the door and gave it a little shove youre getting ahead of yourself irish lets just say when i want you in bed i wont ask and he wouldnt she thought as they watched each other he wasnt the type to court a woman with flowers and pretty words any more than he was the type to coax a woman gently into his arms well she wasnt the type who wanted to be coaxed but neither would she be steamrollered just what is it youre wanting burke lets take a walk he repeated but this time he closed his hand over hers she could have refused but then she wouldnt know what it was he had to say erin decided that if she shook free and shut the door in his face hed tuck his hands in his pockets and stroll off leaving her the one who was fuming there was no harm in walking with him she told herself as she stepped down beside him her mother was in the house and her father along with a couple of her brothers was somewhere on the farm added to that was the fact that she had every confidence she could take care of herself i dont have much time she said briskly theres a lot more to be done today this wont take long but he said nothing more as they walked away from the house he didnt seem to look but he saw everythingthe care the sweat that went into the farm the long hours and the hope he counted thirty cows a man could make a living off less he imagined it hadnt been so many years since hed worked backbreaking hours he hadnt forgotten just as he never forgot that fate could take what he had just as easily as it had given it to him if it was a tour of the farm you were wanting erin began i had one yesterday remember he paused a moment to look out over a field he knew what it was to haul rocks from them to ride sweating over them at baling time and to curse the land as much as you worshiped it you grow grain here for the stock aye itll be plowing time soon you work the fields ive been known to burke turned her hand palmup and studied it it wasnt raw and cracked but toughened with a ridge of callus the nails were trimmed short and left unpainted you havent pampered them what good would that do me im not ashamed of the work theyve done no youre too practical for that he turned her hand over again and looked at her face youre not the kind of woman who daydreams about white knights she could smile at that though the intensity of his eyes made her uneasy ive always thought white knights would be painfully dull and the last thing i want is to be a lady in distress id rather be slaying my own dragons good i dont have much use for a woman who wants to be taken care of he still had her hand he still watched the wind whip furiously through her hair why dont you come back to america with me erin she stared at him speechless the skies opened up they were both soaked in a matter of seconds she might have stood there wideeyed and openmouthed but he grabbed her arm and yanked her inside a shed inside it was dim and smelled of soil and damp tools for the vegetable garden lined the walls her mothers peat pots and seeds were stacked on shelves waiting for planting rain beat on the tin roof and the wind snaked through the cracks in the boards and moaned erin stood shivering just inside the door her hair plastered to her head her sweater dripping at the hem but her senses had come back full force youre a madman burke logan by the saints youre as mad as a hatter do you think id just bundle up my skirts and cross an ocean with you she still shivered but the more she spoke the hotter her temper became sure and its a conceited ox you are to believe all you have to do is crook your finger to have me tagging after you i dont even know you she swiped a hand over her face to dry it then went one better and shoved him hard in the chest and its the gods truth that i have no desire to she turned to the shed door and would have yanked it open if he hadnt caught her by the shoulders take your hands off me you snake on impulse she grabbed a rake and turned on him with it touch me again and ill slice you into pieces little ones that wont be put back together easily so shed slay her dragons with a garden rake he thought lifting both hands palms out in a gesture of peace you dont have to defend your honor irish im not after ityet this is business what business would i be having with you when he took a step toward her she gestured with the rake come closer and i promise youll be missing an ear at the very least fine he made as if to take a step back then he moved quickly erin cursed him when he wrenched the rake out of her hands even as it clattered to the floor her back was against the wall youll have to learn not to drop your guard his face was close so close she could see his eyes smoky and dark and little else she twisted but his fingers only dug in harder hold still a minute will you youre making a fool of yourself nothing he could have said would have struck the light to her temper faster she all but bared her teeth and snarled therell come a time and therell come a place when youll pay for this everyone pays irish now take a deep breath shut your mouth and listen im offering you a job thats all she stopped wriggling to stare at him again i need someone sharp someone clever with figures to run my books your books the farm expenses payroll the man i had was a little too creative since hes going to be a guest of the state for the next few years i need someone else i want someone i know someone i can see and talk to handling my money rather than a big shiny company that doesnt give a damn about the farm or me because her head was whirling she took one long breath before she spoke again you want me to come to america and keep your books he smiled because she sounded almost disappointed im not offering you a free ride youre a pleasure to look at erin but at the moment all i intend to pay for is your brain move back she ordered in a voice that was suddenly firm i cant breathe with you pushing me through the wall no more attacks with garden tools her chin came up all right just move aside when he did she took a couple of deep breaths she had to keep a clear head now she didnt mind taking a new road in fact shed often fretted to do just that she only wanted to study all the curves and angles of it first you want to hire me thats right why ive just told you she shook her head still cautious you told me you need a bookkeeper i imagine therere plenty of them in america lets just say i like your style bending he picked up the rake and replaced it he wondered briefly if she would have used it yes indeed he thought grinning to himself oh yes indeed for all you know i cant add two and two mrs malloy and odonnelly at the dry goods say differently he leaned back against a workbench studying her from there he decided hed spoken no less than the truth even wet and dripping she was a pleasure to look at mrs malloy youve spoken to her you went to mr odonnelly and asked questions about me just checking your references no one told you to go poking about the town asking questions about me business irish strictly business what i found out is that youre neat as a pin and dependable your figures tally and your books are clean thats good enough for me this is crazy struggling against a surge of excitement she dragged a hand through her stilldripping hair a body doesnt hire someone theyve known only a few days irish people are hired after a tenminute interview thats not what i mean this isnt a matter of me giving you a resume then catching a bus to take a new job across town youre talking about me coming to america and taking on a job thats bigger than the inn the farm and the dry goods put together he only moved his shoulders its just a matter of more figures isnt it youre talking about going north in a year im giving you a chance to go to america now make the break its not so simple along with the excitement was a growing panic wasnt this what shed always wanted now that it was nearly as close as a handspan she was terrified its a gamble he was watching her again in that quiet intense way most things worth winning are ill pay for your ticket as a sign of good faith youll start out at a weekly salary he considered a moment then named a figure that had her mouth dropping open if it works out therell be a tenpercent raise in six months for that you take care of all the details all the figures all the bills ill want a weekly report well leave in two days two days she was numb now so numb she could only stare at him but even if i agreed i could never be ready to leave by then all you have to do is pack and say your goodbyes ill handle the rest but i you have to make up your mind erin stay or go he stepped toward her again if you stay youll be safe and youll always wonder what if he was right the question was already nagging at her if i go where will i live ive got plenty of room no on this she would have to be firm right from the start i wont agree to that i may say ill work for you but i wont live with you its your choice again he moved his shoulders as if it didnt matter hed already anticipated her balking there i dont imagine adelia would have any problem putting you up in fact i think you know shed love to have you with her it wouldnt be charity he said keeping one step ahead of her youd be bringing in a wage you could get your own place for that matter but i think youd be more comfortable with your cousin at first and our farms are close enough to make it convenient ill talk to her sometime during the last two minutes her mind had been made up she was going her bridges might not be burning behind her but they were certainly smoking ill have to speak to my family as well but id like to accept your offer she held out her hand burke took it just as casually though he wondered about the wild surge of relief that coursed through him i expect a days work for a days pay i dont doubt youll give it to me that i will im grateful for the chance ill remind you of that after youve spent a few days sorting through the mess my last bookkeeper left me with she stood very still for a moment letting it all soak in layer by layer then she spun in a quick circle and laughed i cant believe it america its like some kind of a mad dream ive hardly been more than fifty kilometers from skibbereen and now im going thousands in the blink of an eye he liked to see her this way her face flushed with pleasure her eyes lit with it and the rain still drummed on the roof it takes a bit longer than that to cross the atlantic dont be so literal but she was too excited to take offense in a matter of days ill be in a new country a new place a new job new money he started to reach for a cigar then thought better of it the money puts a gleam in your eye anyone whos ever been poor gleams a bit when theyve got enough money he acknowledged this with a nod hed been poor but he doubted erin would understand that degree of poverty he appreciated money though if he lost it as he had before he would simply shake the dust off his shoes and make more youll earn it i wouldnt be having it any other way she stopped as reality began to seep through but i need a passport and the green card that allows you to work there must be a pile of papers that have to be processed i told you id see to it he drew a paper out of his pocket fill this out and drop it off at the inn tonight its an application he explained as she studied it ive already arranged to have it processed tomorrow your passport and whatever else you need will be in cork when we get there she tapped the paper slowly against her palm you were damn sure of yourself werent you it pays to be youll need a picture they can use too a recent one what if id said no he simply smiled then youd have been a fool and id have thrown the application away i cant figure you she tucked the application in the pocket of her baggy pants but shook her head at him youve made me a very generous offer youre giving me the opportunity to do something ive wanted to do for as long as i can remember but even as youre doing it it doesnt seem to matter to you one way or the other he remembered the surge of relief but chose to ignore it things matter too much to people thats how they get hurt are you saying that things dont matter to you nothing at all what about your farm he shifted a bit surprised that the question when she asked it made him uncomfortable its a place a comfortable and fairly profitable one at the moment but thats all it is i dont have the ties to it that you have to the land here erin thats why if i leave it i will leave without a second glance when you leave ireland no matter how much you want to go youre going to hurt theres nothing wrong in that she murmured its my home its only right to miss your home some people dont make homes they just live somewhere and leave it at that she saw more clearly now though the light was still dim she saw though shed told herself she didnt care that there were places inside him no one no woman would ever touch thats a cold and sorry way to live its a choice he corrected then he pushed the subject aside make sure you get me the application tonight im leaving for cork first thing in the morning but you said we werent going for a couple of days ill meet you there all right then i should be getting along theres a lot to be done theres something else i think we should get out of the way he rocked back on his heels a moment then stunned her by grabbing both her arms and dragging her against him this has nothing to do with business infuriated she brought her hands to his chest and gave him one hard shove it didnt budge him an inch then he clamped his mouth down on hers rough and ready and with no patience at all she would have ripped and clawed at him she would have struggled and bit and cursed that was what she told herself she would have done if she hadnt been so stunned by the heat his lips were firm that she already knew but she hadnt known they could be so hot so passionate so tempting her head filled with soundslouder deeper sounds than the rain that drove furiously on the roof above her hands were trapped between their bodies so that she could feel the pounding of a heart without knowing which of them it came from this is what the apple must have tasted like when eve took the first forbidden bite she thought giddily succulent tart unbearably delicious nothing else ever tasted would be as satisfying lost in the flavor she parted her lips and let him take more hed known what hed wanted but hadnt been sure what to expect if shed hissed at him he would have ignored her and taken his fill if shed struck out at him in anger he would have taken her struggles in stride and enjoyed the fury hed fought or gambled for everything hed wanted all of his life for days hed been trying to convince himself that erin mckinnon was no different but she was she gave after the first stunned instant she gave passionately with the kind of desperation that left him shaken and edgy for more her mouth was avid and mobile her body taut and trembling he could feel the raw jagged need raging through her rising speeding up to meet and match his own he wanted to take her there on the damp floor with the smell of rain and earth everywhere he wanted her to touch him to feel those capable hands on his flesh to hear her say his name to watch her eyes go dark as midnight as he covered her body with his it could be now he could feel it in the press of her body against his in the give of her mouth it could be now there had been times and there had been women with whom he wouldnt have hesitated why he did so now he couldnt be sure but he drew her away though his hands stayed on her shoulders and his eyes stayed on hers as they slowly fluttered open she couldnt speak not for a moment the feeling was so immense it left no room for words shed never known that a body could be filled so quickly with sensations or that a mind could be emptied of them just as swiftly she knew now if anyone had told her that the world could change in the single beat of a heart she would have laughed now she understood he didnt speak erin struggled to find her footing as he kept his silence she couldnt allow herself that kind of madness not again if she were to travel an ocean with him work for him understand him just a little she couldnt let this happen again not with a man like him taking a deep breath she steadied herself no never with him if the past few moments had taught her anything it was that he was a man who knew women and who understood their weaknesses very well you had no right to do that she didnt unleash her temper knowing she hadnt the energy left for it he was shaken down to the bone down to the heart but it wasnt the time to dwell on it it wasnt a matter of right but of want that was a proper kiss irish and we needed to get it out of our systems whether you were coming with me or not she nodded hoping she sounded as casual as he shed rather have died on the spot than have admitted her own inexperience now that our systems are clear therell be no need for it to happen again dont ask me for promises youll be disappointed he strolled to the door pushing it open so that the wind and rain lashed their way in it helped cool his head and steady his heart rate you can talk to dee and travis when you bring the papers in give your family my best then he was gone into the storm though erin dashed to the door he was only a quickly fading shadow in the gloom a shadow she thought who she knew nothing about and she would be going with him to america chapter america erin wasnt naive enough to believe the streets were paved with gold but she was determined to make it the land of opportunity her opportunity it was the speed of things that struck her first the hurry every living soul seemed to be in well she was in a bit of a hurry herself she decided as she sat in the back of her cousins station wagon and tried not to gawk the cold had surprised her too a numbing bonechilling cold shed never experienced in the mild irish climate but the snow was novelty enough to make it a small inconvenience piles of it more than shed ever seen rolling over the gentle hills and heaped on the sides of the road it was a different sky above different air around her so what if she gawked erin thought to herself and she smiled as she tried to see everything at once burke had been true to his word the paperwork had gone so smoothly that in a matter of days after hed offered her the job shed been across the atlantic hed left her with her cousins family at the airport in virginia with a casual comment that hed see her in a couple of days after shed settled in just like that erin was still trying to catch her breath shed hoped hed say more shed hopedperhaps foolishlythat he would seem more pleased that she was there shed even waited to see that half smile that dark amusement in his eyes or to feel the flick of his finger down her cheek but hed only dismissed her as an employer dismisses an employee erin reminded herself that was precisely what they were now there would be no more waltzes or wild embraces did she wish there would be the devil of it was shed done just as much thinking about burke logan as she had about coming to america something had told her that they were both chances the man and the country sometime somehow shed begun to mix them together and had discovered she wanted both she knew she was being foolish again and resolved to settle for the land it was beautiful the mountains dark in the distance reminded her just enough of home to make her comfortable while the whiz of the cars beside them in three lanes were foreign enough to add excitement erin found it a palatable combination and was already hoping for more adelia shifted in her seat so that she could smile back at her cousin i remember my first day here when uncle paddy picked me up at that same airport i felt like id been plopped down in the middle of a circus ill get used to it erin smiled and took another long look out the window ill get used to it very quickly as soon as i believe im really here i for one am grateful to burke distracted a moment dee murmured to brady who was fretting in his car seat then soothed him with a stuffed dog it was never in my mind when we went to ireland that wed be bringing family back with us the guilt tingled a little shadowing the pleasure i know it was all very sudden and im beholden to you dee oh what a pack of nonsense i feel like a girl again having my best friend come to stay well have a party the minute the thought struck adelia rolled with it a proper one too dont you think travis i think we could handle it i dont want you to go to any trouble erin put in if you dont let dee go to any trouble youll break her heart travis said without embellishment they crossed over the line into maryland nearly home now love im as excited to be back as i was to leave brendon if you dont stop teasing your sister youll be seeing nothing but the four walls of your room until morning dee sighed a bit and shifted all right travis sent her a quick concerned glance theyre just active she patted his hand to make light of the discomfort probably squabbling between themselves already id like to help with the children the closer they came the more erins nerves began to jump or however else i can to pay you back for taking me in this way youre family adelia said simply then she sat up straighter as they drove between the stone pillars that led to home welcome to royal meadows cousin be happy erin didnt know what shed been expecting something grand surely she wasnt disappointed the sun shone hard on the february snow causing the thin crust to glitter and shine acres of it erin thought this world was white and gleaming even the trees were coated with it their bare black branches mantled with snow and dripping with cold clear ice like a fairyland she mused then called herself foolish when the house came into view she could only stare shed never seen anything so big or so lovely the stone rose up as sturdy as it was majestic from the white base of snow charm was added by the wroughtirontrimmed balconies that graced the windows its beautiful erin murmured its the most beautiful house ive ever seen ive always thought so too dee reached over to unhook brady as travis brought the car to a halt and its so good to see it again come now my lad were home uncle paddy from the back seat both brendon and keeley began to shout then they were out and kicking through the snow a short stocky man with wiry gray hair and a face like an elf spread his arms wide for them give me the baby missy hannah told dee youre already carrying two and well let the men handle the bags while you come in for a nice cup of tea and put your feet up stop fussing dee said then she laughed as her uncle grabbed her in a fierce hug hows my best girl fit as a fiddle and glad to be home look what we brought back with us from skibbereen still laughing she held out a hand to erin you remember erin mckinnon uncle paddy mary and matthew mckinnons daughter erin mckinnon his face seemed to scrunch together as he thought back then with a hoot he was beaming erin mckinnon is it faith lass the last time i saw you you were no more than a baby i used to raise a glass with your da now and then but you wouldnt be remembering that no but they still speak of paddy cunnane in the village do they now he grinned as if he knew exactly what was said well get inside out of the cold i can help with the bags erin began as adelia started to shoo her children indoors id appreciate it if youd go with dee let her show you your room travis was already pulling out the first of the luggage even as he set them in the drive his gaze was following his wife she doesnt like to admit she gets tired and having you to fuss over will keep her from overdoing erin stood a moment torn between carrying her own weight and doing what was asked of her all right if you like it wouldnt hurt if you told her youd like to sit down with a cup of tea quietly domineering erin thought again on impulse she leaned over and kissed traviss cheek your wifes a fortunate woman ill see that she rests without knowing shes been maneuvered into it still she picked up one of the cases and took it inside with her the warmth struck her immediately not just the change of temperature but the colors and the feel of the house itself the children were already racing through the rooms as if they wanted to make sure nothing had changed in their absence youll want to go up first see your room dee was already stripping off her gloves and laying them on an ornamental table in the hall hooking her arm through erins she started up the stairs youll tell me if it suits you or not and if theres anything else you want as soon as you feel settled in ill show you the rest erin only nodded the space alone left her speechless adelia opened a door and gestured her inside this is the guest room i wish wed had time to have some flowers for you she glanced around the room regretting she hadnt been able to add a few more personal touches the baths down the end of the hall and im sorry to say the children are always flinging wet towels around and making a mess of it the room was done in gray and rose with a big brass bed and a thick carpet the furniture was a rich mahogany with gleaming brass pulls and a tall framed mirror over the bureau there were knickknacks here and there a little china dog a rosecolored goblet more brass in a whimsical study of a lion the terrace doors showed the white expanse of snow through gauzy curtains making a dreamlike boundary between warmth and cold unable to speak erin gripped her case in both hands and just looked will it suit you youre free to change anything you like no erin managed to get past the block in her throat but her hands didnt relax on the handle of the case its the most beautiful room ive ever seen i dont know what to say say it pleasures you gently dee pried the case from her i want you to feel comfortable erin at home i knew what its like to leave things behind and come to some place strange erin took a deep breath she wasnt able to bear it not for another second i dont deserve this what foolishness businesslike dee set the case on the bed with the intention of helping her cousin unpack no please erin put her hand over dees then sat she didnt want her cousin to tire herself and she didnt want her to see what a pitiful amount shed brought with her i have to confess amused dee sat beside her do you want a priest with a watery laugh that shamed her erin shook her head ive been so jealous of you there it was out dee considered a minute but youre much prettier than i am no thats not true and thats not it in any case erin opened her mouth again then let out a long breath oh i hate confession me too sinning just comes natural to some of us erin glanced over saw both the warmth and humor and relaxed it comes natural enough to me i was jealous of you am she corrected determined to make a clean breast of it id think about you here in a big beautiful house with pretty things and pretty clothes your family all the things that go with it and id just near die with envy when i met you at the airport that day i was resentful and nervous nervous she could pass over resentment easily about seeing me erin we all but grew up together but you moved here and youre rich she closed her eyes ive a powerful lust for money a smile trembled on dees lips but she managed to control it well that doesnt seem like a very big sin to me a couple of days in purgatory maybe erin i know what is it not to have and to wish for more i dont think less of you for envying mein truth im flattered i suppose thats a sin too she added after a moments thought its worse because youre so kind to me all of you and i feel like im using you maybe you are but im using you as well to bring ireland a little closer to be my friend i have a sistertraviss sister but she moved away about two years ago i cant tell you how much i miss her i guess i was hoping youd fill the hole because her conscience was soothed by the admission erin touched a hand to dees i guess its not so bad if we use each other lets just see what happens now ill help you unpack lets leave it id really like to go down and have a cup of tea as erin rose adelia eyed her did travis tell you to keep me off my feet i dont know what youre talking about lyings a sin too dee reminded her but she smiled as she led her downstairs she dreamed of ireland that night of the heady green hills and the soft scent of heather she saw the dark mountains and the clouds that rushed across the sky ahead of the wind and her farm with its rich plowed earth and grazing cows she dreamed of her mother telling her goodbye with a smile even as a tear slid down her cheek of her father holding her so tight her ribs had ached she heard each of her brothers teasing her one by one she cried for ireland that night slow quiet tears for a land shed left behind and carried with her but when she woke her eyes were dry and her mind clear shed made her break chosen her path and shed best be getting on with it the plain gray dress she chose was made sturdily and fit well her mothers stitches were always true erin started to pin her hair up then changed her mind and tamed it into a braid she studied herself with what she hoped was a critical and objective eye suitable for work erin decided then started downstairs she heard the hoopla from the kitchen the moment shed reached the first floor at ease with confusion she headed toward it youll have plenty to tell your friends at school hannah was at the stove lecturing brendon as she scooped up scrambled eggs youve missed two weeks my lad at the kitchen table dee was fussing with a ribbon in keeleys hair theres no reason in the world you shouldnt go back to school today i have jet lag he made a hideous face at his sister then attacked the eggs hannah set in front of him jet lag is it with an effort dee kept a straight face after kissing the top of keeleys hair she nudged her daughter toward her own breakfast well if thats the truth of it i suppose we have to forget those flying lessons when youre sixteen a jet pilot cant be having jet lag maybe its not jet lag brendon corrected without missing a beat its probably some foreign disease i caught when we were in ireland bog fever erin said from the doorway clucking her tongue she walked over to rest a hand on brendons brow sure and thats the most horrible plague in ireland bog fever dee made sure there was a tremor in her voice oh no erin it couldnt be not my baby young boys are the ones who catch it easiest im afraid theres only one cure you know dee shuddered and closed her eyes oh not that poor darling poor little lad i dont think i could bear it if the boy has bog fever it has to be done erin put a hand on his shoulder for comfort nothing but raw spinach and turnip greens for ten days its the only hope for it raw spinach brendon felt his little stomach turn over he wasnt sure precisely what turnip greens were but they sounded disgusting i feel a lot better are you sure dee leaned over to check his brow herself he seems cool enough but i dont know if we should take any chances i feel fine to prove his point he jumped up and grabbed his coat come on keeley we dont want to miss the bus well if youre sure dee rose to kiss his cheek then keeleys uncle paddys going to drive you to the end of the lane its cold so stay in the car until the bus comes dee waited until the door slammed behind them before she lowered herself in the chair again and howled with laughter bog fever where in the blue heaven did you dig that up ma always used it on joe it never failed youve a quick mind hannah chuckled as she turned around what can i fix you for breakfast oh i dont if you think mrs malloy can cook wait until you taste hannahs muffins understanding her cousins embarrassment dee took the cloth off a little wicker basket why dont you have some eggs to go with it i have the appetite of a hog when im carrying and i hate to eat alone coffee hannah was by her shoulder with the pot please thank you ah is travis not up yet up and gone dee said comfortably hes been down at the stables for more than an hour when he travels on business im never sure if he misses me or the horses more she glanced at the muffins lectured herself then took another anyway after all she was eating for three brendons in the first grade now and keeley goes mornings to kindergarten so theres only brady she gestured to the high chair where he sat his face covered with oatmeal as he sang to his fingers hes the besttempered child in the world if i do say so myself now what would you like to do today actually i thought id go over to mr logans and begin work already dee smiled her thanks at hannah as the breakfast plates were set in front of them youve only just got here surely burkes willing to give you a day or two to get your bearings i know but im anxious to get started to see what there is to be done and to make certain i can do it i cant imagine burke logan putting anyone on his payroll who didnt know their business its different for me even thinking in dollars instead of pounds is different if im in the middle of it working my way out i wont worry so much about making a mess dee remembered how anxious she herself had been to begin work when shed come to america to prove to herself she was still competent and able to make her own way all right then ill drive you over myself after breakfast not on your life missy hannah said from the stove oh for pity sakes i can still fit behind the wheel of a car youre not driving anywhere until you have your next checkup and the doctor clears it paddy can take miss mckinnon dee wrinkled her nose at hannahs back but subsided im a prisoner in my own house if i go down to the stables travis has every hand on the place watching me like a hawk youd think i never had a baby before twins come early as you know very well the sooner the better then she smiled well ill just stay in and plan the party and brady and i can build block houses cant we love in answer he squealed and slapped his hand into his oatmeal after he has a bath why dont i take care of that rising erin moved over to free brady from his high chair youre not going to start pampering me too ill go mad nothing of the kind i just think its time this handsome young man and i got better acquainted by the time she was finished erin had to clean the oatmeal off herself as well bundled inside a cardigan and a coat she drove with paddy cunnane to burkes neighboring horse farm the nerves were back she could feel them tense in her fingers as she curled them together it was a waste of time to be nervous about the likes of him she told herself what had happened on that stormy morning in the shed was over and done with now they were nothing more than boss and employee hed said he expected a days work for a days pay and she intended to give it to him whatever other feelings shed had had been born of the moment lust she said firmly telling herself she was mature enough to face that as a fact of life just as she would be strong enough to resist it she was a bookkeeper now her nerves were suddenly tinged with excitement a bookkeeper she repeated silently with a good job and a good wage within the month she could start sending money home with enough left over to buy lord she couldnt begin to think what would be first paddy turned the jeep under an arch the sign was large wrought iron strong rather than fancy with its block letters three aces erin caught her lip between her teeth was that the hand hed won it with or the hand the former owner had lost it with the snow lay here as well but the rise of hill wasnt as gentle she saw a willow old and gnarled with its leaves dulled and yellow from winter perhaps in the summer it would look peaceful and lovely but for now it looked fierce then she saw the house shed thought nothing could surprise her after the grants shed been wrong it had cupolas like a castle and the stone was dull and gray the windows were arched some of them with little parapets across from the steps and circled by the drive was an oval island that was now covered with untrampled snow do people really live in places like this she said half to herself cunningham hed be the owner before logan liked to think of himself as royalty paddy sniffed but erin wasnt entirely sure if the sound was directed at the present or the former owner put more money into fancying up this place than into the stables and the stock got a pool right inside the house youre joking indeed not right inside the house now youve only to call when youve finished here ill come fetch you or one of the boys will im obliged to you but her fingers seemed frozen on the handle good luck to you lass thanks screwing up her courage she pushed out of the jeep she was grateful it stayed parked where it was as she climbed the stone steps to the front door and what a door she thought as big as a barn and all carved she ran a hand over it before she pulled back the knocker erin counted slowly under her breath and waited it was opened by a darkhaired woman with big eyes and a small erect figure erin swallowed and kept her chin up im erin mckinnon mr logans bookkeeper the woman eyed her silently then stepped back erin managed to throw a smile to paddy over her shoulder before she stepped inside by the saints she thought tonguetied again as she stood in the atrium shed never seen anything to match it with its high ceilings and lofty windows it seemed the sun shone in from all directions and slanted over the leaves of thick green plants a balcony ran all the way around in one huge circle the rail gleaming and carved as the door had been the heels of her sensible shoes clicked on the tile floor then stopped as she stood uncertain what to do next ill tell mr logan youre here erin only nodded the accent sounded spanish making her feel more out of place than ever erin wiped her hands on her skirt and thought she knew what alice had felt like when shed stepped through the looking glass are you eager to work or did you just miss me she turned knowing shed been caught gaping he was in jeans and boots and the smile was the same the confidence shed lost when shed stepped inside came flooding back it was the best defense eager to work and earn a wage the cold and excitement had heightened the color in her cheeks and darkened her eyes as she stood in the center of the big open room burke thought she looked ready and able to take on the world you could have had a day or two to settle in i could but i didnt want it im used to earning my way fine youll certainly earn it here he lifted a hand and gestured her to follow morita my last bookkeeper managed to embezzle thirty thousand before the cage shut on him in the process he made a mess of the records your first priority is to straighten them out again while youre doing that youre to keep up the payroll and the current invoices of course of course a little voice inside her said mockingly burke pushed a door open and led her inside youll work here hopefully you wont have to ask me a bunch of annoying questions but if something comes up you can call rosa on the intercom and shell pass it on to me make a list of whatever supplies you think youll need and youll have them she cleared her throat and nodded her office was every bit as large as odonnellys entire storeroom the furniture was old and glossy the carpet like something out of a palace determined not to stare again erin walked over to the desk he had been right about one thing it was a mess for the first time since shed approached the big stone house she felt relief here was something familiar ledgers and books and papers were piled together in one heap there was an adding machine but it was nothing like the clunky manual one shed used before besides the clutter there was a phone a china holder stuffed with pencils and a basket clearly marked in and out burke moved behind the desk and began opening and closing drawers youve got stamps stationery extra work sheets checkbooks since morita nothing goes out without my signature if youd taken that precaution before youd be thirty thousand dollars richer point taken he didnt add that morita had worked for him for ten years during lean times and better set your own pace as long as its not sluggish rosa will fix you lunch you can take it in here or in the dining room there may be times ill join you are you here most of the day im around he settled a hip on the corner of the desk you didnt sleep well no i but her fingers had automatically lifted to the slight smudges under her eyes the time change i guess are you comfortable at the grants aye theyre wonderful to me all of them theyre extraordinary people you wont find many like them youre not she hadnt meant to say it but told herself it was too late to be sorry she had youve an edge to you then be careful you dont get too close edges can be sharp ive already seen that for myself she said it lightly as she reached for the first stack of papers he closed his hand slowly and firmly around her wrist are you trying to provoke me irish no but i dont imagine it takes much youre right there it might be fair to tell you that i have a short fuse and a dangerous one im so warned she looked amused but when she tried to free her hand his fingers only tightened one more warning then since youve moved into our little community youll hear it from others soon enough when i find a woman who attracts me i find a way to have her fair means or foul it doesnt mean a damn to me it wasnt a warning erin realized it was a threat beneath his fingers her pulse was beating hard and fast but she kept her eyes even with his i didnt have to be told to know that nor have i any intention of attracting you too late he grinned but released her hand i find you intriguing enough to dance in the moonlight with desirable enough to kiss in a garden shed and passionate enough to imagine making love to her stomach knotted with fear with longing well a womans head could be turned clear around with such flattery mr logan tell me did you bring me to america to sleep with you or to fix your books both he said simply but well deal with business first business is all well deal with now id like to begin fine but instead of leaving he ran his hands up her arms erin stiffened but didnt back away she wouldnt play the fool and struggle though she braced herself for the hot passion shed experienced before he only brushed a kiss over her cheek hed thought of her and little else since hed come home again hed thought of how shed felt in his arms of how his system reacted when she smiled of how her voice flowed warm and sweet so that a man didnt care what the words were as long as she spoke again he knew he could have her her response had been too quick and too encompassing before for either of them to pretend otherwise he knew she wanted him though it didnt sit well with her even now as he kissed her lightly avoiding her lips her breath was beginning to tremble hed never known a woman whose passion was so close to the surface now that she was here in his home he knew he wouldnt rest until he had all of it but she would come to him his pride demanded it so he teased her with his lips knowing he stirred her he teased her with his lips knowing he was slowly killing himself fair means or foul he murmured nipping gently at her earlobe i want you her eyes were closed how was it possible to be swept away so quickly to want so desperately what you knew you shouldnt have she put a hand to his chest willing it to be steady and youre used to taking what you want i understand that i wont deny you move something in me but im not here for the taking burke maybe not he murmured some women were only there for the earning i can be patient irish when a mans got the cards hes got to know when to hold and when to lay them on the table thoughtfully he ran a finger down her braid well play out this hand sooner or later ill let you get started erin waited until hed left before she let out a long breath how was it he could be that arrogant and still make her want to smile with a shake of her head she sat behind the desk in a plush leather chair that made her sigh burke was right about one thing she mused they would play out the hand sooner or later the problem was erin was afraid that even if she won shed lose chapter within a week erin had developed a routine that pleased her in the mornings she rose early enough to help dee ready the children for school then drove a borrowed car to the three aces to report to work by nine the mess of burkes bookkeeping had been an enormous understatement so had her estimate of his wealth as she tallied figures and pored over ledgers she tried to think of it in simple practical terms numbers after all were just numbers she was rarely interrupted and took her lunch from the silent rosa at her desk by the end of the first week shed made enough headway to feel pleased with herself only once or twice had she been made to feel foolish shed had to ask burke for the instruction book on the adding machine then shed asked him to supply her with a pencil sharpener hed simply picked up a cylinder with a hole in it and handed it to her and what good is this shed demanded it doesnt even have a crank hed picked up a pencil and shoved it in the hole then damn him had laughed when shed jumped at the grinding batteries hed said not magic shed gotten over that small humiliation by burying her face in the account books maybe she wasnt used to gadgets but by the saints shed balanced his books now she sat at the little electric typewriter and wrote up her weekly report after tidying her desk erin picked up her report and went to find burke his house was still almost completely uncharted territory to her in the atrium erin hesitated she could have called for rosa on the intercom but talking into the blasted thing always made her feel foolish instead erin set off in what she hoped was the general direction of the kitchen the place went on forever she thought and found it increasingly difficult not to open doors and peek inside as she went hearing a hum she turned in that direction dishwasher she thought or a washing machine with a shrug she decided shed find rosa at the end of it the woman was a mystery erin thought as she walked rosa rarely spoke and always seemed to know precisely where to find burke though the housekeeper referred to burke as mr logan erin sensed something less formal between them shed wondered though it hadnt brought her any pleasure if they were or had been lovers pushing the thought aside she moved to the south end of the house but it wasnt the kitchen she found or the laundry room as she pushed open one of a pair of double doors erin entered the tropics the pool was an inviting blue sparkling under the sun that poured through the glass roof and walls there were trees here the likes of which shed never seen planted in huge pottery urns and flowers she stepped in farther overwhelmed by the heady scent when she could still see the snow through the glass there were rich red petals brilliant orange and yellow exotic blues if she closed her eyes she imagined shed hear the chatter of parrots paradise she thought smiling as she walked farther with his eyes halfclosed and his body just beginning to relax burke watched her she didnt look sultry like the room but fresh untouched the sun was all over her hair drawing out the fire licking at the layers of light shed pulled it back in a band as hed seen her wear it in ireland and he could remember very well too well what it felt like to run his fingers through its mass he saw her reach for a flower as if her fingers itched to pick it then draw back her hand and bury her face in the blooms instead her laugh was quiet delighted and he knew she thought herself alone so the irish rose had a weakness for flowers he thought then watched her shake her head and look wonderingly longingly around and for money at the latter he shrugged his shoulders it was difficult for someone in his position to blame her he could blame her however for the fact that his body was no longer even close to relaxing want a swim irish at the sound of his voice she whirled around shed forgotten about the hum she saw its source now and burke in the middle of it another poolno not a pool she corrected she wasnt a complete dunderhead shed seen pictures of spas with their jets and bubbles and steamy water and she couldnt help for just a moment wondering what it felt like to lower ones body into it want to join me because he grinned when he said it erin merely shrugged thank you but ill be leaving for home in a few minutes ive finished for the day and brought you your first report he nodded but merely gestured to a white wicker chair beside the spa have a seat biting off a sigh erin did as he asked you may be a man of leisure yourself but ive things to do burke stretched his arms along the edge of the spa he didnt mention that hed been up and at the stables since dawn or that hed strained every muscle in his body overseeing the mating between a stud and a particularly highstrung mare youve still got a few minutes on the clock irish so how are my finances youre a rich man mr logan though how that might be with the mess your books were in amazes me ive done a bit of studying and come up with a new system the truth was shed spent two nights burning the midnight oil with books on accounting if you like ill wait until youve finished and go over it with you itll keep suit yourself by the end of next week i should have everything running smoothly enough thats good to know why dont you tell me how he stretched his shoulders erin watched the muscles ripple along the damp skin then deliberately shifted her gaze above his head this was no place for her to be she told herself especially when her mind was wandering away from accounting its all in this report if youd care to pull yourself out of the tub there and have a look at it have it your way burke pushed the button that shut off the jets then stood erins limbs went weak as she saw he wore no more than hed been born with she was grateful color didnt rise to her cheeks though she couldnt prevent some from leaving burke took a towel and swung it easily over his hips as he stepped from the spa youve no shame burke logan none at all well if youd meant to shock me ill have to disappoint you ive four brothers if youll remember and she glanced over again prepared to look at him without interest it was then she noticed the darkening bruise just under his left ribs youve hurt yourself she was up immediately and laying gentle fingers on it oh its a nasty one without thinking she took her fingers up over his ribs carefully checking you didnt break anything not so far he murmured he was standing very still the amusement hed felt completely wiped out her fingers felt so cool so tender on his skin she touched him as if she cared that was something hed learned to live a long time without itll look worse yet tomorrow she said with a cluck of her tongue you should put some liniment on it then she realized her fingers were spread over his chest and his chest was hard and smooth and wet erin snatched her hand away and stuck it behind her back howd you come by it the new colt i picked up in ireland she closed her hand into a fist it was damp from his skin youll have to give him more room next time the shudder inside her came as no surprise and was quickly controlled i intend to i have the highest respect for the irish temper and so you should if youd look over the report now i could answer any questions you might have before i leave burke picked up the neatly typed sheets erin found it necessary to clear her throat as she turned to look out through the glass now lightly fogged from the steam of the spa but she didnt see the snow she could still see himthe long arms roped with muscle the hard chest glistening with water the narrow hips leading to taut thighs a fine specimen some would have said herself included and she could have murdered him for making her want it seems clear enough she jolted a bit then cursed herself you know your business erin but then i wouldnt have hired you if i hadnt believed that no he wouldnt have but hed have found some other way to bring her back with him got anything in mind for your first paycheck a thing or two she relaxed enough to smile at him schooling her gaze to go no lower than his neck half the money would be on its way to ireland in the morning and the rest she couldnt begin to think of it if youre satisfied ill be going home now im a long way from satisfied burke said under his breath listen did you ever think the bookkeeping would be more interesting if you knew more about the stables the racing no then she moved her shoulders as the thought hed planted took root i suppose it might though ive got a horse running tomorrow why dont you come along see where the money comes from and where it goes go to the races she caught her lip between her teeth as she thought of it could i bet theres a woman after my heart be ready at eight ill take you around the stables and paddock first all right good day to you she started out then glanced over her shoulder id put some witch hazel on that bruise erin paced the living room it was her first day off and she was going to spend it at the races there would be mobs of people shed never met shed hear dozens of voices for the first time she ran a hand down her hair and hoped she looked all right not for burke she thought quickly for herself that was all she wanted to look nice to feel she looked nice when she stood in the midst of all those people the minute she heard burkes car she was racing out of the house she hesitated on the steps staring down at the firered sports car with its long sleek hood she made a mental note of the make so she could write home and tell brian youre prompt burke commented as she climbed in beside him im excited it didnt seem foolish to admit it now ive never been to the races before cullen has and he told me the horses are beautiful and the people fascinating faith look at all these dials she studied the dash youd have to be an engineer to drive it want to try when she glanced at him and saw he was serious she was sorely tempted but she remembered all the cars that had been on the highway when theyd driven from the airport ill just watch for now when does the racing start weve got plenty of time hows dee shes fine the doctor gave her a clean checkup but told her she had to stay off her feet a bit she grumbles because she cant spend as much time down at the stables but were keeping her busy the snows melting a few more days like weve been having and itll be gone i hope not i like to look at it she settled back deciding that riding in the sports car was like riding on the wind are you going to be warm enough she asked looking at his light jacket and jeans theres still a bite in the air dont worry so what do you like best about america so far besides the snow the way you talk she said instantly talk you know the accent its charming charming he glanced over at her then laughed until the bruise began to throb still chuckling he rubbed a hand over it absently is that troubling you what this no did you use witch hazel he knew better than to laugh again i couldnt put my hands on any id imagine youd have a case or two of horse liniment down in the stables oh look at the little planes when he turned into the airport she looked over at him what are we doing here taking a ride on one of the little planes her stomach did a quick flipflop but i thought we were going to the races we are my horse is racing at hialeah thats in florida whats florida burke paused in the act of swinging his door closed on the other side of the car erin stared at him south he told her and held out a hand too excited to think too terrified to object erin found herself bundled onto a plane the cabin was so small that even she had to stoop a bit but when she sat the chair was soft and roomy burke sat across from her and indicated the seat belt once hers was secured he flipped the switch on an intercom were set here tom okay mr logan looks like smooth sailing skies are clear except for a little patch in the carolinas we ought to be able to avoid most of them when she heard and felt the engines start erin gripped the arms of the chair are you sure this things safe lifes a gamble irish she nearly babbled before she caught the amusement in his eyes deliberately she made her hands relax so it is as the plane started to roll she looked out the window within minutes the ground was tilting away under them its quite a sight isnt it she smiled leaning a little closer to the window when all of you landed in cork i looked at the plane and wondered what it would be like to sit inside now i know how is it she gave him a sideways smile well theres no champagne there can be at half past eight in the morning with a laugh she sat back again i think not i should have thanked you for asking me to go today the grants have been nothing but kind to me so im really grateful to give them a day to themselves is that the only reason you should have thanked me he stood and went into a little alcove no i appreciate the chance to go you want cream in this coffee aye he could have said youre welcome she thought then let it pass nothing was going to spoil her mood when he sat she took the cup but was too wound up to drink will you give me an answer if i ask a question thats none of my business burke drew out a cigar then lit it ill give you an answer but not necessarily the truth he kicked out his legs then rested his ankles on the seat beside her did you really win three aces in a poker game he blew out smoke yes and no thats not an answer at all yes i played poker with cunninghamquite a bit of poker with cunninghamand he lost heavily when you gamble you have to know when to stick and when to walk away he didnt so you won the farm from him shed like that he thought watching her eyes he imagined she saw a smoky liquorscented room with two men bent over five cards each and the deed to the farm between them in a manner of speaking i won money from him more money than he had to lose he didnt have enough cash to pay me or for that matter to pay certain other parties who were growing tired of holding ious in the end i bought the farm from him dirt cheap oh it wasnt quite as romantic you must have been rich before then you could say my luck was on an upswing at the time gamblings no way to make a living it beats sweeping floors since she could only agree erin fell silent a moment did you know about horses before i knew they had four legs but when youve got your money riding on a game you learn fast where did you learn to keep books arithmetic came easily to me when i could i took courses in school then i started to run the books at the farm it was more satisfying than morning milking then because everyone knows what everyone else is up to back home i found myself working for mrs malloy then mr odonnelly i worked for francis duggan at the market for a time too but his son donald thought i should marry him and have ten children so i had to let that job go you didnt want to marry donald duggan and spend my life counting potatoes and turnips no thank you it came to the point where i knew i had to either black both his eyes or give up the job it seemed easier to give up the job what are you smiling at i was just thinking that donald duggan was lucky you didnt carry a rake erin tilted her head as she studied him its you whore lucky i held myself back comfortable now she tucked her legs under her and sipped her cooling coffee tell me about the horse youre racing today double bluff hes a twoyearold temperamental and nervy unless hes running hes proved himself from his first race took the florida derby last weekend thats the biggest purse in the state aye i heard travis mention it he seems to think this horse is the best hes seen in a decade is it might be in any case hell be my derby entry this year his sire won over a million dollars in purses in his career and his dam was the offspring of a triple crown winner likes to come from behind on the outside he took another puff and again erin noticed the scar along his knuckles you sound as though youre fond of him he was and that fact was a constant surprise burke only shrugged hes a winner what about the one you bought in ireland the one who kicked you im going to start him off locallycharles town laurel pimlico so i can keep an eye on him if my hunch is right hell double what i paid for him in a year and if your hunch was wrong they arent often in any case id still consider my trip to ireland paid off she wasnt completely comfortable with the way he looked at her being a gambler she said evenly youd know how to lose i know how to win better she set her coffee down how did you get the scar on your hand he didnt glance at it as most people would but tapped out his cigar as he watched her broken bottle of texas star in a bar fight outside of el paso there was a disagreement over a hand of sevencard stud and a pretty blonde did you win the hand the woman wasnt worth it i suppose it makes more sense to gash your hand open over a game of cards than it does for a woman depends on what the woman on the game irish it always depends on the game when they arrived erin stepped off the plane into another new world burke had told her to leave her coat on the plane but even so she hadnt been expecting the warmth or the glare of the sun palm trees she managed then laughed and grabbed burkes hands those are palm trees no fooling before she had a chance to be annoyed he swung an arm over her shoulders and swept her away there was a car waiting for them erin slipped inside wanting to pretend she did such things every day theres no handle for the window she began burke leaned over and pressed the button to lower it oh after ten seconds she gave up trying to be poised i cant believe it its so warm and the flowers oh my mother would die for the flowers its like that room in your house with all the glass two weeks ago i was scrubbing mrs malloys floor and now im looking at palm trees he drove competently without asking directions or checking a map erin realized this life wasnt new to him here she was babbling and sounding like a fool she made one attempt to restrain herself then gave it up it didnt matter how she sounded he hadnt realized hed get such enjoyment out of seeing someone take little things and make them special for a moment he wished they could just keep driving so that she would go on talking laughing asking questions hed nearly forgotten there were people who could still find things fresh and new no matter how often theyd been used traveling was a profession to him and like most professional travelers hed long ago stopped looking at what was around him now with erin pointing out white sand young skateboarders and towering hotels he began to remember what it was like to see something for the first time they knew him at the track erin noticed as they walked over the green lawn toward the spread of stables that people nodded in his direction or greeted him as mr logan there were jockeys and trainers and grooms already preparing for the afternoon races logan erin glanced over and saw a big potbellied man in a straw hat she saw the flash of a diamond on his finger and the light film of sweat the heat had already drawn on his face durnam didnt know you were coming down for a looksee i like to keep an eye on things your horse ran well last week at charles town i didnt know you were there i wasnt erin mckinnon charlie durnam he owns durnam stables in lexington real horse country maam he took her hand and flashed her a smile a pleasure a real pleasure nobody picks the fillies like logan i wont be running any races mr durnam she told him but she smiled judging him harmless from ireland are you shes adelia grants cousin burke spoke mildly giving durnam a straight look until he released erins hand well aint that something i tell you maam any friend of the grants is a friend of charlie durnams fine people thank you mr durnam im going to go check on my horse charlie see you around take a look at charlies pride while youre at it he called after them thats a real piece of horseflesh what a funny man erin murmured that funny man has one of the best stables in the country and a roving eye she glanced back over her shoulder and chuckled his eye can rove all it pleases i cant imagine he has much luck on a landing youd be surprised the kind of luck ten or fifteen million can buy burke nodded to a groom im running against him today is that so erin tossed her hair back and was sure the sun had never shone brighter then youll just have to beat him wont you with a grin burke put his arm around her shoulders again i intend to he walked by a few stalls erin cautiously kept on the far side of him the smell of horse and hay was familiar and so was the little knot in her stomach ignore it she told herself stepping up beside burke as he stopped at a stall this is double bluff she judged the dark bay to be about fifteen hands broad at the chest and streamlined for speed the beauty of him struck her first then she froze when he tossed his head hes a big one her throat had gone bonedry but she forced herself to take one step closer ready to win with a laugh burke reached up to stroke his nose the colts ears came forward in acknowledgment but he continued to prance impatient this one hates to wait hes an arrogant devil and i think he might just win three aces its first triple crown what do you think of him hes lovely erin had taken a step backward the first time the colt had looked in her direction im sure hell do you proud lets have a closer look make sure the grooms done his job burke opened the stall door and stepped in erin steeled herself and with her heart pounding walked to the opening you look good fella burke ran his hands over the colts flank then dipped under him to check the other side he lifted each hoof then nodded in approval clean as a whistle wait until they put a saddle on him the minute they do hes ready you have to hold him back from the starting gate as if he understood double bluff pawed the ground he tossed up his head and whinnied as burke laughed erin fainted dead away when she surfaced there was an arm supporting her something cool and wet was being urged through her lips she swallowed reflexively then opened her eyes what happened you tell me burkes voice was rough but the hand that stroked her cheek was gentle probably too much sun erin heard the drawled pronouncement and shifted her gaze beyond burkes shoulder she saw a young face and a thatch of sandy hair thats right she said grabbing the excuse im fine now just sit still burke held her down as she tried to get up its okay bobby ill handle it from here yes sir mr logan you take it easy now miss stay in the shade thank you oh erin closed her eyes and cursed herself for seven kinds of a fool im sorry i caused a scene i dont know what could have happened you were fine one minute and in a heap the next and nothing absolutely nothing in his life had ever scared him so badly youre still pale why dont we take bobbys advice and get you up and into some shade aye she let out a breath of relief just as burke started to help her up double bluff stuck his head out again and shook the stall door with a muffled cry erin threw her arms around burkes neck and clung it took him only a moment to put one and one together for gods sake erin why didnt you tell me you were afraid of horses im not nitwit he muttered hauling her unceremoniously into his arms dont carry me ive had enough humiliation already shut up when he judged they were far enough away from the stables he set her down under a palm if youd had the brains to tell me you wouldnt have shaved ten years off my life with another oath he dropped down beside her his heart had yet to resume its normal rhythm the last thing im wanting from you is a lecture she would have stood and stormed away but she knew her legs werent ready to carry her besides there was nothing to tell i thought i was over it you thought wrong then because she was still pale he relented and took her hand why dont you tell me about it its childish tell me anyway we had some field horses two good ones she let out a long breath he could hardly think her any more of a fool then he did now we had them out and a storm was coming up brian unhooked the one to take him back to the barn there was a lot of thunder and lightning so the horses were nervous joe was unhooking the second and i was at the head trying to calm him i dont know it happened fast lightning spooked him and he reared god those hooves are big when theyre over your head she shuddered once i fell and he ran right over me oh god burke tightened his fingers on her hand i was lucky it wasnt that bad a couple of broken ribs only bruises but ive just never been able to get too close to one without panicking if youd told me i never would have brought you i thought id beaten it by now it was more than five years ago stupid she ran a hand over her face then tucked back her hair ive been making excuses all week to dee and travis why i dont go down to the stables why dont you just tell them when she only shrugged he shifted closer its not half as stupid to be afraid as it is to be ashamed of it her chin came up then she sighed maybe avoiding his eyes she plucked a blade of grass dont tell them more secrets patiently he caught her chin in his hand and turned her face to his it was far more difficult to resist her now when her cheeks were pale her eyes a little damp and the vulnerability like a sheen on her skin you shouldnt worry so much about what people think of you i know you wash dishes and faint at the sight of horses but i still like you do you a reluctant smile tugged at her mouth really well enough unaccustomed to resisting any desire for long he lowered his mouth to hers to taste to nibble to explore she lifted a hand to his chest as if to hold him off but then her fingers simply curled into his shirt and held him there his other kisses hadnt made her feel peaceful or secure anything but yet this one was different even as excitement shimmered warm in her stomach she felt safe maybe it was the way his hand curved around her neck with his fingers gentle and soothing or maybe it was the way his lips made hers feel soft and tingly he wanted to draw her close to cuddle her to rock her on his lap and murmur foolish things hed never had that urge with a woman before it was an odd and uneasy sensation and at the same time comforting he drew away slightly but kept her close ill take you home home but i want to see the races for some reason she felt as though she could face anything at that moment im fine i promise you besides maybe if i can learn to watch them from a distance i wont freeze up when im near one she stood grateful that her legs were sturdy again come now burke we didnt fly all the way towhere are we florida he told her and rose aye florida to turn right around and go home again that great beast in there is going to win isnt he ive got my money on him and ive got ten more on the nose with a laugh he accepted the hand she held out lets go get a seat the stands were already filling up in them erin indeed saw many faces tanned and sunburned ones faces with lines spreading out from the eyes and more with skin as smooth as new cream some people pored over racing forms others smoked fat cigars or sipped from plastic cups but in the boxes was elegance the kind that spoke of confidence and poise sheer summer dresses in pastels mixed well with light cotton suits and straw hats she saw more than one tanned slender woman tilt a head in burkes direction now and then he lifted a hand but he made no effort to mix with them from burkes box in the front she could see the wide brown oval where the horses would ran and the lush green infield filled with tropical flowers and pink flamingos still farther away were more stands with more people every minute more were filing in ive never seen so many people in one place at one time and theyre all here to watch the race want a beer erin nodded absently and continued to take in everything as burke left her she spotted durnam not far away talking to a woman in the tiniest pair of shorts erin had ever seen erin passed over him and looked at the electronic board that was beginning to flash with numbers and odds for the first race i want you to explain to me what it all means up there erin began before burke had a chance to sit down again so ill know best how to bet if you want a tip youll wait for the third race bet on number five why the horse is out of royal meadows sentiment aside hes a strong runner records a little shaky but he looks good today first race is anybodys game so far the odds arent spectacular are you betting on it no i thought you were a gambler i like to pick my own game erin sat back and listened to the announcements for the first race crystal maiden sounds pretty pretty names dont win races hold on to your money irish she settled back and contented herself with absorbing the sounds and sights around her by the time the horses were brought to the starting gate she was leaning forward in her chair they are beautiful she said but she felt a great deal better when burkes hand rested lightly on hers her pulse was hammering he gauged it to be almost as much from excitement as nerves hed been right about the contradictions in her as the gates opened her fingers linked hard with his but she didnt cringe what a noise she murmured while her heart beat almost as loudly as hooves on turf as they rounded the first turn she strained to keep following them that was power she thought both raw and controlled they might well have made it a business but she could see why it had been and was still the sport of kings when it was over she laid a hand on her breast my hearts still pounding dont smile at me like that she warned but laughed with it its the most wonderful thing ive ever seen all those colors all that energy can you imagine doing this every day there are plenty who do but she only shook her head today was special a onceinalifetime day i want to bet on the next one third race burke repeated and sipped his beer when her time came she insisted on betting herself erin put the stub in the pocket of her shirt then changed her mind and tucked it carefully in her billfold seated beside burke again she fretted until the horses were brought to the gate i dont mind losing she said with a quick grin but id sure as hell like to win better when they were off she stood and leaned against the rail which one is he she demanded grabbing burkes hand to drag him forward with her fourth back on the inside redandgold silks aye she watched urging him on he runs well doesnt he yes oh look hes moving up better hang on irish theyve got half a mile to go but hes moving up she gave a hoot of laughter as she pointed hes in second now there was shouting all around her competing with the announcer and the thundering of hooves erin strained to hear all three as she grabbed burkes shirt and tugged hes taken the lead look at him she spun away from the rail and into burkes arms as he finished half a length ahead he won won laughing she kissed burke hard how much mercenary little witch its nothing to do with mercenary and everything to do with winning im going home and tell dee i bet on her horse and won how much the odds were five to one fifty dollars she gave another peal of laughter ill buy the next beer she took him by the hand when does your horse race in the fifth thank goodness itll give me time to recover she bought him a beer then went one better and bought them both hot dogs the only time she could remember spending such a frivolous day was at a fair this seemed like one to her with the noise and smells and colors she had another ticket in her pocket and burkes sunglasses on by the time the fifth race was announced i really hope he wins she told him with her mouth full not just because i bet on him either that makes two of us how does it feel to own one she wondered not just a horse but a horse from a great line most of the time its like having an expensive lover one you have to keep happy and lavish money on for moments of intense gratification erin turned and tipping the glasses down looked at him over them youre full of blarney at the very least he turned and watched his horse charge through the gate how did it feel burke asked himself how did it feel for a dirtpoor bastard from new mexico to sit and watch his sixfigure horse come flying by incredible so incredible he couldnt begin to describe it and wasnt sure he wanted to it could all be gone tomorrow and what of it hed taught himself long ago that when you held on to something too tightly it squeezed through your fingers he was giving three aces the best he had though hed never intended to get involved with the running of it hed certainly never intended to get attached to it he worked better on the move yet hed been in one place for four years just recently hed been telling himself that maybe it was time for him to get a manager for the place and take an extended vacation monte carlo san juan tahoe if a man stuck with one game too long didnt he get stale but then hed gone to ireland and had come back with erin the damnedest thing was he wasnt thinking about monte carlo or playing the wheel anymore it was becoming easier and easier to stay in one place and think about one woman you won suddenly she was laughing and her arms were around his neck you won by two lengths maybe three i couldnt tell oh burke im so pleased for you are you hed forgotten the race the horse and the bet of course i am its wonderful that your horse won and he looked so beautiful doing it and im happy for me too she grinned the odds were eight to five then he stunned her by dragging her closer and kissing her with a power and passion that left her limp she didnt protest but held trapped in his arms allowed herself to be buffeted by the storm the hell with the odds burke muttered and kissed her again chapter one didnt know what to think no one could have been kinder than burke the day erin had spent with him shed watched the races the strong beautiful horses striving for speed shed seen women dressed in elegant clothes and jockeys in brilliant silks shed heard the noises that came from thousands of people in the same place shed seen exotic birds and flowers had sipped champagne in a private plane but her clearest memory of the day was of sitting on the grass in burkes arms she didnt know what to think since then the days had passed routinely erin had to remind herself she was doing exactly what shed set out to domaking a wage starting a life seeing new things but burkes visits to her office had become few and far between she began to catch herself watching the door and wishing it would open she told herself that her feelings for him were surface ones he made her laugh showed her exciting things and could be kind enough when it suited him he was just arrogant enough to keep an edge on without alienating her a woman could like a man like that without putting her heart at risk couldnt she a woman could even kiss a man like that without falling too deep wasnt that right and yet she knew shed come to the point where she thought of him a bit too easily and watched for him far too often hed stayed away from her long enough that was what burke told himself as he came in through the back of the house from the stables hed stayed away from her since their quick trip to florida because his feelings were mixed he was used to clear thinking and welldefined emotions not this jumbled mess of needs and restraint he couldnt stop thinking about the way shed looked at the track watching the horses race by shed been vivid excited exciting the kind of woman he could handle yet he couldnt stop thinking about the way shed looked when shed fainted all but at his feet shed been pale and helpless frightened hed needed to protect and soothe hed never wanted the responsibility of a woman who needed protection or care yet he wanted erin she wasnt the kind of woman you took to bed for a night of mutual enjoyment then strolled away from yet he wanted her for all her strong talk she was a woman who would put down roots and sink them deep hed never wanted the restriction or the responsibility of a home in the true sense yet he still wanted erin mckinnon and hed stayed away from her long enough when he walked into the office she was marking in the ledger in her clear careful hand she knew it was himeven without looking she knewbut made herself finish before she glanced up hello i havent seen much of you lately ive been busy thats clear from the papers on my desk ive just paid your vet bill dr harrigan back home could live a year off what you pay a month are the new foals well theyll do i see youve hired a new stable boy my trainer sees to the hiring erin lifted a brow so he was going to play master of the estate was he i see your ante up ran well at santa anita reading the sports page these days i figure living with the grants and working for you i should keep up erin picked up her pencil again now that weve had such a pleasant little talk ill get back to work unless theres something youre wanting come with me what i said come with me before either of them had a chance to think it through he took her arm and hauled her to her feet wheres your coat why where are we going instead of answering he glanced around and spotted it folded on a chair put this on he told her then even as he thrust it at her he began to walk a fine thing erin began breathlessly as he pulled her down the hall interrupting my work in the middle of the day dragging me off without any explanation just because you pay me burke logan doesnt mean i have to jump at your bidding an employee has rights in this country which reminds me ive been meaning to ask you about my paid holidays you learn fast he muttered as he pushed the door open if you dont let go of my arm i wont be able to put it in my coat when he did erin rammed her arm in the sleeve but left the coat unbuttoned sure and its a fine day the grounds a bit of a mess with the snow melting but thats all the better for spring growing if that was all you wanted to show me ill go back to work she managed to hiss out a protest when he grabbed her arm and began walking again burke what the devils got into you if theres something you want me to do or see fine but theres no need to strongarm me how long have you been working for me three weeks giving up erin matched her stride to his and in three weeks youve barely poked your head out of the office i work in the office she reminded him did it ever occur to you that you cant understand the work if youve never looked at where the money comes from or where it goes i thought thats why we went to the races theres more to this place than one race why do i have to understand as long as the figures tally he wasnt sure of the answer himself but he knew he wanted her to see what was his to understand it to move closer to it pushing the hair out of her eyes she glanced up at him his profile was set and she thought she detected a shadow in his eyes is there something troubling you no he said it sharply almost defensively then made himself relax no nothing except the need tethered tight inside him that strained hard at the scent of her what the hell was happening to a man who could only think of one woman of one voice of one taste she continued to walk beside him in silence but she noticed the crocusesbig fat purple ones that pushed their way up through the soggy ground unmindful of the patches of snow she saw the way the land sloped the way the sun slanted over it and she saw the stables with their white wood gleaming in the sunlight she saw the checkerboard of paddocks and the long oval track where even now a horse was being ridden why its lovely she murmured like something out of a book you must be proud that its yours he wasnt sure he had been but he stopped and looked out as she did hed won it fairly but then hed won and lost a great deal in his life it had never been his intention to stay but rather reorganize so that the gamble paid off hed come into this knowing little about horses and nothing about racing or breeding and had told himself hed better learn in order to turn a true profit that had been four years ago and he was still here looking out with erin beside him he began to understand why it was lovely it was his and it was and would always be a gamble keeping erins hand in his he began to walk again weve got thirty horses two of which are studs that do nothing but please the ladies and themselves erin added two of the mares just foaled and weve two more that are due any day nearly half of whats left are being trained for next year at the moment ive got five prime twoyearolds and a few veterans that have another season or two in them before they go out to stud or retirement there you see the horse being exercised now thats one of the pair i picked up in ireland erin looked back at the track the rider was up in the stirrups and bent low but he earned no more than a glance the horse was magnificent a chestnut with a slash down his face like white lightning already his legs were spreading out in a rhythm that picked up speed and pounded on the soggy track hes fast and mean as hell that would be the one that kicked you erin looked back again beautiful he might be but shed keep her distance if hes badtempered why did you buy him i liked his style as he started to walk again erin held back id just as soon not be on closer acquaintance i want to show you something else erin told herself to relax as she walked with him if youd told me we were going tramping around the yard id have worn boots he glanced down but kept walking you could use some new shoes anyway thank you very much id have thought youd have gone shopping by now with a couple of paychecks under your belt im thinking about it they passed the stables where the scent of horses and wet grass was strong she could hear men talking inside erin braced herself but he continued to walk then she saw the paddock where the mare was standing nursing a fawncolored foal thats one of the newest residents of three aces cautiously erin approached the fence theyre sweet when theyre little arent they she relaxed enough to curl her hands over the top rail and lean a little closer the air was mild with just a hint of spring it wasnt the green or the scent of ireland but she found herself suddenly content we never had much time to think of an animal as any more than a means to an end she smiled as the foal burrowed deeper and sucked joe was always the one for animals cooing at them and stroking hed love to see this you miss your family its strange not seeing them every day i hadnt realized she let the words trail off word from home is everyones fine cullens back in dublin playing at one of the clubs and brians taken a fancy to mary margaret shannesy ma says hes making a fool of himself but thats to be expected the foal having had his fill began to scamper around the paddock erin watched him absently thinking of home franks wifes nearly ready to have the baby i could be an aunt already its funny most mornings when i wake up i think its time to go down to the henhouse but theres no henhouse here the foal came over to the fence to sniff at her without thinking erin reached out a hand and rubbed between his ears do you wish there were i suppose i could live my life happily enough without gathering eggs again she glanced down and focusing on the foal started to draw her hand back automatically burke set his on top of hers and rested it on the foals head trusting little soul isnt he aye but his mother is probably relieved that hes distracted for a few minutes sometimes if youre afraid its best to face it in small doses i suppose the foal was soft as butter and nuzzled its nose between the rails to nip at her coat find something else to chew on she said laughing its all i brought with me finding nothing of interest the foal scampered away to race around his mother will he be a champion if its in the cards erin stepped away from the fence and dipping her hands in her coat pockets looked at him why did you bring me out here i dont know he didnt think about the men walking around the yard and going in and out of the stables he thought only of her as he lifted a hand to her cheek why should it matter had it come so far so fast that it only took the touch of his fingers on her skin to send her heart racing inside her pockets the palms of her hands grew damp i think it does and i think i should go back in youve faced one fear today why not face another im not afraid of you that was true and she felt a surge of relief that it was her heart might not be steady but it wasnt in fear that it raced maybe not he slid his hand from her cheek to the back of her neck as he drew her closer he was afraid afraid of what she was doing to him without his planning without his calculations she yearned toward him she strained away i dont think its wise for you to kiss me that way again all right well try another way so he nibbled teasing tempting tormenting she felt the scrape of his teeth then the moist trace of his tongue her hand went to his cheek and rested there as she opened herself for an emotional assault like nothing shed ever experienced so he could be sweet and patient and alluring she hadnt known her fingers crept into his hair as her lips parted and invited no she wasnt afraid not of him if what he brought to her was more than shed ever imagined then she was willing even eager to accept it with a sigh she tilted her head back and let him take he held himself back the more generosity she showed him the more wary he became of accepting burning inside him was a desire to sweep her away to some dim private place where they could both take their fill to touch her he pressed his lips over hers and imagined how it would be to fill his hands with her no barriers while her teeth nipped gently he imagined what it would feel like to have her flesh slide warm over his there was such a flavor here warm and wild and willing but he wanted more than her mouth as her sigh whispered into him he knew he needed more he took his hand to her hair and held her close against him i want you to stay with me tonight stay she floated up out of the dream and was stunned by the heat and passion that had turned his eyes to smoke stay he repeated tonight damn it more than tonight get your things and bring them here the thrill moved through her there was something in the command in the look in his eyes as he gave it that called to her even as it raised her hackles move in with you she lifted her hands to his chest and struggled to keep her voice calm you want me to live under your roof eat your food sleep in your bed i want you with me you know damn well ive wanted that since the first time i put my hands on you aye maybe i did but what i agreed to do was work for you she tilted her head back again but not in surrender this time yes shed been willing to accept the feelings he stirred in her but not to compromise her principles for them do you think id be your mistress do you think id let you keep me in your fine house no ones talking about keeping no youre not a man for keeping are you but for taking enjoying and moving on ill tell you now no matter how you make me feel how you make me want ill not be any mans mistress it was foolish to be hurt ridiculous to be insulted but she was both erin jerked out of his hold and stood with her feet planted if i kiss you its because it pleasures me to do so and nothing more ill not live in your house shaming my family until youre tired of me she tossed back her hair and crossed her arms ill be going back to work now and youd best keep out of my way unless you want to explain to your men why the payroll isnt done she turned on her heel and strode away burke leaned back against the paddock fence a smart man would have folded his cards and pushed away from the table he figured hed stay for the next hand and see where the chips fell whether she was feeling festive or not erin was swept along in her cousins plans for the party and what better day to celebrate than st patricks day erin decided if thered been a dog around shed surely have kicked it no come live with me and be my love from the likes of burke logan she thought she attacked a silver platter with a polishing cloth as though she could have rubbed through the metal oh no with him it was just pack your things and be quick about it hah as if shed want pretty words from that swine of a man the truth of it was erin mckinnon didnt want pretty words from anyone what she wanted was to be left alone to pursue her new career in six months shed have a place of her own and a new job altogether she decided shed find a job where she didnt have to put up with a man who made her laugh one minute and steam the next and steam in more ways than one she added as she tossed the polishing cloth aside turning the platter over she studied her own reflection he was toying with her he was hadnt she known that right from the beginning well what was fine for him was fine for her she could do some toying herself and tonight was as good a time as any to start it from what dee had told her there would be plenty of men at the party tonight including a certain snake in the grass have you finished scowling at yourself from the other side of the table dee set aside another tray almost thats good then because weve only a couple more hours rising she stacked the bowls and platters beside the crystal between hannah and the caterers the rest could be easily handled is there anything youd like to talk to me about no nothing that might have to do with why youve been muttering to yourself for the past week or so erin set her teeth then dropped her chin on her hand i think american men are even more rude and arrogant than irish men ive always thought it was a draw adelia came over to lay a hand on her shoulder has burke been troubling you to say the least something in the way erin said it caused dee to smile he has a way with him not my way well then we wont be worrying about him anymore weve a party to get ready for erin nodded as she rose shed known she was in trouble as soon as shed seen the silver and crystal things had only gotten worse when shed watched the team of caterers descend to fuss over things like salmon mousse and gooseliver pate shed seen the cases of champagne delivered cases by god then there was the black caviar shed managed to sample while no one was looking and there were the flowers tubs of them that were being arranged even as she walked with dee down the hall a madhouse isnt it dee began when they started up the stairs later if youve had your fill of hearing about horses and tracks and stud fees just send me a sign i like listening its a bit like learning a new language its all of that dee moved into her room and took a large box off the bed happy st patricks day automatically erin put her hands behind her back what is it its a present of course arent you going to take it theres no need for you to give me presents no but i didnt think of it as a need pride was something adelia understood too well her own had been bruised repeatedly id like you to have it erin from all of us as a kind of welcome to a new place when i came here i had only uncle paddy i think i understand now how happy it made him to share with me please i dont mean to seem ungrateful good then youll pretend to like it even if you dont dee sat on the bed and gestured with both hands open it ive never been long on patience erin hesitated only another moment then laid the box on the bed to draw off the top under a cushion of tissue paper was dark green silk oh what a color its expected today well take it out she demanded im dying to see if its right on you cautiously erin touched the silk with her fingertips then lifted the dress from the box the material draped softly in the front and simply fell away altogether in the back to a slim skirt dee rose to hold the dress in front of her cousin i knew it she said and her face lit up i was sure it was right oh erin youll be dazzling its the most beautiful thing ive ever seen almost reverently she brushed her fingers over the skirt it feels like sin aye then with a laugh dee stepped back for a better viewpoint itll look like it too there wont be a man able to keep his eyes in his head youre kinder to me than i deserve probably gathering up the box she handed it to erin go put it on fuss with yourself awhile erin kissed her cheek then letting her feelings spread she gave her cousin a hard laughing hug thank you ill be ready in ten minutes take your time erin paused at the door no the sooner i have it on the longer i can wear it the party was already underway when burke drove up hed nearly bypassed it altogether restless and edgy hed thought about driving up to atlantic city placing a few bets spinning a few wheels that was his milieu he told himself casinos with bright lights back rooms with dim ones a party with the racing class with their old money and closed circles wasnt his style he told himself he was here because of the grants the fact that erin would be there hadnt swayed him so he told himself since their last encounter hed nearly talked himself out of believing there was something between them oh a spark certainly a frisson a lick or two of flame but that was all that overwhelming and undesirable feeling that there was something deeper something truer had only been his imagination he hadnt come tonight to prove that either so he told himself it was travis who let him in burke could hear voices raised in the living and dining rooms along with the piping irish music that set the tone dee was worried about you travis closed the door on the nippy midmarch air outside i had a few things to see to no problems no problems burke assured him but if that was true he wondered why his shoulders were tensed why he felt ready to jump in any direction youll know just about everyone here travis was saying as he led him into the living room youve got quite a crowd burke murmured and was already searching through it though he didnt move beyond the doorway i think youll see that dees outdone herself in more ways than one with the slightest gesture travis had burkes gaze traveling to the far end of the room and erin he hadnt known she could look like that coolly sexy polished she was sipping champagne and laughing over the rim of her glass at lloyd pentel heir to one of the oldest and most prestigious farms in virginia flanking her were two more men he recognized thirdand fourthgeneration racing barons with ivy league educations and practiced moves burke felt his blood heat as one of them leaned close to murmur something in her ear both amused and sympathetic travis laid a hand on burkes shoulder beer whiskey he downed the first one easily appreciating its bite but it did nothing to relax his muscles he took a second and sipped it more slowly erin was perfectly aware that he was there she doubted hed been in the room ten seconds before shed felt his presence she smiled and flirted with lloyd and the others who wandered her way and told herself she was having a wonderful time but she never stopped watching burke and the women who gravitated to him adelia had been rightthe talk was horses purses the size of which made the head reel were discussed and the politics of racing dissected erin took it in determined to hold her own but as she nursed her single glass of champagne her gaze kept roaming the man didnt even have the courtesy to say how do you do she decided but then he seemed more interested in the leggy blonde than in manners erin accepted a dance with lloyd and if he held her a bit too close she ignored it and watched burke it didnt appear to bother her to have the young pentel stud pawing her burke noted as he swirled his whiskey and where in the hell had she gotten that dress setting down his whiskey he lit a cigar she was nothing to get worked up over he reminded himself if she wanted to wear a dress that was cut past discretion and bat her baby blues at pentel that was her business the hell it was burke crushed out his cigar and leaving the blonde who had snuggled up beside him staring walked over to erin pentel annoyed but as wellbred as his fathers prize colt lloyd nodded logan i have to borrow erin a minute business before either of them could object burke had maneuvered his way between and had erin in his arms youre a rude shameless man burke logan she was delighted i wouldnt talk about shameless while youre wearing that dress do you like it id be interested to hear what your father would say about it youre not my father though she smiled there was more challenge than humor in the curve of lips doesnt a man like you worry about luck burke no wearing of the green on st patricks day who says im not his eyes tossed the challenge right back money doesnt count i was talking about something more personal than money if you want to go somewhere private ill be happy to show you where im wearing my green im sure you would she murmured and tried not to be amused now what business do we have he wasnt holding her as close not nearly as close as lloyd had been but she felt the pull of him youve come a long way from dancing in moonlit fields irish aye some of the pleasure went out of her as she studied him what does that mean youre an ambitious woman one who wants things big things god it was driving him mad to be this close to smell her as he had once before in a dim garden shed with rain pelting the roof and what of it lloyd pentels not a bad choice to give it to you hes young rich not nearly as shrewd as his old man the kind of man a smart woman could twist easily around her finger its kind of you to point that out she said in a voice that was very low and very cold she didnt know what possessed her to go on but whatever it was she swore she wouldnt regret it but why should i settle for the colt when i can have the stallion the old mans a widower burkes mouth thinned as he smiled you work fast and you the skinny blondes still pouting after you it must be rewarding to walk into a room and have six females trip over themselves to get to you it has its compensations well why dont you get back to them she started to pull away but his hand pressed into her back so that their bodies bumped the flame that was never quite controlled flared at the contact damn you she said from the heart as he tightened his fingers on hers im tired of playing games he had her across the room and into the hall before she found the breath to speak what are you doing were leaving wheres your coat im not going anywhere and i he merely stripped off his jacket and tossed it over her shoulders before he yanked her outside get in the car go to hell he grabbed her then hard and fast therell be little doubt of that after tonight when his mouth came down on hers her first reaction was to fight free for this was a man to fear but that reaction was so quickly buried under desire that she moved to him get in the car erin she stood at the base of the steps a moment knowing no matter how strong how determined he was the choice would be hers she opened the door herself and got in without looking back chapter had she lost her mind erin sat in burkes car watching his headlights cut through the night and heard nothing but the sound of her own heart pounding in her ears she must be mad to have thrown all caution all sense all pretense of propriety to the winds why had no one ever told her that madness felt like freedom shed never been selfdestructive or had she she asked herself almost giddy from the speed and the night and the man beside her perhaps that was one more thing hed recognized in her a need to take risks and damn the consequences if that wasnt true why didnt she tell him to stop to turn back erin gripped her fingers together until the knuckles turned white she wasnt at all sure hed listen but that wasnt the reason she didnt speak no the reason she didnt speak was that shed lost more than her mind her heart was lost as well perhaps one was the same as the other erin thought surely it was a kind of madness to love him but love him she did in a way shed never imagined she could love anyone there was a ferocity to it an edgy sort of desperation that didnt swell the heart so much as tighten it indeed it felt like a hard hot lump beneath her breast even now was this the way love should feel shouldnt she know there should be a warmth a comfort a sweetnessnot this wild combination of power and terror though she searched she could find no tenderness in her feelings perhaps they were a reflection of his at a glance she could see no gentleness in the man beside her his hands gripped the wheel tightly and he looked nowhere but straight ahead erin pressed her lips together and told herself not to be a romantic fool love didnt have to be gentle to be real hadnt she known all along that her emotions when it came to burke would never be ordinary or simple she didnt want them to be still she would have liked to have laid a hand over his to have offered some word to show him how deep her feelings went and how much she was willing to give but more than her heart was involved there was pride and spirit as well she had to be realistic enough to understand that just because she loved didnt mean he loved in return so she said nothing as they drove under the sign and onto his land why did he feel as though his life had just changed irrevocably burke saw the lights of his house in the distance and tensed as though readying for a blow he wanted her and if the need was stronger than he wanted to admit at least tonight it would be assuaged she hadnt said a word his nerves neared the breaking point as he rounded the first curve in the drive did it mean so little to her could she take what was happening between them so casually that she sat in silence he didnt want this he wanted it more than hed ever wanted anything in his life what was she feeling damn it what was going on inside her couldnt she see that every day every hour hed spent with her had driven him closer and closer to the brink of what burke demanded of himself what line was he teetering on that hed never crossed before what would his life and hers be like once hed stepped over it the hell with it burke braked at the base of the steps and without sparing her a glance slammed the door and got out of the car legs trembling erin got out and started up the steps the door looked bigger somehow like a portal to another world with one long breath she passed through was it always so silent and angry when lovers came together she wondered as she started up the staircase her hand on the banister was drydry and cold she wished hed reached for it held it warmed it in his own that was nonsense she told herself she wasnt a child to be coddled and soothed but a woman he walked into the bedroom ahead of her waiting for her to smile to offer her hand to give him some sign that she was happy to be with him but when the door closed at her back she simply stood chin up eyes defiant the hell with it he thought again she didnt need sweetness and neither did he they were both adults both aware and willing he should have been glad she didnt want coaxing and candlelight and the promises that were so rarely kept so he pulled her against him their eyes met once acknowledging then his mouth was on hers and the chance for quiet words and gentle caresses was past this was enough erin told herself as the heat rose like glory this had to be enough because she would never have more from him accepting she pressed against him offering her mind and body along with her heart he didnt know was already his there was no hesitation now as her lips parted as their tongues met in a hot greedy kiss when his hands roamed over her back pressed into her hips she only strained closer she was prepared to trust him to show her the art of intimacy she was prepared to risk selfdestruction as long as he was part of the gamble her fingers trembled only slightly as they dug into his arms the strength was there an almost brutal kind of strength that had her heart racing and her body yearning good god no woman had ever taken him so close to desperation so quickly it only took a touch a taste when she kissed him avidly for one sweet moment he could almost believe he was the only one that was its own kind of madness a sane man would think of just this one night but like a drug she was seeping into his system making his heart race and his mind swirl he tugged on her dress and she moved against him murmuring he recognized the excitement the tremble of anticipation but not the modesty when her flesh was freed for him he took with rough hands that incited both desire and panic no one had ever touched her like this as if he had a right to every part of her no one had ever caused this hard fist of need to clench inside her so that she was willing to cede to him that right then she was naked tumbling to the bed so that his body covered hers his hands found her sent her spiraling so that she arched against him even as the fear of the unknown began to brew her breath caught with the sensation of being pressed under him vulnerable dizzy with desire her own body seemed like a strangers filled with towering emotions and terrifying pleasures she wanted a moment just one moment of reassurance one soft word one tender touch but she was beyond asking and he beyond listening greedy impatient he took his lips over her as he wrestled out of his shirt he wanted the feel of her flesh against his how many times had he imagined them coming together this way urgently without questions she was murmuring his name in a breathy desperate whisper that had his passion snowballing out of control he dragged at his clothes swearing hardly able to breathe himself and far beyond the capacity to think her body was like a furnace beneath his and with each movement she stoked the flames higher she dug her nails into his shoulders he fused his mouth with hers past all reason he plunged into her she was curled away from him trembling burke lay in the dark and tried to clear his head innocent dear god hed taken her with all passion and no care and he was the first he should have known yet from the first time hed held her shed been so ripe so ready there had been the strength the hotheaded passion the unquestioning response it had never crossed his mind that she hadnt been with anyone else he ran his hands over his face rubbing hard he hadnt seen because he was a fool the innocence had been there in her eyes for any man to see whod had the brains to look he hadnt looked perhaps because he hadnt wanted to see now hed hurt her however careless however callous he had been with women in the past hed never hurt one because the women hed chosen before had known the rules burke reminded himself not erin no one had ever taught them to her searching for a way to apologize he touched her hair erin only drew herself closer together she wouldnt cry she squeezed her eyes tight and swore it she was humiliated enough without tears what a fool he must think her sniffling like a baby but how could she have known loving would be all heat and no heart the hell of it was he was lousy at words burke reached down to the foot of the bed and drew a cover over her as he tried to sort through and pick the best ones he continued to stroke her hair erin im sorry by god he was lousy with words if those were the pick of the litter dont apologize i cant bear it she turned her face into the pillow and prayed he wouldnt do so again all right i only want to say that i shouldnt have what wanted her taken her i shouldnt have been careless with you that was beautiful he thought detesting himself i hadnt realized that you hadntthat tonight was your first time if id known i would have run for cover she suggested pushing herself up before she could climb out of the bed he had her arm he felt her withdrawal like a blade in the gut youve every right to be angry with me with you she turned her head and made herself look at him he was hardly more than a silhouette in the dark they had loved in the dark she thought unable to see unable to share perhaps it was best it was dark still so that he couldnt see the devastation why should i be angry with you its myself im angry with if youd told me told you she sniffed again but this time there was more than a little derision in it of course i should have told you while we were rolling around on the bed naked as the day we were born i might have said oh by the way burke you might be interested in knowing ive never done this before that would have put a cap on it he was amazed to find himself smiling even as he reached for her hair again and she jerked her head away maybe the timing could have been a bit better than that its done so theres no sense pining over it i want to go home now before i humiliate myself again dont dont what dont go that was a tough one he hadnt known hed had it in him to ask what happened wasnt wrong it was just done badly and thats my fault he caught her chin in his hand as she started to turn away look im not good at asking but id like you to let me make it up to you theres no need she wasnt aware that it was the gentleness in his voice that was calming her i told you im not angry with you its true it was my first time but im not a child i came here of my own free will now im asking you to stay he took her hand and turning it palm up pressed his lips to the center when he looked up at her again she was staring her lips parted in surprise he cursed himself again ill draw you a bath youll what draw you a bath he said snapping off the words youll feel better when he disappeared into the adjoining room erin simply continued to stare after him what in the world had gotten into him she wondered she gathered the blanket around her and stood as burke came back in he was wearing a robe tied loosely at the waist the light from the bath angled out onto the floor she could hear the sound of water running and sensedbut surely she was mistakena hesitation in him go ahead in and relax do you want something tea mutely she shook her head take your time then ill be back in a few minutes not a little baffled erin walked in and lowered herself into the tub the water was steaming so that she felt the tension and the ache begin to diminish almost immediately sinking down she closed her eyes she wished she had another woman to talk to another woman to ask if this was all there was to lovemaking she wished there was someone she could talk to about her feelings she loved burke yet she felt no fulfillment after being with him it had been exciting the way he had touched her the way his body had felt against hers made her tremble and ache but there had been no glorious glow no beautiful colors no feeling of lightness and contentment she was probably a fool for imagining there would be after all it was the poets and dreamers who promised more pretty words pretty images she was a practical woman after all but burke had been right the bath had made her feel better there was no reason for humiliation or for regret if she was no longer innocent she had brought about the change herself willingly one thing her parents had always told her was to follow what was in your heart and to blame no one steadier she stepped from the bath she would face burke now no tears no blushes no recriminations seeing no other cover she wrapped the towel securely around her and stepped into the bedroom hed lighted candles dozens of them erin stood in the doorway staring at the soft light there was music too something quiet and romantic that seemed to heighten the scent of wax and flowers the sheets on the bed were fresh and neatly turned down erin stared at them as all the confidence shed newly built up began to crumble he saw her glance at the bed and saw the quick unmistakable flash of panic that went with the look it brought him guilt and a determination to erase it there were other ways better ways tonight he would show both of them rising he went to her and offered a rose hed just picked in the solarium feel better aye erin took the rose but her fingers nearly bit through the stem you said you didnt want tea so i brought up some wine thats nice but i the words jammed in her throat as he lifted her into his arms burke relax he pressed a kiss to her temple i wont hurt you he carried her to the bed and laid her against the pillows taking two glasses already filled with pale wine he offered her one happy st patricks day with a half smile he touched his glass to hers erin managed a nod before she sipped this is a fine room she began lamely i didnt notice before it was dark he slipped an arm around her shoulders and settled back even as she tensed aye ive ah wondered what the other rooms were like you could have looked i didnt want to pry she sipped a little more wine and unconsciously brushed the rose over her cheek its petals were soft and just on the verge of opening it seems like a big place for one man i only use one room at a time she moistened her lips what was this music she wondered cullen would know it was so lovely and romantic i heard double bluff won his last race travis said he beat durnams colt by a length everybodys talking about the kentucky derby already and how your horse is favored when she realized her head was resting against his shoulder she cleared her throat she would have shifted away but he was stroking her hair you must be pleased its hard not to be pleased when youre winning and tonight at the party lloyd told me that bluff was the horse to beat i didnt tell you how wonderful you looked tonight the dress dee gave it to me it made my heart stop she was able to chuckle at that what blarney then again you managed to stop it wearing overalls she slanted a look up at him aye now im sure theres some irish in you i discovered i had a weakness for women taking in the wash id say its more a matter of a weakness for women in general has been but just lately ive preferred them with freckles erin rubbed rueful fingers over her nose if youre trying to flirt with me you ought to be able to do better works both ways lifting the hand that still held the rose he kissed her fingers you could say something nice about me erin caught her lip between her teeth and waited until he glanced up im thinking she said then laughed when his teeth nipped her knuckle well i suppose i like your face well enough im overwhelmed oh im picky i am so you should be flattered and though you havent traviss build im partial to the wiry type does dee know youve had your eye on her husband erin laughed into her glass surely theres no harm in looking then look here tilting her face up to his he kissed her his lips lingered softly more a whisper than a shout theres the way you do that too she murmured do what make my insides curl all up with his lips still hovering over hers he took the glass from her and set it aside is that good i dont know but id like you to do it again with a hand to her cheek he nuzzled drawing on a tenderness he hadnt known he possessed wailing for her lips to warm and soften beneath his she hesitantly touched a hand to his shoulder she knew his strength now what it was capable of and yet and yet his mouth was so patient so sweet so beautifully gentle when he increased the pressure her fingers tensed immediately he drew back to nibble again until he felt her begin to relax he wanted to take care and not just for her he realized but for himself he wanted to savor to explore to open doors for both of them hed never been a man to bother with candlelight and music had never looked for the romance of it now he found himself as soothed and seduced by it as she was the scent of her bath was on her skin fresh clean on her his soap seemed feminine somehow mysterious her skin was smooth but not frail beneath it were firm muscles honed by an unpampered life he would never have found frailty as appealing still he could feel the nerves jangle inside her now he would treat her as though shed never been touched where there was innocence there should be compassion where there was trust there should be respect and somehow wonderingly he felt as though it was his own initiation she heard the rustle of the sheets as he shifted her body hammered with need even while her fears held her back it was natural she reminded herself and now that she wasnt expecting she wouldnt be disappointed then her breath caught as a new thrill coursed over her skin confused she brought a hand to his chest i wont hurt you again he drew away from her to brush the hair from her face his fingers werent steady god he had to be steady now he warned himself he couldnt afford to lose control to lose himself a second time i promise i wont hurt you she didnt believe him even as she opened her arms in acceptance he saw she didnt believe him so he lowered his mouth to hers again and thought only of erin hed never been a selfish lover but hed never been a selfless one either now he found himself ignoring his own needs for hers when he touched her it wasnt to fulfill his own desire but to bring her whatever passion he was able he felt the change in her start slowly a gradual relaxation of the limbs a dreamy murmuring of his name shed waited braced for the speed the pressure the pain instead he gave her languidness indulgence and pure pleasure he moved his hands over her freely as he had before but this time there was a difference he stroked caressed lingered until she felt as though she was floating the sensation of vulnerability returned but without the panic light and sweet he brought his mouth to her breast to nibble and suckle so that she felt the response deep inside a pull a tug a warmth that spread to her fingertips with a moan she wrapped her arms around him no longer simply accepting but welcoming my god she was sweet with his lips rubbing over her skin he discovered she had a taste like no other a taste he would never be able to do without again her body was so completely responsive under his that he knew he could have her now and satisfy them both but he was greedy in a different way this time greedy to give reaching for her hand he linked his fingers with hers even that just that was the most intimate gesture hed ever made in the candlelight he saw her face glow with pleasure the soft silky kind that could last for hours so he came back to her mouth to give them both time she tasted the wine just a hint of it on his tongue then she felt his lips move against hers with words she heard only in her heart here was the glow shed once imagined and all the bright beautiful colors the poets had promised here was music flowing gently and light soft as heaven here was everything a woman whod given her heart could ask in return shed loved him before but now experiencing the compassion the completeness she fell deeper slowly carefully he began to show her more finding all the pleasure he could want from her response her body shuddered and strained toward him without hesitation without restrictions when he nudged her over the first peak he saw her eyes fly open with shock and dark delight breathless she clung to him it felt as though her mind was racing to keep pace with her body and still he urged her on in ways shed never dreamed existed the next wave struck with a force that had her rearing up there couldnt be more the colors were almost too bright to bear now and need and pleasure had mixed to a point that was both sharp and sweet she held him moaning out his name there couldnt be more but he filled her and showed her there was she was trembling again but she wasnt curled away from him this time she was turned to him her face pressed against his shoulder her arms holding tight because he was more than a little dazed himself he kept her close and said nothing he was no novice at this game burke reminded himself so why did he feel as though someone had just changed the rules the candlelight flickered its shadows around the room so that he shook his head it looked as if hed changed them himself soft light soft music soft words that wasnt his style but it felt so damn right he was used to living hard loving hard and moving on win lose or draw now he felt as though he could go happily to the grave if he never moved beyond this spot as long as erin stayed with him that thought had several small shock waves moving through him stayed with him since when had he started thinking along those lines since hed laid eyes on her he realized and let out a long nonetoosteady breath good god he was in love with her hed gone through his life without taking more than a passing interest in any woman then someone had opened the chute and hed fallen face first in love with a woman who hadnt had time to test the waters he didnt have time for this his life was unsettled the way he wanted it his days his decisions his moves were his own he had plans places to go he had nothing he thought absolutely nothing without her closing his eyes he tried to talk himself out of it it was crazy he was crazy how did he know what it meant to love someone there had only been one person hed loved in his life and that was long ago he was a drifter a hustler if hed stayed in one place a little too long it was only becausebecause there hadnt been a better game that was all but he knew it was a lie he should do them both a favor and take that trip to monte carlo he should leave first thing in the morning the hell with the farm the responsibilities hed just pick up and go the way he always had nothing was keeping him but her hand was resting on his heart he wasnt going anywhere but maybe it was time he upped the stakes and played out his hand you okay he asked her erin nodded then lifted her face to look into his i feel youll think im foolish probably how do you feel beautiful then she laughed and threw her arms around his neck i feel like the most beautiful woman in the world youll do he murmured and knew in that moment that no matter how hard he struggled he was already caught i never want to feel any different than this she drew him closer to press kisses along his jawline and throat you will but theres no reason you cant feel like this as often as possible well bring your things over tomorrow what things still smiling her arms still around his neck she drew back whatever things you have theres no reason to bother moving tonight tomorrows soon enough moving slowly she unwound her arms burke i told you once before i wont live here with you things have changed he said simply reaching for the wine he wished it was whiskey aye but that hasnt what happened tonight had been beautiful the most beautiful experience of her life and she didnt want it spoiled by talk of sharing a life with him that wouldnt be a true one i want to remember it id like to think that there may be a time when we mightwhen we might love each other this way again but that doesnt mean ill toss my beliefs aside and move in as your mistress lover the label doesnt really matter she started to move away but he grabbed her shoulders the glass tilted to the floor and shattered i want you damn it dont you understand not just once i dont want to have to drag you away from the grants every time i want an hour with you youll drag me nowhere the afterglow of love was replaced by angry pride do you think ill move in here so itll be convenient for you when you have an urge to wrestle in bed well i wont be a convenience to you or any man the hell with you burke logan she pushed away and had swung her legs off the bed when she went tumbling backward to find herself pinned under him im getting tired of you wishing me to hell well get used to it now take your hands off me im going home no youre not her eyes narrowed youll not keep me here whatever it takes then she twisted under him before he realized her intent her teeth were sunk into his hand he swore and they rolled from one end of the bed to the other before he managed to pin her again ill draw blood next time i swear it now let me go shut up you crazy irish hothead namecalling is it erin sucked the breath between her teeth the words she uttered now were gaelic this was hardly the time to be amused he reminded himself but there was no help for it what was that a curse some say my granny was a witch if youre lucky youll die fast and leave you a widow not a chance maybe youll live but in such pain youll wish what did you say were getting married because her mouth went slack and her bones limp he released her to suck on his wounded hand its a relief to know youve got good teeth he reached to the bedside table for a cigar nothing to say irish getting married thats right we could fly to vegas tomorrow but then dee would give me grief i figure we can get a license and do it here in a few days a few days she shook her head to clear it then sat up i think the wines gone to my head or he had she thought i dont understand i want you he lit the cigar then spoke practically deciding it was the style shed relate to best you want me but you wont live with me it seems like the logical solution solution calmly as if his life wasnt on the line he blew out smoke are you going to spend the rest of the night repeating everything i say again she shook her head trying to keep calm she watched him looking for any sign but his eyes were shuttered and his face was closed hed played too many hands to give away the most important cards hed ever held why do you want marriage i dont know ive never been married before he blew out another stream of smoke and i dont intend to make a habit of it i figure once should do me i dont think this is something you can take lightly im not taking it lightly burke studied the end of his cigar then leaned over to tap it out ive never asked another woman to marry me never wanted one to im asking you do you love me she wanted to ask but she couldnt whatever answer he gave wouldnt be the right one because shed posed the question do you really think that what we had here is enough for marriage no but were good together we understand each other youll make me laugh keep me on my toes and youll be faithful i cant ask for more than that and didnt dare ill give you what youve always wanted a nice home a comfortable living and youll be the most important person in my life she lifted her head at that it could be enough if she was indeed important to him do you mean that i rarely say what i dont mean because he needed to he reached for her hand lifes a gamble irish remember i remember most marriages dont make it because people go into them thinking that in time theyll change the other person i dont want to change you i like you the way you are he took her fingers to his lips and her heart simply spoke louder than her head then i guess ill have to take you the way you are as well chapter this is all happening so fast dee sat in erins bedroom where even now a dressmaker was pinning and tucking a white satin gown on her cousin are you sure you dont want a little more time for what erin stared out the window wondering whether if one of the dressmakers pins slipped and pierced her skin she would discover it was all a dream to catch your breath think things through i could have another six months and still not catch my breath she lifted a hand to her bodice and felt the symphony of tiny freshwater pearls who would have thought shed ever have such a dress in another two days she would put it on to become burkes wife wife a chill ran up her spine and at her quick shudder the dressmaker murmured an apology have a look miss mckinnon i think youll be pleased with the length if i do say so myself the dress is perfect for you not every woman can wear this line holding her breath erin turned to the cheval mirror the dress was the real dream she thought thousands of pearls glimmered against the satin making it shimmer in the lateafternoon light she thought it was something a medieval princess would wear with its snug sleeves coming to points over her hands and its miles of snowy skirts its beautiful mrs viceroy adelia put in when her cousin only continued to stare and its a miracle indeed that you could have it ready for us in such a short time were beholden to you you know youve only to ask mrs grant she eyed erin as she continued to stare into the glass is there something youd like altered miss mckinnon no no not a stitch she touched the skirt gingerly just a fingertip as if she was afraid it would dissolve under her hand im sorry mrs viceroy its only that its the most beautiful thing ive ever seen more than placated mrs viceroy began to fuss with the hem i think your new husband will be pleased now let me help you out of it erin surrendered the dress and stood in the plain cotton slip burke had once unhooked from the clothesline as the wedding gown was packed away she slipped into her shirtwaist and thought she understood what cinderella must have felt like at midnight if i might suggest the dressmaker continued the dress and veil would be most effective with the hair swept up something very simple and oldfashioned im sure youre right dee murmured as she continued to watch her cousin erin was staring out the window as if she was looking at a blank wall and naturally jewelry should be kept to the bare minimum shell have my pearl earrings for something borrowed what a sweet thought thank you again mrs viceroy dee said rising ill show you out no need for you to go up and down those stairs in your condition i know the way the dress will be delivered by ten day after tomorrow day after tomorrow erin thought and felt the chill come back to her skin would it always be now or never when it came to burke a lovely lady dee said after she closed the bedroom door it was kind of her to come here kind is one thing business another since the weight of the twins seemed to grow heavier every day she sat again she would hardly pass up the opportunity to please the future mrs burke logan erin im happy for you of course oh i feel like a mother hen are you sure this is what you want im not sure of anything erin blurted out then sank onto the bed im scared witless and i keep thinking ill wake up and find myself back on the farm and this all something i dreamed up its real dee squeezed her hand you have to understand that everything happening now is as real as anything can be i do and that only scares me more but i love him i wish i knew him better i wish hed talk to me about his family about himself i wish ma was here and my father and the rest of them but but dee coaxed as she moved over to sit beside her but i love him its enough isnt it enough to start she remembered that in the beginning all shed had was a blind desperate love for travis time had given her the rest hes not an easy man to know but you like him ive always had a soft spot for burke hes got a kind heart though hed rather no one noticed hes a tough one but i believe hed do his best not to hurt someone he loved i dont know if he loves me whats this it doesnt matter erin said quickly and rose to pace because i love him enough for the two of us why would he want to marry you if he didnt love you he wants me better to face it now headon she told herself as she turned back to dee i see and because she did she chose her words with care marriage is a mighty big step for a man to take only for a want a bigger step yet for a man like burke if the words are hard to come by it might be that he hasnt learned how to say them it doesnt matter i dont need words of course you do aye youre right she turned back with a sigh but they can wait sometimes a person needs to feel safe before he can speak whats in his heart youre good for me erin reached out both hands and grasped dees im happy and despite the both of us im going to make him happy brave words aside when she stood at the top of the staircase two days later clinging to paddys arm erin wasnt sure she could walk as far as the atrium where the ceremony would take place the music had begun in truth she could hear nothing else she took one step and stopped then she felt paddys comforting pat on her hand come now lass you look beautiful your father would be proud of you today she nodded took two slow easy breaths then descended burke thought the tux would strangle him if hed had his way they would have walked into the courthouse said a few words and walked out again mission accomplished it had been dee who had browbeaten him into a wedding just a simple one shed said burke thought with a grimace a woman was entitled to white lace and flowers once in her life she herself hadnt been given the choice but she wanted it for erin hed relented because hed been certain she couldnt pull it off in the two weeks hed given her of course she had the simple wedding shed promised had swelled into what he considered a sideshow with two hundred people eager to watch him juggle the house was full of white and pink roses and hed been forced to pull himself into a tux shed ordered a fivetiered wedding cake and enough champagne to fill his pool wasnt it enough that he was about to make a lifetime commitment without having a trio of violins behind him burke stood with his hands at his side and his face carefully blank and wondered what in the hell he was doing then he saw her her hair was glowing warm and vibrant under layers of white tulle she seemed pale but her eyes met his without hesitation how was it hed never noticed how small she was how delicate until now when she was about to become a permanent part of his life permanent he felt the quick sliver of panic then she smiled slowly almost questioningly he held out a hand her fingers were icy it was a relief to find his equally cold she held tight and turned to face the priest it didnt take long to change lives a few moments a few words she felt the ring slip onto her finger but she was looking at him her hand was steady when she took the gold band from dee and placed it on burkes finger and it was done he lifted the veil and touched the warm skin beneath he brought his lips to hers lightly then more strongly with a laugh erin threw her arms around his neck and held him and it was sealed then almost from the moment she became his wife she was spun away to be congratulated complimented and envied it became like a dream full of music and strangers and frothy wine she was toasted and fussed over cameras flashed there was caviar and elegant little hors doeuvres and sugared fruit that sparkled like diamonds under the lights erin found herself answering questions smiling and wishing herself a hundred miles away then she was dancing with burke and the world snapped back into focus this didnt seem real until now she rested her cheek against his and sighed i always dreamed of a day like this are we really married or am i still imagining he lifted her hand running a finger over her ring looks real to me smiling she looked down then caught her breath oh burke its beautiful stunned she turned her hand so that the layers of diamonds and sapphires glittered i never expected anything like this youve had it on for an hour havent you looked no it was foolish to cry now but she felt the tears sting her eyes thank you she was grateful the music stopped while she still had control ill be back in just a minute youd better be ill be damned if ill deal with this crowd alone she tucked her thumb into her fist so that she could run it along the ring as she hurried upstairs she just needed a minute erin told herself to compose to adjust to believe stepping inside the bedroom she leaned back against the door and caught her breath tonight she thought this would be her room just as burke would bewasher husband she would sleep in this bed wake in it tidy the sheets fuss with the curtains and one day it would become usual no she thought with a laugh and hugged herself it would never become usual she wouldnt let it from this day on her life would be special because she loved and belonged touching her cheeks to be certain they were cool and dry she started to open the door a trio of women were passing on their way downstairs why for his money of course this from a woman erin recognized from adelias party one with beautiful white hair and a wateredsilk suit after all she hardly knew the man why else would she marry him you dont think she came all the way from ireland to settle for keeping his books it seems strange that burke would marry her a nobody when he could have had his pick of some of the most acceptable women in the area the leggy blonde from the party fussed with the snap of her purse i thought they made a lovely couple the third woman merely shrugged as the whitehaired matron looked down her nose really dorothy a man hardly marries without reason no doubt shes got a few tricks up her sleeve its one thing to get a man into bed after all and another to get him to the altar men are charmed easily enough and bore just as easily i imagine hell be finished with her in a year if shes as smart as i think she is shell tuck away a nice settlementstarting with that ring he gave her ordered it from cartiers you know ten thousand not a bad start for a little farm girl from nowhere the blonde fussed with her hair as they approached the head of the stairs it should be interesting to see her struggle to climb the social ladder in the next few months shes not one of us the whitehaired woman announced with a flick of the wrist erin stood with her hand on the knob and watched them descend the stairs not one of them through the first shock came the tremble of anger well damned if she wanted to be they were nothing but a bunch of gossiping old broody hens with nothing better to do than make cruel remarks and speculate on the feelings of others for his money did everyone really believe shed married burke for his money did he she wondered with a sudden and very new shock anger drained as she let her hand slip off the knob oh sweet god did he was that what hed meant when hed said he could give her what she wanted she put her hands to her cheeks again but they were no longer cool could he believe that her feelings were tied up in what he had instead of what he was she hadnt done anything to show him otherwise erin realized with a sinking heart but she would lifting her head she started out of the room she would show him she would prove to him that it was the man she had married not his fine house or his rich farm and to hell with the rest of them when she descended the steps this time she didnt look like the pale innocent bride her color was high her eyes dark she might not be one of them she thought but she would find a way to fit in she would make burke proud of her forcing a smile she walked directly to the woman in watered silk im so glad you could come today the woman gave erin a gracious nod as she sipped champagne wouldnt have missed it my dear you do make a lovely bride thank you but a womans only a bride for a day and a wife for a lifetime if youll excuse me she crossed the room her dress billowing magnificently though burke was surrounded she moved directly to him and putting her arms around him kissed him until the people around them began to murmur and chuckle i love you burke she said simply and i always will he hadnt known he could be moved by words at least not such wellused ones but he felt something shift inside him as she smiled is that a conclusion you just came to no but i thought it past time i told you he thought hed never nudge the last guest out the door no one loved a party and free champagne like the privileged class erin stood in the center of the atrium with her hands clasped together its going to take an army to put this place to rights no ones walking through that door for twentyfour hours she smiled but the fatigue and nerves were beginning to show i should go up and change in a minute before she could move he took both her hands i should have told you how beautiful you are i cant remember ever being as nervous as i was when i stood down here waiting for you were you her smile came fully now as she pressed against him oh i was scared to death i nearly picked up my skirts and bolted id have caught you i hope so because theres no place i want to be but here with you he framed her face with his hands you havent had much chance to compare it doesnt matter but he wondered he was the only man shed ever known now hed done his best to be certain he was the only one she ever would selfish yes but a desperate man takes desperate measures he kissed her again and then while his lips were on hers lifted her into his arms theres no threshold to carry you over her eyes laughed at him theres one in the bedroom i told you that you were a woman after my heart he said and carried her up the stairs rosa had champagne chilling in a bucket and two glasses waiting burke i wonder would you mind giving me ten minutes whos going to help you out of that dress i can manage im sure its bad luck for the bridegroom to do so just ten she repeated when he set her down ill be quick with a shrug he pulled a robe out of his closet i suppose i can get out of this straitjacket somewhere else thank you he didnt give her a minute more than that but she was ready she was still in white but this gown was like a cloud wisping down shifting with each breath she took her hair was loose over the shoulders fire against snow he closed the door quietly behind him and looked his fill i didnt think you could be more beautiful than you were this afternoon i wanted tonight to be special i know weve already weve already been together but this is the first time ill make love to my wife aye she held out her hands and i want you to love me i want you more now than i did before if you could it was foolish to blush now she was a married woman if you could teach me what to do erin he didnt know what to say he simply didnt have the words but he took her hand and pressed a kiss to her brow i have something for you when he took a box out of his pocket and handed it to her she moistened her lips burke i dont want you to feel obliged to buy me things if i dont how am i going to please myself by looking at you wear them so he opened the box himself inside was a rope of diamonds holding one perfect sapphire oh burke she wanted to cry because it was so lovely she wanted to cry because she was afraid he thought she required it it matches my ring she managed that was the idea but he was watching her frowning at the look in her eyes dont you like it of course i do its like something out of a palace i think im afraid to wear it he laughed at that and turned her toward the mirror dont be silly its made to be worn see he held it up around her throat the sapphire gleamed dark against her skin and the wink of diamonds what good are pretty stones if a woman doesnt wear them youll need more than this before its done we can pick up some things on our honeymoon he kissed the curve of her throat where do you want to go paris aruba ireland she thought but was afraid hed laugh at her i was thinking maybe we should wait awhile for that after all this is one of the busiest times of year for you with the derby coming up could we wait a few months before we go away if you like he placed the necklace back in the box before turning her to face him erin whats wrong nothing its just all so new and burke i swear to you i wont do anything to cause you shame what the hell is this patience gone he took her by the arm and set her on the bed i want to know what youve got into your head and how it got there its nothing she said furious with herself that she was always an open book to him while she could never dig beneath the top layer its just that i realized today that i dont really fit in with your people and lifestyle my people his laugh wasnt amused and had her tensing you dont know anything about my people irish and you can consider yourself fortunate if you mean the people who were here today twothirds of them arent worth the snap of your fingers but i thought you liked them youve friends among them and associates associates for the most part and that can change at any time we can go to parties and you can join any clubs or committees you like but if you want to thumb your nose at the lot of them it wouldnt matter to me youre part of the racing world she insisted and married to you so am i i wont have anyone saying you married some little nobody who cant fit in and someone did he murmured she didnt have to confirm with words what he could see so clearly in her eyes you listen to me it only matters what we think i married you because you were what i wanted im going to be she lifted her hands to his face i swear to you she brought her mouth to his with all the passion love and longing she had she wanted the night to be special but that meant more than champagne and white lace it meant showing him what was in her heart what she was just beginning to understand for herself that she loved him unrestrictedly with her arms around him her mouth on his she lowered onto the bed their marriage bed he had shown her what loving could be now she hoped she could give some of that beauty back to him since experience wasnt hers she could only act on what was in her heart she had no idea if a man could feel more than need and satisfaction but she wanted to try to give him some of the sweetness some of the comfort he had given to her hesitant unsure she pressed her lips to his throat his taste was darker there potent and she could feel the beat of his pulse beneath her mouth its rhythm quickened she smiled against his skin yes she could give him something she liked the way he felt under her hands the muscles that bunched and flowed as she moved her fingers over them tentatively she parted his robe when she felt him tense she retreated immediately an apology forming on her lips no with a half laugh he took her hand and brought it back to him i want you to touch me he kept his own hands gentle though each hesitant stroke of her fingertips drove him mad he was already caught in the innocence and passion of her in her willingness to be taught her eagerness to please and be pleased so they loved slowly taking time to teach to learn there was no shyness on her part when he drew the lace from her shoulders but rather a wonder that he found her so desirable in answer she slipped his robe away and let herself marvel at the strength and beauty that was her husband perhaps it didnt make sense but it was more exciting now that he belonged to her the hard fist of need hadnt lessened the trembles of anticipation and anxiety were just as sharp but now along with desire was the simple joy that the man who held her was the man who would hold her night after night this was only the beginning she thought laughing she rolled over him something funny he managed he felt as though his body was stretched beyond the breaking point im happy she brought her mouth down hard on his then incredibly felt her bones liquefy with a soft moan she took him into her when the whirlwind started she could only hold her breath and grip his hands tight her body took control now moving with his instinctively as pleasure built and crested and built again her head was thrown back he thought she looked like a goddess red hair streaming over white shoulders her slender body strong and agile as it merged with his he wanted to hold her like this to see her like this again and again in his minds eye then the pleasure was so complete that it blinded him erin woke on her first day as mrs logan to a gray morning lashed by spring rain she thought it was beautiful smiling she shifted over to reach for burke and found him gone terrified shed dreamed it all she sat straight up do you always wake up like that across the room burke hooked his belt and watched her no i thought it wasnt a dream of course it wasnt she laughed at herself and shook her head never mind where are you going down to the stables so early its seven seven she rubbed her hands over her eyes as she struggled up ill fix your breakfast rosall see to it you should get some more sleep but i she wanted to fix his breakfast it was one of the small and very vital things a wife could do for her husband she wanted to sit in the kitchen with him talking of the day to come and remembering the night that had passed but he was already pulling on his boots im not tired i could go down and start on the books youve gotten them in good enough shape to take a couple of days off in fact we havent talked about it but you dont have to continue with that if you dont like well of course ill continue with it thats why i came here he lifted a brow as she tugged on a robe things have changed i dont want my wife to have to close herself up in an office all day if its all the same to you id like to work uncomfortable she began to tug on the sheets if you dont want me to be doing your books anymore ill find another job i dont care if you work on them or not i just want you to know you have a choice what are you doing im making the bed of course crossing over he caught her hand in his rosa takes care of the bedmaking as well theres certainly no need for her to make mineours thats her job he kissed her brow then changed his mind and drew her close against him good morning he murmured against her lips hers curved just slightly good morning ill be back in a few hours why dont you take a swim when the door closed behind him erin crossed her arms take a swim on her first day as a wife she wasnt supposed to cook breakfast or make a bed but to take a swim walking over to the mirror she stared at herself she didnt look so very different but feelings didnt always show wasnt it odd that shed refused to be burkes mistress but now she was feeling more like that than a wife married him for his money erin pushed away from the mirror the hell with that it was past seven and she had work to do rosa wasnt any more cooperative than burke there was no reason for the senora to do that there was no reason for the senora to do this perhaps the senora would like to take a book into the solarium in other words erin thought youre of no use here that was going to change she decided she threw herself into her paperwork when burke didnt return for lunch erin took matters into her own hands filling a pail with hot water and detergent she took it and a mop to the atrium glasses and plates had already been cleared away but rosa hadnt yet gotten to the tiles erin felt a stab of satisfaction at having beaten her to it this is my house she told herself as she sloshed out soapy water my floor and ill damn well wash it if i like burke strode through the streaming rain thinking that the horse he had entered at charles town that night would have an edge on the muddy track his second thought was that erin might get a kick out of taking the trip to west virginia to see the run it would give him a chance to show her off a bit god shed looked beautiful that morning all heavyeyed and dewyskinned he was far from certain hed done the right thing for her by rushing her into marriage but he was more certain than ever that hed done the right thing for himself he couldnt remember ever being at peace before or ever feeling as though each day had a solid purpose to it he could give her the things in life shed always wanted the money didnt matter to him so he didnt give a hang how she spent it in turn she was giving him a solid base something he hadnt known hed wanted inside he shook the rain out of his hair and went to look for her when he entered the atrium he stopped she was on her hands and knees scrubbing even as she heard his steps and glanced up he was dragging her to her feet what in hell are you doing why im washing the floor it took a beating yesterday youd be amazed what people can drop and what they dont bother to pick up again burke youre hurting my arm i dont ever want to see you down on your knees again understand no studying him she rubbed her arm she knew real anger when she looked it in the face no i dont my wife doesnt scrub floors now wait a minute as he turned on his heel she caught him shell scrub them if she pleases and she wont be called my wife as though she were something shiny to be kept in a box whats the matter with you i didnt marry you so you could scrub floors no nor that i could cook your breakfast or make the bed thats plain just why did you marry me then i thought id made that clear aye she dropped her hand from his arm i suppose you did so im to be your mistress after all its just a matter of being a legal one he made an effort an enormous one to block off the anger it didnt work dont be a fool and leave that damn bucket where it is youll remember the word in the ceremony was changed from obey to cherish scowling at him she gave the bucket a kick and sent soapy water pouring over the tiles but ill be happy to leave it just where it is where the hell are you going i dont know she said over her shoulder surely i can walk through the house even though im not allowed to touch anything in it stop it he caught her as she stormed down the hall but she only shook him off and kept going damn it erin you can touch whatever you like just dont clean it i can see its time we had the rules straight she pushed through the doors into the solarium the heat was like a wall and suited her mood perfectly touching and looking are allowed stop acting like an idiot me she turned on him and nearly upset a pot of geraniums its me whos an idiot is it out there its a fool i am and in here an idiot well it wasnt me who went into a rage because the floor was getting washed i thought you came here to get away from that because you wanted more out of life than washing dishes slowly she nodded aye i came to america for that but its not why i married you maybe i can handle others thinking i married you because of your money and your fine house but not you i told you yesterday that i loved you dont you believe me i dont know he ran a hand over his face and struggled for calm for clear thinking for the kind of controlled logic that had always brought him out on top of any game he chose why does it matter she had to turn away because it hurt too much to face him i didnt lie when i said it but you can think whatever you like it doesnt matter at all very deliberately she picked up a pottery bowl and sent it crashing to the tiles you neednt worry i wont clean it up are you finished i havent decided crossing her arms she stared at the clear water of the pool he put his hand on her shoulder perhaps she did love him a little it would take a bigger fool than he to push her away my mother spent more than half of her life on her knees scrubbing other peoples floors she was barely forty when she died i dont want you on your knees for anyone erin when he started to draw his hand away she clasped it in her own thats the first thing youve trusted me with she turned to put her arms around him dont you see youll drive me mad if you shut me out you agreed to take me for what i am i have i will i do love you burke then let me see you enjoy yourself but i am tilting her head back she grinned at him i like to fight he ran a finger down her nose then im glad to oblige you did you take that swim no i had the books and then i argued with rosa for awhile busy day lets take one now i cant more arguing to do no ive done with that but i dont want to swim cant you her chin angled as hed expected of course i can but i dont have a suit thats okay lifting her up he walked to the edge as she giggled and shoved against him you wouldnt and if you try by god youll go in with me i never intended it any other way they went in together fully dressed chapter before she had been married a full month erin had taken trips to new york and kentucky and back to florida she grew used to the look and feel of the racetracks whether they were earthy or glamorous she grew used to but never less fascinated by the people who inhabited them from the young grooms still shiny with ambition to the older hands who lived from race to race and bet to bet the contrasts were a constant curiosity from her box she could watch the other owners their families and friends seersucker suits and picture hats while against the rail elbow to elbow were the masses who came for the fun or the money she learned that wagering had its own scent often a desperate one always a little sweaty away from the stands were the horses the scales the tack and the riders only a few who watched knew the thrill and the anxiety of ownership in lexington she visited horse farms with burke and saw stables grander than she had ever thought any house could be she saw the races of the thoroughbred world grew to know the people whose lives were tied to them and she learned at cocktail parties dinner parties and small celebrations she listened to discussions on breeding on training on strategy she grew to understand that owners often thought of their horses as possessions while trainers more often than not thought of a horse in their care as an athlete to be disciplined and pampered in the peculiar way of the sportsman but above all the horse was the focus for envy or for pride after a time she drew together the courage to go as far as the paddocks where she could watch the horses being examined and saddled for the races though the scent and sounds of horses still disturbed her she was determined that burkes associates would never twitter about his wife being afraid she grew more accustomed to the parties the lavish ones that only the successful and the privileged could attend the talk there was of horses and the people who owned them not so different from skibbereen she began to think certainly this life was more glamorous but at home the talk had often been just as narrow she studied poring over books on thoroughbreds racing and the history of both she learned that every thoroughbred descended from three arabian studs and that the most expensive horseflesh in the world was to be found in ireland at the irish national stud shed had to smile at that not only from home pride but because two such horses were in burkes stables she learned to wager wisely and to win a skill that never failed to amuse her husband hed been right when hed said she would make him laugh erin found more pleasure in that than in all the pretty stones he bought her or the new clothes that hung in her closet shed discovered something in a month of marriage the things shed thought shed always wanted werent important after all and she was pregnant the knowledge both thrilled and terrified her she was carrying a child burkes child one that had been conceived on their first night together in a matter of months they would no longer be just husband and wife but a family she couldnt wait to tell him she was afraid of what he would say theyd never discussed children but then there had been time to discuss little she hardly knew more of him now than she had when shed married him true she had come to understand that unlike many of his associates his horses were neither possessions nor pets nor were they the game of chance he claimed them to be they had his pride and his affection and erin came to see that they had his admiration for simply being what they were it wasnt just the winning but the heart that made champions there was this and little more she had learned of him hed never spoken of his mother or his family again though shed tried to question him gently hed simply ignored her not evaded erin thought now just ignored it didnt matter she told herself as she went to find him shed seen him with dees children and hed been gentle and kind and caring surely he would be only more so with a child of his own she would tell him and he would hold her tight and tell her how happy he was they would laugh and she would show him all the pamphlets the doctor had given her on childbearing classes and diet then they would plan the nursery all pinks and blues like a sunrise she found him in the library and had to bite back an impatient oath when she saw he was on the phone im not interested in selling he said as he gestured her in no not at that price not at any if you want to get back to me in a few years and talk stud fees yes thats a firm no tell durnam none of my stocks for sale at the moment yeah youll be the first to know he hung up and pulled a hand through his hair problems erin crossed over to kiss his cheek no charlie durnams interested in buying one of the new foals makes me think hes the one with problems so what did you buy buy you said you were going shopping oh yes i didnt buy anything she rested her cheek against his hair a moment burke ive something i want to tell you in a minute sit down erin it was the tone that had her retreating he used that odd flat voice when shed annoyed him whats wrong ive had a letter from your father from da she was up again almost before she sat is something wrong is someone sick no nothings wrong sit down he swiveled in his chair and for the first time in a month she felt as though they were back on terms of business he wrote to welcome me into the family and to express what i suppose is fatherly concern that i take good care of you what nonsense he knows very well i can take care of myself she relaxed again unconsciously resting a hand low on her stomach was that all he also thanked me for the money youve been sending over he says its been a great help burke paused a moment as he flipped through the papers on his desk why didnt you tell me youve been sending more than half your money over to ireland i never thought of it she began then she stopped how do you know how much im sending you keep excellent and very clear books erin he pushed away from the desk to pace to the window i dont understand why youre angry the moneys mine after all its yours he murmured damn it erin theres a checkbook in the office if youd felt the need to send money home why didnt you just take what you wanted and be done with it theres more than enough out of my wages youre my wife damn it and that entitles you to whatever you want youre past the point where you have to draw wages she was silent a moment and when she spoke she spoke carefully thats it isnt it you still believe that im here because of your fat checkbook he didnt know what he thought burke admitted as he stared out of the window she was perfect warm loving and the longer she was with him the more he was certain there had to be a catch no one gave unconditionally no one gave without wanting something back not entirely he said after a moment but i dont believe youd have married me if i didnt have one i told you before it doesnt matter we suit well enough do we the point is the moneys there and you may as well make use of it you never know how long itll last with a half smile he lit a cigar thats a bridge well cross when we come to it enjoy it irish its all part of the bargain she thought of the child inside her and could have wept instead she stood is there anything else i want you to go write out a check for whatever your family needs all right thank you well be leaving for kentucky in a few days the bluegrass stakes and the derby he turned and leaned back against the sill you should enjoy it its quite a show im sure its wonderful she took a long breath and watched him carefully its a pity dees too far along to travel so she and travis wont be there thats the price you pay for having a family he shrugged and moved back to his desk aye she said quietly but the light had gone out of her eyes ill let you get back to work wasnt there something you wanted to tell me no it was nothing erin closed the door behind her then covered her face with her hands hadnt she told him she loved him hadnt she showed him in every way she knew and now she was carrying physical proof of her feelings but none of it mattered to him then it would have to matter to her even more erin straightened her shoulders and walked away from the door unaware that burke stood on the other side hesitating his hand on the knob he hadnt meant to be angry shed looked so happy when shed come into the room shed smiled at him as though as though she loved him why couldnt he get past the block and just accept because he didnt believe in that kind of love not even when he felt it himself he did believe that she would stay with him happily enough as long as he continued to provide her with what she needed when hed met her hed recognized the hunger for more he himself had always felt hed recognized the need to see new things climb new mountains and win it was just fortunate for both of them that he was in a position to show her those things to provide her with the means to taste and hear and see the fantasies shed had she could love him for that and that he could understand but what about the man who had come from nothing what about the man who could be back to nothing at the toss of the dice what would her feelings be for him he couldnt afford to find out because the man who thought love only existed for convenience was desperately in love with his wife she was far from aware of it as erin walked into the kitchen she was certain burke only wanted her as long as she did nothing to upset the balance of his lifestyle sooner or later he would be aware that together they already had rosa was washing crystal in the sink but stopped the moment erin walked in the room is there something you want senora im just going to fix some tea ill heat the water i can do it myself erin snapped as she slammed the kettle onto the stove as you like senora erin leaned her palms against the stove im sorry rosa denada as rosa went back to her crystal erin found a cup and saucer what kind of wife was it she wondered who didnt even know which cupboard held her dishes how could she be so happy and so unhappy at the same time rosa how long have you worked for mr logan many years senora before he came here to this house before that like pulling teeth she thought determined to pull harder where did you work with him before that in another house erin turned from the stove where rosa she saw the housekeepers lips tighten in nevada in the west what did he do there he had much business you should ask mr logan yourself its you im asking rosa dont you think i have a right to know who my husband is she saw the brief hesitation before rosa began to polish glasses its not my place senora i need something with an angry flick of her wrist she shut off the flame i dont care what he did what he was if hes done something wrong it doesnt matter how can i get through to him if i dont understand him senora carefully rosa set down the first glass and picked up another im not sure you would understand even if you knew tell me and let me try some things are better left alone no she wanted to throw something anything but managed to hold the need back rosa look at me i love him when the housekeeper turned erin spoke again i love him and i cant stand being kept apart from who he is i want to make him happy rosa stood silently a moment her eyes were very dark and very clear for a moment erin felt a stab of recognition then it passed i believe you its burke who needs to believe for some believing such things doesnt come easily why why for burke do you know what its like to be hungry truly hungry for food for knowledge for love no he grew up with nothing less than nothing when there was work he worked when there was not he stole she moved her shoulders and picked up the next glass not such a bad life for some hell for others he never knew his father his mother was not married you understand yes erin sat and made no objection when rosa moved over to the stove to fix her tea his mother worked very hard though she was never well but in such places a person always owes much more than they could ever have at times he went to school but more often he worked in the fields on a farm she asked remembering the way burke had looked over hers si he lived on one for awhile so that he could give his mother his pay i see and she was beginning to he hated the life the dirt and the stench of it rosa how did you know him when he was a child she set the tea down in front of erin we had the same father erin stared then when rosa would have walked away she grabbed her arm youre burkes sister half sister my father took me to new mexico when i was six he met burkes mother she was pretty frail and very innocent after burke was born he left me with her promising to send for us all when he had a job he never did something might have happened to him he might she stopped when she saw the look in rosas eyes burkes mother discovered hed met another woman in utah that was his way so she worked washing up other peoples dirt for twenty years then she died she had done her best for him but burke was always wild and restless the day she was buried he left it was five years before i saw him again he found you no i found him rosa went back to her glasses burke is not a man who looks for anyone he owned part of a casino in reno because i wouldnt take the money he offered i went to work for him hes never been comfortable with it but he doesnt send me away he couldnt youre his sister not to him because to him our father never existed there is no family in burkes life no roots no home that can change only burke can change it aye nodding she stood thank you rosa she didnt tell him about the baby over the next few days she fretted over the secret but didnt speak it there were races to prepare for important ones now as she watched burke handle his business and deal with his horses she watched from a different perspective how had his early life shaped him she took note of the way he treated those who worked for him he was firm and demanding but never unreasonable not once had she heard him raise his voice to any of his men because he knew what it was like to be abused by an employer she wondered because he understood how it felt to be dependent for your existence on another he loved the horses she wasnt sure he was aware of it himself but she could see it in the way he watched them take to the track the way he supervised their grooming perhaps it was true that when hed won the farm it had been only another game but hed made a life out of it whether he realized it or not that alone gave erin hope the time came for them to fly to kentucky erin vowed she would tell him about the baby when they returned there was something different about her burke thought as he fixed himself a drink in the parlor of their hotel suite he just couldnt quite put his finger on it her moods were like a roller coasterup down and sideways as quick as a wink not that he didnt find them interesting hed never been one who wanted to settle in too comfortably and a man would hardly do that with a wife who was raging one minute and smiling sweetly the next she was always doing the unexpected these days cuddling up against him and falling into long thoughtful silences or racing down to the stables to drag him back for a picnic under the willow she was the same in public playing the dignified wife one moment and a flirtatious woman the next and she didnt always flirt with only him he couldnt deny it made him jealous but he was fully aware that was her intent he found her daydreaming one minute and rushing around talking about redecorating the next at times he worried that she was becoming restless again but then she would reach for him at night and no one had ever seemed so content hed noticed she seemed to have lost her taste for champagne though they attended the spring parties with regularity shed taken to sipping plain juice and discussing bloodlines and the pros and cons of certain tracks then there had been the day hed given her the earrings sapphires to match her necklace she had opened the box burst into tears and fled only to come back an hour later to gather him close and thank him the woman was driving him crazy and he was enjoying every minute of it are you almost ready or do you want to be fashionably late he asked as he strolled toward the bedroom almost ready since were going to win the race tomorrow i thought i should look my best for the pictures theyll be taking tonight ive never known people with such love for taking pictures at parties you didnt complain about having yours in the paper he began then stopped to stand in the doorway she smiled when she saw him and turned a slow circle shed chosen the dress carefully knowing that before too many more weeks she would be showing and wouldnt feel proper wearing something daring the midnight blue was shot through with silver threads so that she shimmered even standing still it left her shoulders bare then slithered down her body without drape or fold without the slit up the skirt she wasnt sure she could have moved in it well do you like it mrs viceroy said i should have something to show off my necklace whos going to notice the necklace he came to her and in the way he had of making her heart stop took both her hands to kiss them irish youre gorgeous its sinful for me to want the other women to be jealous isnt it probably but i do i want them to look at you and think hes the most wonderful man here and she has him laughing she spun another circle then i can just look at them and smile sort of pitying its a shame i wont be able to notice because i wont be able to take my eyes off you she turned back to touch his cheek you know when you say things like that it still makes my insides curl up burke she wanted to tell him she loved him but she knew he would only smile and kiss her forehead then her heart would break a little because he wasnt able to give the words back to her did you ever think these parties are a littleslow i thought you liked them well i do she moved closer to run a finger down his lapel but sometimes sometimes i find myself in the mood for something that takes a little more energy she smiled as she looked up at him under her lashes a lot more energy you smell very nice thanks he lifted a brow as she loosened his tie are you trying to start something and what if i am she pushed his jacket off his shoulders just checking he murmured while she unbuttoned his shirt this isnt going to make all those women jealous with a laugh she ran her hands up his chest thats what you think grinning she shoved him onto the bed and jumped in after him for the first time since shed fainted erin insisted on going down to the stables with burke she told him it was a matter of pride and it was pride in him she wasnt able to bring herself to go in but urged him to as she stood in the sun and watched the people a long way from skibbereen indeed she thought the air was warm with springtime and flowers were already in bloom trainers and exercise boys shed come to know by sight nodded or tipped their hats as they passed her and greeted her as mrs logan there was excitement in the air as well the kind that hummed before an important race before long it would be the race the derby but for now everyones attention was on today and the bluegrass stakes a win here added to double bluffs record would make him the favorite erin smiled as she thought that would lower the odds but odds didnt matter she wanted burke to win today and at churchill downs she could almost taste the satisfaction of having double bluff named horse of the year more than shed wanted anything she wanted that for burke for him to know hed done something special something only the best could accomplish good day to you mrs logan paddy pleased to see him erin opened her arms for a hug oh its a fine day isnt it hows dee right as right and mean as a bear she told me to tell you if traviss apollo doesnt win burkes double bluff better and who are you betting on now who do you think i trained apollo myself but if i was hedging my bets id lay some money on the colt out of three aces a smart man would put his money down on charlies pride durnam came up behind them and slapped paddy on the shoulder well now its a fine colt you have there mr durnam and thats the truth but i think ill stick with my own thats your choice hello there mrs logan youre looking as pretty as ever thank you good luck to you today you dont need luck when youve got the best he pulled at the brim of his straw hat and moved on well see whos the best erin said under her breath got the fever do you chuckling paddy slipped an arm around her shoulders theres a powerful competition in this business cant be otherwise when money and prestige change hands in a matter of minutes how do you know when youve got a winner well now theres breeding and training and a matter of attitude theres feed and grooming theres the jockey that sits on top and finding the right man for the right mount but what it comes down to darling is blood its in the blood or it isnt just like with people aye the blood she looked toward the stables and thought of burke so you think that someone could be denied the proper care and feeding the training and still be a winner we talking horses or people does it matter not much he gave her shoulder a quick squeeze its in the blood and its in the heart ive got to tend to my boy now ill wave to you from the winners circle paddy cunnane she called after him you sound sure of yourself burke commented as he crossed to her sure of you she gripped his hands as they headed for the stands you dont have to walk me up i know you want to stay to see your jockey weighed in and watch double bluff saddled the last time i didnt go with you i found you surrounded by reporters i know how to handle them now besides i did like seeing my picture in the paper youre a vain woman irish aye and why not she brushed a finger over his creamcolored shirt and found herself pleased he didnt go in for the seersucker of his associates whether its pride or vanity i find it exciting to see my picture on the society page did you know mr logan youre a very important man is that so ayetis so and so im told often enough then by rights i have to be an important woman you could pass for one today he decided taking a quick study of her pale blue suit and pearls shed added a plain widebrimmed straw hat then had tilted it at an angle so it could no longer be called demure i decided the day called for dignified then she laughed and touched the brim of her hat sort of burke ill be fine really i know you want to stay close to the horse id rather stay close to you mind no she hooked her arm through his and grinned why dont i buy you a beer she thought it was a perfect day the most perfect day of her life the sky was cloudless a soft spring blue that made her smile just to look at it she noticed the woman from her wedding as she stepped into the box and made sure she tilted her head and smiled coolly in greeting why do i feel youre always sticking pins in dorothy gainsfield because i am darling she stood on tiptoe and kissed him long sharp ones i didnt know until the other day that the skinny blonde who was hanging all over you on st patricks day was mrs gainsfields favorite niece she laughed again figuring it meant another day in purgatory life can be sweet youll have to fill me in on all this later in ten or twenty years perhaps look burke television cameras can you imagine delighted with the world in general she took her seat now and then she spotted someone she knew and waved to lloyd pentel to honoria louis to the elderly mrs bingham do you know ive met as many people in a months time as ive known all of my life its an odd and wonderful feeling she turned to see he was smiling at her why do you look at me like that its an education to watch you in a place like this soaking it all up storing it away i wonder what youll look like when we go to paris or rio probably stand around with my mouth hanging open the whole time and humiliate you theres that he only laughed when she jabbed him with her elbow try to behave yourself its almost post time oh lord save us so it is and i havent bet i bet for you while you were buying my beer and trying to decide if you were going to eat a cheeseburger or two hot dogs living in americas improved your appetite it wasnt only that that was increasing her appetite she thought and wondered when she would work up the nerve to tell him it wasnt my fault we missed breakfast she reminded him wheres my ticket watching the horses being led to the starting gate he reached in his pocket erin took the stub and was about to tuck it away when she noticed the amount a thousand dollars her voice squeaked so that a few interested heads turned burke where would i be getting a thousand dollars to bet on a horse dont be ridiculous he didnt spare her a glance his trainer had moved to double bluffs head as the colt reared and danced seems a little more wired than usual he murmured as two grooms stepped up to help but burke a thousand dollars afraid youll lose no she stopped then closing the ticket tight in her hand she said a quick prayer no of course not the bell sounded the gate was released the horses plunged forward she recognized the pentel colt in the lead he was a fast starter she remembered but he didnt have stamina with the ticket still clutched in her hand she put a fist to her breast the pack was hardly more than a blur but she could see the greenandwhite silks of burkes jockey rounding the first turn he was in fourth with traviss colt on his left the crowd was already shouting so that she could no longer hear the announcer it didnt matter with her free hand she gripped the sleeve of burkes linen shirt and held on hes making his move burke murmured she saw the whiz of crops the strain of speed as the jockeys leaned low double bluff moved to the outside his stride lengthened eating up distance it seemed that before her eyes he grew bigger his coat glossier his legs longer a champion she thought again was in the heart hers was with the colt it was more than a race she knew more than prestige and certainly more than money it was burkes pride she understood what it was like to come from little then to have a chance for everything the pentel colt began to lag as they came down the stretch it was a race between three leaving the pack behind charlies pride held first with traviss colt and double bluff vying for second she could see the dirt flying and the sweat all around her there was one huge bellowing roar hes going to do it she didnt even realize she was shouting as she watched double bluff gain on charlies pride they were nose to nose for what seemed forever and then he was ahead by a neck by half a length by a length with his speed only increasing he was two lengths ahead at the wire oh burke he did it you did it she hadnt been aware of standing but found herself on her feet as she turned to throw her arms around him sure and hes the most beautiful horse ever born im so proud of you i wasnt racing she drew back to caress his cheek yes you were maybe i was he murmured as he kissed the tip of her nose he continued to watch as his jockey took the horse around for the victory lap can you manage to stand in the winners circle with me i think so people were congratulating them and though erin acknowledged them her thoughts were already moving forward to standing beside burke as he accepted the win her arms were still around him when the official winner was declared charlies pride double bluff had been disqualified disqualified what do they mean well find out taking her hand burke moved out of the stands the murmurs had already started burke they cant say he didnt win for heavens sake i saw it with my own eyes he was well in the lead theres a mistake wait here leaving her he walked over to the paddock area where double bluff was being held she saw a bald man in a suit approach burke then two other men join them it looked so official she thought the bald man was talking calmly pointing to the horse then to a piece of paper as he spoke both the jockey and the trainer began to argue furiously but burke simply stood listening she began to feel the heat as she stood there so she moved over into the shade it was a mistake of course she told herself as she removed her hat to stir air into her face no one would take away what burke had earned what he needed what she needed for him what is it she demanded as burke strode back amphetamines someone gave the horse amphetamines drugs but thats ridiculous apparently not his eyes were narrowed as he looked over at the paddock someone wanted him to win very badly or to lose chapter what do you mean youre sending me home im not a package to be wrapped and stamped erin rushed after burke as he strode from the parlor to the bedroom of the suite youve barely said a word to me since we left the track and now all you can say is youre sending me home theres nothing else to say not at the moment nothing to say because she was breathless after struggling to keep pace with him she sat double bluff was just disqualified from one of the most important races of the year because someone gave him drugs thats plenty to talk about to start its not your concern he pulled a suitcase out of the closet then set it open on the bed pack she kept her seat and just barely her temper but her eyes narrowed oh i see so this is one more thing im not to touch pausing only a moment burke studied her he could see the temper beginning to brew as far as he was concerned she was better off angry than dealing with the tempest of the next few days hed never considered himself a man of great virtues but hed protect his wife you can look at it that way or any other way you like ive got some calls to make pack your things ill see that your flights changed just one bloody minute she was up and after him again as he walked into the next room im sick to death of orders from you almost as sick as i am of talking to your back if you dont put down that phone burke logan itll pleasure me to wrap the cord around your neck erin ive got enough to deal with at the moment without you adding one of your tantrums tantrums her hands clenched into fists as she walked toward him oh ive a flash for you i do you havent seen a tantrum yet now sit taking both hands she shoved him into a chair and its time you unplugged your ears and listened for a change he could have risen again and struck back with his own temper he decided against it in the same way he might have decided to bluff his way to a pot with a pair of deuces the quickest way to have her out and on her way was to show disinterest is this going to take long as long as needs be then would you mind if i had a drink seething she went behind the bar and grabbed a bottle and a glass she slammed them down on the table beside him go ahead have the whole bottle drown yourself in it just onell do he poured two fingers then lifted the glass in a half salute say whats on your mind irish i have a few things to see to before your flight if i said half what was on it your ears would be ringing from now till gabriel blew his horn answer me this are you going to take this business lying down he lifted the glass and sipped watching her steadily over the rim what do you think i think youre going to fight and i think you wont be resting until you find out whos behind this then i think youre going to carve them up in little pieces he toasted her again then downed the rest of the whiskey that about covers it and im not going home to twiddle my thumbs while youre about it thats exactly what youre going to do did it ever occur to you that i could help i dont want your help or need it erin no you dont need anyone she swung away to pace the room wishing she knew a better way than shouting to handle an argument all you need are a few paid servants to deal with the little details while you go on your merry way you certainly dont need a wife a partner to tend to your shirts or hold your hand when theres trouble the urge to get up to hold on to her was so strong he had to press his fingers into the glass until his knuckles whitened because she was wrong she was very very wrong about what and whom he needed i didnt marry you to do my laundry no you married me to sleep with and i know it well enough but you got more than you bargained for because im not running back home like some weakhearted whiny female who cant face a spot of trouble pride he thought and nearly laughed it always seemed to be his pride or hers on the line no ones insulting your valor erin it would simply make things easier if i didnt have you to deal with you wont have to deal with me in private ill stay out of your way and you can do your business however you please but in public im going to be there the loyal and trusting wife whats wrong with that nothing he sat back determined to study her calmly she looked like a comet about to go into orbit it matters to you what these people think what they say and why shouldnt it why shouldnt it indeed he thought as he stared into his empty glass she was worried about her position and hers walked hand in glove with his own have it your way then i can hardly drag you to a plane and tie you on but i warn you it wont be pretty youve said you understand me almost from the first moment we met you said it and i believed you now i see that you really dont understand me at all there was no more anger it had been smothered by a rising despair if theyd really been married in the true sense they would have been able to talk about what had happened they would have been able to fight together rage together instead of at each other you can make your calls im going for a walk but he didnt pick up the phone when she left it was more than being unused to having someone stand beside him more than his own penchant for handling his own in his own way hed wanted her to go away from the murmurs and sly looks he didnt want her to be a part of the suspicion that had already fallen over him and his shed never even asked burke scrubbed his hands over his face and tried to get beyond his own fury it wasnt losing the purse or the race so much as knowing that someone had violated what was his and shed never asked if hed arranged it himself could she really believe so blindly in him or was it a matter of her not caring how he won however she felt he couldnt shield her from the gossip and gossip there would be he thought grimly once she had a taste of it he figured shed be happy enough to go back to the quiet of three aces in the meantime he was going to find out whod messed with him pushing the bottle aside burke picked up the phone the action moved to churchill downs and derby week erin made certain she attended each function and every qualifying race she held her head up and when she heard a whisper only held it higher not everyone seemed inclined to believe that burke had had a hand in the drugging of his horse for every snub and murmur there was someone else to offer support but the only one who mattered had closed himself off from her she didnt try to break through the barrier it took all the energy she had to hold up the pretense of an united couple the strain was taking its toll all the more because she worked hard to make sure burke didnt see it he rose early so she rose early he went to the track to oversee double bluffs morning exercise so she spent her mornings at the track there were days when by noon she was so weary she wanted to crawl off into a corner and sleep but there were races and luncheons and functions often backtoback she refused to miss even one erin mckinnon logan wasnt hiding in some dim corner until the trouble passed she would face it shoulders straight and dare even one person to look her in the eye and make an accusation it was hard and grew harder so that every day she had to force herself to put in an appearance there were whispers and knowing looks behind smiles there were eyes that turned away rather than meet hers and there were a few who preferred to cloak their insults in manners she dressed carefully for a formal dinner party near the end of derby week erin had always felt that a strong outer appearance helped tap the inner strength attending alone was only more difficult but burke had been called to a meeting at the last minute she could have stayed at the hotel just as burke had asked the truth was that a quiet evening a tray in bed and a good book was exactly what she would have preferred but that would have been cowardly so she wore her midnightblue silk and hung her sapphire around her neck like a badge while others sipped cocktails she nursed orange juice and made conversation more than ever she was grateful for paddy he stayed close keeping her spirits up and her mind busy with stories of ireland but he couldnt shield her from everything nor from everyone my dear what a pretty dress dorothy gainsfield swept toward her her eyes as cold as her diamonds good evening mrs gainsfield tell me are you enjoying your first derby week it is your first isnt it aye its my first if erin had learned one thing it was how to return a meaningless smile im sure youve been coming here for many years indeed she said repressively refusing to be insulted by one so beneath her station i dont see your husband he couldnt make it thats understandable isnt it erin felt paddy start forward and laid a hand on his arm with the race only a couple of days away burke is busy im sure he is the older woman gave a dry laugh and sipped her champagne you know im rather surprised hes being allowed to enter after that mishap shall we say at the bluegrass stakes the racing commission feels double bluffs record speaks for itself and for burke once the investigations complete that too will speak for itself oh i dont doubt it my dear not for a minute it isnt unusual for someone to get a bit too enthusiastic about winning this wouldnt be the first time the methods been used to lower the odds burke doesnt cheat he doesnt have to im sure youre right mrs gainsfield smiled again but then i wasnt speaking of your husband mrs logan satisfied with the dig mrs gainsfield moved away that doughfaced old cow paddy began as he fired up ill give her a piece of my mind no again erin put a hand on his arm shes not worth it erin watched her mingle with the crowd when double bluff wins itll be enough erin was determined that by the end of the week they would have discovered who was responsible for double bluffs disqualification and the cloud on burkes reputation would be gone she was even more determined that on sunday when churchill downs opened for the derby burke would win what was rightfully his once that was done she would face the cracks and scars on her marriage perhaps burke had been wrong when hed said most marriages didnt work because one person tried to change the other she knew now that if changes werent madein both of themtheir marriage would never survive she watched him now as he stood near the oval with his trainer it was barely dawn with a light so sweet and fragile that it turned the white steeples pink the air was cool quiet enough to carry voices to her if not the words all around her the stands were empty in twentyfour hours they would be filling section by section until they and the infield grass were packed with bodies the race would last only a matter of minutes but for those few minutes every square inch would be crammed with excitement with pumping hearts and with hope it has its own magic this time of day travis erin was up and swinging her arms around him she hadnt realized until that moment how badly shed needed someone to hold on to oh its so glad i am to see you but you shouldnt be here she drew away just as quickly what about dee is she all right all right enough to throw me out she told me she could use a couple of days without my hovering over her thats nonsense and i know it but im grateful to both of you she looked beyond his shoulder to her husband he needs his friends now how about you she gave a quick laugh and a shake of her head oh he doesnt seem to need me i dont believe that but it isnt what i meant how are you holding up im tough enough to get through a few rough spots yet youre a bit pale he murmured then took her chin in his hand more than a bit im fine really could use a bit more sleep thats all then she swayed against him before she could pull herself back he was settling her into a seat just sit back ill get burke no she gripped his hand and held hard ill be all right in a second i just need to close my eyes erin if youre ill im not ill she laughed and unconsciously laid a hand on the child that was growing inside her i promise you he lifted his brow as he studied her then congratulations erin opened her eyes slowly youre a sharp one ive been through it a few times he stroked her hand until a hint of color returned to her face how does burke feel about starting a family he doesnt know steadier she sat up and was relieved to see burkes back was still to them he has enough to worry about right now dont you think this would more than balance the scales no letting out a sigh she faced travis again no i dont because im not sure he wants children at all and right now he doesnt want anything more than for me to leave him alone youre underestimating him youre his friend and yours then stand up with him until this is over let me tell him about the baby when the times right all right if you promise to take better care of yourself she smiled and kissed his cheek after tomorrow ill sleep for a week travis burke slipped under the rail i didnt expect to see you down here hate to miss a derby how are things going burke glanced over his shoulder to where the horse was being walked and cooled the colts in top form you can say were both ready to put things right the investigation slow that was true at least of the official one his own was moving quite a bit faster now that travis was here he would have someone he could trust to listen to his theory though he wore his tinted glasses erin felt his eyes on her with a nod of acknowledgment she rose ill leave you to discuss business shes worried about you travis murmured as erin walked away from the stands id prefer she didnt what id prefer is that she went back to the three aces until this is cleared up if youd wanted a quiet obedient wife you shouldnt have picked an irish one burke pulled out a cigar and contemplated it how many times have you been tempted to throttle dee in the last seven years or in the last week for the first time in days burke smiled and meant it never mind do me a favor and keep an eye on her will you i dont think shes feeling well you could try talking to her yourself im not much good at talk id like you to take her back with you after the race tomorrow arent you coming back i might have to stay in kentucky a few more days got a lead a hunch he lit the cigar and blew out smoke trouble is the racing commission likes proof want to talk about it he hesitated only because it still seemed unnatural to confide in another yeah you got a few minutes erin wasnt sure why she felt the sudden need but she walked toward the stables maybe if she could prove to herself that she was strong and capable burke would begin to believe it shed faced the gossip shed stood tall against the innuendos shed held her own but there was one thing shed yet to face one fear shed yet to vanquish so she would do it then tomorrow she would walk easily beside burke into double bluffs stall and she would stand beside him without a quiver in the winners circle three yards from the stables she stopped to give herself another lecture it was foolish to be afraid after all this time it was useless to cling to a feeling that had been caused years before by an accident shed been around animals all her life married to burke she would continue to be around them and the child she rested a hand on her stomach her child would be raised without fear of his inheritance she would walk in alone then tomorrow even if burke wished her to hell and back she would walk in beside him she went closer the scents were therethe hay the sweet smell of grain the pungent smell of horse and sweat the sounds toohooves scraping over concrete harness jingling the sighs and lazy whinnies of horses at rest shed be quiet and go carefully remembering that each step was one step closer the light changed almost from the moment she stepped inside it was dimmer softer and now there was the scent of leather as well most of the horses had already been exercised and the grooms were indulging in their own breakfasts before it came time to brush and rub and wrap shed chosen this time the least busy time so that if she bolted no one would see but she didnt bolt one of the horses dipped its head over the gate and she jumped a little but she stood her ground she could touch him erin told herself the gate was latched she could lay her hand on him just as easily as she had with burkes foal her fingers trembled a little but she laid them gingerly against the horses cheek he eyed her but when he shifted his weight she jerked back ill have to do better than that she muttered then laid her hand more firmly on his neck her palm was damp and she didnt move a muscle but she felt a little thrill of victory he was a finelooking animal she told herself as she made her hand move just a little over his neck it was the pentel colt one shed seen race nearly as often as shed seen bluff there now she managed with a sigh its not so bad my hearts thumping but im here im here she repeated silently and im coming back every day each time it would be a little easier she drew her hand back then made herself reach out again and it was easier just as it would become easier to face and overcome her insecurities with burke she wasnt going to go through life being cowed and miserable because her husband was too stubborn to accept her love and her support she might have taken him the way he was but there would be some changes made and soon when she heard voices she drew her hand back again embarrassed she didnt want one of the grooms wandering in to find her she didnt think she was quite ready to stand in the stables and hold a conversation erin wiped her damp palm on her slacks and fixed a casual smile on her face shed started out when the tone of the voices stopped her there was anger in them and though they remained quiet more than a little desperation because she hesitated she had time to recognize one of them if you want your money youll find a way i tell you the horse isnt alone for five minutes logans got him locked up like the crown jewels erins lips parted then firmed she took a step back into the shadows and listened youve got a job to do one youre paid well for if you cant get to the horse get to his feed i want him out of the running for tomorrow i aint poisoning no horse and im tired of taking all the risks you didnt have any qualms about using a hypodermic or taking ten percent of the purse from the bluegrass stakes amphetamines is one thing cyanides another that horse dies and logans not going to rest until somebody hangs for it it aint going to be me then use the drugs the voice was impatient dismissive erin found her hands balled into fists find a way or you wont see a penny if the colts found drugged in the derby hes out for the season i need this race and she needed to get to burke erin stayed still and waited for them to pass on but luck wasnt with her as she saw the two figures enter the stables she straightened her shoulders and moved forward it was a gamble but the best she could hope for was a bluff good day to you mr durnam she made her lips curve even when she saw the shock come into his eyes she glanced at the groom too one of the new ones burkes trainer had hired mrs logan durnam smiled in return but was already calculating we didnt see you in the stables just thought id look over the competition if youll excuse me burkes waiting i think not he took her arm as she tried to pass because shed been half expecting it erin was already primed to scream with surprising speed his hand clamped over her mouth good god almighty what are you doing the groom demanded loganll have your head hell have yours as well if she goes to him and blabs she heard everything you idiot because erins struggles were making him pant durnam thrust her at the groom hold on to her let me think weve got to get the hell out of here if someone comes in shut up just shut up durnams face was already sheened with sweat he took out a white handkerchief and mopped it he was a desperate man who had already taken desperate measures now it was time to take another well put her in the van until the race is over tomorrow by then ill have thought of something taking the handkerchief he pulled it around her mouth as an extra precaution he took the grooms grimy bandanna and tied it over her eyes get some rope hurry tie her hands and feet erin choked on the gag and struggled against both of them but she was already aware shed lose on a desperate impulse she worked her wedding ring off her hand and let it fall to the ground then ropes bit into her wrist and she was smothered inside a blanket she felt herself being lifted but could do no more than squirm even that was futile as the more she resisted the harder it was to breathe she heard a door open just before she was lifted up and set inside on a hard floor what the hell are we going to do with her the groom demanded as he stared down at the heap inside the blanket the minute we let her go shell talk then we wont let her go durnam leaned against the side of the van and this time mopped his brow with his sleeve everything was going to go his way he told himself hed come too far risked too much to have one woman destroy it i aint having no part in murdering a woman durnam dropped his arm and gave the groom a long narrow look you just take care of the horse and leave the woman to me they were going to kill her erin struggled to work the blanket from her face as she heard them shut the van door and walk away shed heard that in his voice even if hed promised the groom that hed cause her no harm she would have known whatever had pushed durnam to this point he wouldnt hesitate to do away with any obstacle her baby with a half sob erin twisted her wrists and fought against the rope mother of mercy she had to protect her baby and burke the panic welled up and for a moment she lost herself in it completely before shed regained control her wrists were raw and her shoulders bruised panting erin lay quiet in the dark and tried to think if she could get up somehow and find the door she might find a way of forcing it open she inched her way over to the wall then using it as a brace she managed to get to her knees she was soaked with sweat by the time shed struggled to her feet keeping her back to the wall she slid along it groping with her fingers she almost wept when she found the knob she twisted straining on her toes before she could fit her fingers around it locked she had to shake her head to keep the tears from coming of course it was locked durnam might be a brute but he wasnt a fool she tried thudding against the door hoping to draw some attention but trussed up tightly she was unable to get the momentum to make more than a quiet bump erin slid to the floor again and closing her mind to both panic and pain continued to work at the ropes have you seen erin travis continued to run his hands down his colts leg as he looked up at burke not since this morning i assumed shed gone back to the hotel maybe she could have taken a cab it was logical burke reminded himself there was no reason for the sick feeling in his stomach we came in together this morning she usually waits she was looking a little tired travis straightened she could have gone back to get some rest before tonight yeah it made sense she was probably soaking in a hot tub right now thinking about the party that night i think ill drive back and check on her ask her if shell take pity on a lonely man and save a few dances for me sure burke yeah something wrong his hands were cold icecold no nothing see you in a couple hours they stayed cold as he drove from the track toward the hotel it wasnt like erin to simply go off without a word but then they hadnt been exchanging a great many words lately his fault he accepted that with a shrug he didnt feel right about her being there and he hated seeing her brace herself against the gossip that would certainly swell before it diminished if she wasnt so damn stubborn about maintaining a social position but then that was one of the things hed promised her when theyd married he couldnt help but be grateful that she was sticking by him whatever her reasons but with gratitude came only more guilt and responsibility he was no fonder of responsibility now than hed ever been maybe it would be a relief to head the car west and keep going to start from scratch as hed done so many times before nothing had ever held him back before but then there hadnt been an erin before once the race and the scandal were behind them they would talk the air had to be cleared the rules had to be reset maybe just maybe after it was all done hed tell her about his past the way hed grown up the things hed filled his life with it was better to have it out to make it clean now and let her walk away than to continue waiting for her to find out for herself hed never thought of his past as anything to be ashamed of that was something else shed done to him shed forced him to look back at his past a little too hard and he didnt like what he saw his mood hadnt improved by the time he reached the hotel he knew it was ridiculous for him to be angry with her for leaving the track when hed demanded she leave altogether but damn it shed made him depend on her the days were easier to get through when he knew he could look around and see her he didnt care for that either by the time he walked into their suite he was primed for a fight it had been too long since theyd developed a polite veneer and no substance he was going to shout at her and let her shout back then theyd both vent the rest of their frustrations in bed erin he slammed the door behind him but had gone no farther than the center of the parlor before he knew she wasnt there and his hands were cold again cursing himself he walked into the bedroom had she left him had he pushed her away far enough consistently enough that shed decided to take that final step he didnt want to lose her that admission left him shaken as she reached for the closet door no he didnt want to lose her any more than he wanted to need her he had to make himself pull open the door of the closet and was nearly dizzy with relief when he saw her clothes undisturbed shed gone shopping he told himself or to have her hair done but those thoughts didnt relieve his mind as he closed the closet door he was pacing the suite nearly thirty minutes later when the phone rang burke pounced on it ready to rail at her no matter what her explanation burke its travis yeah is erin back at the hotel no and now his mouth was dry why lloyd pentel just brought me her wedding ring he found it on the floor in the stables what the stables he was lowering himself into a chair unaware that hed moved at all thats not right she wouldnt go in the stables shes afraid of horses burke travis kept his voice calm has she been back to the hotel no she hasnt been here i want to talk to pentel i already have he hasnt seen her burke we may be jumping the gun but i think you should call the police shed lost track of the time once shed thought the ropes had loosened but had had to accept it as wishful thinking more than her wrists hurt now there were bumps and bruises all over from a fall shed taken while trying to maneuver standing up because the fall had scared her badly with the thought of what might have happened to the baby she no longer tried to stand for a time she closed herself off and thought of burke as if she could will him to find her would he be worried had enough time passed that he would begin to wonder where she was would he care she may have prayed then slept a little while dreaming first of ireland and the farm why had she wanted to leave so badly what had been safe and secure then she dreamed of burke and knew that part of the answer was that shed been meant for him mrs logan her body jackknifed as a hand touched her shoulder the blindfold was loosened and she had to blink and struggle to focus in the dim light she made out the face of the groom and panic flooded back hed come to kill her and her baby i brought you some food you gotta promise to be quiet durnam would have my hide for coming in here like this if you promise not to scream ill take the gag off so you can eat if you make noise i put it back and you get nothing she nodded then drew in fresh air when her mouth was free it wasnt easy to smother the instinct to cry out but she could still taste the gag hed pulled from her mouth please why are you doing this if its money you want you can have it im in too deep he had a sandwich that was rapidly going stale eat some or youll get sick what difference does it make just the smell of the meat between the bread made her stomach turn youre going to kill me anyway now i dont have nothing to do with that she saw the panic in his eyes and the sweat beading on his lip he was as afraid as she was if she could use that she might yet have a chance you know what durnams going to do he cant let me go he just wants to win thats all he needs to got himself in some financial trouble and his stable isnt as good as it was charlies pride is his best shot but logans colt is better thats why he had me hire on at three aces so i could keep an eye on things and make sure the race went wrong but thats it he added glancing around he was talking too much he always talked too much when he got nervous and he wanted a drink the saliva in his mouth had dried to nothing i just sweetened the horse some thats what durnam wanted he just needs to put him out of the running you gotta understand this is business just business youre talking about races im talking about murder i dont want to hear about it i got nothing to do with that now you eat mr i dont know your name its berley maam tom berley ridiculous as it was he lifted his fingers to his cap mr berley im begging you for my life and not just for mine but for the baby im carrying you cant let him kill my baby now youll only be in trouble about the horse but this is murder an innocent child mr berley im not going to hear no more talk about killing his voice had roughened but his hands werent steady when they pulled the gag up again he no longer wanted a drink he needed one desperately he started to replace the blindfold but the look in her eyes had him hesitating there was nothing for her to see anyway he told himself the back of the van was windowless and the cab was blocked off by a wooden partition you dont want to eat thats your business ive got my own to see to he stuffed the sandwich in his pocket erin saw him look both ways before he stepped out the door again and left her in the dark chapter id prefer if youd go out and look for my wife lieutenant rather than sitting here asking me questions lieutenant hallinger was nearly sixty and after thirtyseven years on the force he figured hed seen it all and heard twice as much hed certainly experienced more than his share of frustrated and angry spouses it seemed to him that the man in front of him was both mr logan we have an apb out on your wife right now and several officers are asking questions at the track though he envied burke his cigar he didnt mention it it would help clear things up and give us a better chance of locating your wife if youd fill me in ive already told you erin hasnt come back to the hotel no ones seen her since this morning and her wedding ring was found at the stables at churchill downs some people are careless with jewelry mr logan some people what the hell was this business about some people they were talking about erin his erin where the hell was she he looked back at hallinger again and spoke precisely not erin and not with her wedding ring umhmm he made a notation in his book mr logan occasionally this sort of thing comes down to a simple misunderstanding he could have written a book hallinger thought yeah he couldve written a book on misunderstandings alone did you and your wife quarrel this morning no its possible she rented a car and decided to do a little sightseeing thats ridiculous he glanced up as travis handed him a cup of coffee burke accepted it but set it aside if erin had wanted to go for a drive she would have taken the car weve already rented she would have told me she was leaving and she would have been back two hours ago we had plans for this evening hed had plans himself which had included a nice quiet evening with his own wife and a footbath hallinger wriggled his aching toes inside his shoes derby week can be chaotic it might have slipped her mind erins the most responsible person i know if shes not here its because she cant get here he thought again of the hateful and terrifying calls hed already made to the hospitals because someones keeping her from getting here mr logan kidnapping usually prompts a ransom call youre a wealthy man yet you tell me you havent been contacted no i havent been contacted but he still broke out in a sweat every time the phone rang look lieutenant ive told you everything i know and im damn sick of going over the same ground when you should be out doing your job id go out and look myself but i feel its more important for me to stay here and wait endlessly hallinger glanced over his notes he was a thin man with small aching feet and a quiet voice he was a man who took his appearance as seriously as he took his job it was possible for him to admire burkes casually expensive shoes while noting his nerves and anxiety mr logan you had some trouble at the bluegrass stakes how did your wife feel about that she was upset naturally crushing out his cigar he rose to pace upset enough to want to avoid the crowds tonight and tomorrow upset enough to want to escape from it and you there was a flat and dangerous look in burkes eyes when he turned erin wouldnt run from anything or anyone the fact is i asked her to go back home until this thing was settled she wouldnt do it she insisted on staying and seeing it through youre a fortunate man im aware of that now why dont you get the hell out of here and find my wife hallinger simply made a note in his book and turned to travis mr grant youre the last person we know of who spoke with mrs logan this morning what was her mood she was anxious about the race about burke a little tired she told me she intended to sleep a week when the derby was over the last thing on her mind was missing the race or leaving her husband shes only been married a few weeks and shes very much in love umhmm the lieutenant said again with maddening calm her ring was found in the stables you tell me she didnt go in the stables mr logan yet she was seen walking toward them early this morning to prove a point to herself maybe i cant be sure his patience was stretching thinner by the second if shed waited for him to go with her if shed asked him to take her in stand with her hed been the one whod pulled away far enough that shed stopped asking him for anything what sort of point mr logan what patience was an integral part of hallingers job you said she might have gone inside the stables to prove a point she had an accident a few years ago and was afraid of horses over the past few weeks shes been trying to win out over it damn it what difference does it make why she went in she was there and now shes missing i work better with details when the phone rang burke jumped his face was gray with strain when he lifted the receiver yes with a muttered oath he offered it to hallinger its for you theyre going to find her burke travis touched a hand to burkes shoulder as he passed youve got to hold on to that its wrong its very wrong i can feel it it was welling up inside him beyond the first panic beyond the lingering fear was a dread a certainty if they dont find her soon its going to be too late ive got to get out of here will you stay in case a call comes in sure hallinger watched burke walk to the door and simply gestured for one of his men to follow she must have slept erin woke from the nightmare soaked with sweat and shivering with cold she murmured for burke and tried to reach out but her arms wouldnt move it wasnt just a dream she realized as she closed her eyes and took deep breaths to stem another wave of panic how long oh god how long perhaps they were just going to leave her here to go mad or slowly starve to death she wouldnt go mad because she would think of burke she would close her eyes and remember how it felt to lie beside him at night with the moonlight coming through the windows and his body warm against hers she would think about the way he would kiss her in that way he hadthat slow devastating way that made her bones melt and her mind go dim she could taste him even now she could taste him and feel the way his hand felt as he brushed it over her cheek and into her hair he had such wonderful hands so strong and hard they were always so steady always so sure sometimes at night shed reach for his hand and hold it against her cheek just to have it there she didnt think he ever knew if she concentrated hard enough she could almost feel his hand against her cheek now she could hold it there as long as she wanted when her eyes grew accustomed to the dark she could see his head on the pillow beside hers his profile was such a handsome one with its firm jaw and the sharp planes of his cheeks she liked it when it was shadowed just a bit with beard had she ever told him that he was such a pleasure to look at and if she was careful she could cuddle close not waking him the scent of his skin would lull her to sleep he always smelled as shed thought a man should without the sweetening of colognes so she could cuddle close and sometimes he would shift closer his arm stretching lazily over her waist those were the best times when she could murmur that she loved him shed told herself that if he heard it enough times in his sleep he would begin to believe it so erin kept her eyes closed and thought only of burke after a time she slept again it was nearly three but burke sat in the same chair hed gone out for only an hour driving to the track with some wild hope that he would find erin waiting for him hed prowled the stables and badgered the stable boys and grooms with the same questions the police had already asked but there was no erin nor any sign of her so hed come back to pace the parlor haunt the bedroom and ignore the coffee that travis poured for him for the past hour hed sat unmoving staring at the phone hed told travis to go to get some sleep and had been ignored it reminded him that there had only been one other person in his life who had stuck by him if he lost her he couldnt think of that he knew that luck could change could turn cruel like a change in the wind but not with erin she hadnt had her chance yet not a real one to see everything there was maybe hed been wrong to lock her in so quickly to bind her to him but she still had so much life so much energy why was it he couldnt get past that one sick thought that whatever was happening to her now was because of him when the phone rang he grabbed the receiver with both hands logan the voice in his ear was thick with liquor but he understood and his heart began to thud where is she i dont want no trouble spiking the horse was one thing but i dont want no trouble fine tell me where she is he glanced up to see travis beside him waiting i didnt want no part of it hell kill me if he finds out im talking to you just tell me where she is and ill take care of it kept her at the track in the van i dont know what hes going to do kill her maybe what van what van damn it i aint having no part in murder when the phone went dead burke simply dropped it and rose shes at the track theyre holding her in a van ill call the police and be right behind you he drove like a maniac ignoring red lights and speed limits kill her maybe those three words drummed in his head over and over so that he didnt notice the speedometer hovering at a hundred and ten the streets were deserted people were asleep anticipating the race tomorrow some would already be camped on the infield grass he prayed that erin was asleep as well and when she woke he would be there gravel spit from under the tires as he braked behind the stables vans were parked there for trainers for owners who preferred to stay close to their horses for grooms and hands who could afford a little luxury he only needed to find one he started across the lot when he heard steps behind him fists clenched and murder on his mind he whirled easy lad paddy told him travis called me he nodded briefly though in the moonlight he could see that the old man hadnt slept either durnams van which is it durnam travis said you didnt know which call it a hunch which one is durnams the big black one there paddy turned as he heard the whine of sirens the police are coming but burke was already racing to the black van erin the door held fast for a moment he thought he could tear it off with his bare hands use this paddy handed him a crowbar when travis called and filled me in i thought wed have use for it without hesitation burke began to pry the door open all the time calling to her he wanted her to know it was him he couldnt stand the thought of her having one more instant of fear the metal groaned fought back then gave burke gripped the crowbar like a weapon as he jumped inside he shoved away the plywood partition that separated the back of the van from the cab erin there was no answer no sound what if he was too late burke turned the crowbar in his hands wiping sweat on metal erin its all right ive come to take you out of here he cursed the lack of light and dropped to his hands and knees he saw her then curled in a corner in the rear he was with her in an instant but he was almost afraid to touch her his hand went to her cheek first so cold so still erin in a fit of rage he tore the gag away when her eyes fluttered open he nearly wept with relief erin its all right but when he reached for her she cringed making small sounds in her throat its all right he murmured im not going to let anyone hurt you its burke darling its okay now burke her eyes were still glazed with shock but she said his name thats right and im going to take you out of here he shifted her cursing under his breath each time she whimpered her trembles became shudders that none of his soothing words could halt he found the ropes but when he started to loosen them she cried out im sorry i have to get them off i dont want to hurt you can you stay very still she simply turned her face to the wall the van shook as men entered and she pressed back in the corner i need a knife he looked up and saw lieutenant hallinger give me a damn knife then get out shes terrified hallinger reached in his pocket with one hand and signaled his men back with the other just hold on irish its all over now he hurt her he could feel each jerk and tremble inside his own body as he cut through the bonds both his skin and hers were damp before he had freed her feet as well im going to pick you up and carry you out just stay still my arms she bit her lip as even the gentlest touch sent the pain throbbing i know as carefully as he could he lifted her up she moaned and pressed her face against his shoulder when they stepped outside the lot was bright with lights erin squeezed her burning eyes shut she couldnt think beyond the pain and fear and concentrated on the sound of burkes voice you stay the hell away from her he said very quietly his eyes on hallinger i called an ambulance travis stepped between burke and the police its here now paddy and i will follow you as if in a dream erin felt herself laid down the light was still too bright so she kept her eyes closed there were voices too many voices but she focused in on the only one that mattered she jolted as she felt something cool over the raw skin of her wrist but burke stroked her hair and never stopped talking to her he didnt know what he said promises vows nonsense but he could see the dried blood on her wrists and ankles and the bruises that ran up her arms each time she winced he thought of durnam and how he would kill him in the stables she murmured i heard them in the stables talking about drugging the horse it doesnt matter burke kept stroking her hair in the stables she repeated in a voice that was thin and tended to float i couldnt get away i tried youre safe now just lie still they wouldnt let him go with her erin was wheeled away the moment they reached the hospital and burke was left helpless and hurting in the hallway shes going to be all right travis laid a hand on his shoulder burke nodded the ambulance attendants had already assured him of that her wrists were the worst of her physical injuries they would heal just as the bruises would fade but no one knew how badly shed been scarred emotionally stay with her theres something i have to do burke youll do her more good here and yourself just stay with her he repeated then strode out through the wide glass doors he kept his mind carefully blank as he drove out to durnams farm the rage was there but he held it knowing it would cloud his thinking so he thought of nothing and his mind stayed as cool as the earlymorning air the thirtyminute drive took him fifteen but still the police were faster burke slammed out of his car in front of durnams palatial stone house and faced hallinger once again thought id see you here tonight hallinger lit one of the five cigarettes he allowed himselfwhich was five more than his wife knew about figured a sharp man like you would have already put it together that durnam was the one who had your horse drugged yeah i put that together where is he hes my guest tonight hallinger blew out smoke then leaned against the hood of burkes car if the footbath didnt work he was going to have to go see the damned podiatrist you know sometimes cops have brains too we were here questioning durnam when the call came in that you were on your way to the track to get your wife why well assuming that your wifes disappearance had something to do with the trouble last week which was a big assumption i had to figure out who had the most to gain that would be durnam i take it youd already worked that out i had everything but proof weve got that now too the man was already on the edge our call coming in was all it took to push him over hed cleaned out his bank account what was left of it knew that did you yeah i knew that had his bags packed but he wasnt going to miss that race tomorrow today hallinger corrected with a glance up at the lightening sky he wanted that derby win bad funny how people can set their minds on one thing and forget about the consequences hows your wife shes hurt where are you keeping him thats police business now mr logan he examined his cigarette thoughtfully before taking another drag i know how you feel burke cut him off with a look you dont know how i feel hallinger nodded slowly youre right and i doubt youre in the mood for advice but here it is you havent been a boy scout logan he smiled a little sourly when burke only continued to stare at him i make it my business to check details youve had a few scrapes in your time some bad luck and some good right now id say youve got yourself a good woman and a chance to make things click dont blow it on something as pitiful as charles durnam he lost a hell of a lot more than a horse race isnt that enough no burke pulled open the door of his car then paused to turn back he gets out in a year in twenty yearshes dead with some regret hallinger flipped the butt of his cigarette away ill keep that in mind when erin awoke she opened her eyes cautiously the hospital the wave of relief came as it did every time she awoke to find herself safe the light beside her bed was still burning shed hated to be weak but had insisted the nurse leave it on even when the sun was coming up burke hadnt been there shed fretted and asked for him but theyd wheeled her to a private room and tucked her into bed promising hed be with her soon she was to sleep to relax she wasnt to worry but she wanted him listless she turned her head there were already flowers in the room she imagined travis or paddy had seen to that theyd been so kind but she wanted burke shifting in search of comfort she pushed herself up in bed and she saw him he was standing by the window his back to her everything fled but the pleasure of knowing he was there with her burke he turned immediately his first thought was that she was sitting up and her cheeks were no longer pale his second thought was that if it hadnt been for him she wouldnt be in a hospital bed with bandages on her wrists because she was holding out a hand he went to her and touched it lightly youre looking better he said inadequately im feeling better i didnt know you were here ive been around awhile do you want anything i could eat she smiled and reached for his hand again but his was in his pocket ill get the nurse burke she stopped him as he reached the door it can wait look at you you havent slept busy night she tried another smile aye it was all of that im sorry his eyes went hard and flat dont ill get the nurse alone erin lay back on the pillows maybe she was still confused and disoriented he couldnt really be angry with her with a half sigh she closed her eyes of course he could there was no telling with men and with burke in particular whether it was her fault or not shed put him through hell and now she was tying him to a hospital room on the most important day of his life when the door opened again she made sure her smile was cheerful and her voice though her throat still tended to ache mirrored it you should be at the track i had no idea it was so late did anyone think to bring me a change of clothes i can be ready in ten minutes youre not going anywhere you dont expect me to miss my first derby i know what the doctor said but then youll know youre not getting up from that bed for twentyfour hours dont be stupid she opened her mouth then firmly shut it again she wouldnt argue with him shed been close to death and that made a person think about how much time was wasted on pettiness youre right of course ill just sit here and be pampered while i watch on television why didnt he come to her why didnt he hold her erin kept her lips curved as he turned again to stare out of the window youd better be on your way where to the track of course its nearly noon youve already missed the morning im staying here her heart did a quick flip but she shook her head dont be silly you cant miss this if im to be shut up here its bad enough at least i can have the pleasure of watching you step into the winners circle theres nothing for you to do here he thought of how helpless hed felt through the night of how helpless he felt now no i suppose there isnt then off with you she told him forcing her voice to be light yeah he rubbed his hands over his face and i dont want to see you back here until youve had some rest she lifted her face for a kiss but his lips only brushed over her brow see you later burke he was already out of reach youre going to win with a nod he closed the door behind him he leaned against the wall almost too exhausted to stand far too exhausted to think he didnt give a damn about the derby or any other race all he could see playing over and over in his mind was erin curled in the corner of that van cringing away from him shed bounced back smiling and talking as though nothing had happened but he could still see the white bandages on her wrists he was afraid to touch her afraid shed cringe away again or if she didnt that hed hurt her he was afraid to look at her too long because hed see that glazed shock in her eyes again he was afraid that if he didnt gather her close keep her close that shed slip away from him that he would lose her as hed nearly lost her only hours before but she was urging him to go telling him she didnt need him beside her all she needed was a win a blanket of red roses and a trophy hed damn well give them to her she hadnt realized she would be nervous but even watching the preliminaries the interviews the discussions on television kept her pulse racing when she saw burke caught by the cameras as he stepped out of the stables she laughed and hugged her pillow oh if she could just be there with him holding on but he avoided the reporter leaving erin disappointed shed wanted to hear him to see his face on the screen so that they could laugh about it later then it was the reporter facing the camera recounting the story that had unfolded since the bluegrass stakes it pleased her to hear that burkes name had been cleared absolutely and that double bluff was considered the favorite in the run for the roses she listened trying to be dispassionate as he talked about her kidnapping and durnams arrest the groom had been picked up sleeping off a bottle in a stall apparently it hadnt taken much encouragement for him to spill the entire story there were pictures of the van with its broken door and police barriers that she had to force herself to look at it almost amused her to be told that she was resting comfortably somehow the reporter made it all sound like a grand adventure something out of a mystery novelthe lady in distress the villain and the hero she wrinkled her nose however much she might consider burke a hero she didnt care to think of herself as a lady in distress she let it pass as she watched the horses being spotlighted as they were led from the paddock there was double bluff as big and as handsome as ever double bluff the threeyearold from three aces owners burke and erin logan she smiled at that though of course it was burkes horse and the news people had made a mistake it still gave her a good feeling to see her name flash on the screen with burkes she laughed at herself again because her palms were getting sweaty the track was just as shed known it would be filled to capacity the camera panned over dorothy gainsfield erin gave herself the satisfaction of sticking out her tongue then it focused on burke and her heart broke a little he looked so tired worn to the bone that was why hed been so distant before the man was exhausted when hed rested and had time to get his bearings things would be right again i love you burke she told him rubbing her cheek against the pillow loving you is what got me through then the screen flashed back to the horses it was nearly post time there was the blare of the trumpet and the roar of the crowd again erin found herself tempted to jump out of bed and hurry to the track if it hadnt been for the baby she would have ignored the doctor and done just that instead she forced herself to be patient well go to our first derby together she murmured as she placed a hand on her stomach next year the three of us will go the bell sounded and for the next two minutes she didnt take her eyes off the screen it seemed to her that double bluff was running with a vengeance and perhaps he was perhaps burke had transformed some of his emotions to the horse for the colt ran like fury when he broke from the pack early erin held her breath it was too soon she knew the jockey had been instructed to hold him back the first half mile there was no holding back today her first concern evaporated in pure excitement as she watched him run he was glorious angry and unstoppable it was as if the horse himself wanted vindication and perhaps revenge he clung to the rail taking the turns hard and close traviss apollo held back by a length the pentel colt under a new rider was coming up fast on the outside and the crowd was on its feet erin was shouting but was unaware of it even after the nurse came in as he came down the backstretch he poured on more speed impossibly more so that even the announcers voice cracked with excitement two lengths then three then three and a half he went under the wire as if he was alone on the oval he never gave up the lead erin brushed her palms over her cheeks to dry them not once congratulations mrs logan id say youve just had some of the best medicine on the market the very best but her fingers curled into the sheets as she waited for the official announcement in her mind she could picture it the weighing in the certification it seemed to take forever but then the numbers flashed on the board the very very best theres burke she gripped the nurses hand hes worked so hard for this waited so long oh i wish i could be with him she watched the cameramen and reporters vie for angles as burke and his trainer grouped in the winners circle why wasnt he smiling she wondered as she wiped another tear away she saw him reach up and shake his jockeys hand but couldnt hear whatever it was he said its a good day for three aces a reporter stuck a microphone in burkes face this must make up for the disqualification last week mr logan it doesnt begin to make up for it he patted the colts neck i think double bluff proved himself a champion here today and proved my trust in his team but this race was run for my wife he pulled a rose from the blanket covering his horse excuse me that was a lovely thing to say the nurse murmured aye still as erin watched the jockey hold the cup over his head she wondered why she felt so lost chapter hey flew home as soon as erin was released from the hospital but she didnt feel like celebrating everything should have been right burkes reputation had been cleared his prize colt had won the derby with a track record and she was safe so why was it everything was wrong she knew burke could be aloof that he could be arrogant and hardheaded those were three ridiculous reasons to love a man but they were reasons none the less what she hadnt known was that he could be both withdrawn and distant he never touched her in fact as the first few days passed erin realized he was going out of his way to avoid any opportunity to touch her he came to bed late and rose early he spent a great deal more time out of the house and away than he spent at home she tried to tell herself he was just gearing up for the preaknessthe second jewel of the triple crownbut she knew it wasnt true with too much time left to herself to think she began to remember the words shed heard on her wedding day men are easily charmed and just as easily bored was that it was he bored with her trying to find the answer she took stock of herself her face was the same maybe she was a little holloweyed but those things came with worry and restless nights her body was still firm though she knew that would change in a matter of weeks and what then she wondered when she told him about the baby would he turn away completely no she couldnt believe that of him burke would never turn his back on his own child but on her if he was tired of her now how would he feel when she began to round and swell she wanted to look forward to the changes in her body to the signs that her baby was growing and healthy but would those same changes push burke only farther away how could they not if they didnt reestablish their intimacy since the physical change couldnt be avoided erin decided shed better do something about seducing her husband now she chose the wine herself that was something she was pleased to have developed a knack for she wouldnt do any more than play at drinking it herself but it was the atmosphere that mattered and candles she set dozens of them around the bedroom lighting them so that their scent would be as much a part of the mood as the flames she chose the same gown shed worn on her wedding night the white lace that made her feel like a bride hed thought her lovely once desirable once he would again she picked the chopin hed played on their first night together and wondered if he would remember tonight would be another first another beginning when theyd loved each other when theyd finally come back together as they were meant to be she would tell him about the baby then they would talk about the future hed taken himself to the wire before he climbed the stairs burke found it easiest to wear himself out before he slipped into bed beside her that way it wasnt as difficult to stop himself from pulling her against him it wasnt as difficult to ignore the fact that she was right there next to him soft and lovely and incredibly sweet it wasnt as difficult to will himself to sleep and pretend he didnt want her but it was all a lie it was killing him to be with her and yet not to be with her still he knew no other way to wean her away to give her time to make a choice she had secrets she was keeping from him he could see them in her eyes there were times he wanted to take her by the shoulders and shake her until she told him then he would remember what she had gone through because of him and he didnt touch her at all shed been the perfect wife since theyd come back never demanding never questioning never arguing he wanted erin back then he stepped into the bedroom and his limbs went weak i thought youd never come up she crossed to him holding out a hand youre working too hard theres a lot to be done when he didnt take her hand she curled her fingers into her palm but made herself take the final step theres more to living than horses and the next race involuntarily he reached up to touch her hair i thought youd gone to bed ive been waiting for you she brought a hand to his cheek as she rose on her toes to kiss him ive missed you missed being alone with you come to bed burke make love with me i havent finished downstairs it can wait smiling she began to unbutton his shirt she was sure almost sure that she felt his response his need we havent had an evening alone in a long time it only took the feel of her bandages rubbing against his skin im sorry i only came up to see if you were all right you should get some rest the rejection stung her and she stepped back even as he did you dont want me anymore do you not want her he was nearly eaten up with wanting i want you to take care of yourself thats all youve been through a lot of strain aye and you thats why we need some time together he touched his fingers lightly to her cheek get some sleep she stared at the closed door before turning away blindly to blow out the candles erin closed herself in the office and buried herself in columns of figures those at least she could understand with numbers when you added two and two you could be assured of a logical answer life shed discovered and burke in particular wasnt quite that simple when the call came from travis that dee was in labor she found herself not only pleased for her cousin but for herself and the diversion scribbling a hasty note she left it on her desk if burke bothered to look for her hed find it if he didnt then it didnt matter where she was shed learned something else about marriage both husband and wife should stand on their own in the best of worlds this was offset by an interdependencea sharing a love of each other and a contentment in each others company in the notsobest it simply meant survival she was and always had been a survivor still she watched the house retreat as she drove toward the main road such a special place it was the kind shed always dreamed of living in the grass was green now and the flowers were in bloom it was hard to believe she could finally have something so beautiful and still be unhappy but it could be so much more than a place to live she thought just as her marriage could be so much more than an agreement between two logical adults in time burke would have to decide how much more he would permit it to be he was dealing with his own devils when he came into the house all morning and half the afternoon hed been unable to erase from his mind how lovely erin had looked the night before how hard it had been to walk away from her and from his own feelings he was no longer sure he was doing her a favor and he knew for a fact he was killing himself maybe the time had come for them to talk plain words plain thinking he didnt believe himself capable of much else it hadnt taken him long to realize he was useless without her how that had come to be and why didnt seem to matter it simply was but nagging at him gnawing at him was the question of what she would be without him hed never given her a chance to find out so theyd face off that was something he understood now was as good a time as any he glanced in her office and finding it empty passed it by in the atrium rosa was watering geraniums he paused there wishing he didnt continually find himself uncomfortable when he caught her going about her household duties rosa is erin upstairs rosa glanced up but continued her watering the senora went out a few hours ago out the panic was absurd so he told himself even as it choked him where she didnt tell me did she take her car i believe so when he swore and turned away rosa moved to a pot of asters burke yes she smiled a little and set down her watering can you have little more patience now than you did when you were ten i dont want her left alone yet you do so continually she lifted her brow at his look its difficult to pretend not to see whats under my nose your wifes unhappy so are you erins fine and so am i you would say the same when you came home with a black eye that was a long time ago its foolish to think either of us have forgotten to have a future its necessary to face the past whats the point in this rosa she did something she hadnt done since theyd been children crossing to him she touched a hand to his face shes stronger than you think my brother and you you arent nearly as tough im not ten anymore rosa no but in some ways you were easier then i was never easy it was the life that wasnt easy youve changed that maybe your mother would be proud of you she would rosa insisted when he started to back away she never had a chance no but you do and you gave one to me he made a quick gesture of dismissal i gave you a job and the first decent home ive ever known rosa added before you go answer one question why do you let me stay the truth burke he didnt want to answer but shed always had a way of looking straight and waiting for as long as it took maybe he owed her the truth maybe he owed it to himself because she cared about you and so do i she smiled then went back to watering your wife wont wait as long for an answer shes impatient like you rosa why do you stay she fluffed the leaves of a fern because i love you so does your wife if you dont mind i would like to pick some flowers for the sitting room yeah sure he left rosa there watering plants and went back to erins office it was the first time hed asked himself or allowed himself to ask why hed permitted rosa to stay why hed provided her with a job in order that she could keep her pride she was family it was just that simple and just that hard to accept shed been right too when shed said that erin wouldnt wait so long for an answer he wanted erin there where they could sit down together there where he could talk to her about his feelings that would be a first he admitted restless he began to push through the papers on her desk she was a hell of a bookkeeper he thought ruefully everything in neat little piles all the figures in tidy rows a man could hardly complain about having a conscientious wife it certainly shouldnt make him want to gather up all the books and papers and dump them in the trash it was the doctor bill that made him frown all medical expenses from her stay in kentucky should have been addressed to him yet this one was clearly marked to her annoyed he picked it up with the intention of dealing with it himself he wanted her to have no reminders but the doctors address wasnt in kentucky it was in maryland and the doctor was an obstetrician obstetrician burke lowered himself very carefully in her chair the words pregnancy test seemed to jump out at him pregnant erin was pregnant that couldnt be because he would have known she would have told him yet he had the paper in his hand the paper stated positive clearly enough and the test was dated almost a month earlier erin was pregnant and she hadnt told him what else hadnt she told him he sprang up again to push through the other papers as if hed find the answers there it was then he found her note hastily scribbled burke ive gone to the hospital i dont know how long it will take as he stared at the note he felt all the blood drain out of his face oh i dont see how dee can be so calm and patient paddy turned a page in the magazine he was pretending to read you cant hurry babies into the world it seems to be taking forever erin paced the waiting room again my palms are sweating and she looked like she could take a walk in the park its scary having babies he chuckled a little and sneaked a peek at his watch while erin wasnt looking dees an old hand at this erin laid a hand on her stomach was she this way when she had the first one i mean the first one would be the scariest its like taking everything on faith that nothings going to go wrong dees a trouper aye she prayed she would be as well when her time came it must make a difference having travis with her through it all shed seen the way hed been with dee standing beside the bed holding her hand talking making her laugh timing her contractions total support total commitment i wonder paddy do you think most men would do that would burke id say when a man loves a woman the way travis loves dee he wouldnt be anywhere else right now lass youre going to wear a rut in the floor i cant sit still she muttered im going to go downstairs and see if i can buy some flowers have them waiting for her thats a fine idea i could bring you some tea you do that wont be long now he waited until she was out of sight to get up and pace himself downstairs burke burst into the hospital like a man possessed in seconds he had pounced on the admissions clerk wheres my wife the clerk swiveled her chair over to her computer name logan erin logan when was she admitted i dont know a couple of hours ago the clerk began to punch buttons for what purpose i he wasnt sure he could deal with the purpose shes pregnant maternity the clerk continued to punch im sorry mr logan we dont have your wife i know shes here damn it where continuing to swear he pulled the paper out of his pocket dr morgan i want to see dr morgan dr morgans in delivery with another patient you can check at the nurses station on the fifth floor but she shrugged when burke raced away expectant fathers she thought they were always crazy burke jammed a fist against the elevator button he hated hospitals hed lost his mother in one only days before hed watched erin lie in one and now burke i didnt expect you he turned to see erin walking toward him with a huge arrangement of rosebuds and babys breath her hair was pulled back and her cheeks were glowing the flowers nearly tipped to the floor when he grabbed her shoulders what the hell are you doing he demanded burke youre crushing them ill crush more than a bunch of flowers i want you to tell me what youre doing im taking them upstairs if they survive i think dee will appreciate them more if theyre not mangled dee he shook his head but didnt manage to clear it what are you talking about what are you talking about she countered it doesnt seem so strange to me to buy flowers for someone whos having babies dee you came here because dees delivering well of course didnt you see my note i saw your note he muttered taking her arm he pulled her into the elevator it wasnt very clear i was in a hurry i wish theyd had more roses she murmured seems when youre having twins you should have twice as many flowers she buried her face in them a moment then smiled at him im glad you came itll mean a lot to dee struggling for calm he stepped out when the doors opened again how is she shes perfect paddy and i are a wreck but shes perfect you shouldnt be on your feet he took the flowers because he was abruptly afraid for her to carry anything you shouldnt be getting yourself worked up dont be silly she turned into the waiting room not to find paddy pacing but to find him dancing one of each he shouted to both of them shes gone and had one of each oh paddy laughing she flung herself at him and let him whirl her around shes all right and the babies everyones all right everyones fit as a fiddle so the nurse told me theyll be bringing them all out in a minute so we can have a peek a fine day to you burke a fine fine day paddy erin why dont you sit down sit she shook her head with another laugh and hooked her arm through paddys i couldnt sit if my legs fell off paddy and i are going dancing arent we paddy that we are he put his chin up and began to hum recognizing the tune erin joined in as their feet began to move burke stood holding a bushel of roses and watched them he hadnt heard her laugh like that for too long he hadnt seen her smile just that way he wanted to toss the flowers aside and gather her up snatch her away take her home hold her for hours here she is paddy did another quick jig as dee was wheeled out heres my little girl look at this he had to pull out his handkerchief and wipe his eyes theyre beautiful lass just like you what am i travis wanted to know chopped liver you did a fine job erin moved over to kiss his cheek a boy and a girl she looked down at the two bundles beside her cousin and so tiny theyll grow quick enough dee turned her head to the right then the left to nuzzle them the doctor said they have everything they should have lord they came out squalling both of them didnt they travis they have their mothers disposition its lucky you are ive my hands full burke its good of you to come this is the best time to have family around are you okay he felt both foolish and awkward as he passed the flowers to travis is there anything you want a ham sandwich she said with a sigh a huge one but im afraid theyll make me wait just a little while yet im sorry well have to take mrs grant now evening visiting hours start at seven paddy bring the children back tonight no children under twelve are allowed mrs grant the nurse said as she began to push her away dee merely smiled and mouthed the request again she looked wonderful didnt she erin mused shes a thoroughbred my dee always has been paddy stuffed his handkerchief back in his pocket well id better get home and think up a way to smuggle that brood in here tonight let me know if you need any help that i will lass he kissed both her cheeks as he walked down the hall he jumped up and clicked his heels youve been on your feet long enough burke said tersely ill drive you home ive got my car leave it he took her arm again thats silly ill just leave it he repeated pulling her into the elevator fine she bit the word off since youre sure you can bear to be in the same car with me she crossed her arms and stared at the doors burke stuck his hands in his pockets and scowled neither of them spoke again until erin stormed into the atrium if its all the same to you im going upstairs and you you can take your foul mood out to the stables with the rest of the dumb animals he wondered that her neck didnt break from holding her head that high burke gave himself thirty seconds to calm down when it didnt work he strode up the stairs after her sit down he spit out the order as he slammed the bedroom door behind him erin simply narrowed her eyes and crossed her arms i said sit down and i say to hell with you that was all it took before she could evade him he had scooped her up and plunked her down on the bed all right now im sitting dont tell me you actually want to have a conversation with me she tossed her hair back then slowly crossed her legs im all aflutter she saw his hand close into a fist and angled her chin go ahead pop me one youve been wanting to for days dont tempt me it was quite clear last night i couldnt even do that she pulled her shoes off and tossed them aside if youre so fired up to talk to me then talk yeah i want to talk to you and i want some straight answers but instead of asking he shoved his hands back into his pockets and circled the room where to start he wondered his fingers brushed over the ring hed carried for days perhaps that was the best place burke pulled it out and held it in the palm of his hand you found it erins first burst of pleasure was almost blanked out by the look in his eyes you didnt tell me you didnt ask no i didnt because i was sick about it dropping it in the stables was stupid why did you because i couldnt think of anything else i knew i couldnt get away from them they were already tying my hands she was looking at her ring and didnt see him wince i guess i thought someone would find it and take it to you and youd know though i dont know what i expected you could do about it why havent you given it back to me because i wanted to give you time to decide if you wanted it or not he took her hand and dropped the ring in it its your choice always was she said slowly but she didnt put the ring on youre still angry with me because of what happened i was never angry with you because of what happened youve been giving a champion imitation of it then it was my fault he turned to her then and for the first time began to let go of the rage twenty hours you lay in the dark for twenty hours because of me the words could still bring on a cold flash but she was more intrigued by burkes reaction i thought it was because of durnam youve never seemed willing to talk it through to let me explain to you exactly what happened if youd you could have died there was really nothing else but that no explanations no calm recounting could change that one fact i sat in that damn hotel room waiting for the phone to ring terrified that it would and there was nothing nothing i could do when i found you saw what theyd done to you your wrists theyre healing she stood to reach out to him but he withdrew immediately why do you do this why do you keep pulling away from me even at the hospital you werent there you couldnt even stay with me i went to kill durnam oh burke no i was too late for that the bitterness was still there simmering with a foul taste hed almost grown used to they had him by then where i couldnt get to him all i could do was stand in that hospital room and watch you and think of how close id come to losing you the longer i stood there the more i thought about the way id dragged you in with me right from the beginning never giving you a choice never letting you know what kind of man you were tied to thats enough do you really believe im some weakminded female who cant say yes or no i had a choice and i chose you and not for your bloody money it was her turn to rage around the room im sick to death of having to find ways to prove that i love you ill not be denying that i wanted more out of life than a few acres of dirt and someone elses dishes to wash and im not ashamed of it but hear this burke logan id have found a way to get it for myself i never doubted it you think i married you for this house she threw up her arms as if to encompass every room well set a match to it then it doesnt matter to me you think its for all those fine stocks and bonds take them all take every last scrap of paper and put it on one spin of the wheel whether you win or lose makes no difference to me and these she pulled open her dresser and yanked out boxes of jewelry these pretty shiny things well take them to hell with you i love yougod himself knows why you thickheaded miserable excuse for a man not know what kind of man i married is it she tossed the jewelry aside and stormed around the room i know well enough who and what you are more fool i am for not giving a damn and loving you anyway you dont know anything he said quietly but if youd sit down ill tell you you wont tell me anything i dont know do you think i care you grew up poor without a father oh you dont need to look that way rosa told me weeks ago do you think i care if you lied or cheated or stole i know what it is to be poor to need but i had my family cant i feel sorry for the boy without thinking less of the man i dont know she rocked him but then it seemed she never failed to do so sit down erin please im sick to death of sitting just like im sick to death of walking on eggs with you i did nearly die i thought i was going to die and all i could think was how much time wed wasted being at odds i swore if we were back together thered be no more fighting now for days ive held my temper ive said nothing when you turn away from me but no more if youve any more questions burke logan youd best out with them because ive plenty more to say myself why didnt you tell me you were pregnant that stopped her cold her mouth fell open and for all her talk about not sitting she lowered herself onto the bed how do you know burke drew out the paper hed found and handed it to her youve known for a month aye didnt you intend to tell me or were you just going to take care of it yourself i meant to tell you but what do you mean take care of it myself i could hardly keep it a secret when she stopped again as the realization hit like a wall thats what you thought id gone to the hospital for today you thought id gone there to see that there would be no baby she let the paper slip to the floor as she rose again you are a bastard burke logan that you could think that of me what the hell was i supposed to think youve had a month to tell me id have told you the day i found out i came to tell you i could hardly wait to get the words out but you started in on me about the money and the letter from my father it always came down to the money i put my heart on a platter for you time after time and you keep handing it back to me no more of that either she was ashamed of the tears but more ashamed to wipe them away ill go back to ireland and have the baby there then neither of us will be in your way before she could storm out of the room he asked you want the baby damn you for a fool of course i want the baby its our baby we made it our first night together in this bed i loved you then with my whole heart with everything i had but i dont now i detest you i hate you for letting me love you this way and never giving it back to me never once taking me in your arms and telling me you loved me erin no dont you dare touch me now not now that ive made as big a fool of myself as any woman could shed thrown up both hands to ward him off she couldnt bear to have his pity i was afraid you wouldnt want the baby and me with it when you found out that wasnt part of the bargain was it you wouldnt be so free and easy to come and go if there was a baby to think of he remembered the day shed come to tell him about the baby and the look in her eyes just as he remembered the look in her eyes when shed left without telling him he chose his words carefully now knowing hed already made enough mistakes six months ago youd have been right maybe even six weeks ago but not now its time we stopped moving in circles irish and do what its not easy for me to say what i feel its not easy for me to feel it he approached her cautiously and when she didnt back away he rested his hands on her shoulders i want you and i want the baby she closed her fingers tightly over the ring she still had in her hand why i didnt think i wanted a family i swore when i was a kid that id never let anyone hurt me the way my mother had been hurt id never let anyone mean so much that the life went out of me when they left then i went to ireland and i met you id still be there if you hadnt come back with me you asked me to come here to keep your books it was as good an excuse as any for both of us i didnt want to care about you i didnt want to need to see you just to get through the day but thats the way it was i pulled you into marriage so fast because i didnt want to give you a chance to look around and find someone better seems to me id had chance enough youd never even been with a man before do you think i married you because you had a talent in bed he had to laugh at that how would you know i doubt a woman has to bounce around between lovers to know when shes found the right one sex is as sorry an excuse to marry someone as money maybe weve both been fools me for thinking you married me for the first and you for thinking i married you for the second ive told you why i married you burke dont you think its time you told me i was afraid youd get away she sighed and tried to make herself accept that all right then thatll do she held her wedding ring out to him this belongs on my finger you should remember which one he took it and her hand the choice had been given to her and to him it wasnt every day a man was given a second chance i love you erin he saw her eyes fill and cursed himself for holding that away from both of them for so long say it again she demanded until you get used to it the ring slipped easily onto her finger i love you erin and i always will when he gathered her into his arms he felt all the gears of his life click into place you mean everything to me everything their lips met and clung it was just as sweet just as powerful as the first time were going to put down roots we already have smiling she took his face in her hands you just didnt notice cautiously he laid his palm on her stomach how soon seven months a little less there will be three of us for christmas she let out a whoop when he lifted her into his arms i wont let you down he swore it as he buried his face in her hair i know i want you off your feet as he started to lay her on the bed she grabbed his shirt thats fine with me as long as you get off yours as well he nipped her lower lip ive always said irish youre a woman after my heart the end
