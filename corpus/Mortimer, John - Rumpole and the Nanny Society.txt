john mortimer rumpole and the nanny society rumpole put on that nice scarf i gave you for christmas theres a nasty wind about and we dont want you laid up or sneezing all over the place oh and rumpole i hope you gargled this morning you wont be much good in court with a sore throat will you she who must be obeyed was in her most nannylike mode but i was halfway out the front door so i called back yes i gargled and ive got wellie boots on in case it rains so thanks nurse and i was down the stairs and off to work before she could remind me to trap the germs in my hanky and chew my food at least twenty times before swallowing it was the same on the tube government health warnings dont smoke dont drink observe personal hygiene wash fore and aft at least once a day too many calories lead to heart disease when i arrived at temple station i called in at the tasteebite for a healthy breakfast lit a small cigar coughed happily and struggled down to the old bailey to defend one of the timson family of south london villains who didnt remember that warehouse breaking is a serious danger to health before a judge who took snuff and quite failed during the ensuing sneeze to trap his germs in his red and white spotted handkerchief i was spending the day as far away as possible from the nanny society and speaking of the nanny society reminds me of a small mystery i was able to penetrate by the use of a logical mind and that common sense which is far more important in the life of an old bailey hack than any knowledge of the law it started one summer my wife hilda was away on a visit to her friend dodo macintosh in cornwall a treat i had managed to avoid by pleading pressure of work in fact work wasnt very pressing that summer even the timsons seemed to have stopped burgling and gone off to the costa del crime i was looking after myself in the gloucester road and spending the evenings in the old crouchback arms which is handy for froxbury mansions i was in there one evening when i found myself at a table near three youngish goodlooking girls a blonde with a swedish accent a darkhaired girl with an irish brogue and a redheaded english girl they were drinking respectively a pint of beer a guinness and a repellant mixture of avocat and lemonade which i learnt from dot clopton our beautiful typist is called a snowball i thought at first they were discussing their lovers or even husbands you should try living with justin said the english girl the buggers got such a filthy temper throws his breakfast at you and then sulks my nevilles quite goodlooking the irish voice complained but hes thicker than two planks cant do up his shoelaces let alone zip up his flies im thinking of leaving my max the swede said he swears horribly and collects pictures of madonna and hes always sick at parties thinking how unhappy their love lives must be i shot a smile in their direction the english girl looked through me so i turned my attention to my bangers and mash tepid from the microwave i listened hard to their subsequent conversation but they made no mention of me i did discover however that they were called petronela siobhan and kirsti that they were all three nannies and what they had been discussing were not the character defects of their lovers but their charges soon the conversation turned to the failings of their employers from whose loins max justin and neville had sprung mrs gregthorpe stays in bed drinking all morning she gets up at lunchtime and complains shes feeling exhausted im really sorry for poor mr gregthorpe he looks so sad sometimes kirsti was smiling quite cheerfully as she told them this mrs reels carrying on with a turkish estate agent siobhan said and whenever mr reel sees me he sings when irish eyes are shining in a fake dublin accent the spokes have a fluffy cover on their loo seat petronella spoke with disgust and judge spoke told me they have specially friendly parties once a month so they send justin to stay with his granny and hed like me to join in a judge said that siobhan was surprised i wasnt i think hes a rather common sort of judge petronella told them a few nights later they were in the crouchback again spreading even more malicious gossip kirsti said she had come home from shopping and was honestly surprised and delighted to see petronela coming out of the gregthorpes home in launceston place it seemed that justin and max went to the same nursery school and petronella had forgotten the date of maxs birthday party and mr gregthorpe remembered it kirsti was laughing at such improbability he did i was amazed he seemed to have a terrible cold i thought he was rather sad and mrs gregthrope was drunk in bed upstairs poor mr gregthorpe is very sad but not attractive oh no petronela agreed not at all attractive later on my way to the gents i passed petronella telephoning in the draughty passage i overheard her saying something which i had good cause to remember in the months to come a week later petronella and siobhan were having a drink together but there was no sign of kirsti i listened hard and soon learned the reason mrs gregthorpe had missed a valuable emerald and diamond ring for some reason she had suspected kirsti and searched her room it was not long before she found the precious jewellery hidden away among the swedish girls sweaters mrs gregthorpe had telephoned the police and her nanny was now under arrest and charged with theft before i left the pub that night i wrote the name and number of mr bernard the timsons family solicitor on a piece of paper and handed it to siobhan telling her the best legal team in the country was at the disposal of their friend she smiled and thanked me promising to hand over the glad tidings to the unfortunate swede tell her not to have a moments fear i told them rumpole of the bailey is galloping to the rescue it never looked an easy case and didnt start well when it came on before judge bullingham the mad bull in number court at the old bailey kirsti had told the police she hadnt taken the ring had no idea how it got among her sweaters the prosecution opening suggested that there could only be one explanation mrs gregthorpe gave evidence a diamond in the ring needed resetting and she had given it to her husband about four days previously in its box to take to the jewellers as was his habit he had forgotten to do this and the box stayed in his study until the day after maxs birthday party which was the twentysecond of june then she had asked about the ring and was told it was still in the study she opened the box she said to make sure it was still there and found to her horror that the box was empty they started to search the house and kristi being out fetching max from nursery school they went through her clothes and found the ring james gregthorpe was called next he agreed that his wife gave him the ring to take to the jewellers on the nineteenth of june so far as he knew no one had taken it from his study but when he and his wife looked in the box on the twentythird it was gone he was a tall fairly handsome man with soft spaniels eyes and a certain weakness about the mouth he seemed nervous while looking i thought with genuine concern at the girl in the dock when he did she smiled back bravely and a hint of defence began to form in my mind gregthorpe and kirsti i thought had more in common than the care of little max they were people who had been or perhaps still were in love mr gregthorpe i asked when i rose to crossexamine were you in love with your son maxs nanny mr rumpole the mad bull scarlet in the face lowered his head and charged into the arena how can this be relevant if your lordship refuses to allow the question i said i shall go straight to the court of appeal about the only thing the bull fears is the court of appeal you may ask it i suppose he grumbled i very much doubt if itll do you much good with the jury i thought she was a very nice girl gregthorpe conceded i wont say i was in love with her did you ever tell anyone you were in love with her or had been in love with her no there mr rumpole the mad bull roared with considerable satisfaction youve got your answer but i hadnt not quite when the proseuction evidence was finished i said i wouldnt be calling my client everything she knew about the matter was in her statement to the police but i would be calling a miss petronella sanderson who was in court and prepared to give evidence on behalf of the defence petronella went into the box and seemed confident enough she gave kirsti an excellent character and then i asked her about the day my client had seen her coming out of the house in launceston place she said shed spoken to mr gregthorpe on that occasion but mrs gregthorpe was upstairs in bed how long were you in the house petronella paused looked at kirsti and said i suppose about half an hour perhaps more half an hour to find out that date of maxs birthday party we talked about other things had you met james gregthorpe before yes petronella looked uneasy how many times perhaps half a dozen the boys went to the same nursery school and did you talk about kirsti yes sometimes what did he tell you about kirsti i looked among my papers hoping to convince the witness that i had a statement from kirsti detailing the conversation the trick worked did he tell you they were lovers it was a risk one of the biggest i have taken the rule is never to ask a question unless you know the answer but from kirstis look of panic and petronellas confusion i knew id scored a bulls eye well yes she said if you like he told me hed been in love with her not if i like is that the truth yes petronella was quiet now almost inaudible so that the bull had to roar keep your voice up miss sanderson yes my lord and what was the date of this conversation it was two days before maxs birthday so this was on the twentieth of june did you speak to mr gregthorpe in his study yes where we know the box with the ring in it was did james gregthorpe leave the room while you were there together i think he went to the lavatory he wasnt feeling well how long was he away i suppose five minutes time enough for you to take the ring run up the stairs with it to kirstis room and hide it among the sweaters she wouldnt be wearing in june the learned counsel for the prosecution was summoning up his strength to object to my crossexamining my own witness so i carried on without drawing a breath because you wanted to get kirsti into trouble get her sent to prison and perhaps back to sweden why because you were jealous of her because you were having an affair with gregthorpe yourself and that was why you kept meeting i dont know where you met but i do know you were jealous of kirsti hed been in love with her perhaps he was in love with her still it was a chance too good to miss isnt that the truth miss petronella sanderson petronella was silent she was looking round the court amazed and frightened she stared at kirsti as through she must have discovered the truth but kirsti looked away she looked at the bull but he was indulging in a rare moment of silence she looked at the jury but they stared back at her without smiling she avoided looking at me then she lowered her eyes and quietly in the stillness of the court she said i dont think you can prove any of that it wasnt an admission but then it wasnt a denial either it was enough to make the jury think that my reconstruction of the events might be true enough to give them a reasonable doubt so that they could do what they secretly wanted to do and acquit the blonde and beautiful swede whatever gave you the idea that petronella and gregthorpe were having an afair bonny bernard my instructing solicitor and partner in crime asked as we left the court i heard her telephoning james from a pub she said he must be careful of his cold and be sure to wear his raincoat when he went out and not get wet when a woman starts to treat a man as though she were his nanny you may be sure she has some deep and lasting relationship with him the end
