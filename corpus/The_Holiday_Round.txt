the holiday round contents holiday time the housewarming at play two stories an odd lot little plays for amateurs a chapter of accidents stories of successful lives a few friends epilogue holiday time i the ordeal by water we will now bathe said a voice at the back of my neck i gave a grunt and went on with my dream it was a jolly dream and nobody got up early in it we will now bathe repeated archie go away i said distinctly archie sat down on my knees and put his damp towel on my face when my wife and i took this commodious residence for six weeks he said and engaged the sea at great expense to come up to its doors twice a day it was on the distinct understanding that our guests should plunge into it punctually at seven oclock every morning dont be silly its about three now and i wish youd get off my knees its a quarterpast seven then there you are weve missed it well we must see what we can do for you tomorrow goodnight archie pulled all the clothes off me and walked with them to the window jove what a day he said and cant you smell the sea i can let that suffice i say whats happened to my blanket i must have swallowed it in my sleep wheres his sponge i heard him murmuring to himself as he came away from the window no no im up i shouted and i sprang out of bed and put on a shirt and a pair of trousers with great speed where do i take these off again i asked i seem to be giving myself a lot of trouble there is a tent wont the ladies want it because if so i can easily have my bathe later on the ladies think its rather too rough today perhaps theyre right i said hopefully a womans instinct no im not a coward it wasnt so bad outside sun and wind and a blueandwhite sky and plenty of movement on the sea just the day for a swim said archie cheerily as he led the way down to the beach ive nothing against the day its the hour i object to the lancet says you mustnt bathe within an hour of a heavy meal well im going to have a very heavy meal within about twenty minutes that isnt right you know by the time i was ready the wind had got much colder i looked out of the tent and shivered isnt it jolly and fresh said archie determined to be helpful there are points about the early morning after all there are plenty of points about this morning where do they get all the sharp stones from look at that one there hes simply waiting for me you ought to have bought some bathing shoes i got this pair in the village why didnt you tell me so last night it was too late last night well its much too early this morning if you were a gentleman youd lend me one of yours and wed hop down together archie being no gentleman he walked and i hobbled to the edge and there we sat down while he took off his shoes i should like to take this last opportunity i said of telling you that up till now i havent enjoyed this early morning bathe one little bit i suppose there will be a notable moment when the ecstasy actually begins but at present i cant see it coming at all the only thing i look forward to with any pleasure is the telling dahlia and myra at breakfast what i think of their cowardice that and the breakfast itself goodbye i got up and waded into the surf one last word i said as i looked back at him in my whole career i shall never know a more absolutely beastly and miserable moment than this then a wave knocked me down and i saw that i had spoken too hastily the world may be divided into two classes those who drink when they swim and those who dont i am one of the drinkers for this reason i prefer river bathing to sea bathing its about time we came out i shouted to archie after the third pint im exceeding my allowance arent you glad now you came he cried from the top of a wave very i said a moment later from inside it but i really did feel glad ten minutes afterwards as i sat on the beach in the sun and smoked a cigarette and threw pebbles lazily into the sea holbein how brave of you cried a voice behind me goodmorning im not at all sure that i ought to speak to you have you really been taking the sea so early said myra as she sat down between us or did you rumple each others hair so as to deceive me i have been taking the sea i confessed what you observe out there now is what i left oh but thats what i do thats why i didnt come today because i had so much yesterday im a threebottle man i can go on and on and on and after all these years i have the most sensitive palate of any man living for instance i can distinguish between scarborough and llandudno quite easily with my eyes shut speaking as an expert i may say that there is nothing to beat a small cromer and seltzer though some prefer a ventnor and dash ilfracombe with a slice of lemon is popular but hardly appeals to the fastidious do you know said archie that you are talking drivel nobody ought to drivel before breakfast it isnt decent what does dahlia want to do today myra mr simpson is coming by the onethirty good then well have a slack day the strain of meeting simpson will be sufficient for us i do hope he comes in a yachting cap well send him back if he doesnt i told him to bring one said myra i put a ps in dahlias letter please bring your telescope and yachting cap she thought we could have a good days sailing tomorrow if youd kindly arrange about the wind ill talk to the crew about it and see what he can do if we get becalmed we can always throw somebody overboard of course well i must go in and finish my toilet we got up and climbed slowly back to the house and then i said then for the heavy meal ii becalmed well said dahlia giving up the tiller with a sigh if this is all that you and joe can do in the way of a breeze you neednt have worried dont blame the crew said archie nobly he did his best he sat up all night whistling are we moving asked myra from a horizontal position on the shady side of the mainsail we are not i said from a similar position on the sunny side lets get out simpson took off his yachting cap and fanned himself with a nautical almanac how far are we from anywhere he asked cheerfully miles said archie to be more accurate we are five miles from a publichouse six from a church four from a postoffice and three from the spacious walledin kitchengarden and tenniscourt on the other hand we are quite close to the sea you will never see your friends again simpson they will miss you at first perhaps but they will soon forget the circulation of the papers that you wrote for will go up the brindled bullpup will be fed by another and a smaller hand but otherwise all will be as it was before my voice choked and at the same moment something whizzed past me into the sea yachting cap overboard help cried myra you arent in the spectator office now simpson said archie severely as he fished with the boathook there is a time for ballyragging by the way i suppose you do want it back again its my fault i confessed remorsefully i told him yesterday i didnt like it myra and i do like it mr simpson please save it archie archie let it drip from the end of the boathook for a minute and then brought it in morning sir thomas i said saluting it as it came on board lovely day for a sail weve got the new topmast up but her grace had the last of the pottedmeat for lunch yesterday simpson took his cap and stroked it tenderly thirteen and ninepence in the buckingham palace road he murmured thanks old chap quiet settled down upon the good ship armadillo again there was no cloud in the sky no ripple on the water no sound along the deck the land was hazy in the distance hazy in the distance was publichouse church postoffice walledin kitchengarden and tenniscourt but in the little cabin joe was making a pleasant noise with plates splendid said archie putting down his glass and taking out his pipe now what shall we do i feel full of energy then you and simpson can get the dinghy out and tow i suggested ill coach from the armadillo we might go for a long bicycle ride said myra or call on the vicarage girls there isnt really very much to do is there said dahlia gently im sorry simpson leapt excitedly into the breach ill tell you what ill do ill teach you all the different knots and things i learnt them coming down in the train everybody ought to know them archie old man can you let me have a piece of rope certainly take any piece you like only spare the mainsheet simpson went forward to consult joe and came back with enough to hang himself with he sat down opposite to us wrapped the rope once round his waist and then beamed at us over his spectacles now supposing you had fallen down a well he began and i let this rope down to you what would you do with your end we thought deeply for a moment i should wait until you were looking over the edge and then give it a sharp jerk said archie one must have company in a well i agreed theyre being silly again apologized myra tell me mr simpson i should love to know im always falling down wells well you tie it round you like this through there and over there and then back under there you see it simply cant slip then i should pull you up but how nice of you let me try oh yes thats easy well then theres the hangmans knot archie and i looked at each other the predicaments in which simpson finds himself are extraordinarily varied i said one of these days hell be in a well and we shall let down a rope to him and hell hang himself by mistake that would look very determined on the other hand there must be annoying occasions when he starts out to strangle somebody and finds that hes pulling him out of the cistern why how delightful mr simpson said myra do show us some more those are the most important ones then there are one or two fancy ones do you know the monkeys claw dont touch it said archie solemnly its poison oh i must show you that joe showed me the monkeys claw afterwards and it is a beautiful thing but it was not a bit like simpsons simpson must have started badly and i think he used too much rope after about twenty minutes there was hardly any of him visible at all take your time houdini said archie take your time just let us know when youre ready to be put into the safe thats all you would hardly think to look at him now i said a minute later that one day hell be a dear little butterfly wheres the sealingwax maria you know im certain hell never go for threepence what i say is its simply hypnotic suggestion theres no rope there at all really an anxious silence followed no said simpson suddenly im doing it wrong from tonight said archie after tea you will be put on rations one cobnut and a thimbleful of sherry wine per diem i hope somebodys brought a thimble there really isnt so very much left said dahlia then we shall have to draw lots who is to be eaten dont we eat our boots and things first asked myra the doctor says i mustnt have anything more solid than a lightlyboiled shoelace the last thing at night after all theres always the dinghy said archie if we put in a tin of corned beef and a compass and a keg of gunpowder somebody might easily row in and post the letters personally as captain i must stick to my ship theres another way ive just thought of i said lets sail in i pointed out to sea and there unmistakably was the least little breeze coming over the waters a minute later and our pennant napped once simpson moistened a finger and held it up the sprint for home had begun iii a day ashore well which is it to be asked archie just whichever you like said dahlia only make up your minds well i can do you a very good line in either ive got a lot of sea in the front of the house and theres the armadillo straining at the leash and ive had some land put down at the back of the house and theres the silentknight eating her carburettor off in the kennels oh what can ail thee silentknight alone and palely loitering asked simpson keats he added kindly ass shakespeare i said of course if we sailed simpson went on eagerly and we got becalmed again i could teach you chaps signalling archie looked from one to the other of us i think that settles it he said and went off to see about the motor little chagford said archie as he slowed down where are we going to by the way i thought wed just go on until we found a nice place for lunch and then on again till we found a nice place for tea added myra and so home to dinner i concluded speaking for myself began simpson oh why not i should like to see a church where katharine of aragon or somebody was buried samuels morbid craving for sensation wait till we get back to london and ill take you to madame tussauds mr simpson well i think hes quite right said dahlia there is an old norman church i believe and we ought to go and see it the philistines neednt come in if they dont want to philistines i said indignantly well im agagged suggested archie oh no he was an amalekite youve lived in the same country as this famous old norman church for years and years and years and you care so little about it that youve never been to see it and arent sure whether it was katharine of aragon or aliceforshort who was buried here and now that you have come across it by accident you want to drive up to it in a brandnew motorcar with simpson in his gents fancy vest knocking out the ashes of his pipe against the lychgate as he goes in and thats what it is to be one of the elect little chagfords noted backchat comedians commented archie your turn dahlia there was once a prince who was walking in a forest near his castle one day thats how all the nice stories begin and he suddenly came across a beautiful maiden and he said to himself ive lived here for years and years and years and ive never seen her before and im not sure whether her name is katharine or alice or where her uncle was buried and ive got a new surcoat on which doesnt match her wimple at all so lets leave her and go home to lunch and thats what it is to be one of the elect dont go on too long said archie there are the performing seals to come after you i jumped out of the car and joined her in the road dahlia i apologize i said you are quite right we will visit this little church together and see who was buried there myra looked up from the book she had been studying jovial jaunts round jibmouth there isnt a church at little chagford she said at least there wasnt two years ago when this book was published so that looks as though it cant be very early norman then lets go on said archie after a deep silence we found a most delightful little spot which wasnt famous for anything for lunch and had the baskets out of the car in no time now are you going to help get things ready asked myra or are you going to take advantage of your sex and watch dahlia and me do all the work i thought women always liked to keep the food jobs for themselves i said i know im never allowed in the kitchen at home besides ive got more important work to do im going to make the fire what fire you cant really lead the simple life and feel at home with nature until you have laid a fire of twigs and branches rubbed two sticks together to procure a flame and placed in the ashes the pemmican or whatever it is that falls to your rifle well i did go out to look for pemmican this morning but there were none rising then i shall have my ham sandwich hot bread butter cheese eggs sandwiches fruit catalogued dahlia as she took them out what else do you want im waiting here for cake i said bother i forgot the cake look here this picnic isnt going with the swing that one had looked for no pemmican no cake no early norman church we might almost as well be back in the cromwell road does your whole happiness depend on cake asked myra scornfully to a large extent it does archie i called out theres no cake archie stopped patting the car and came over to us good lets begin he said im hungry you didnt hear i said there wasnt any cake on the contrary there is an entire absence of it a shortage a vacuum not to say a lacuna in the place where it should be there is an aching void or mere hardboiled eggs or something of that sort i say doesnt anybody mind except me apparently nobody did so that it was useless to think of sending archie back for it instead i did a little wristwork with the corkscrew now said archie after lunch before you all go off with your butterfly nets id better say that we shall be moving on at about halfpast three that is unless one of you has discovered the slot of a large cabbage white just then and is following up the trail very keenly i know what im going to do i said if the flies will let me alone tell me quickly before i guess begged myra im going to lie on my back and think about who do you think do the hardest work in the world stevedores then i shall think about stevedores are you sure asked simpson that you wouldnt like me to show you that signalling now i closed my eyes you know i wonder sometimes what it is that makes a picnic so pleasant because all the important things the eating and the sleeping one can do anywhere iv in the wet myra gazed out of the window upon the driving rain and shook her head at the weather ugh she said ugly beast i added in order that there should be no doubt about what we thought utter and deliberate beast we had arranged for a particularly pleasant day we were to have sailed across to the mouth of the i always forget its name and then up the river to the famous old castle ofofno its gone again but anyhow there was to have been a bathe in the river and lunch and a little exploration in the dinghy and a lesson in the morse code from simpson and tea in the woods with a real fire and in the cool of the evening a ripping run home before the wind but now the only thing that seemed certain was the cool of the evening well light a fire and do something indoors said dahlia this is an extraordinary house said archie there isnt a single book in it except a lot of strand magazines for that must have been a very wet year we can play games dear true darling lets do a charade the last time i played charades i said i was horatius the front part of elizabeths favourite palfrey the arrow which shot rufus jonah the two little princes in the tower and mrs pankhurst which was your favourite part asked myra the front part of the palfrey but i was very good as the two little princes its no good doing charades if theres nobody to do them to thomas is coming tomorrow said myra we could tell him all about it clumps is a jolly good game suggested simpson the last time i was a clump i said i was the first coin paid on account of the last pair of boots sandals or whatnot of the man who laid the first stone of the house where lived the prettiest aunt of the man who reared the goose which laid the egg from which came the goose which provided the last quill pen used by the third man shakespeare met on the second wednesday in june he mightnt have had an aunt said myra after a minutes profound thought he hadnt well anyhow one way and another youve had a very adventurous career my lad said archie what happened the last time you played ludo when i played clumps put in simpson i was the favourite spoke of hall caines first bicycle they guessed hall caine and the bicycle and the spoke very quickly but nobody thought of suggesting the favourite spoke myra went to the window again and came back with the news that it would probably be a fine evening thank you we all said but i wasnt just making conversation i have an idea silence for myras idea well its this if we cant do anything without an audience and if the audience wont come to us lets go to them be a little more lucid theres a dear it isnt that we arent trying well then lets serenade the other houses about here tonight there was a powerful silence while everybody considered this good said archie at last we will the rest of the morning and all the afternoon were spent in preparations archie and myra were all right one plays the banjo and the other the guitar it is a musical family the mannerings simpson keeps a cornet which he generally puts in his bag but i cannot remember anyone asking him to play it if the question has ever arisen he has probably been asked not to play it however he would bring it out tonight in any case he has a tolerable voice while dahlia has always sung like an angel in short i was the chief difficulty i suppose there wouldnt be time to learn the violin i asked why didnt they teach you something when you were a boy wondered myra they did but my man forgot to put it in my bag when he packed he put in two toothbrushes and left out the triangle do you think theres a triangle shop in the village i generally play on an isosceles one any two sides of which are together greater than the third likewise the angles which are opposite to the adjacent sides each to each well you must take the cap round for the money i will i forgot to say that my own triangle at home the strad is in the chromatic scale of a and has a splice it generally gets the chromatics very badly in the winter while the others practised their songs i practised taking the cap round and by teatime we all knew our parts perfectly i had received permission to join in the choruses and i was also to be allowed to do a little dance with myra when you think that i had charge of the financial arrangements as well you can understand that i felt justified in considering myself the leader of the troupe in fact i said you ought to black your faces so as to distinguish yourselves from me we wont black our faces said dahlia but well wear masks and we might each carry a little board explaining why were doing this right said archie and he sat down and wrote a notice for himself i am an orphan so are the others but they are not so orphan as i am i am extremely frequent dahlia said we are doing this for an advertisement if you like us send a shilling for a free sample concert mentioning this paper your money back if we are not satisfied with it simpson announced worlds long distance cornetist holder of the oboe record on grass runnerup in the ocarina welter weights strangle hold barred mixed zither champion covered courts myra said kind friends help us we were wrecked this afternoon the cornet was sinking for the third time when it was rescued and had to be brought round by artificial respiration can you spare us a drink of water as for myself i had to hand the simpson yachting cap round and my notice said we want your money if you cannot give us any for heavens sake keep the cap we had an early dinner so as to be in time to serenade our victims when they were finishing their own meal and feeling friendly to the world then we went upstairs and dressed dahlia and myra had kimonos simpson put on his dressinggown in which he fancies himself a good deal and archie and i wore brilliantlycoloured pyjamas over our other clothes lets see said simpson i start off with the minstrel boy dont i and then what do we do then we help you to escape said archie after that dahlia sings santa lucia and myra and i give them a duet and if youre back by then with your false nose properly fixed it might be safe for you to join in the chorus of a coon song now then are we all ready whats that said myra we all listened and then we opened the door it was pouring v marooned stroke youre late said thomas butting me violently in the back with his oar my dear thomas when you have been in the admiralty a little longer you will know that bow is not the gentleman who sets the time what do you suppose would happen at queens hall if the second birdcall said to the conductor henry youre late the whole gallery would go out and get its hair cut said archie im not used to the morse system of rowing thats the trouble explained thomas longshort shortshortlong shortlong youre spelling out the most awful things if you only knew be careful how you insult me thomas a little more and i shall tell them what happened to you on the ornamental waters in regents park that rough day really asked simpson with interest yes i fancy he had been rather overdoing it at swedish drill that morning we gave her ten in silence and then by mutual consent rested on our oars theres a long way yet said myra dahlia and i will row if youre tired this is an insult thomas shall we sit down under it yes said thomas getting up only in another part of the boat we gave up our seats to the ladies even in a boat one should be polite and from a position in the stern waited with turnedup coatcollars for the water to come on board we might have sailed up a little higher remarked simpson its all right im not a bit wet thanks its too shallow except at high tide said myra the armadillo would have gone aground and lost all her her shell do armadilloes have shells or what feathers well were a pretty good bankholiday crowd for the dinghy said archie simpson if we upset save the milk and the sandwiches my wife can swim the woods were now beginning to come down to the river on both sides but on the right a grassy slope broke them at the waters edge for some fifty yards thither we rowed and after a little complicated manoeuvring landed suddenly simpson who was standing in the bows with the boathook being easily the first to reach the shore he got up quickly however apologized and helped the ladies and the hampers out thereafter he was busy for some time making the dinghy fast with a knot peculiarly his own the first thing to do is to build a palisade to keep the savages off said archie and he stuck the boathook into the ground after which you are requested to light fires to frighten the wild beasts the woodbines are very wild at this time of the year we shall have to light a fire anyhow for the tea so that will be very useful said the thoughtful dahlia i myself i said will swim out to the wreck for the musket and the bag of nails as youre going said myra unpacking you might get the sugar as well weve forgotten it now youve spoilt my whole holiday it was bad enough with the cake last week but this is far far worse i shall go into the wood and eat berries its all right here it is now youre happy again i wish if you arent too busy youd go into the wood and collect sticks for the fire i am unusually busy i said and there is a long queue of clients waiting for me in the anteroom an extremely long queue almost a halfbutt in fact i wandered into the wood alone archie and dahlia had gone arminarm up the hill to look at a view simpson was helping myra with the hampers and thomas the latest arrival from town was lying on his back telling them what he alleged to be a good story now going round london myra told it to me afterwards and we agreed that as a boy it had gone round the world several times first yet i heard her laugh unaffectedly what angels women are ten minutes later i returned with my spoil and laid it before them a piece of brown bread from the breadfruit tree a piece of indiarubber from the mango tree a chutney from the banana grove and an omelet from the turtle run i missed the chutney with my first barrel and brought it down rather luckily with the ricochet but how funny they all look just like sticks of wood that is natures plan of protective colouring in the same way apricots have often escaped with their lives by sitting in the cream and pretending to be poached eggs the same instinct of selfpreservation added archie has led many a pill called beauchamp to pronounce its name cholmondeley simpson begged to be allowed to show us how to light a fire and we hadnt the heart to refuse him it was he said the way they lit fires on the veldt and other places where they wanted fires and it went out the first time because the wind must have changed round after he had begun to lay the wood he got the draught in the right place the next time and for a moment we thought we should have to take to the boats but the captain averted a panic and the fire was got under then the kettle was put on and of all the boiled water i have ever tasted this was the best you know said archie in simpson the nation has lost a wonderful scoutmaster oh samuel cried myra tell us how you tracked the mules that afternoon and knew they were wounded because of the blood tell us about that time when you bribed the regimental anchovy of troop b to betray the secret password to you i ignore you because youre jealous may i have some more tea miss mannering call me myra scoutmaster simpson of the spectator troop and you shall i blush for my unblushing sex said dahlia i blush for my family said archie that a young girl of gentle birth nurtured in a peaceful english home brought up in an atmosphere of oldworld courtesy should so far forget herself as to attempt to wheedle a promising young scoutmaster who can light a fire practically speaking backwards this i repeat is too much it was thomas who changed the subject so abruptly i suppose the tide comes as far as this he said it does captain then that would account for the boat having gone that and simpsons special knot i said keeping calm for the sake of the women and children archie jumped up with a shout the boat was about twenty yards from the shore going very slowly upstream its very bad to bathe just after a heavy meal i reminded him im not sure that im going to but im quite sure that one of us will have to walk up the river with it said myra while dahlia and i pack and the one whos first digested goes in we walked up i felt that in my own case the process of assimilation would be a lengthy one vi a little cricket for an ending we came back from a men only sail to find myra bubbling over with excitement ive got some news for you she said but im not going to tell you till dinner be quick and change bother shes going to get married i murmured myra gurgled and drove us off put on all your medals and orders thomas she called up the stairs and archie its a champagne night i believe old fellow said simpson shes married already half an hour later we were all ready for the news just a moment myra said archie id better warn you that were expecting a good deal and that if you dont live up to the excitement youve created youll be stood in the corner for the rest of dinner shes quite safe said dahlia of course i am well now im going to begin this morning about eleven i went and had a bathe and i met another girl in the sea horribly crowded the sea is getting nowadays commented archie and she began to talk about what a jolly day it was and so on and i gave her my card i mean i said im myra mannering and she said im sure youre keen on cricket i like the way girls talk in the sea said archie so direct what is there about our myra i asked that stamps her as a cricketer even when shes only got her head above water shed seen me on land silly well we went on talking and at last she said will you play us at mixed cricket on saturday and a big wave came along and went inside me just as i was saying yes hooray myra your health were only six though added archie didnt you swim up against anybody else who looked like a cricketer and might play for us but we can easily pick up five people by saturday said myra confidently and oh i do hope were in form we havent played for years we lost the toss and myra led her team out on to the field the last five places in the eleven had been filled with care a preparatory schoolboy and his little sister found by dahlia on the beach miss debenham found by simpson on the road with a punctured bicycle mrs oakley found by archie at the station and rediscovered by myra in the channel and sarah a jolly girl of sixteen found by me and thomas in the tobacconists where she was buying the sportsman where would you all like to field asked the captain lets stand round in groups just at the start and then see where were wanted whos going to bowl me and samuel i wonder if i dare bowl overhand im going to said simpson you cant not with your left hand why not hirst does then i shant field point said thomas with decision however as it happened it was short leg who received the first two balls beautiful swerving wides while the next two were well caught and returned by third man simpsons range being thus established he made a determined attack on the over proper with lobs and managed to wipe off half of it encouraged by this he returned with such success to overhand that the very next ball got into the analysis the batsman reaching out and hitting it over the hedge for six two more rangefinders followed before simpson scored another dot with a sneak and then at what should have been the last ball a tragedy occurred wide said the umpire but but i was bbowling underhand stammered simpson now youve nothing to fall back on i pointed out simpson considered the new situation then you fellows cant mind if i go on with overhand he said joyfully and he played his twelfth it was the batsmans own fault like a true gentleman he went after the ball caught it up near point and hit it hard in the direction of cover sarah shot up a hand unconcernedly one for six said simpson and went over to miss debenham to explain how he did it he must come off said archie we have a reputation to keep up its his left hand of course but we cant go round to all the spectators and explain that he can really bowl quite decent long hops with his right in the next over nothing much happened except that miss debenham missed a sitter subsequently simpson caught her eye from another part of the field and explained telegraphically to her how she should have drawn her hands in to receive the ball the third over was entrusted to sarah so far said dahlia half an hour later the rabbits have not shone sarah is doing it all hang it dahlia thomas and i discovered the child give the credit where it is due well why dont you put my bobby on then boys are allowed to play righthanded you know so bobby went on and with sarahs help finished off the innings jolly good rot he said to simpson youre having to bowl lefthanded my dear robert i said mr simpson is a natural baseball pitcher he has an acquired swerve at bandy and he is a lepidopterist of considerable charm but he cant bowl with either hand coo said bobby the allies came out even more strongly when we went in to bat i was the only rabbit who made ten and my whole innings was played in an atmosphere of suspicion very trying to a sensitive man mrs oakley was in when i took guard and i played out the over with great care being morally bowled by every ball at the end of it a horrible thought occurred to me i had been batting righthanded naturally i changed round for my next ball movements of surprise hallo said the wicketkeeper i thought you were lefthanded why arent you playing right no im really righthanded i said i played that way by mistake just now sorry he grunted sceptically and the bowler came up to have things explained to her the next ball i hit lefthanded for six loud mutters is he really righthanded the bowler asked mrs oakley i dont know she said ive never seen him before sensation i think if you dont mind wed rather you played righthanded certainly the next ball was a full pitch and i took a righthanded six there was an awful hush i looked round at the field and prepared to run for it i felt that they suspected me of all the undiscovered crimes of the year look here i said nearly crying ill play any way you like sideways or upside down or hanging on to the branch of a tree or the atmosphere was too much for me i trod on my wickets burst into tears and bolted to the tent well said dahlia we won yes we all agreed we won even if we didnt do much of it ourselves simpson pointed out we had jolly good fun we always have that said myra the housewarming i work for all well said dahlia what do you think of it i knocked the ashes out of my afterbreakfast pipe arranged the cushions of my deckchair and let my eyes wander lazily over the house and its surroundings after a year of hotels and other peoples houses dahlia and archie had come into their own ive no complaints i said happily a vision of white and gold appeared in the doorway and glided over the lawn toward us myra with a jug none at all said simpson sitting up eagerly but thomas isnt quite satisfied with one of the bathrooms im afraid i heard him saying something in the passage about it this morning when i was inside i asked if youd gone to sleep in the bath explained thomas i hadnt it is practically impossible thomas to go to sleep in a cold bath except perhaps for a civil servant said blair exactly of the practice in the admiralty thomas can tell us later on for myself i was at the window looking at the beautiful view why cant you look at it from your own window instead of keeping people out of the bathroom grunted thomas because the view from my room is an entirely different one there is no stint in this house dahlia pointed out no said simpson jumping up excitedly myra put the jug of cider down in front of us there she said please count it and see that i havent drunk any on the way this is awfully nice of you myra and a complete surprise to all of us except simpson we shall probably be here again tomorrow about the same time there was a long silence broken only by the extremely jolly sound of liquid falling from a height just as it was coming to an end archie appeared suddenly among us and dropped on the grass by the side of dahlia simpson looked guiltily at the empty jug and then leant down to his host tomorrow he said in a stage whisper about the same time i doubt it said archie i know it for a fact protested simpson im afraid myra and samuel made an assignation for this morning said dahlia theres nothing in it really said myra hes only trifling with me he doesnt mean anything simpson buried his confused head in his glass and proceeded to change the subject we all like your house archie he said we do i agreed and we think its very nice of you to ask us down to open it it is rather said archie we are determined therefore to do all we can to give the house a homey appearance i did what i could for the bathroom this morning i flatter myself that the taint of newness has now been dispelled i was sure it was you said myra how do you get the water right up the walls easily further archie if you want any suggestions as to how to improve the place our ideas are at your disposal for instance said thomas where do we play cricket by the way you fellows announced simpson ive given up playing cricket we all looked at him in consternation do you mean youve given up bowling said dahlia with wideopen eyes arent you ever going to walk to the wickets again asked blair arent you ever going to walk back to the pavilion again asked archie what will montgomeryshire say wondered myra in tones of awe may i have your belt and your sandshoes i begged its the cider said thomas i knew he was overdoing it simpson fixed his glasses firmly on his nose and looked round at us benignly ive given it up for golf he observed traitor said everyone and the triangular tournament arranged for and everything added myra you could make a jolly little course round here went on the infatuated victim if you like archie ill archie stood up and made a speech ladies and gentlemen he said at tomorrow precisely i invite you to the paddock beyond the kitchengarden myra and i have an appointment put in simpson hastily a net will be erected archie went on ignoring him and mr simpson will take his stand therein while we all bowl at him or if any prefer it at the wicket for five minutes he will then bowl at us for an hour after which he will have another hours smart fielding practice if he is still alive and still talks about golf why then i wont say but what he mightnt be allowed to plan out a little course or at any rate to do a little preliminary weeding good man said simpson and if anybody else thinks he has given up cricket for ludo or croquet or oranges and lemons then he can devote himself to planning out a little course for that too or anyhow to removing a few plantains in preparation for it in fact ladies and gentlemen all i want is for you to make yourselves as happy and as useful as you can its what youre here for said dahlia ii a gala performance the sun came into my room early next morning and woke me up it was followed immediately by a large bluebottle which settled down to play with me we adopted the usual formation the bluebottle keeping mostly to the back of the court whilst i waited at the net for a kill after two sets i decided to change my tactics i looked up at the ceiling and pretended i wasnt playing the bluebottle settled on my nose and walked up my forehead heavens i cried clasping my hand suddenly to my brow ive forgotten my toothbrush this took it completely by surprise and i removed its corpse into the candlestick then simpson came in with a golf club in his hand great scott he shouted youre not still in bed i am not this is telepathic suggestion you think im in bed i appear to be in bed in reality there is no bed here do go away i havent had a wink of sleep yet but man look at the lovely morning simpson i said sternly rolling up the sleeves of my pyjamas with great deliberation i have had one visitor already today his corpse is now in the candlestick it is an omen simpson i thought youd like to come outside with me and id show you my swing yes yes i shall like to see that but after breakfast simpson i suppose one of the gardeners put it up for you you must show me your box of soldiers and your tricycle horse too but run away now theres a good boy my golfswing idiot i sat up in bed and stared at him in sheer amazement for a long time words wouldnt come to me simpson backed nervously to the door i saw the coronation i said at last and i dropped back on my pillow and went to sleep i feel very important said archie coming on to the lawn where myra and i were playing a quiet game of bowls with the croquet balls ive been paying the wages archie and i do hate it so said dahlia im luckier because i only pay mine once a month it would be much nicer if they did it for love said archie and just accepted a tiepin occasionally i never know what to say when i hand a man eighteenandsix heres eighteenandsix i suggested and dont bite the halfsovereign because it may be bad you should shake his hand said myra and say thank you very much for the azaleas or you might wrap the money up in paper and leave it for him in one of the beds and then youd know whether he had made it properly well youre all very helpful said archie thank you extremely where are the others its a pity that they should be left out of this simpson disappeared after breakfast with his golfclubs he is in high dudgeon which is the surname of a small fish because no one wanted to see his swing oh but i do said dahlia eagerly where is he we will track him down announced archie i will go to the stables unchain the trufflehounds and show them one of his reversible cuffs we found simpson in the pigsty the third hole as he was planning it out for archie necessitated the carrying of the farm buildings which he described as a natural hazard unfortunately his ball had fallen into a casual pigsty it had not yet been decided whether the ball could be picked out without penalty the more immediate need being to find the blessed thing so simpson was in the pigsty searching if youre looking for the old sow i said there she is just behind you whats the local rule about loose pigs blown on to the course asked archie oh you fellows there you are said simpson rapidly im getting on firstrate this is the third hole archie it will be rather good i think the green is just the other side of the pond i can make a very sporting little course weve come to see your swing samuel said myra can you do it in there or is it too crowded ill come out this balls lost im afraid one of the little pigs will eat it complained archie and we shall have indiarubber crackling simpson came out and proceeded to give his display fortunately the weather kept fine the conditions indeed being all that could be desired the sun shone brightly and there was a slight breeze from the south which tempered the heat and in no way militated against the general enjoyment the performance was divided into two parts the first part consisted of mr simpsons swing without the ball the second part being devoted to mr simpsons swing with the ball this is my swing said simpson he settled himself ostentatiously into his stance and placed his clubhead stiffly on the ground three feet away from him middle said archie simpson frowned and began to waggle his club he waggled it carefully a dozen times its a very nice swing said myra at the end of the ninth movement but isnt it rather short simpson said nothing but drew his club slowly and jerkily back twisting his body and keeping his eye fixed on an imaginary ball until the back of his neck hid it from sight you can see it better round this side now suggested archie hell split if he goes on said thomas anxiously watch this i warned myra hes going to pick a pin out of the back of his calf with his teeth then simpson let himself go finishing up in a very creditable knot indeed thats quite good said dahlia does it do as well when theres a ball well i miss it sometimes of course we all do that said thomas thus encouraged simpson put down a ball and began to address it it was apparent at once that the last address had been only his telegraphic one this was the genuine affair after what seemed to be four or five minutes there was a general feeling that some apology was necessary simpson recognized this himself im a little nervous he said not so nervous as the pigs are said archie simpson finished his address and got on to his swing he swung he hit the ball the ball which seemed to have too much lefthand side on it whizzed off and disappeared into the pond it sank luckily the weather had held up till the last well well said archie its time for lunch we have had a riotous morning lets all take it easy this afternoon iii unexpected guests sometimes i do a little work in the morning doctors are agreed now that an occasional spell of work in the morning doesnt do me any harm my announcement at breakfast that this was one of the mornings was greeted with a surprised enthusiasm which was most flattering archie offered me his own room where he does his thinking simpson offered me a nib and dahlia promised me a quiet time till lunch i thanked them all and settled down to work but dahlia didnt keep her promise my first hour was peaceful but after that i had inquiries by every post blair looked in to know where myra was archie asked if id seen dahlia anywhere and when finally thomass head appeared in the doorway i decided that i had had enough of it oh i say began thomas will you come and but i suppose youre busy not too busy i said to spare a word or two for an old friend and i picked up the dictionary to throw at him but he was gone before i could take aim this is the end i said to myself and after five minutes more decided to give up work and seek refreshment and congenial conversation to my surprise i found neither every room seemed to be empty the tennis lawn was deserted and archies cricketbag and simpsons golfclubs rested peacefully in the hall something was going on i went back to my work and decided to have the secret out at lunch now then i said when that blessed hour arrived tell me about it youve deserted me all morning but im not going to be left out its your fault for shutting yourself up duty i said slapping my chest duty and i knocked my glass over with an elbow oh dahlia im horribly sorry may i go and stand in the corner lets talk very fast and pretend we didnt notice it said myra helping me to mop go on archie well its like this said archie a little while ago the vicar called here i dont see that thats any reason for keeping me in the background i have met clergymen before and i know what to say to them when i say a little while ago i mean about three weeks wed have asked you down for the night if wed known you were so keen on clergymen well as the result of that unfortunate visit the school treat takes place here this afternoon and lorblessme if i hadnt forgotten all about it till this morning youll have to help please said dahlia only dont spill anything said thomas they have a poor sense of humour in the admiralty i took a baby in each hand and wandered off to look for bees their idea not mine the best bees are round here i said and i led them along to the front of the house on the lawn was myra surrounded by about eight babies two more for your collection i announced very fine specimens the word with them is bees arent they darlings sit down babies and the pretty gentleman will tell us all a story meaning me i asked in surprise myra looked beseechingly at me as she arranged the children all round her i sat down near them and tried to think once upon a time i said there was a a there was a was a a bee myra nodded approvingly she seemed to like the story so far i didnt the great dearth of adventures that could happen to a bee was revealed to me in a flash i saw that i had been hasty at least i went on he thought he was a bee but as he grew up his friends felt that he was not really a bee at all but a dear little rabbit his fur was too long for a bee myra shook her head at me and frowned my story was getting oversubtle for the infant mind i determined to straighten it out finally however i added the old name stuck to him and they all called him a bee now then i can get on where was i but at this moment my story was interrupted come here shouted archie from the distance youre wanted im sorry i said getting up quickly will you finish the story for me youd better leave out the part where he stings the shah of persia thats too exciting goodbye and i hurried after archie help simpson with some of these races said archie hes getting himself into the dickens of a mess simpson had started two races simultaneously hence the trouble in one of them the bigger boys had to race to a sack containing their boots rescue their own pair put them on and race back to the startingpoint good in the other the smaller boys each armed with a paper containing a problem in arithmetic had to run to their sisters wait for the problem to be solved and then run back with the answer excellent simpson at his most inventive unfortunately when the bootless boys arrived at the turning post they found nothing but a small problem in arithmetic awaiting them while on the adjoining stretch of grass young mathematicians were trying with the help of their sisters to get into two pairs of boots at once hallo there you are said simpson do help me i shall be mobbed in a moment its the mothers they think the whole thing is a scheme for stealing their childrens boots cant you start a race for them you never ought to go about without somebody wheres thomas hes playing rounders he scored a rounder by himself just now from an overthrow but we shall hear about it at dinner look here theres a game called twos and threes couldnt you start the mothers at that you stand in twos and whenever anyone stands in front of the two then the person behind the two runs away are you sure what do you mean said simpson it sounds too exciting to be true i cant believe it go on theres a good chap theyll know how to play all right oh very well do they take their boots off first or not twos and threes was a great success i found that i had quite a flair for the game i seemed to take to it naturally by the time our match was finished simpsons little footwear trouble was over and he was organizing a grand threelegged race i think they are all enjoying it said dahlia they love it i said thomas is perfectly happy making rounders but i meant the children dont you think they love it too the babies seem so happy with myra i suppose shes telling them stories i think so shes got rather a good one about a bee oh yes theyre happy enough with her i hope they all had enough to eat at tea allowing for a little natural shyness i think they did well and i didnt spill anything altogether it has been rather a success dahlia stood looking down at the children young and old playing in the field beneath her and gave a sigh of happiness now she said i feel the house is really warm iv a word in season archie said blair whats that big empty room above the billiardroom for that said archie is where we hide the corpses of our guests i sleep with the key under my pillow this is rather sudden i said im not at all sure that i should have come if i had known that dont frighten them dear tell them the truth well the truth is said archie that there was some idea of a little playacting there occasionally hence the curtainrod the emergency exit and other devices then why havent we done any we came down here to open your house for you and then you go and lock up the most important room of all and sleep with the key under your pillow its too hot but well do a little charade tonight if you like just to air the place hooray said myra i know a lovely word myras little word was in two syllables and required three performers archie and i were kindly included in her company simpson threatened to follow with something immense and archaic and thomas also had something rather good up his sleeve but i am not going to bother you with these one word will be enough for you first scene oh goodmorning said myra she had added a hat and a sunshade to her eveningfrock and was supported by me in a gentlemans loungecoat and boater for henley wear goodmorning mum said archie hitching up his apron and spreading his hands on the table in front of him i just want this ribbon matched please certainly mum wont your little boy i beg pardon the old gentleman take a seat too what colour did you want the ribbon mum the same colour as this i said idiot your grandfather is in a bit of a draught im afraid mum it always stimulates the flow of language my grandfather was just the same im afraid mum we havent any ribbon as you might say the same colour as this if its very near it will do now what colour would you call that wondered archie with his head on one side kind of pucelike i should put it at pucemagenta as we say in the trade no were right out of puce magenta show the lady what you have got i said sternly well mum im right out of ribbon altogether the fact is im more of an ironmonger really the drapers is just the other side of the road you wouldnt like a gardenroller now i can do you a nice gardenroller for two pound five and thats simply giving it away oh shall we have a nice roller said myra eagerly im not going to carry it home i said thats all right sir my little lad will take it up on his bicycle two pounds five mum and sixpence for the mousetrap the gentlemans been sitting on say three pounds myra took out her purse second scene we were back in our ordinary clothes i wonder if they guessed that said archie it was very easy said myra i should have thought theyd have seen it at once but of course theyre not a very clever lot i explained that fellow with the spectacles simpson his name is said archie i know him well hes a professional golfer well he looks learned enough i expect he knows all right but the others do you think they knew that we were supposed to be in a shop surely why i should think even whats that mans name over there no that one next to the pretty lady ah yes thomas is that thomas the wonderful cueist by the way really well i should think even thomas guessed that much why not do it over again to make sure oh no it was perfectly obvious lets get on to the final scene im afraid that will give it away rather said myra im afraid so agreed archie third scene we sat on campstools and looked up at the ceiling with our mouths open es late said archie i dont believe es coming and i dont mind oo ears me sye so said myra so there ot work i said wiping my brow nar not up there not ot nice and breezy like but es nearer the sun than wot we are aint e ah but es not ot not up there ere there e is cried myra jumping up excitedly over there ow naow its a bird i declare i quite thought it was im silly of me there was silence for a little and then archie took a sandwich out of his pocket wunner wot theyll invent next he said and munched stolidly well done said dahlia thomas and i have been trying to guess said simpson but the strain is terrific my first idea was codfish but i suppose thats wrong its either silkworm or wardrobe thomas suggests mangelwurzel he says he never saw anybody who had so much the whole air of a wurzel as archie the indefinable elan of the wurzel was there cant you really guess said myra eagerly i dont know whether i want you to or not oh no i dont want you to then i withdraw mangelwurzel said simpson gallantly i think i can guess said blair its whisper it said simpson im never going to know blair whispered it yes said myra disappointedly thats it v uninvited guests nine said archie separating his latest victim from the marmalade spoon and dropping it into the hot water this is going to be a sanguinary day with a pretty late cut into the peach jelly mr a mannering reached double figures ten battles are being won while thomas still sleeps any advance on ten does that include my wasp asked myra there are only ten here said archie looking into the basin and theyre all mine i remember them perfectly what was yours like well i didnt exactly kill him i smacked him with a teaspoon and asked him to go away and he went on to your marmalade so i expect you thought he was yours but it was really mine and i dont think its very sporting of you to kill another persons wasp have one of mine i said pushing my plate across have bernard hes sitting on the greengage i dont really want to kill anything i killed a rabbit once and i wished i hadnt i nearly killed a rabbit once and i wished i had great sportsmen at a glance said archie tell us about it before it goes into your reminiscences it was a fierce affair while it lasted the rabbit was sitting down and i was standing up so that i rather had the advantage of him at the start i waited till he seemed to be asleep and then fired and missed him yyes he heard the report though i mean you mustnt think he ignored me altogether i moved him he got up and went away all right a very lucky escape for you said archie i once knew a man who was gored to death by an angry rabbit he slashed in the air with his napkin fifteen dahlia lets have breakfast indoors tomorrow this is very jolly but its just as hot and it doesnt get thomas up any earlier as we hoped all that day we grilled in the heat myra and i started a game of croquet in the morning but after one shot each we agreed to abandon it as a draw slightly in my favour because i had given her the chipped mallet and in the afternoon thomas and simpson made a great effort to get up enthusiasm for lawntennis each of them returned the others service into the net until the score stood at eight all at which point they suddenly realized that nothing but the violent death of one of the competitors would ever end the match they went on to ten all to make sure and then retired to the lemonade and wasp jug simpson missing a couple of dead bodies by inches only and after dinner it was hotter than ever the heat in my room announced archie breaks all records the thermometer says a hundred and fifty the barometer says very dry weve had twentyfive hours sunshine and theres not a drop of rain recorded in the soapdish are we going to take this lying down no said thomas lets sleep out tonight what do you say dahlia its a good idea you can all sleep on the croquet lawn and myra and i will take the tennis lawn hadnt you better have the croquet lawn thomas walks in his sleep and we dont want to have him going through hoops all night youll have to bring down your own mattresses went on dahlia and youve not got to walk about the garden in the early morning at least not until myra and i are up and if youre going to fall over croquet hoops you mustnt make a noise thats all the rules i think im glad weve got the tennis lawn said myra its much smoother do you prefer the righthand court dear or the lefthand we shall be very close to nature tonight said archie now we shall know whether it really is the nightjar or simpson gargling we were very close to nature that night but in the early morning still closer i was awakened by the noise of simpson talking as i hoped in his sleep however it appeared that he was awake and quite conscious of the things he was saying i cant help it he explained to archie who had given expression to the general opinion about it these bally wasps are all over me its your own fault said archie why do you egg them on i dont have wasps all over me conf there ive been stung youve been what stung stung where in the neck in the neck archie turned over to me simpson he said has been stung in the neck tell thomas i woke up thomas simpson i said has been stung in the neck good said thomas and went to sleep again weve told thomas said archie now are you satisfied get away you brute shouted simpson suddenly and dived under the sheet archie and i lay back and shouted with laughter its really very silly of him said archie because go away because everybody knows that get away you ass that wasps arent dangerous unless confound you unless i say isnt it time we got up i came up from under my sheet and looked at my watch fourthirty i said dodged a wasp and went back again we must wait till fivethirty said archie simpson was quite right he was stung after all ill tell him so he leant out of bed to tell him so and then thought better of it and retired beneath the sheets at fivethirty a gallant little party made its way to the house its mattresses over its shoulders gently said archie as we came in sight of the tennis lawn we went very gently there were only wasps on the tennis lawn but one does not want to disturb the little fellows vi a final arrangement seeing that this is our last day together began archie oh dont said myra i cant bear it seeing that this is our first day together we might have a little tournament of some kind followed by a small distribution of prizes what do you think dahlia well i daresay i can find something any old thing that we dont want will do nothing showy or expensive victory is its own reward yes but if there is a pot of homemade marmalade going with it i said so much the better dahlia earmark the marmalade for this gentleman now whats it going to be golf simpson why of course said myra hasnt he been getting it ready for days that will give him an unfair advantage i pointed out he knows every single brick on the greens oh i say there arent any greens yet protested simpson thatll take a year or two but ive marked out white circles and you have to get inside them i saw him doing that said archie i was afraid he expected us to play prisoners base with him the game fixed upon we proceeded to draw for partners youll have to play with me archie said dahlia because im no good at all i shall have to play with myra i said because im no good at all oh im very good said myra that looks as though i should have to play with simpson thomas said thomas and simpson together youre all giving me a lot of trouble said archie putting his pencil back in his pocket ive just written your names out neatly on little bits of paper and now theyre all wasted youll have to stick them on yourselves so that the spectators will know who you are as you whizz past he handed his bits of paper round and went in for his clubs it was a stroke competition and each couple went round by itself myra and i started last now weve got to win this she said because we shant play together again for a long time thats a nice cheery thing to say to a person just when hes driving now i shall have to address the ball all over again oh no i addressed and despatched the ball it struck a wall about eighty yards away and dropped when we got there we found to our disgust that it was nestling at the very foot myra looked at it doubtfully cant you make it climb the wall i asked we shall have to go back im afraid we can pretend we left our pockethandkerchiefs behind she chipped it back about twenty yards and i sent it on again about a hundred unfortunately it landed in a rut however myra got it out with great resource and i was lucky enough with my next to place it inside the magic circle five i said you know i dont think youre helping me much all you did that hole was to go twentyone yards in the wrong direction myra smiled cheerfully at me and did the next hole in one well played partner she said as he put her club back in its bag oh at the short holes i dont deny that youre useful where do we go now over the barn this is the long hole i got in an excellent drive but unfortunately it didnt aviate quick enough while the intrepid spectators were still holding their breath there was an ominous crash did you say in the barn or over the barn i asked as we hurried on to find the damage we do play an exciting game dont we said myra we got into the barn and found the ball and a little glass on the floor what a very small hole it made said myra pointing to the broken pane what shall i do youll have to go back through the hole its an awkward little shot i dont think i could no it is rather a difficult stroke you want to stand well behind the ball and however there may be a local rule about it i dont think there is or i should have heard it samuels been telling me everything lately then theres only one thing for it i pointed to the window at the other end of the barn go straight on myra gave a little gurgle of delight but we shall have to save up our pocketmoney she said her ball hit the wood in between two panes and bounded back my next shot was just above the glass myra took a niblick and got the ball back into the middle of the floor its simply sickening that we cant break a window when were really trying to i should have thought that anyone could have broken a window now then oh good shot cried myra above the crash we hurried out and did the hole in nine at lunch having completed eighteen holes out of the thirtysix we were seven strokes behind the leaders simpson and thomas simpson according to thomas had been playing like a book golf faults analysed that book i should think but i expect hell go to pieces in the afternoon said thomas he turned to a servant and added mr simpson wont have anything more we started our second round brilliantly continued after an unusual incident on the fifth tee brilliantly and ended up brilliantly at the last tee we had played a hundred and thirtyseven myra got in a beautiful drive to within fifty yards of the circle how many said the others coming up excitedly this is terrible said myra putting her hand to her heart a hundred and shall i tell them a a oh dear a hundredandthirtyeight golly said thomas youve got one for it we did a hundred and forty we did a hundred and fortytwo said archie close play at the oval oh said myra to me do be careful oh but no she went on quickly i dont mind a bit really if we lose its only a game besides we you forget the little pot of homemade marmalade i said reproachfully dahlia what are the prizes because its just possible that myra might like the second one better than the first in that case i should miss this go on whispered myra i went on there was a moments silence and then a deep sigh from myra how about it i said calmly loud applause well said dahlia you and myra make a very good couple i suppose i must find a prize for you it doesnt really matter said myra breathlessly because on the fifth tee we we arranged about the prizes we arranged to give each other one i said smiling at dahlia dahlia looked very hard at us you dont mean myra laughed happily oh she said but thats just what we do at play ten and eight the only event of importance last week was my victory over henry by ten and eight if you dont want to hear about that then i shall have to pass on to you a few facts about his motor bicycle youd rather have the other i thought so the difference between henry and me is that he is what i should call a good golfer and i am what everybody else calls a bad golfer in consequence of this he insults me with offers of bisques ill have ten this time i said as we walked to the tee better have twelve i beat you with eleven yesterday thank you i said haughtily i will have ten it is true that he beat me last time but then owing to bad management on my part i had nine bisques left at the moment of defeat simply eating their heads off henry teed up and drove a pink spot out of sight henry swears by the pink spot if there is anything of a wind i use either a quo vadis which is splendid for going out of bounds or an ostrich which has a wonderful way of burying itself in the sand i followed him to the green at my leisure five said henry seven said i and if i take three bisques its my hole you must only take one at a time protested henry why theres nothing in wisden or baedeker about it besides i will only take one at a time if it makes it easier for you i take one and that brings me down to six and then another one and that brings me down to five and then another one and that brings me down to four there and as you did the hole in five i win well of course if you like to waste them all at the start im not wasting them im creating a moral effect behold i have won the first hole let us be photographed together henry went to the next tee slightly ruffled and topped his ball into the road i had kept mine well this side of it and won in four to five i shant take any bisques here i said two up at the third tee my quo vadis darted off suddenly to the left and tried to climb the hill i headed it off and gave it a nasty dent from behind when it wasnt looking and with my next shot started it rolling down the mountains with everincreasing velocity not until it was within a foot of the pin did it condescend to stop henry who had reached the green with his drive and had taken one putt too many halved the hole in four i took a bisque and was three up the fourth hole was prettily played by both of us and with two bisques i had it absolutely stiff unnerved by this henry went all out at the fifth and tried to carry the stream in two unfortunately i mean unfortunately for him the stream was six inches too broad in the particular place at which he tried to carry it my own view is that he should either have chosen another place or else have got a narrower stream from somewhere as it was i won in an uneventful six and took with a bisque the short hole which followed six up i pointed out to henry and three bisques left theyre jolly little things bisques but you want to use them quickly bisque dat qui cito dat doesnt the sea look ripping today go on growled henry i once did a two at this hole i said as i teed my ball if i did a two now and took a bisque youd have to do it in nothing in order to win a solemn thought at this hole you have to drive over a chasm in the cliffs my ball made a bee line for the beach bounced on a rock and disappeared into a cave henrys pink spot which really seemed to have a chance of winning a hole at last found the wind too much for it and followed me below im in this cave i said when we had found henrys ball and with a lighted match in one hand and a niblick in the other i went in and tried to persuade the ostrich to come out my eighth argument was too much for it and we reappeared in the daylight together how many i asked henry six he said as he hit the top of the cliff once more and shot back on to the beach i left him and chivied my ball round to where the cliffs are lowest then i got it gradually on to a little mound of sand very delicate work this took a terrific swing and fairly heaved it on to the grass two more strokes put me on to the green in twenty i lit a pipe and waited for henry to finish his game of rackets ive played twentyfive he shouted then youll want some of my bisques i said i can lend you three till monday henry had one more rally and then picked his ball up i had won seven holes and i had three bisques with which to win the match i was a little doubtful if i could do this but henry settled the question by misjudging yet again the breadth of the stream what is experience if it teaches us nothing henry must really try to enlarge his mind about rivers dormy nine i said at the tenth tee and no bisques left thank heaven for that sighed henry but i have only to halve one hole out of nine i pointed out technically i am on what is known as velvet oh shut up and drive i am a bad golfer but even bad golfers do holes in bogey now and then in the ordinary way i was pretty certain to halve one of the nine holes with henry and so win the match both the eleventh and the seventeenth for instance are favourites of mine had i halved one of those he would have admitted cheerfully that i had played good golf and beaten him fairly but as things happened what happened put quite briefly was this bogey for the tenth is four i hooked my drive off the tee and down a little gully to the left put a good iron shot into a bunker on the right and than ran down a hundredyard putt with a niblick for a three one of those difficult downhill putts luck said henry as soon as he could speak ive been missing those lately i said your match said henry i cant play against luck like that it was true that he had given me ten bisques but on the other hand i could have given him a dozen at the seventh and still have beaten him however i was too magnanimous to point that out all i said was ten and eight and then i added thoughtfully i dont think ive ever won by more than that pat ball youll play tennis said my hostess absently thats right let me introduce you to miss er urn oh weve met before smiled miss ive forgotten the name again now thank you i said gratefully i thought it was extremely nice of her to remember me probably i had spilt lemonade over her at a dance and in some way the incident had fixed itself in her mind we do these little things you know and think nothing of them at the moment but all the time smooth said a voice i looked up and found that a pair of opponents had mysteriously appeared and that my partner was leading the way on to the court ill take the righthand side if you dont mind she announced oh and what about apologizing she went on shall we do it after every stroke or at the end of each game or when we say goodbye or never i get so tired of saying sorry oh but we shant want to apologize im sure were going to get on beautifully together i suppose youve played a lot this summer no not at all yet but im feeling rather strong and ive got a new racket one way and another i expect to play a very powerful game our male opponent served he had what i should call a nasty swift service the first ball rose very suddenly and took my partner on the side of the head sorry she apologized its all right i said magnanimously i returned the next into the net the third clean bowled my partner and off the last i was caught in the slips one love will you serve said miss i wish i could remember her surname her christian name was hope or charity or something like that i know when i heard it i thought it was just as well if i might call her miss hope for this once thank you will you serve said miss hope in the righthand court i use the american service which means that i never know till the last moment which side of the racket is going to hit the ball on this occasion it was a dead heat that is to say i got it in between with the wood and the ball sailed away over beds and beds of the most beautiful flowers oh is that the american service said miss hope much interested south american i explained down in peru they never use anything else in the lefthand court i employ the ordinary hampstead smash into the bottom of the net after four hampstead smashes and four peruvian teasers love two i felt that another explanation was called for ive got a new racket ive never used before i said my old one is being pressed it went to the shop yesterday to have the creases taken out dont you find that with a new racket you er exactly in the third game we not only got the ball over but kept it between the white lines on several occasions though not so often as our opponents three love and in the fourth game miss hope served gentle lobs while i at her request stood close up to the net and defended myself with my racket i warded off the first two shots amidst applause thirty love and dodged the next three thirty forty but the last one was too quick for me and won the coconut with some ease game love four its all right thanks i said to my partner it really doesnt hurt a bit now then lets buck up and play a simply dashing game miss hope excelled herself in that fifth game but i was still unable to find a length to be more accurate i was unable to find a shortness my long game was admirably strong and lofty are you musical said my partner at the end of it five love she had been very talkative all through come come i said impatiently you dont want a song at this very moment surely you can wait till the end of the set oh i was only just wondering i quite see your point you feel that nature always compensates us in some way and that as oh no said miss hope in great confusion i didnt mean that at all she must have meant it you dont talk to people about singing in the middle of a game of tennis certainly not to comparative strangers who have only spilt lemonade over your frock once before no no it was an insult and it nerved me to a great effort i discarded for it was my serve the hampstead smash i discarded the peruvian teaser instead i served two piccadilly benders from the righthand court and two westminster welts from the lefthand the piccadilly bender is my own invention it can only be served from the one court and it must have a wind against it you deliver it with your back to the net which makes the striker think that you have either forgotten all about the game or else are apologizing to the spectators for your previous exhibition then with a violent contortion you slue your body round and serve whereupon your opponent perceives that you are playing and that it is just one more ordinary fault into the wrong court so she calls fault in a contemptuous tone and drops her racket and then adds hurriedly oh no sorry it wasnt a fault after all that being where the wind comes in the westminster welt is in theory the same as the hampstead smash but goes over the net one must be in very good form or have been recently insulted to bring this off well we won that game a breeze having just sprung up and carried away by enthusiasm and mutual admiration we collected another five two then it was miss hopes serve again goodbye i said i suppose you want me in the forefront again please i dont mind her shots the bottle of scent is absolutely safe but im afraid hell win another packet of woodbines miss hope started off with a double which was rather a pity and then gave our masculine adversary what is technically called one to kill i saw instinctively that i was the one and i held my racket ready with both hands our opponent who had been wanting his tea for the last two games was in no mood of dalliance he fairly let himself go over this shot in a moment i was down on my knees behind the net and the next moment i saw through the meshes a very strange thing the other man with his racket on the ground was holding his eye with both hands dont you think said miss hope two five abandoned that your overhead volleying is just a little severe the opening season my dear said jeremy as he folded back his paper at the sporting page i have some news for you cricket is upon us once again theres a nasty cold upon baby once again said mrs jeremy i hope it doesnt mean measles no child of mine would ever have measles said jeremy confidently its beneath us he cleared his throat and read the coming season will be rendered ever memorable by the fact that for the first time in the history of the game youll never guess whats coming mr jeremy smith is expected to make double figures jeremy sat up indignantly well of all the wifely things to say who was top of our averages last year plummer because you presented the bat to him yourself that proves nothing i gave myself a bat too as it happens and a better one than plummers after all his average was only mine if the weather had allowed me to finish my solitary innings would probably have been as it was the weather only allowed you to give a chance to the wicketkeeper off the one ball you had i was getting the pace of the pitch said jeremy besides it wasnt really a chance because our umpire would never have given the treasurer out first ball there are certain little courtesies which are bound to be observed then said his wife its a pity you dont play more often jeremy got up and made a few strokes with the poker one of us is rather stiff he said perhaps its the poker if i play regularly this season will you promise to bring baby to watch me of course we shall both come and you wont let baby jeer at me if im bowled by a shooter she wont know what a shooter is then you can tell her that its the only ball that ever bowls father said jeremy he put down the poker and took up a ball of wool i shall probably field somewhere behind the wicketkeeper where the hottest drives dont come but if i should miss a catch you must point out to her that the sun was in fathers eyes i want my child to understand the game as soon as possible ill tell her all that she ought to know said his wife and when youve finished playing with my wool ive got something to do with it jeremy gave himself another catch threw the wool to his wife and drifted out he came back in ten minutes with his bat under his arm really it has wintered rather well he said considering that it has been in the boot cupboard all the time we ought to have put some camphor in with it or i know theres something you do to bats in the winter anyhow the splice is still there it looks very old said mrs jeremy is that really your new one yes this is the one that played the historic innings it has only had one ball in its whole life and that was on the edge the part of the bat that i propose to use this season will therefore come entirely fresh to the business you ought to have oiled it jeremy oil that was what i meant ill do it now well give it a good rub down i wonder if theres anything else it would like i think most of all it would like a little practice my dear thats true it said in the paper that on the county grounds practice was already in full swing he made an imaginary drive i dont think i shall take a full swing its so much harder to time the ball i say do you bowl very badly jeremy the worse you bowl the more practice the bat will get or what about baby could she bowl to me this afternoon do you think or is her cold too bad i think shed better stay in today what a pity nurse tells me shes lefthanded and i particularly want a lot of that because little buxted has a very hot lefthand bowler called you dont want your daughter to be an athletic girl do you jeremy looked at her in surprise and then sat down on the arm of her chair surely dear he said gravely we decided that our child was going to play for kent not a girl why not theres nothing in the rules about it rule b says that you neednt play if you dont like the manager but theres nothing about sex in it im sure baby would love the manager mrs jeremy smiled and ruffled his hair well said jeremy if nobody will bowl to me i can at least take my bat out and let it see the grass after six months of boots it will be a change for it he went out into the garden and did not appear again until lunch during the meal he read extracts to his wife from the coming seasons prospects and spoke cheerfully of the runs he intended to make for the village after lunch he took her on to the tennis lawn there he said proudly pointing to a cricket pitch beautifully cut and marked with a crease of dazzling white doesnt that look jolly heavenly she said you must ask someone up tomorrow you can get quite good practice here with these deep banks all round yes i shall make a lot of runs this season said jeremy airily but apart from practice dont you feel how jolly and summery a cricket pitch makes everything mrs jeremy took a deep breath yes theres nothing like a bucket of whitening to make you think of summer im glad you think so too said jeremy with an air of relief because i upset the bucket on the way back to the stables just underneath the pergola it ought to bring the roses on like anything an inland voyage thomas took a day off last monday in order to play golf with me for that day the admiralty had to get along without thomas i tremble to think what would have happened if war had broken out on monday could a thomasless admiralty have coped with it i trow not even as it was battleships grounded crews mutinied and several awkward questions in the house of commons had to be postponed till tuesday something some premonition of this no doubt seemed to be weighing on him all day rotten weather he growled as he came up the steps of the club im very sorry i said i keep on complaining to the secretary about it he does his best whats that he taps the barometer every morning and says it will clear up in the afternoon shall we go out now or shall we give it a chance to stop thomas looked at the rain and decided to let it stop i made him as comfortable as i could i gave him a drink a cigarette and mistakes with the mashie on the table at his elbow i had in reserve faulty play with the brassy and a west middlesex directory for myself i wandered about restlessly pausing now and again to read enviously a notice which said that c d toppings handicap was reduced from to lucky man at about halfpast eleven the rain stopped for a moment and we hurried out the course is a little wet i said apologetically as we stood on the first tee but with your naval experience you wont mind that by the way i ought to warn you that this isnt all casual water some of it is river how do you know which is which youll soon find out the river is much deeper go on your drive thomas won the first hole very easily we both took four to the green thomas in addition having five splashes of mud on his face while i only had three unfortunately the immediate neighbourhood of the hole was under water thomas the bounder had a small heavy ball which he managed to sink in nine my own being lighter refused to go into the tin at all and floated above the hole in the most exasperating way i expect theres a rule about it i said if we only knew which gives me the match however until we find that out i suppose you must call yourself one up i shall want some dry socks for lunch he muttered as he sploshed off to the tee anything you want for lunch you can have my dear thomas i promise you that you shall not be stinted the next green is below sealevel altogether im afraid the first in the water wins honours it turned out were divided i lost the hole and thomas lost his ball the third tee having disappeared we moved on to the fourth theres rather a nasty place along here i said the secretary was sucked in the other day and only rescued by the hair thomas drove a good one i topped mine badly and it settled down in the mud fifty yards off excuse me i shouted as i ran quickly after it and i got my niblick on to it just as it was disappearing it was a very close thing well said thomas as he reached his ball thats not what i call a brassy lie its what we call a corkscrew lie down here i explained if you havent got a corkscrew youd better dig round it with something and then when the position is thoroughly undermined oh good shot thomas had got out of the fairway in one but he still seemed unhappy my eye he said bending down in agony ive got about half middlesex in it he walked round in circles saying strange nautical things and my suggestions that he should rub the other eye and blow his nose suddenly were received ungenerously anything youd like me to do with my ears he asked bitterly if youd come and take some mud out for me instead of talking rot i approached with my handkerchief and examined the eye carefully see anything asked thomas my dear thomas its full of turf we mustnt forget to replace this if we can get it out what the secretary would say there hows that worse than ever try not to think about it keep the other eye on the ball as much as possible this is my hole by the way your ball is lost how do you know i saw it losing itself it went into the bad place i told you about its gone to join the secretary oh no we got him out of course i keep forgetting anyhow its my hole i think i shall turn my trousers up again said thomas bending down to do so is there a local rule about it no it is left entirely to the discretion and good taste of the members naturally a little extra licence is allowed on a very muddy day of course if oh i see you meant a local rule about losing your ball in the mud no i dont know of one unless it comes under the heading of casual land be a sportsman thomas and dont begrudge me the hole the game proceeded and we reached the twelfth tee without any further contretemps save that i accidentally lost the sixth ninth and tenth holes and that thomas lost his iron at the eighth he had carelessly laid it down for a moment while he got out of a hole with his niblick and when he turned round for it the thing was gone at the twelfth tee it was raining harder than ever we pounded along with our coatcollars up and reached the green absolutely wet through how about it said thomas my hole i think and that makes us all square i mean how about the rain and its just one oclock just as you like well i suppose it is rather wet all right lets have lunch we had lunch thomas had it in the only dry things he had brought with him an ulster and a pair of vardon cuffs and sat as near the fire as possible it was still raining in torrents after lunch and thomas who is not what i call keen about golf preferred to remain before the fire perhaps he was right i raked up an old copy of strumers with the niblick for him and read bits of the telephone directory out aloud after tea his proper clothes were dry enough in places to put on and as it was still raining hard and he seemed disinclined to come out again i ordered a cab for us both its really rotten luck said thomas as we prepared to leave that on the one day when i take a holiday it should be so beastly beastly thomas i said in amazement the one day im afraid you dont play inland golf much i hardly ever play round london i thought not then let me tell you that todays was the best days golf ive had for three weeks golly said thomas an informal evening dinner was a very quiet affair not a soul drew my chair away from under me as i sat down and during the meal nobody threw bread about we talked gently of art and politics and things and when the ladies left there was no booby trap waiting for them at the door in a word nothing to prepare me for what was to follow we strolled leisurely into the drawingroom a glance told me the worst the ladies were in a cluster round miss power and miss power was on the floor she got up quickly as we came in we were trying to go underneath the poker she explained can you do it i waved the poker back let me see you do it again i said i missed the first part oh i can never do it bob you show us bob is an active young fellow he took the poker rested the end on the floor and then twisted himself underneath his right arm i expected to see him come up inside out but he looked much the same after it however no doubt his organs are all on the wrong side now yes thats how i should do it i said hastily but miss power was firm she gave me the poker i pressed it hard on the floor said goodbye to them all and dived i got halfway round and was supporting myself upside down by one toe and the slippery end of the poker when it suddenly occurred to me that the earth was revolving at an incredible speed on its own axis and that in addition we were hurtling at thousands of miles a minute round the sun it seemed impossible in these circumstances that i should keep my balance any longer and as soon as i realized this the poker began to slip i was in no sort of position to do anything about it and we came down heavily together oh what a pity said miss power i quite thought youd done it being actually on the spot i said i knew that i hadnt do try again not till the grounds a little softer lets do the jampot trick said another girl im not going under a jampot for anybody i murmured however it turned out that this trick was quite different you place a book macaulays essays or what not on the jampot and sit on the book one heel only touching the ground in the right hand you have a box of matches in the left a candle the jampot of course is on its side so that it can roll beneath you then you light the candle and hand it to anybody who wants to go to bed i was ready to give way to the ladies here but even while i was bowing and saying not at all i found myself on one of the jampots with bob next to me on another to balance with the arms outstretched was not so difficult but as the matches were then about six feet from the candle and there seemed no way of getting them nearer together the solution of the problem was as remote as ever three times i brought my hands together and three times the jampot left me well played bob said somebody the bounder had done it i looked at his jampot there you are i said raspberry mines gooseberry a rotten vintage and look at my book alone on the prairie and youve got the mormons wedding no wonder i couldnt do it i refused to try it again as i didnt think i was being treated fairly and after bob and miss power had had a race at it which bob won we got on to something else of course you can pick a pin out of a chair with your teeth said miss power not properly i said i always swallow the pin i suppose it doesnt count if you swallow the pin said miss power thoughtfully i dont know ive never really thought about that side of it much anyhow unless youve got a whole lot of pins you dont want dont ask me to do it tonight accordingly we passed on to the watertrick i refused at this but miss power went full length on the floor with a glass of water balanced on her forehead and came up again without spilling a single drop personally i shouldnt have minded spilling a single drop it was the thought of spilling the whole glass that kept me back anyway it is a useless trick the need for which never arises in an ordinary career picking up the times with the teeth while clasping the left ankle with the right hand is another matter that might come in useful on occasions as for instance if having lost your left arm on the field and having to staunch with the right hand the flow of blood from a bullet wound in the opposite ankle you desired to glance through the financial supplement while waiting for the ambulance heres a nice little trick broke in bob as i was preparing myself in this way for the german invasion he had put two chairs together front to front and was standing over them a foot on the floor on each side of them if that conveys it to you then he jumped up turned round in the air and came down facing the other way can you do it i said to miss power come and try said bob to me its not really difficult i went and stood over the chairs then i moved them apart and walked over to my hostess goodbye i said im afraid i must go now coward said somebody who knew me rather better than the others its much easier than you think said bob i dont think its easy at all i protested i think its impossible i went back and stood over the chairs again for some time i waited there in deep thought then i bent my knees preparatory to the spring straightened them up and said what happens if you just miss it i suppose you bark your shins a bit yes thats what i thought i bent my knees again worked my arms up and down and then stopped suddenly and said what happens if you miss it pretty easily oh you can do it if bob can said miss power kindly hes practised i expect he started with two hassocks and worked up to this im not afraid but i want to know the possibilities if its only a broken leg or two i dont mind if its permanent disfigurement i think i ought to consult my family first i jumped up and came down again the same way for practice very well i said now im going to try i havent the faintest hope of doing it but you all seem to want to see an accident and anyhow im not going to be called a coward one two three well done cried everybody did i do it i whispered as i sat on the floor and pressed a cushion against my shins rather then i said massaging my ankles next time i shall try to miss the continental manner of course i should recognize simpson anywhere even at a masked ball besides who but simpson would go to a fancydress dance as a shortsighted executioner and wear his spectacles outside his mask but it was a surprise to me to see him there at all samuel i said gravely tapping him on the shoulder i shall have to write home about this he turned round with a start hallo he said eagerly how splendid but my dear old chap why arent you in costume i am i explained ive come as an architect luckily the evening clothes of an architect are similar to my own excuse me sir but do you want a house built how do you like my dress i am an executioner i left my axe in the cloakroom so i observe you know in real life one hardly ever meets an executioner who wears spectacles and yet of course if one cant see the head properly without glasses by jove said simpson there she is again columbine in a mask hurried past us and mixed with the crowd what one could see of her face looked pretty it seemed to have upset simpson altogether ask her for a dance i suggested be a gay dog simpson wake london up at a masked ball one is allowed a certain amount of licence exactly said simpson in some excitement one naturally looks for a little continental abandon at these dances portrait of simpson showing continental abandon and so i did ask her for a dance just now she was cold samuel i fear she said sorry im full up a ruse a mere subterfuge now look here ask her again and be more debonair and dashing this time what you want is to endue her with the spirit of revelry perhaps youd better go to the bar first and have a dry gingerale and then youll feel more in the continental mood by jove i will said simpson with great decision i wandered into the ballroom and looked round columbine was standing in a corner alone some outsider had cut her dance as i looked at her i thought of simpson letting himself go and smiled to myself she caught the edge of the smile and unconsciously smiled back remembering the good advice which i had just given another i decided to risk it do you ever dance with architects i asked her i do sometimes she said not in lent she added in lent i agreed one has to give up the more furious pleasures shall we just finish off this dance and dont lets talk shop about architecture we finished the dance and retired to the stairs i want you to do something for me i began cautiously anything except go into supper again ive just done that for somebody else no its not that the fact is i have a great friend called simpson it sounds a case for help she murmured he is here tonight disguised as an executioner in glasses he is in fact the only spectacled beheader present you cant miss him all the same i managed to just now she gurgled i know he asked you for a dance and you rebuffed him well he is now fortifying himself with a small dry ginger and he will then ask you again do be kind this time hes really a delightful person when you get to know him for instance both his whiskers are false no doubt i should grow to love him she agreed but i didnt much like his outward appearance however if both whiskers are false and if hes really a friend of yours he is naturally as harmless as a lamb i said but at a dance like this he considers it his duty to throw a little continental abandon into his manner columbine looked at me thoughtfully nodding her head and slowly began to smile you see i said the possibilities he shall have his dance she said decidedly thank you very much i should like to ask for another dance for myself later on but i am afraid i should try to get out of you what he said and that wouldnt be fair of course i shouldnt tell you well anyhow youll have had enough of us by then but softly he approaches and i must needs fly lest he should pierce my disguise goodbye and thank you so much so i cant say with authority what happened between simpson and columbine when they met but simpson and i had a cigarette together afterwards and certain things came out enough to make it plain that she must have enjoyed herself oh i say old chap he began jauntily do you know match thanks er whereabouts is finsbury circus youre too old to go to a circus now simpson come and have a day at the polytechnic instead dont be an ass its a place like oxford circus i suppose its in the city somewhere i wonder he murmured to himself what she would be doing in the city at eleven oclock in the morning perhaps her rich uncle is in a bank and she wants to shoot him i wish youd tell me what youre talking about simpson took off his mask and spectacles and wiped his brow dear old chap he said in a solemn voice in the case of a woman one cannot tell even ones best friend you know how it is well if theres going to be a duel you should have chosen some quieter spot than finsbury circus the motorbuses distract ones aim simpson was silent for a minute or two then a foolish smile flitted across his face to be followed suddenly by a look of alarm dont do anything that your mother wouldnt like i said warningly he frowned and put on his mask again are chrysanthemums in season he asked casually anyhow i suppose i could always get a yellow one you could simpson and you could put it in your buttonhole so that you can be recognized and go to finsbury circus to meet somebody at eleven oclock tomorrow morning samuel im ashamed of you er where do you lunch at the carlton old chap i got quite carried away things seemed to be arranged before i knew where i was and whats she going to wear so that you can recognize her yes said simpson getting up thats the worst of it i told her it was quite out of date and that only the suburbs wore fashions a year old but she insisted on it i had no idea she was that sort of girl well im in for it now he sighed heavily and went off for another gingerale i think that i must be at finsbury circus tomorrow for certainly no columbine in a harem skirt will be there simpson in his loneliness will be delighted to see me and then we can throw away his buttonhole and have a nice little lunch together two stories the making of a christmas story as carried out in the best end of fleet street yuletide london at yuletide a mantle of white lay upon the embankment where our story opens gleaming and glistening as it caught the rays of the cold december sun an embroidery of white fringed the trees and under a canopy of white the proud palaces of savoy and cecil reared their silent heads the mighty river in front was motionless for the finger of death had laid its icy hand upon it above the hard blue sky stretching to eternity below the white purity of innocence london in the grip of winter editor come i like this this is going to be good a cold day was it not author very all at once the quiet of the morning was disturbed in the distance a bell rang out sending a joyous paean to the heavens another took up the word and then another and another westminster caught the message from bartholomew the son of thunder and flung it to giles without who gave it gently to andrew by the wardrobe suddenly the air was filled with bells all chanting together of peace and happiness mirth and jollity a frenzy of bells the duke father of four fine children waking in his highland castle heard and smiled as he thought of his little ones the merchant prince turning over in his streatham residence heard and turned again to sleep with love for all mankind in his heart the pauper in his workhouse up betimes heard and chuckled at the prospect of his christmas dinner and on the embankment robert hardrow with a cynical smile on his lips listened to the splendid irony of it editor we really are getting to the story now are we not author that was all local colour i want to make it quite clear that it was christmas editor yes yes quite so this is certainly a christmas story i think i shall like robert do you know it was christmas day so much at least was clear to him with that same cynical smile on his lips he pulled his shivering rags about him and half unconsciously felt at the growth of beard about his chin nobody would recognize him now his friends as he had thought them would pass by without a glance for the poor outcast near them the women that he had known would draw their skirts away from him in horror even lady alice lady alice the cause of it all his thoughts flew back to that last scene but twentyfour hours ago when they had parted for ever as he had entered the hall he had half wondered to himself if there could be anybody in the world that day happier than himself tall wellconnected a vicepresident of the tariff reform league and engaged to the sweetest girl in england he had been the envy of all little did he think that that very night he was to receive his conge what mattered it now how or why they had quarrelled a few hasty words a bitter taunt tears and then the end a last cry from her go and let me never see your face again a last sneer from him i will go but first give me back the presents i have promised you then a slammed door and silence what use without her guidance to try to keep straight any more bereft of her love robert had sunk steadily gambling drink morphia billiards and cigars he had taken to them all until now in the wretched figure of the outcast on the embankment you would never have recognized the once spruce figure of handsome hardrow editor it all seems to have happened rather rapidly does it not twentyfour hours ago he had been author you forget that this is short story handsome hardow how absurd it sounded now he had let his beard grow his clothes were in rags a scar over one eye testified editor yes yes of course i quite admit that a man might go to the bad in twentyfour hours but would his beard grow as author look here youve heard of a man going grey with trouble in a single night havent you editor certainly author well its the same idea as that editor ah quite so quite so author where was i editor a scar over one eye was just testifying i suppose he had two eyes in the ordinary way testified to a drunken frolic of an hour or two ago never before thought the policeman as he passed upon his beat had such a pitiful figure cowered upon the embankment and prayed for the night to cover him the he was er the editor yes author to tell the truth i am rather stuck for the moment editor what is the trouble author i dont quite know what to do with robert for ten hours or so editor couldnt he go somewhere by a local line author this is not a humorous story the point is that i want him to be outside a certain house some twenty miles from town at eight oclock that evening editor if i were robert i should certainly start at once author no i have it as he sat there his thoughts flew over the bridge of years and he was wafted on the wings of memory to other and happier yuletides that christmas when he had received his first bicycle that christmas abroad the merry houseparty at the place of his cambridge friend yuletide at the towers where he had first met alice ah ten hours passed rapidly thus author i put dots to denote the flight of years editor besides it will give the reader time for a sandwich robert got up and shook himself editor one moment this is a christmas story when are you coming to the robin author i really cant be bothered about robins just now i assure you all the best christmas stories begin like this nowadays we may get to a robin later i cannot say editor we must my readers expect a robin and they shall have it and a wassailbowl and a turkey and a christmastree and a author yes yes but wait we shall come to little elsie soon and then perhaps it will be all right editor little elsie good robert got up and shook himself then he shivered miserably as the cold wind cut through him like a knife for a moment he stood motionless gazing over the stone parapet into the dark river beyond and as he gazed a thought came into his mind why not end it all here and now he had nothing to live for one swift plunge and editor you forget the river was frozen author dash it i was just going to say that but no even in this fate was against him the river was frozen over he turned away with a curse what happened afterwards robert never quite understood almost unconsciously he must have crossed one of the numerous bridges which span the river and join north london to south once on the other side he seems to have set his face steadily before him and to have dragged his weary limbs on and on regardless of time and place he walked like one in a dream his mind drugged by the dull narcotic of physical pain suddenly he realized that he had left london behind him and was in the more open spaces of the country the houses were more scattered the recurring villa of the clerk had given place to the isolated mansion of the stock broker each residence stood in its own splendid grounds surrounded by fine old forest trees and approached by a long carriage sweep electric editor quite so the whole forming a magnificent estate for a retired gentleman never mind that robert stood at the entrance to one of these houses and the iron entered into his soul how different was this mans position from his own what right had this man a perfect stranger to be happy and contented in the heart of his family while he robert stood a homeless wanderer alone in the cold almost unconsciously he wandered down the drive hardly realizing what he was doing until he was brought up by the gay lights of the windows still without thinking he stooped down and peered into the brilliantly lit room above him within all was jollity beautiful women moved to and fro and the happy laughter of children came to him elsie he heard someone call and a childish treble re sponded editor now for the robin author i am very sorry i have just remembered something rather sad the fact is that two days before elsie had forgotten to feed the robin and in consequence it had died before this story opens editor that is really very awkward i have already arranged with an artist to do some pictures and i remember i particularly ordered a robin and a wassail what about the wassail author elsie always had her porridge upstairs a terrible thought had come into roberts head it was nearly twelve oclock the houseparty was retiring to bed he heard the goodnights wafted through the open window the lights went out to reappear upstairs presently they too went out and robert was alone with the darkened house the temptation was too much for a conscience already sodden with billiards drink and cigars he flung a leg over the sill and drew himself gently into the room at least he would have one good meal he too would have his christmas dinner before the end came he switched the light on and turned eagerly to the table his eyes ravenously scanned the contents turkey mincepies plumpudding all was there as in the days of his youth editor this is better i ordered a turkey i remember what about the mistletoe and holly i rather think i asked for some of them author we must let the readers take something for granted editor i am not so sure couldnt you say something like this holly and mistletoe hung in festoons upon the wall indeed even holly and mistletoe hung in festoons upon the wall editor thank you with a sigh of content hardrow flung himself into a chair and seized a knife and fork soon a plate liberally heaped with good things was before him greedily he set to work with the appetite of a man who had not tasted food for several hours doodevening said a voice are you father kwistmas robert turned suddenly and gazed in amazement at the whiterobed figure in the doorway elsie he murmured huskily editor how did he know and why huskily author he didnt know he guessed and his mouth was full are you father kwistmas repeated elsie robert felt at his chin and thanked heaven again that he had let his beard grow almost mechanically he decided to wear the mask in short to dissemble yes my dear he said i just looked in to know what you would like me to bring you youre late arent oo oughtnt oo to have come this morning editor this is splendid this quite reconciles me to the absence of the robin but what was elsie doing downstairs author i am making robert ask her that question directly editor yes but just tell me now between friends author she had left her golliwog in the room and couldnt sleep without her editor i knew that was it if im late dear said robert with a smile why so are you the good food and wine in his veins were doing their work and a pleasant warmth was stealing over hardrow he found to his surprise that airy banter still came easy to him to what he continued lightly do i owe the honour of this meeting i came downstairs for my dolly said elsie the one you sent me this morning do you remember of course i do my dear and what have you bwought me now father kwistmas robert started if he was to play the role successfully he must find something to give her now the remains of the turkey a pair of fingerbowls his old hat all these came hastily into his mind and were dismissed he had nothing of value on him all had been pawned long ago stay the gold locket studded with diamonds and rubies which contained alices photograph the one memento of her that he had kept even when the pangs of starvation were upon him he brought it from its restingplace next his heart a little something to wear round your neck child he said see thank oo said elsie why it opens yes it opens said robert moodily why its alith sister alith editor ha author i thought youd like that robert leapt to his feet as if he had been shot who he cried my sister alith does oo know her too alices sister heavens he covered his face with his hands the door opened editor ha again what are you doing here elsie said a voice go to bed child why who is this father kwithmath thithter editor how exactly do you work the lisping author what do you mean dont children of elsies tender years lisp sometimes editor yes but just now she said kwistmas quite correctly author i am glad you noticed that that was an effect which i intended to produce lisping is brought about by placing the tongue upon the hard surface of the palate and in cases where the subject is unduly excited or influenced by emotion the lisp becomes more pronounced in this case editor yeth i thee send her away cried robert without raising his head the door opened and closed again well said alice calmly and who are you you may have lied to this poor child but you cannot deceive me you are not father christmas the miserable man raised his shamefaced head and looked haggardly at her alice he muttered dont you remember me she gazed at him earnestly robert but how changed since we parted alice much has happened yet it seems only yesterday that i saw you editor it was only yesterday author yes yes dont interrupt now please to me it has seemed years but what are

joseph then i have broken into your uncle josephs house alice send me away put me in prison do what you will to me i can never hold up my head again lady alice looked gently at the wretched figure in front of her i am glad to see you again she said because i wanted to say that it was my fault alice can you forgive me forgive you if you knew what my life has been since i left you if you knew into what paths of wickedness i have sunk how only this evening unnerved by excess i have deliberately broken into this house your uncle josephs house in order to obtain food already i have eaten more than half a turkey and the best part of a plumpudding if you knew i with a gesture of infinite compassion she stopped him then let us forgive each other she said with a smile a new year is beginning robert he took her in his arms listen he said in the distance the bells began to ring in the new year a message of hope to all weary travellers on lifes highway it was new years day editor i thought christmas day had started on the embankment this would be boxing day author im sorry but it must end like that i must have my bells you can explain somehow editor thats all very well i have a good deal to explain as it is some of your story doesnt fit the pictures at all and it is too late now to get new ones done author i am afraid i cannot work to order editor yes i know the artist said the same thing well i must manage somehow i suppose goodbye rotten weather for august isnt it a matteroffact fairy tale once upon a time there was a king who had three sons the two eldest were lazy goodfornothing young men but the third son whose name was charming was a delightful youth who was loved by everybody outside his family who knew him whenever he rode through the town the people used to stop whatever work they were engaged upon and wave their caps and cry hurrah for prince charming and even after he had passed they would continue to stop work in case he might be coming back the same way when they would wave their caps and cry hurrah for prince charming again it was wonderful how fond of him they were but alas his father the king was not so fond he preferred his eldest son which was funny of him because he must have known that only the third and youngest son is ever any good in a family indeed the king himself had been a third son so he had really no excuse for ignorance on the point i am afraid the truth was that he was jealous of charming because the latter was so popular outside his family now there lived in the palace an old woman called countess caramel who had been governess to charming when he was young when the queen lay dying the countess had promised her that she would look after her youngest boy for her and charming had often confided in caramel since one morning when his family had been particularly rude to him at breakfast charming said to her countess i have made up my mind and i am going into the world to seek my fortune i have been waiting for this said the countess here is a magic ring wear it always on your little finger and whenever you want help turn it round once and help will come charming thanked her and put the ring on his finger then he turned it round once just to make sure that it worked immediately the oddest little dwarf appeared in front of him speak and i will obey said the dwarf now charming didnt want anything at all just then so after thinking for a moment he said go away the dwarf a little surprised disappeared this is splendid thought charming and he started on his travels with a light heart the sun was at its highest as he came to a thick wood and in its shade he lay down to rest he was awakened by the sound of weeping rising hastily to his feet he peered through the trees and there fifty yards away from him by the side of a stream sat the most beautiful damsel he had ever seen wringing her hands and sobbing bitterly prince charming grieving at the sight of beauty in such distress coughed and came nearer princess he said tenderly for he knew she must be a princess you are in trouble how can i help you fair sir she answered i had thought to be alone but since you are here you can help me if you will i have a a brother but charming did not want to talk about brothers he sat down on a fallen log beside her and looked at her entranced i think you are the most lovely lady in all the world he said am i said the princess whose name by the way was beauty she looked away from him and there was silence between them charming a little at a loss fidgeted nervously with his ring and began to speak again ever since i have known you you are in need of help said the dwarf appearing suddenly certainly not said charming angrily not in the least i can manage this quite well by myself speak and i will obey then go away said charming and the dwarf who was beginning to lose his grip of things again disappeared the princess having politely pretended to be looking for something while this was going on turned to him again come with me she said and i will show you how you can help me she took him by the hand and led him down a narrow glade to a little clearing in the middle of the wood then she made him sit down beside her on the grass and there she told him her tale there is a giant called blunderbus she said who lives in a great castle ten miles from here he is a terrible magician and years ago because i would not marry him he turned my my brother into a i dont know how to tell you into a a tortoise she put her hands to her face and sobbed again why a tortoise said charming knowing that sympathy was useless but feeling that he ought to say something i dont know he just thought of it it it isnt a very nice thing to be and why should he turn your brother into it i mean if he had turned you into a tortoise of course he went on hurriedly im very glad he didnt thank you said beauty but i dont understand why he knew he could hurt me more by making my brother a tortoise than by making me one she explained and looked at him anxiously this was a new idea to charming who had two brothers of his own and he looked at her in some surprise oh what does it matter why he did it she cried as he was about to speak why do giants do things i dont know princess said charming remorsefully and kissed her hand tell me how i can help you my brother said beauty was to have met me here he is late again she sighed and added he used to be so punctual but how can i help him asked charming it is like this the only way in which the enchantment can be taken off him is for someone to kill the giant but if once the enchantment has stayed on for seven years then it stays on for ever here she looked down and burst into tears the seven years she sobbed are over at sundown this afternoon i see said charming thoughtfully here is my brother cried beauty an enormous tortoise came slowly into view beauty rushed up to him and having explained the situation rapidly made the necessary introduction charmed said the tortoise you cant miss the castle its the only one near here and blunderbus is sure to be at home i need not tell you how grateful i shall be if you kill him though i must say he added it puzzles me to think how you are going to do it i have a friend who will help me said charming fingering his ring well i only hope youll be luckier than the others the others cried charming in surprise yes didnt she tell you about the others who had tried i forgot to said beauty frowning at him ah well perhaps in that case wed better not go into it now said the tortoise but before you start i should like to talk to you privately for a moment he took charming on one side and whispered i say do you know anything about tortoises very little said charming in fact then you dont happen to know what they eat im afraid i dont dash it why doesnt anybody know the others all made the most ridiculous suggestions steak and kidney puddings and shrimp sandwiches and buttered toast dear me the nights we had after the shrimp sandwiches and the fool swore he had kept tortoises all his life if i may say so said charming i should have thought that you would have known best the same silly idea they all have said the tortoise testily when blunderbus put this enchantment on me do you suppose he got a blackboard and a piece of chalk and gave me a lecture on the diet and habits of the common tortoise before showing me out of the front gate no he simply turned me into the form of a tortoise and left my mind and soul as it was before ive got the anatomy of a tortoise ive got the very delicate inside of a tortoise but i dont think like one stupid else i shouldnt mind being one i never thought of that no one does except me and i can think of nothing else he paused and added confidentially were trying rum omelettes just now somehow i dont think tortoises really like them however we shall see i suppose youve never heard anything definite against them you neednt bother about that said charming briskly by tonight you will be a man again and he patted him encouragingly on the shell and returned to take an affectionate farewell of the princess as soon as he was alone charming turned the ring round his finger and the dwarf appeared before him the same as usual said the dwarf preparing to vanish at the word he was just beginning to get into the swing of it no no said charming hastily i really want you this time he thought for a moment i want he said at last a sword one that will kill giants instantly a gleaming sword was at his feet he picked it up and examined it is this really a magic sword it has but to inflict one scratch said the dwarf and the result is death charming who had been feeling the blade took his thumb away hastily then i shall want a cloak of darkness he said behold here it is beneath this cloak the wearer is invisible to the eyes of his enemies one thing more said charming a pair of sevenleague boots thank you that is all today directly the dwarf was gone charming kicked off his shoes and stepped into the magic boots then he seized the sword and the cloak and darted off on his ladys behest he had barely gone a hundred paces before a sudden idea came to him and he pulled himself up short let me see he reflected the castle was ten miles away these are sevenleague boots so that i have come about two thousand miles i shall have to go back he took some hasty steps back and found himself in the wood from which he had started well said princess beauty have you killed him no nno stammered charming not exactly killed him i was just just practising something the fact is he added confidentially ive got a pair of new boots on and he saw the look of cold surprise in her face and went on quickly i swear princess that i will not return to you again without his head he took a quick step in the direction of the castle and found himself soaring over it turned eleven miles off and stepped back a pace overshot it again and arrived at the very feet of the princess his head said beauty eagerly i i must have dropped it said charming hastily pretending to feel for it ill just go and he stepped off in confusion eleven miles the wrong side of the castle charming sat down to think it out it was but two hours to sundown without his magic boots he would get to the castle too late of course what he really wanted to do was to erect an isosceles triangle on a base of eleven miles having two sides of twentyone miles each but this was before euclids time however by taking one step to the north and another to the southwest he found himself close enough a short but painful walk with his boots in his hand brought him to his destination he had a moments natural hesitation about making a first call at the castle in his stockinged feet but consoled himself with the thought that in lifeanddeath matters one cannot bother about little points of etiquette and that anyhow the giant would not be able to see him then donning the magic cloak and with the magic sword in his hand he entered the castle gates for an instant his heart seemed to stop beating but the thought of the princess gave him new courage the giant was sitting in front of the fire his great spiked club between his knees at charmings entry he turned round gave a start of surprise bent forward eagerly a moment and then leant back chuckling like most overgrown men he was naturally kindhearted and had a simple humour but he could be stubborn when he liked the original affair of the tortoise seems to have shown him both at his best and at his worst why do you walk like that he said pleasantly to charming the baby is not asleep charming stopped short you see me he cried furiously of course i do really you mustnt expect to come into a house without anything on your feet and not be a little noticeable even in a crowd i should have picked you out that miserable dwarf said charming savagely swore solemnly to me that beneath this cloak i was invisible to the eyes of my enemies but then we arent enemies smiled the giant sweetly i like you immensely theres something about you directly you came in i think it must be love at first sight so thats how he tricked me oh no it wasnt really like that the fact is you are invisible beneath that cloak only youll excuse my pointing it out there are such funny bits of you that arent beneath the cloak youve no idea how odd you look just a head and two legs and a couple of arms waists he murmured to himself are not being worn this year but charming had had enough of talk gripping his sword firmly he threw aside his useless cloak dashed forward and with a beautiful lunge pricked his enemy in the ankle victory he cried waving his magic sword above his head thus is beautys brother delivered the giant stared at him for a full minute then he put his hands to his sides and fell back shaking in his chair her brother he roared well of all the her brother he rolled on the floor in a paroxysm of mirth her brother oh you youll kill me her bbbbbrother her bbbb her bbb her bb the world suddenly seemed very cold to charming he turned the ring on his finger well said the dwarf i want said charming curtly to be back at home riding through the streets on my cream palfrey amidst the cheers of the populace at once an hour later princess beauty and prince udo who was not her brother gazed into each others eyes and beautys last illusion went youve altered she said slowly yes im not really much like a tortoise said udo humorously i meant since seven years ago youre much stouter than i thought time hasnt exactly stood still with you you know beauty yet you saw me every day and went on loving me weller he shuffled his feet and looked away didnt you well you see of course i wanted to get back you see and as long as you i mean if we if you thought we were in love with each other then of course you were ready to help me and so youre quite old and bald i cant think why i didnt notice it before well you wouldnt when i was a tortoise said udo pleasantly as tortoises go i was really quite a youngster besides anyhow one never notices baldness in a tortoise i think said beauty weighing her words carefully i think youve gone off a good deal in looks in the last day or two charming was home in time for dinner and next morning he was more popular than ever outside his family as he rode through the streets of the city but blunderbus lay dead in his castle you and i know that he was killed by the magic sword yet somehow a strange legend grew up around his death and ever afterwards in that country when one man told his neighbour a more than ordinarily humorous anecdote the latter would cry in between the gusts of merriment dont youll make me die of laughter and then he would pull himself together and add with a sigh like blunderbus an odd lot the coming of the crocus its a bootiful day again sir said my gardener james looking in at the study window bootiful james bootiful i said as i went on with my work you might almost say as spring was here at last like cross your fingers quickly james and touch wood look here ill be out in a minute and give you some orders but im very busy just now thought praps youd like to know theres eleven crocuses in the front garden then send them away weve got nothing for them crocuses shouted james i jumped up eagerly and climbed through the window my dear man i said shaking him warmly by the hand this is indeed a day crocuses and in the front gar on the south lawn let us go and gaze at them there they were eleven of them six golden ones four white and a little mauve chap this is a triumph for you james its wonderful has anything like this ever happened to you before therell be some more up tomorrow i wont say as not those really are growing are they you havent been pushing them in from the top they were actually born on the estate therell be a fine one in the back bed soon said james proudly in the back my dear james in the spare bed on the northeast terrace i suppose you mean and what have we in the dutch ornamental garden if i has to look after ornamental gardens and south aspics and all i ought to have my salary raised said james still harping on his one grievance by all means raise some celery i said coldly take a spade and raise some for lunch i shall be only too delighted this here isnt the season for celery as you know well this heres the season for crocuses as anyone can see if they use their eyes james youre right forgive me it is no day for quarrelling it was no day for working either the sun shone upon the closecropped green of the deer park the sky was blue above the rose garden in the tapioca grove a thrush was singing i walked up and down my estate and drank in the good fresh air james i called to my head gardener what is it now he grumbled are there no daffodils to take the winds of march with beauty theres these eleven croc but there should be daffodils too is not this march it may be march but tisnt the time for daffodils not on three shillings a week do you only get three shillings a week i thought it was three shillings an hour likely an hour ah well i knew it was three shillings do you know james in the scilly islands there are fields and fields and fields of nodding daffodils out now lor said james did you say lor or liar i asked suspiciously to think of that now said james cautiously he wandered off to the tapioca grove leant against it in thought for a moment and came back to me whats wrong with this little bit of garden this here park he began is the soil its no soil for daffodils now what daffodils like is clay then for heavens sake get them some clay spare no expense get them anything they fancy its too alloovial thats whats the matter too alloovial now crocuses like a bit of alloovial thats where you have it the matter with james is that he hasnt enough work to do the rest of the staff is so busily employed that it is hardly ever visible william for instance is occupied entirely with what i might call the poultry it is his duty in fact to see that there are always enough ants eggs for the goldfish all these prize leghorns you hear about are the merest novices compared with williams protegees then john looks after the staggery henry works the coloured fountain and peter paints the peacocks tails this keeps them all busy but james is for ever hanging about almost seems as if they were yooman he said as we stood and listened to the rooks oh are you there james its a beautiful day who said that first i believe you did them there rooks always make a place seem so homelike rooks and crocuses i say and you dont want anything more yes well if the rooks want to build in the raspberry canes this year let them james dont be inhospitable course some do like to see primroses i dont say but primroses i knew there was something where are they its too early for them said james hastily you wont get primroses now before april dont say now as if it were my fault why didnt you plant them earlier i dont believe you know any of the tricks of your profession james you never seem to graft anything or prune anything and im sure you dont know how to cut a slip james why dont you prune more prune now i should like to watch you wheres your pruninghook you cant possibly do it with a rake james spends most of his day with a rake sometimes leaning on it sometimes working with it the beds are always beautifully kept only the most hardy annual would dare to poke its head up and spoil the smooth appearance of the soil for those who like circles and rectangles of unrelieved brown james is undoubtedly the man as i stood in the sun i had a brilliant idea james i said well cut the croquet lawn this afternoon you cant play croquet today its not warm enough i dont pay you to argue but to obey at the same time i should like to point out that i never said i was going to play croquet i said that we meaning you would cut the lawn whats the good of that why to encourage the wonderful day of course where is your gratitude man dont you want to do something to help how can we let a day like this go past without some word of welcome out with the mower and let us hail the passing of winter james looked at me in disgust gratitude he said indignantly to heaven and theres my eleven crocuses in the front all asinging together like anything on three bob a week the ordeal by fire our flameflower the family flameflower is now plainly established in the northeast corner of the pergola and flourishes exceedingly there or thereabouts it will remain through the generations to come a cascade of glory to the eye a fountain of pride to the soul our fathers fathers the unborn will say of us performed this thing they toiled and suffered that we might front the world with confidence a family secure in the knowledge that it has been tried by fire and not found wanting the atherleys flameflower i am glad to inform you is dead we started the work five years ago i was young and ignorant then i did not understand one day they led me to an old apple tree and showed me fenced in at its foot two twigs and a hint of leaf the flameflower they said with awe in their voices i was very young i said that i didnt think much of it it was from that moment that my education began everybody who came to see us had to be shown the flameflower visitors were conducted to the apple tree in solemn procession and presented they peered over the fence and said aah just as if they knew all about it perhaps some of them did perhaps some of them had tried to grow it in their own gardens as november came on and the air grew cold the question whether the flameflower should winter abroad became insistent after much thought it was moved to the shrubbery on the southern side of the house where it leant against a laburnum until april with the spring it returned home seemingly stronger for the change but the thought of winter was too much for it and in october it was ordered south again for the next three years it was constantly trying different climates and testing various diets though it was touch and go with it all this time our faith was strong our courage unshaken june found it in the gravelpit it seemed our only hope and in the august of that year i went and stayed with the atherleys one morning at breakfast i challenged miss atherley to an immediate game of tennis not directly after said mrs atherley its so bad for you besides we must just plant our flameflower first i dropped my knife and fork and gazed at her openmouthed plant your what i managed to say at last flameflower do you know it john brought one down last night it looks so pretty growing up anything it wont take a moment said miss atherley and then ill beat you but but you mustnt you you mustnt talk like that about it i stammered ththats not the way to talk about a flameflower why whats wrong youre just going to plant it before you play tennis it isnt a a buttercup you cant do it like that oh but do give us any hints we shall be only too grateful hints just going to plant it i repeated getting more and more indignant i i suppose sir christopher wren ssaid to his wife at breakfast one morning ive just got to design st pauls cathedral dear and then ill come and play tennis with you if you can give me any hints is it really so difficult asked mrs atherley weve seen lots of it in scotland in scotland yes not in the south of england i paused and then added we have one what soil is yours do you plant it very deep do they like a lot of water these and other technical points were put to me at once those are mere details of horticulture i said what i am protesting against is the whole spirit in which you approach the business the lighthearted way in which you assume that you can support a flameflower you have to be a very superior family indeed to have a flameflower growing in your garden they laughed they thought i was joking well were going to plant it now anyhow said miss atherley come along and help us we went out six of us mrs atherley carrying the precious thing and we gathered round an old tree trunk in front of the house it would look rather pretty here said mrs atherley dont you think i gave a great groan you you youre all wrong again i said in despair you dont put a flameflower in a place where you think it will look pretty you try in all humility to find a favoured spot where it will be pleased to grow there may be such a spot in your garden or there may not until i know you better i cannot say but it is extremely unlikely to be here right in front of the window they laughed again and began to dig up the ground i turned my back in horror i could not watch and at the last moment some qualms of doubt seized even them they spoke to me almost humbly how would you plant it they asked it was my last chance of making them realize their responsibility i cannot say at this moment i began exactly how the ceremony should be performed but i should endeavour to think of something in keeping with the solemnity of the occasion it may be that mrs atherley and i would take the flower and march in procession round the fountain singing a suitable chant while bob and archie with shaven heads prostrated themselves before the sundial miss atherley might possibly dance the firedance upon the east lawn while mr atherley stood upon one foot in the middle of the herbaceous border and played upon her with the garden hose these or other symbolic rites we should perform before we planted it in a place chosen by chance then leaving a saucer of new milk for it lest it should thirst in the night we would go away and spend the rest of the week in meditation i paused for breath that might do it i added or it might not but at least that is the sort of spirit that you want to show once more they laughed and then they planted it these have been two difficult years for me there have been times when i have almost lost faith and not even the glories of our own flameflower could cheer me but at last the news came i was at home for the weekend and after rather a tiring day showing visitors the northeast end of the pergola i went indoors for a rest on the table there was a letter for me it was from mrs atherley by the way she wrote the flameflower is dead by the way but even if they had taken the business seriously even if they had understood fully what a great thing it was they were attempting even then i think they would have failed for though i like the atherleys very much though i think them all extremely jolly yet i doubt you know if they are quite the family to have a flameflower growing in their garden the lucky month know thyself said the old greek motto in greek but this is an english book so i bought a little red volume called tersely enough were you born in january i was and reassured on this point the author told me all about myself for the most part he told me nothing new you are he said in effect goodtempered courageous ambitious loyal quick to resent wrong an excellent raconteur and a leader of men true generous to a fault yes i was overdoing that rather you have a ready sympathy with the distressed people born in this month will always keep their promises and so on there was no doubt that the author had the idea all right even when he went on to warn me of my weaknesses he maintained the correct note people born in january he said must be on their guard against working too strenuously their extraordinarily active brains well you see what he means it is a fault perhaps and i shall be more careful in future mind i do not take offence with him for calling my attention to it in fact my only objection to the book is its surface application to all the people who were born in january there should have been more distinction made between me and the rabble i have said that he told me little that was new in one matter however he did open my eyes he introduced me to an aspect of myself entirely unsuspected they he saidmeaning me have unusual business capacity and are destined to be leaders in great commerical enterprises one gets at times these flashes of selfrevelation in an instant i realized how wasted my life had been in an instant i resolved that here and now i would put my great gifts to their proper uses i would be a leader in an immense commercial enterprise one cannot start commercial enterprises without capital the first thing was to determine the exact nature of my balance at the bank this was a matter for the bank to arrange and i drove there rapidly goodmorning i said to the cashier i am in rather a hurry may i have my passbook he assented and retired after an interminable wait during which many psychological moments for commercial enterprise must have lapsed he returned i think you have it he said shortly thank you i replied and drove rapidly home again a lengthy search followed but after an hour of it one of those whitehot flashes of thought such as only occur to the natural business genius seared my mind and sent me posthaste to the bank again after all i said to the cashier i only want to know my balance what is it he withdrew and gave himself up to calculation i paced the floor impatiently opportunities were slipping by at last he pushed a slip of paper across at me my balance it was in four figures unfortunately two of them were shillings and pence still there was a matter of fifty pounds odd as well and fortunes have been built up on less out in the street i had a moments pause hitherto i had regarded my commercial enterprise in the bulk as a finished monument of industry the little niggling preliminary details had not come up for consideration just for a second i wondered how to begin only for a second an unsuspected talent which has long lain dormant needs when waked a second or so to turn round in at the end of that time i had made up my mind i knew exactly what i would do i would ring up my solicitor hallo is that you yes this is me what yes awfully thanks how are you good look here come and lunch with me what no at once goodbye business particularly that sort of commercial enterprise to which i had now decided to lend my genius can only be discussed properly over a cigar during the meal itself my solicitor and i indulged in the ordinary smalltalk of the pleasureloving world youre looking very fit said my solicitor no not fat fit you dont think im looking thin i asked anxiously people are warning me that i may be overdoing it rather they tell me that i must be seriously on my guard against brain strain i suppose they think you oughtnt to strain it too suddenly said my solicitor though he is now a solicitor he was once just an ordinary boy like the rest of us and it was in those days that he acquired the habit of being rude to me a habit he has never quite forgotten what is an onyx i said changing the conversation why asked my solicitor with his usual business acumen well i was practically certain that i had seen one in the zoo in the reptile house but i have just learnt that it is my lucky month stone naturally i want to get one the coffee came and we settled down to commerce i was just going to ask you said my solicitor have you any money lying idle at the bank because if so whatever else it is doing it isnt lying idle i protested i was at the bank today and there were men chivying it about with shovels all the time well how much have you got about fifty pounds it ought to be more than that thats what i say but you know what banks are actual merit counts for nothing with them well what did you want to do with it exactly that was why i rang you up i er this was really my moment but somehow i was not quite ready to seize it my vast commercial enterprise still lacked a few trifling details er i well its like that i might get you a few ground rents dont i shouldnt know where to put them but if you really have fifty pounds simply lying idle i wish youd lend it to me for a bit im confoundedly hard up generous to a fault you have a ready sympathy with the distressed dash it what could i do is it quite etiquette for clients to lend solicitors money i asked i thought it was always solicitors who had to lend it to clients if i must id rather lend it to you i mean id dislike it less as to the old friend of my childhood yes thats how i wanted to pay it back bother then ill send you a cheque tonight i sighed and thats where we are at the moment people born in this month always keep their promises the money has got to go tonight if i hadnt been born in january i shouldnt be sending it i certainly shouldnt have promised it i shouldnt even have known that i had it sometimes i almost wish that i had been born in one of the decent months march say a summer cold when i am not feeling very well i go to beatrice for sympathy and advice anyhow i get the advice i think i said carelessly wishing to break it to her as gently as possible i think i have hayfever nonsense said beatrice that annoyed me why shouldnt i have hayfever if i wanted to if youre going to begrudge me every little thing i began you havent even got a cold as luck would have it a sneeze chose that moment for its arrival there i said triumphantly why my dear boy if you had hayfever youd be sneezing all day that was only a sample there are lots more where that came from dont be so silly fancy starting hayfever in september im not starting it i am i earnestly hope just finishing it if you want to know ive had a cold all the summer well i havent noticed it thats because im such a good actor ive been playing the part of a man who hasnt had a cold all the summer my performance is considered to be most lifelike beatrice disdained to answer and by and by i sneezed again you certainly have a cold she said putting down her work come this is something you must be careful how did you catch it i didnt catch it it caught me last weekend no last may beatrice picked up her work again impatiently i sneezed a third time is this more the sort of thing you want i said what i say is that you couldnt have had hayfever all the summer without people knowing but my dear beatrice people do know in this quiet little suburb you are rather out of the way of the busy world rumours of war depressions on the stock exchange my hayfever these things pass you by but the clubs are full of it i assure you that all over the country englands stately homes have been plunged into mourning by the news of my sufferings historic piles have bowed their heads and wept i suppose you mean that in every house youve been to this summer youve told them that you had it and theyve been foolish enough to believe you thats putting it a little crudely what happens is well all i can say is you know a very silly lot of people what happens is that when the mahogany has been cleared of its polished silver and choice napery and wine of a rare old vintage is circulating from hand to hand if they wanted to take any notice of you at all they could have given you a bread poultice and sent you to bed then as we impatiently bite the ends off our priceless havanas they might know that you couldnt possibly have hayfever i sat up suddenly and spoke to beatrice why on earth shouldnt i have hayfever i demanded have you any idea what hayfever is i suppose you think i ought to be running about wildly trying to eat hay or yapping and showing an unaccountable aversion from dried grass i take it that there are grades of hayfever as there are of everything else i have it at present in a mild form instead of being thankful that it is no worse you my dear boy hayfever is a thing people have all their lives and it comes on every summer youve never even pretended to have it before this year yes but you must start some time im a little backward perhaps just because there are a few infant prodigies about dont despise me in a year or two i shall be as regular as the rest of them and i sneezed again beatrice got up with an air of decision and left the room for a moment i thought she was angry and had gone for a policeman but as the minutes went by and she didnt return i began to fear that she might have left the house for good i was wondering how i should break the news to her husband when to my relief she came in again you may be right she said putting down a small package and unpinning her hat try this the chemist says its the best hayfever cure there is its in a lot of languages i said as i took the wrapper off i suppose german hay is the same as any other sort of hay oh here it is in english i say this is a whatdyoucallit cure so the man said homeopathic its made from the pollen that causes hayfever yes ah yes i coughed slightly and looked at beatrice out of the corner of my eye i suppose i said carelessly if anybody took this who hadnt got hayfever the results might be rather i mean that he might then find that hein fact er had got it sure to said beatrice yes that makes us a little thoughtful we dont want to overdo this thing i went on reading the instructions you know its rather odd about my hayfever its generally worse in town than in the country but then you started so late dear you havent really got into the swing of it yet yes but still you know i have my doubts about the gentleman who invented this we dont see eye to eye in this matter beatrice you may be right perhaps i havent got hayfever oh dont give up but all the same i know ive got something its a funny thing about my being worse in town than in the country that looks rather as if by jove i know what it is ive got just the opposite of hayfever what is the opposite of hay why bricks and things i gave a last sneeze and began to wrap up the cure take this pollen stuff back i said to beatrice and ask the man if hes got anything homoeopathic made from pavingstones because you know thats what i really want you have got a cold said beatrice a modern cinderella once upon a time there was a beautiful girl who lived in a mansion in park lane with her mother and her two sisters and a crowd of servants cinderella for that was her name would have dearly loved to have employed herself about the house sometimes but whenever she did anything useful like arranging the flowers or giving the pug a bath her mother used to say cinderella what do you think i engage servants for please dont make yourself so common cinderellas two sisters were much older and plainer than herself and their mother had almost given up hope about them but she used to drag cinderella to balls and dances night after night taking care that only the right sort of person was introduced to her there were many nights when cinderella would have preferred a book at home in front of the fire for she soon found that her partners ideas of waltzing were as catholic as their conversation was limited it was indeed this fondness for the inglenook that had earned her the name of cinderella one day when she was in the middle of a delightful story her mother came in suddenly and cried cinderella why arent you resting as i told you you know we are going to the hogbins tonight oh mother pleaded cinderella need i go to the dance dont be so absurd of course youre going but ive got nothing to wear ive told jennings what youre to wear now go and lie down i want you to look your best tonight because i hear that young mr hogbin is back again from australia young mr hogbin was not the kings son he was the son of a wealthy gelatine manufacturer then may i come away at twelve begged cinderella youll come away when i tell you cinderella made a face and went upstairs oh dear she thought to herself i wish i were as old as my two sisters and could do what i liked im sure if my godmother were here she would get me off going but alas her godmother lived at leamington and cinderella after a week at leamington had left her there only yesterday cinderella indeed looked beautiful as they started for the ball but her mother who held a review of her in the drawingroom was not quite satisfied cinderella she said you know i said you were to wear the silver slippers oh mother they are so tight pleaded cinderella dont you remember i told you at the time they were much too small for me nonsense go and put them on at once the dance was in full swing when cinderella arrived although her lovely appearance caused several of the guests to look at her they did not ask each other eagerly who she was for most of them knew her already as miss partingtonsmith a brewers son led her off to dance the night wore on slowly one young man after another trod on cinderellas toes trotted in circles round her ran her violently backwards into some other man or swooped with her into the fireplace cinderella whose feet seemed mechanically to adapt themselves to the interpretation of the boston that was forming in her partners brain bore it from each one as long as she could and then led the way to a quiet corner where she confessed frankly that she had not bought all her christmas presents yet and that she was going to switzerland for the winter the gelatine manufacturers son took her in to supper it was noticed that cinderella looked much happier as soon as they had sat down and indeed throughout the meal she was in the highest spirits for some reason or other she seemed to find even mr hogbin endurable but just as they were about to return to the ballroom an expression of absolute dismay came over her face anything the matter said her partner n no said cinderella but she made no effort to move well shall we come y yes she waited a moment longer dropped her fan under the table picked it up slowly and followed him out lets sit down here she said in the hall not upstairs they sat in silence for he had exhausted his stock of questions at the end of their first dance and had told her all about australia during supper while she apparently had no desire for conversation of any kind being wrapped up in her thoughts ill wait here she said as a dance began if you see mother i wish youd send her to me her mother came up eagerly well dear she said mother said cinderella do take me home at once something extraordinary has happened its young mr hogbin i knew it who oh er yes of course ill tell you all about it in the carriage mother is my little girl going to be happy i dont know said cinderella anxiously theres just a chance the chance must have come off for once in the carriage cinderella gave a deep sigh of happiness well dear said her mother again youll never guess mother laughed cinderella try i guess that my little daughter thinks of running away from me said her mother archly am i right oh how lovely why running away is simply the last thing i could do look she stretched out her footclothed only in a pale blue stocking cinderella i told you they were too tight she explained rapidly and i was trodden on by every man in the place and i simply had to kick them off at supper and and i only got one back i dont know what happened to the other i suppose it got pushed along somewhere but anyhow i wasnt going under the table after it she laughed suddenly and softly to herself i wonder what theyll do when they find the slipper she said of course the kings son or anyhow mr hogbin ought to have sent it round to all the ladies in mayfair taking knightly oath to marry her whom it fitted but what actually happened was that a footman found it and being very sentimental and knowing that nobody would ever dare to claim it carried it about with him ever afterwards thereby gaining a great reputation with his cronies as a nut oh and by the way i ought to put in a good word for the godmother she did her best cinderella said her mother at lunch next day as she looked up from her letters why didnt you tell me your godmother was ill she wasnt very well when i left her but i didnt think it was anything much is she bad i am sorry she writes that she has obtained measles i suppose that means youre infectious really its very inconvenient well im glad we didnt know yesterday or you couldnt have gone to the dance dear fairy godmother said cinderella to herself she was a day too late but how sweet of her to think of it at all a literary light annesley bupp was born one of the bupps of hampshire the fighting bupps as they were called a sudden death in the family left him destitute at the early age of thirty and he decided to take seriously to journalism for a living that was twelve years ago he is now a member of the authors club a popular afterdinner speaker in reply to the toast of literature and one of the bestpaid writers in fleet street whos who tells the world that he has a flat at knightsbridge and a cottage on the river if you ask him to what he owes his success he will assure you with the conscious modesty of all great men that he has been lucky pressed further that hard work and method have been his watchwords but to the young aspirant he adds that of course if you have it in you it is bound to come out i when annesley started journalism he realized at once that it was necessary for him to specialize in some subject of such subjects two occurred to him george herbert and trams for a time he hesitated and it was only the sudden publication of a brief but authoritative life of the poet which led him finally to the study of one of the least explored of our transit systems meanwhile he had to support himself for this purpose he bought a rolltop desk a typewriter and an almanac he placed the almanac on top of the desk seated himself at the typewriter and began it was the month of february the almanac told him that it wanted a week to shrove tuesday in four days he had written as many articles entitled respectively shrovetide customs the pancake lenten observances and tuesdays known to fame the pancake giving as it did the context of every reference in literature to pancakes was the most scholarly of the four the tuesday article which hazarded the opinion that rome may at least have been begun on a tuesday the most daring but all of them were published this early success showed annesley the possibilities of the topical article it led him also to construct a revised calendar for his own use in the bupp almanac the events of the day were put back a fortnight so that if the feast of st simon and st jude fell upon the th annesleys attention was called to it upon the rd and upon the rd he surveyed the famous partnerships of the epoch similarly the origin of lord mayors day was put in hand on october th he did not however only glorify the past current events claimed their meed of copy in the days of his dependence annesley had travelled so that he could well provide the local colour for such sketches as kimberley as i knew it and birmingham by moonlight his recollections of st peters at rome were hazy yet sufficient to furnish an article with that title at the time of the coronation but i must confess that dashes for the pole came entirely from his invaluable encyclopaedia ii annesley bupp had devoted himself to literature for two years before his first article on trams was written this was called voltage was highly technical and convinced every editor to whom it was sent and by whom it was returned that the author knew his subject thoroughly so when he followed it up with how to be a tram conductor he had the satisfaction not only of seeing it in print within a week but of reading an editorial reference to himself as the noted expert on our overhead system two other articles in the same paper some curious tram accidents and tram or bus which established his position once recognized as the authority on trams bupp was never at a loss for a subject in the first place there were certain articles such as tramways in progress of tramway construction in the past year tramway inventions of the last twelvemonth and the tram its future in which flowed annually from his pen from time to time there would arise the occasion for the topical article on trams trams as army transports and how our trams fared during the recent snow to give two obvious examples and always there was a market for such staple articles as trams in fiction iii you will understand then that by the end of annesley bupp had a reputation to be exact he had two reputations in fleet street he was known as a writer upon whom a subeditor could depend a furnisher of what got to be called buppy matter which is paid at a slightly higher rate than ordinary copy because the length and quality of it never vary outside fleet street he was regarded simply as a literary light annesley bupp the fellow whose name you saw in every paper an accepted author it was not surprising therefore that at the beginning of public opinion forced annesley into sic n wer fields of literature it demanded from him among other things a weekly review of current fiction entitled fireside friends he wrote this with extraordinary fluency a few words of introduction followed by a large fragment of the book before him pasted beneath the line take this for instance an opinion of any kind he rarely ventured an adverse opinion like a good friend never about this time he was commissioned to write three paragraphs each day for an evening paper the first of them always began mr asquiths admission in the house of commons yesterday that he had never done so and so is not without parallel in the elder pitt the second always began mention of the elder pitt recalls the fact that the third always began it may not be generally known until he began to write these paragraphs annesley bupp had no definite political views iv annesley bupp is now at the zenith of his fame the buppy of old days he still writes occasionally but he no longer signs it in full a modest a b in the corner supposed by the ignorant to stand for arthur balfour is the only evidence of the author i say the only evidence for he has had like all great men his countless imitators trams also he deserted with the publication of his great work on the subject tramiana but as a writer on literature and old london he has a european reputation and his recent book in the track of shakespeare a record of a visit to stratfordonavon created no little stir he is in great request at public dinners where his speech in reply to the toast of literature is eagerly attended he contributes to every symposium in the popular magazines it is all the more to be regretted that his autobiography the last of the bupps is to be published posthumously little plays for amateurs fair mistress dorothy the scene is an apartment in the mansion of sir thomas farthingale there is no need to describe the furniture in it as rehearsals will gradually show what is wanted a picture or two of previous sir thomass might be seen on the walls if you have an artistic friend who could arrange this but it is a mistake to hang up your own ancestors as some of your guests may recognize them and thus pierce beneath the vraisemblance of the scene the period is that of cromwell sixteen something the costumes are if possible of the same period mistress dorothy farthingale is seated in the middle of the stage reading a letter and occasionally sighing enter my lord carey carey mistress dorothy alone truly fortune smiles upon me dorothy hiding the letter quickly an she smiles my lord i needs must frown carey used to this sort of thing and no longer put off by it nay give me but one smile

whytis now for i have but recently passed through the gallery and did mark the sun carey fiercely in the name of the king sir thomas i call upon you to arrest this traitor sir thomas sighing i loved

again dorothy and roger embrace each other if they can do it without causing a scandal in the neighbourhood and the curtain goes down a slight misunderstanding the scene is a drawingroom in which the men are allowed to smoke or a smokingroom in which the women are allowed to draw it doesnt much matter in the house of somebody or other in the country george turnbull and his old college friend henry peterson are confiding in each other as old friends will over their whiskies and cigars it is about three oclock in the afternoon george dreamily helping himself to a stiff soda henry do you remember that evening at christ church college oxford five years ago when we opened our hearts to each other henry lighting a cigar and hiding it in a fernpot that moonlight evening on the backs george when i had failed in my matriculation examination george yes and we promised that when either of us fell in love the other should be the first to hear of it rising solemnly henry the moment has come with shining eyes i am in love henry jumping up and grasping him by both hands george my dear old george in a voice broken with emotion bless you george he pats him thoughtfully on the back three times nods his own head twice gives him a final grip of the hand and returns to his chair george more moved by this than he cares to show thank you henry hoarsely youre a good fellow henry airily with a typically british desire to conceal his emotion who is the lucky little lady george taking out a picture postcard of the british museum and kissing it passionately isobel barley if henry is not careful he will probably give a start of surprise here with the idea of suggesting to the audience that he knows something about the ladys past or is in love with her himself he is however thinking of a different play we shall come to that one in a moment henry in a slightly dashing manner little isobel lucky dog george i wish i could think so sighs but i have yet to approach her and she may be anothers fiercely heavens henry if she should be anothers enter isobel isobel brightly so ive run you to earth at last now what have you got to say for yourselves henry like a man by jove looking at his watch i had no idea is it really poor old joe waiting dashes out tactfully in a state of incoherence george rising and leading isobel to the front of the stage miss barley now that we are alone i have something i want to say to you isobel looking at her watch well you must be quick because im engaged george drops her hand and staggers away from her isobel why whats the matter george to the audience in a voice expressing the very deeps of emotion engaged she is engaged i am too late he sinks into a chair and covers his face with his hands isobel surprised mr turnbull what has happened george waving her away with one hand go leave me i can bear this best alone exit isobel merciful heavens she is plighted to another enter henry henry eagerly well old man george raising a face white with misery that is to say if he has remembered to put the french chalk in the palms of his hands henry i am too late she is anothers henry in surprise whose george with dignity i did not ask her it is nothing to me goodbye henry be kind to her henry why where are you going george firmly to the rocky mountains i shall shoot some bears grizzly ones it may be that thus i shall forget my grief henry after a pause perhaps you are right george what shall i tell her george tell her nothing but should anything feeling casually in his pockets happen to me if going over them again quickly i do not come back then searching them all including the waistcoat ones in desperate haste give her give her give her triumphantly bringing his handkerchief out of the last pocket this and say that my last thought was of her goodbye my old friend goodbye exit to rocky mountains enter isobel isabel why wheres mr turnbull henry sadly hes gone isabel gone where henry to the rocky mountains to shoot bears feeling that some further explanation is needed grizzly ones isobel but he was here a moment ago henry yes hes only just gone isobel why didnt he say goodbye eagerly but perhaps he left a message for me henry shakes his head nothing henry bows silently and leaves the room oh she gives a cry and throws herself on the sofa and i loved him george george why didnt you speak enter george hurriedly he is fully dressed for a shooting expedition in the rocky mountains and carries a rifle under his arm george to the audience i have just come back for my pockethandkerchief i must have dropped it in here somewhere he begins to search for it and in the ordinary course of things comes upon isobel on the sofa he puts his rifle down carefully on a table with the muzzle pointing at the prompter rather than at the audience and staggers back merciful heavens isobel dead he falls on his knees beside the sofa my love speak to me isobel softly george george she is alive isobel isobel dont go george george my dear i love you but when i heard that you were anothers honour compelled me isobel sitting up quickly what do you mean by anothers george you said you were engaged isobel suddenly realizing how the dreadful misunderstanding arose which nearly wrecked two lives but i only meant i was engaged to play tennis with lady carbrook george what a fool i have been he hurries on before the audience can assent then isobel you will be mine isobel yes george and you wont go and shoot nasty bears will you dear not even grizzly ones george taking her in his arms never darling that was only turning to the audience with the air of one who is making his best point a slight misunderstanding curtain miss prendergast as the curtain goes up two ladies are discovered in the morningroom of honeysuckle lodge engaged in work of a feminine nature miss alice prendergast is doing something delicate with a crochethook but it is obvious that her thoughts are far away she sighs at intervals and occasionally lays down her work and presses both hands to her heart a sympathetic audience will have no difficulty in guessing that she is in love on the other hand her elder sister miss prendergast is completely wrapped up in a sock for one of the poorer classes over which she frowns formidably the sock however has no real bearing upon the plot and she must not make too much of it alice hiding her emotions did you have a pleasant dinnerparty last night jane jane to herself seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty looking up very pleasant indeed alice the blizzards were there and the podbys and the slumphs these people are not important and should not be overemphasized mrs podbys maid has given notice alice who took you in jane brightening up such an interesting man my dear he talked most agreeably about art during dinner and we renewed the conversation in the drawingroom we found that we agreed upon all the main principles of art considered as such alice with a look in her eyes which shows that she is recalling a tender memory when i was in shropshire last week what was your mans name jane with a warning glance at the audience you know how difficult it is to catch names when one is introduced i am certain he never heard mine as the plot depends partly upon this she pauses for it to sink in but i inquired about him afterwards and i find that he is a mr enter mary the parlourmaid mary handing letter a letter for you miss jane taking it thank you mary exit mary to work up her next line a letter i wonder who it is from reading the envelope miss prendergast honeysuckle lodge she opens it with the air of one who has often received letters before but feels that this one may play an important part in her life dear miss prendergast i hope you will pardon the presumption of what i am about to write to you but whether you pardon me or not i ask you to listen to me i know of no woman for whose talents i have a greater admiration or for whose qualities i have a more sincere affection than yourself since i have known you you have been the lodestar of my existence the fountain of my inspiration i feel that were your life joined to mine the joint path upon which we trod would be the path to happiness such as i have as yet hardly dared to dream of in short dear miss prendergast i ask you to marry me and i will come in person for my answer yours truly in a voice of intense surprise jas bootle at the word bootle a wave of warm colour rushes over alice and dyes her from neck to brow if she is not an actress of sufficient calibre to ensure this she must do the best she can by starting abruptly and putting her hand to her throat alice aside in a choking voice mr bootle in love with jane jane my dear the man who took me down to dinner well alice picking up her work again and trying to be calm what will you say jane rather pleased with herself well really i this is mr bootle fancy alice starting up was that a ring she frowns at the prompter and a bell is heard to ring it is mr bootle i know his ring i mean i know dear i think i will go and lie down i have a headache she looks miserably at the audience closes her eyes and goes off with her handkerchief to her mouth taking care not to fall over the furniture enter mary followed by james bootle mary mr bootle exit finally jane goodmorning mr bootle bootle i beg i thought why of course its miss erhm yes how do you do did you get back safely last night jane yes thank you coyly i got your letter bootle my letter sees his letter on the table furiously you opened my letter jane mistaking his fury for passion yes james and looking down on the ground the answer is yes bootle realizing the situation by george aside i have proposed to the wrong lady tchck jane you may kiss me james bootle have you a sister jane missing the connection yes i have a younger sister alice coldly but i hardly see bootle beginning to understand how he made the mistake a younger sister then you are miss prendergast and

withdraw so two lives are ruined alice you are right james jane must never know goodbye they give each other a farewell embrace jane aside they love fiercely but he is mine i will hold him to his promise picking up a photograph of alice as a small child from an occasional table little alice and i promised to take care of her to protect her from the cruel world baby alice she puts her

of the fact that she has been wearing the mask bootle alice then you are mine after all alice james they k no perhaps better not there has been quite enough for one evening and to think that she knew all the time now i am quite quite happy and james you will remember in future that i am miss alice prendergast bootle gaily my dear i shall only be able to remember that you are the future mrs bootle curtain at dead of night the stage is in semidarkness as dick trayle throws open the window from outside puts his knee on the sill and falls carefully into the drawingroom of beeste hall he is dressed in a knickerbocker suit with arrows on it such as can always be borrowed from a friend and to judge from the noises which he emits is not in the best of training the lights go on suddenly and he should seize this moment to stagger to the door and turn on the switch this done he sinks into the nearest chair and closes his eyes if he has been dancing very late the night before he may drop into a peaceful sleep in which case the play ends here otherwise no sooner are his eyes closed than he opens them with a sudden start and looks round in terror dick striking the keynote at once no no let me out i am innocent he gives a gasp of relief as he realizes the situation free it is true then i have escaped i dreamed that i was back in prison again he shudders and helps himself to a large whiskyandsoda which he swallows at a gulp thats better now i feel a new man the man i was three years ago three years it has been a lifetime pathetically to the audience where is millicent now he falls into a reverie from which he is suddenly wakened by a noise outside he starts and then creeps rapidly to the switch arriving there at the moment when the lights go out thence he goes swiftly behind the window curtain the lights go up again as jasper beeste comes in with a revolver in one hand and a bullseye lantern of apparently enormous candlepower in the other jasper in immaculate evening dress i thought i heard a noise so i slipped on some old things hurriedly and came down fingering his perfectlytied tie but there seems to be nobody here turns round suddenly to the window ha whos there hands up blow you he ought to swear rather badly here really hands up or i fire the stage is suddenly plunged into darkness there is the noise of a struggle and the lights go on to reveal jasper by the door covering dick with his revolver jasper lets have a little light on you brutally now then my man what have you got to say for yourself ha an escaped convict eh dick to himself in amazement jasper beeste jasper so you know my name dick in the tones of a man whose whole life has been blighted by the machinations of a false friend yes jasper beeste i know your name for two years i have said it to myself every night when i prayed heaven that i should meet you again jasper again uneasily we have met before dick slowly we have met before jasper beeste since then i have lived a lifetime of misery you may well fail to recognize me enter millicent wilsdon in a dressinggown with her hair over her shoulders if the county will stand it millicent to jasper i couldnt sleep i heard a noise i suddenly seeing the other dick she trembles dick millicent he trembles too jasper trayle so does he dick bitterly you shrink from me millicent with strong common sense what is an escaped

rachel always curtain william smith editor the scene is the editors room in the office of the lark two walls of the room are completely hidden from floor to ceiling by magnificentlybound books the third wall at the back is hidden by boxes of immensely expensive cigars the windows of course are in the fourth wall which however need not be described as it is never quite practicable on the stage the floor of this apartment is chastely covered with rugs shot by the editor in his travels or in the tottenham court road or in some cases presented by admiring readers from abroad the furniture is both elegant and commodious william smith editor comes in he is superbly dressed in a fur coat and an expensive cigar there is a blue pencil behind his ear and a sheaf of what we call in the profession typewritten manuscripts under his arm he sits down at his desk and pulls the telephone towards him smith at the telephone hallo is that you jones yes its me just come up a moment puts down telephone and begins to open his letters enter jones his favourite subeditor he is dressed quite commonly and is covered with ink he salutes respectfully as he comes into the room jones goodafternoon chief smith goodafternoon have a cigar jones thank you chief smith have you anything to tell me jones the circulation is still going up chief it was three million and eight last week smith testily how often have i told you not to call me chief except when there are ladies present why cant you do what youre told jones sorry sir but the fact is there are ladies present smith fingering his moustache show them up who are they jones there is only one she says shes the lady who has been writing our anonymous secrets of the boudoir series which has made such a sensation smith in amazement i thought you told me you wrote these jones simply i did smith then why jones i mean i did tell you the truth is they came in anonymously and i thought they were more likely to be accepted if i said i had written them with great emotion forgive me chief but it was for the papers sake in matteroffact tones there were one or two peculiarities of style i had to alter she had a way of smith sternly how many cheques for them have you accepted for the papers sake jones eight for a thousand pounds each smith with tears in his eyes if your mother were to hear of this jones sadly ah chief i have never had a mother smith slightly put out but recovering himself quickly what would your father say if jones alas i have no relations i was a foundling smith nettled in that case i shall certainly tell the master of your workhouse to think that there should be a thief in this office jones with great pathos chief chief i am not so vile as that i have carefully kept all the cheques in an old stocking and smith in surprise do you wear stockings jones when i bicycle and as soon as the contributor comes forward smith stretching out his hand and grasping that of jones my dear boy forgive me you have been hasty perhaps but zealous in any case your honesty is above suspicion leave me now i have much to think of rests his head on his hands then dreamily you have never seen your father for thirty years i have not seen my wife ah arabella jones yes sir rings bell smith she would split her infinitives we quarrelled she left me i have never seen her again jones excitedly did you say she split her

out jones ill explain to her about the money jones right you are sir exit smith leans back in his chair and stares in front of him smith to himself arabella enter boy followed by a stylishlydressed lady of middle age boy mrs robinson exit mrs robinson stops short in the middle of the room and stares at the editor then staggers and drops on to the sofa smith in wonder arabella mrs robinson

you to think so william smith yes yes its the least i can say i have been very lonely without you dear and now what shall we do shall we get married again quietly arabella wouldnt that be bigamy smith

arabella oh i beg your pardon smith waving an introduction mrs smith my wife this is our subeditor dear mr jones arabella puts her hand to her heart and seems about to faint why whats the matter arabella hoarsely where did you get that stocking smith pleasantly its one he wears when he goes bicycling jones no i misled you this afternoon chief this stocking was all the luggage i had when i first entered the leamington workhouse arabella throwing herself into his arms my son this is your father william our boy smith shaking hands with jones how are you i say arabella then that was one of my stockings arabella to her boy when i saw you on the stairs you seemed to dimly remind me jones to remind you dimly mother smith no my boy in future nothing but split infinitives will appear in our paper please remember that jones with emotion i will endeavour to always remember it dad curtain a chapter of accidents john walked eight miles over the cliffs to the nearest town in order to buy tobacco he came back to the farmhouse with no tobacco and the news that he had met some friends in the town who had invited us to dinner and bridge the next evening but thats no reason why you should have forgotten the tobacco i said one cant remember everything i accepted for both of us we neednt dress put on that nice blue flannel suit of yours and that nice pair of climbing boots with the nails is that all youve got all im going to walk eight miles in on a muddy path then we shall have to take a bag with us and we can put in pyjamas and stay the night at an hotel it will save us walking back in the dark we dont want to lose you over the cliff i took out a cigar this is the last i said if instead of wandering about and collecting invitations you had only remembered shall we cut it up or smoke half each call said john bringing out a penny heads it is you begin i struck a match and began next day after lunch john brought out his little brown bag it wont be very heavy he said and we can carry it in turns an hour each i dont think thats quite fair i said after all its your bag if you take it for an hour and a half i dont mind taking the other half your shoes are heavier than mine anyhow my pyjamas weigh less such a light blue as they are ah but my toothbrush has lost seven bristles that makes a difference what i say is let every man carry his own bag this is a rotten business john i dont wish to be anything but polite but for a silly ass commend me to the owner of that brown thing john took no notice and went on packing i shall buy a collar in the town he said better let me do it for you you would only go getting an invitation to a gardenparty from the haberdasher and that would mean another eight miles with a portmanteau there we are said john as he closed the bag quite small and light now wholl take the first hour wed better toss if youre quite sure you wont carry it all the way tails just my luck john looked out of the window and then at his watch they say two to three is the hottest hour of the day he said it will be cooler later on i shall put you in i led the way up the cliffs with that wretched bag i insisted upon that condition anyhow that the man with the bag should lead the way i wasnt going to have john dashing off at six miles an hour and leaving himself only two miles at the end but you can come and talk to me i said to him after ten minutes of it i only meant that i was going to set the pace no no i like watching you you do it so gracefully this is my man he explained to some children who were blackberrying he is just carrying my bag over the cliffs for me no he is not very strong you wait i growled john laughed fifty minutes more he said and then after a little silence i think the bagcarrying profession is overrated what made you take it up my lad the drink ah just so dear dear what a lesson to all of us theres a good time coming i murmured to myself and changed hands for the eighth time i dont care what people say said john argumentatively brown and blue do go together if you wouldnt mind for the tenth time i rammed the sharp corner of the bag into the back of my knee there thats what i mean you see it perfectly like that the brown against the blue of the flannel thank you very much i stumbled up a steep little bit of slippery grass and told myself that in threequarters of an hour i would get some of my own back again he little knew how heavy that bag could become they say said john to the heavens that if you have weights in your hands you can jump these little eminences much more easily i suppose one hand alone doesnt do what a pity he didnt tell me before i would have lent him another bag with pleasure nobody likes blackberries more than i do said john but even i would hesitate to come out here on a hot afternoon and fill a great brown bag with blackberries and then carry them eight miles home besides it looks rather greedy i beg your pardon my lad i didnt understand you are taking them home to your aged mother of course of course very commendable if i had a penny i would lend it to you no i only have a sixpence on me and i have to give that to the little fellow who is carrying my bag over the cliffs for me yes i picked him up about a couple of miles back he has mud all up his trousers i know half an hour more i told myself and went on doggedly my right shoulder on fire dear dear he said solicitously how lopsided the youth of today is getting too much lawntennis i suppose how much better the simply healthy exercises of our forefathers the weightlifting after lunch the he was silent for ten minutes and then broke out rapturously once more what a heavenly day i am glad we didnt bring a bag it would have spoilt it altogether we can easily borrow some slippers and it will be jolly walking back by moonlight now if you had had your way one minute more i said joyfully and oh my boy how glad i am we brought a bag what a splendid idea of yours by the way you havent said much lately a little tired by the walk i make it two minutes said john half a minute now there and may i never carry the confounded thing another yard i threw the bag down and fell upon the grass the bag rolled a yard or two away then it rolled another yard slipped over the edge and started bouncing down the cliff finally it leapt away from the earth altogether and dropped two hundred feet into the sea my bag said john stupidly and that did for me altogether i dont care a hang about your bag i cried and i dont care a hang if ive lost my pyjamas and my best shoes and my only razor and ive been through an hours torture for nothing and i dont mind that but oh to think that you arent going to have your hour by jove neither i am said john and he sat down and roared with laughter a crown of sorrows there is something on my mind of which i must relieve myself if i am ever to face the world again with a smile i must share my trouble with others i cannot bear my burden alone friends i have lost my hat will the gentleman who took it by mistake and forgot to leave his own in its place kindly return my hat to me at once i am very miserable without my hat it was one of those nice soft ones with a dent down the middle to collect the rain one of those soft hats which wrap themselves so lovingly round the cranium that they ultimately absorb the personality of the wearer underneath responding to his every emotion when people said nice things about me my hat would swell in sympathy when they said nasty things or when i had had my hair cut it would adapt itself automatically to my lesser requirements in a word it fitted and that is more than can be said for your hard unyielding bowler my hat and i dropped into a hall of music one night last week i placed it under the seat put a coat on it to keep it warm and settled down to enjoy myself my hat could see nothing but it knew that it would hear all about the entertainment on the way home when the last moving picture had moved away my hat and i prepared to depart together i drew out the coat and felt around for my where on earth i was calm at first excuse me i said politely to the man next to me but have you got two hats several he replied mistaking my meaning i dived under the seat again and came up with some more dust someone i said to a programme girl has taken my hat have you looked under the seat for it she asked it was such a sound suggestion that i went under the seat for the third time it may have been kicked further along suggested another attendant she walked up and down the row looking for it and in case somebody had kicked it into the row above walked up and down that one too and in case somebody had found touch with it on the other side of the house many other girls spread themselves in pursuit and soon we had the whole pack hunting for it then the fireman came up suspecting the worst i told him it was even worse than that my hat had been stolen he had a flash of inspiration are you sure you brought it with you he asked the programme girls seemed to think that it would solve the whole mystery if i hadnt brought it with me are you sure you are the fireman i said coldly he thought for a moment and then unburdened himself of another idea perhaps its just been kicked under the seat he said i left him under the seat and went downstairs with a heavy heart at the door i said to the hall porter have you seen anybody going out with two hats by mistake whats the matter he said lost your hat it has been stolen have you looked under the seats it may have been kicked along a bit perhaps id better see the manager i said is it any good looking under the seats for him i expect its just been kicked along a bit the hall porter repeated confidently ill come up with you and look for it if theres any more talk about being kicked along a bit i said bitterly somebody will be i want the manager i was led to the managers room and there i explained the matter to him he was very pleasant about it i expect you havent looked for it properly he said with a charming smile just take this gentleman up he added to the hall porter and find his hat for him it has probably been kicked under one of the other seats we were smiled irresistibly out and i was dragged up to the grand circle again the seats by this time were laid out in white draperies the house looked very desolate i knew that my poor hat was dead with an air of cheery confidence the hall porter turned into the first row of seats it may have been kicked on to the stage i said as he began to slow down it may have jumped into one of the boxes it may have turned into a rabbit you know i expect you arent looking for it properly the manager was extremely sympathetic when we came back to him he said oh im sorry just like that oh im sorry my hat i said firmly has been stolen im sorry he repeated with a bored smile and turned to look at himself in the glass then i became angry with him and his attendants and his whole blessed theatre my hat i said bitingly has been stolen from me while i slept you must have seen me wearing it in the dear old days greeny brown it was in colour but it wasnt the colour that drew your eyes to it no nor yet the shape nor the angle at which it sat it was just the essential rightness of it if you have ever seen a hat which you felt instinctively was a clever hat an alive hat a profound hat then that was my hat and that was myself underneath it napoleon at work when i am in any doubt or difficulty i say to myself what would napoleon have done the answer generally comes at once he would have borrowed from henry or he would have said his aunt was ill the one obviously right and proper thing then i weigh in and do it what station is this said beatrice as the train began to slow up baby and i want to get home whitecroft i expect said john who was reading the paper only four more its grown since we were here last i observed getting quite a big place good then were at hillstead only three more stations i looked out of the window and had a sudden suspicion where have i heard the name byres before i murmured thoughtfully you havent said john nobody has say byres baby urged beatrice happily youre quite sure that there isnt anything advertised called byres youre sure you cant drink byres or rub yourself down with byres quite well then we must be at byres there was a shriek from beatrice as she rushed to the window were in the wrong train quick get the bags have you got the rug wheres the umbrella open the window stupid i got up and moved her from the door leave this to me i said calmly porter porter porter oh guard what stations this byres sir byres yes sir he blew his whistle and the train went on again at any rate we know now that it was byres i remarked when the silence began to get oppressive its all very well for you beatrice burst out indignantly but you dont think about baby we dont know a bit where we are thats the one thing we do know i said were at this little byres place it was the porters fault at liverpool street said john consolingly he told us it was a through carriage i dont care whose fault it was im only thinking of baby what time do babies go to bed as a rule i asked this one goes at six well then shes got another hour now what would napoleon have done napoleon said john after careful thought would have turned all your clothes out of your bag would have put the baby in it diagonally and have bored holes in the top for ventilation thats as good as going to bed you avoid the worst of the evening mists and people would only think you kept caterpillars beatrice looked at him coldly thats a way to talk of your daughter she said in scorn dont kill him i begged we may want him now ive got another idea if you look out of the window you observe that we are on a single line well i envy it and however single it is were going away from home in it true but the point is that no train can come back on it until weve stopped going forward so you see theres no object in getting out of this train until it has finished for the day probably it will go back itself before long out of sheer boredom and its much better waiting here than on a draughty byres platform beatrice quite seeing the point changed the subject theres my trunk will go on to brookfield and the wagonette will meet the train and as we arent there it will go away without the trunk and all babys things are in it shes not complaining i said shes just mentioning it look here said john reproachfully were doing all we can were both thinking like anything he picked up his paper again i was beginning to get annoyed it was of course no good to get as anxious and excited as beatrice that wouldnt help matters at all on the other hand the entire indifference of john and the baby was equally out of place it seemed to me that there was a middle and napoleonic path in between these two extremes which only i was following to be convinced that one is the only person doing the right thing is always annoying ive just made another discovery i said in a hurt voice theres a map over johns head if hed only had the sense to look there before there we are and i pointed with my stick theres byres the line goes round and round and eventually goes through dearmer we get out at dearmer and were only three miles from brookfield what they call a loop line assisted john because its in the shape of a loop its not so bad as it might be admitted beatrice grudgingly after studying the map but its five miles home from dearmer and what about my trunk i sighed and pulled out a pencil its very simple we write a telegram stationmaster brookfield send wagonette and trunk to wait for us at dearmer station love to mother and the children added john our train stopped again i summoned a porter and gave him the telegram its so absurdly simple i repeated as the train went on just a little presence of mind thats all we got out at dearmer and gave up our tickets to the porterstationmastersignalman whats this he said these are no good to me well theyre no good to us weve finished with them we sat in the waitingroom with him for half an hour and explained the situation we said that highly as we thought of dearmer we had not wantonly tried to defraud the company in order to get a sight of the place and that so far from owing him three shillings apiece we were prepared to take a sovereign to say nothing more about it and still the wagonette didnt come is there a postoffice here i asked the man or a horse there might be a horse at the lion theres no postoffice well i suppose i could wire to brookfield station from here not to brookfield but supposing you want to tell the stationmaster there that the trains off the line or that youve won the first prize at the flower show in the vegetable class how would you do it brookfields not on this line thats why youve got to pay three shill yes yes you said all that then i shall go and explore the village i explored as napoleon would have done and i came back with a plan there is no horse i said to my eager audience but i have found a bicycle the landlady of the lion will be delighted to look after beatrice and the baby and will give her tea john will stay here with the bags in case the wagonette turns up and i will ride to brookfield and summon help thats all right said john only i would suggest that i go to the lion and have tea and beatrice and the child we left him in disgust at his selfishness i established the ladies at the inn mounted the bicycle and rode off it was a windy day and i had a long coat and a bowler hat after an extremely unpleasant two miles something drove past me i lifted up my head and looked round it was the wagonette i rode back behind it in triumph when it turned up the road to the station i hurried straight on to the lion to prepare beatrice i knocked and peered into rooms and knocked again and at last the landlady came er is the lady oh shes gone sir a long time ago a gentleman she knew drove past and she asked him to give her a lift home in his trap she was going to tell the other gentleman and hed wait for you oh yes thats all right i returned my bicycle to its owner distributed coppers to his children and went up to the station the porter came out to meet me he seemed surprised the gentleman thought you wouldnt be coming back sir as you didnt come with the wagonette i just went up to the lion yessir well he drove off quarter of an hour ago said it was no good waiting for you as youd ride straight ome when you found at brookfield that the wagonette ad come and now i ask you what would napoleon have said the portuguese cigar everything promised well for my weekend with charles the weather was warm and sunny i was bringing my golf clubs down with me and i had just discovered and meant to put into practice an entirely new stance which made it impossible to miss the object ball it was this that i was explaining to charles and his wife at dinner on friday when the interruption occurred by the way said charles as i took out a cigarette ive got a cigar for you dont smoke that thing you havent let him go in for cigars i said reproachfully to mrs charles i can be very firm about other peoples extravagances this is one i picked up in portugal explained charles you can get them absurdly cheap out there lets see dear where did i put it i saw it on your dressingtable last week said his wife getting up to leave us he followed her out and went in search of it while i waited with an interest which i made no effort to conceal i had never heard before of a man going all the way to portugal to buy one cigar for a friend here it is said charles coming in again he put down in front of me an ashtray the matches and a and a well as i say a cigar i examined it slowly half of it looked very tired well said charles what do you think of it when you say you er picked it up in portugal i began carefully i suppose you dont mean i stopped and tried to bite the end off have a knife said charles i had another bite and then i decided to be frank why did you pick it up i asked the fact was said charles i found myself one day in lisbon without my pipe and so i bought that thing i never smoke them in the ordinary way did you smoke this i asked it was obvious that something had happened to it no you see i found some cigarettes at the last moment and so knowing that you liked cigars i thought id bring it home for you its very nice of you charles of course i can see that it has travelled well we must do what we can with it i took the knife and started chipping away at the mahogany end the other end the brownpaper end which had come ungummed i intended to reserve for the match when everything was ready i applied a light leant back in my chair and pulled thats all right isnt it said charles and youd be surprised if i told you what i paid for it no no you mustnt think that i protested probably things are dearer in portugal i put it down by my plate for a moments rest all ive got against it at present is that its pores dont act as freely as they should ive got a cigarcutter somewhere if no dont bother i think i can do it with the nutcrackers theres no doubt it was a good cigar once but it hasnt wintered well i squeezed it as hard as i could lit it again pressed my feet against the table and pulled now its going said charles im afraid it keeps very reticent at my end the followthrough is poor is your end alight still burning beautifully its a pity that i should be missing all that how would it be if we were to make a knittingneedle redhot and bore a tunnel from this end we might establish a draught that way only theres always the danger of course of coming out at the side i took the cigar up and put it to my ear i cant hear anything wrong i said i expect what it really wants is massage charles filled his pipe again and got up lets go for a stroll he said its a beautiful night bring your cigar with you it may prefer the open air i said theres always that you know we mustnt lose sight of the fact that the portuguese climate is different from ours the things pores may have acted more readily in the south on the other hand the unfastened end may have been more adhesive i gather that though you have never actually met anybody who has smoked a cigar like this yet you understand that the experiment is a practicable one as far as you know this had no brothers no no charles im going on with it but i should like to know all that you can tell me of its parentage it had a portuguese father and an american mother i should say and there has been a good deal of trouble in the family one moment and as we went outside i stopped and cracked it in the door it was an inspiration at the very next application of the match i found that i had established a connection with the lighted end not a long and steady connection but one that came in gusts after two gusts i decided that it was perhaps safer to blow from my end and for a little while we had in this way as much smoke around us as the most fastidious cigarsmoker could want then i accidentally dropped it something in the middle of it shifted i suppose and for the rest of my stay behind it only one end was at work well said charles when we were back in the smokingroom and i was giving the cigar a short breather its not a bad one is it i have enjoyed it i said truthfully for i like trying to get the mastery over a thing that defies me youll never guess what it cost he chuckled tell me i said i darent guess well in english money it works out at exactly three farthings i looked at him for a long time and then shook my head sadly charles old friend i said youve been done a cold world herbert is a man who knows all about railway tickets and packing and being in time for trains and things like that but i fancy i have taught him a lesson at last he wont talk quite so much about tickets in future i was just thinking about getting up when he came into my room he looked at me in horror my dear fellow he said and you havent even packed youll be late here get up and ill pack for you while you dress do i said briefly first of all what clothes are you going to travel in there was no help for it i sat up in bed and directed operations right said herbert now what about your return ticket you mustnt forget that you remind me of a little story i said ill tell it you while you pack that will be nice for you once upon a time i lost my return ticket and i had to pay two pounds for another and a month afterwards i met a man a man like you who knows all about tickets and he said you could have got the money back if you had applied at once so i said give me a cigarette now and ill transfer all my rights in the business to you and he gave me a cigarette but unfortunately it was too late no unfortunately it wasnt he got the two pounds the most expensive cigarette ive ever smoked well that just shows you said herbert heres your ticket put it in your waistcoat pocket now but i havent got a waistcoat on silly which one are you going to put on i dont know yet this is a matter which requires thought give me time give me air well i shall put the ticket here on the dressingtable and then you cant miss it he looked at his watch and the trap starts in half an hour help i cried and i leapt out of bed half an hour later i was saying goodbye to herbert ive had an awfully jolly time i said and ill come again youve got the ticket all right rather and i drove away amidst cheers cheers of sorrow it was half an hours drive to the station for the first ten minutes i thought how sickening it was to be leaving the country then i had a slight shock and for the next twenty minutes i tried to remember how much a third single to the nearest part of london cost because i had left my ticket on the dressingtable after all i gave my luggage to a porter and went off to the stationmaster i wonder if you can help me i said ive left my return ticket on the dress well we neednt worry about that ive left it at home he didnt seem intensely excited what did you think of doing he asked i had rather hoped that you would do something you can buy another ticket and get the money back afterwards yes yes but can i ive only got about one pound six the fare to london is one pound five and tenpence hapenny ah well that leaves a penny hapenny to be divided between the porter this end lunch tea the porter the other end and the cab i dont believe its enough even if i gave it all to the porter here think how reproachfully he would look at you ever afterwards it would haunt you the stationmaster was evidently moved he thought for a moment and then asked if i knew anybody who would vouch for me i mentioned herbert confidently he had never even heard of herbert ive got a tiepin i said stationmasters have a weakness for tiepins and a watch and a cigarette case i shall be happy to lend you any of those the idea didnt appeal to him the best thing you can do he said is to take a ticket to the next station and talk to them there this is only a branch line and i have no power to give you a pass so that was what i had to do i began to see myself taking a ticket at every stop and appealing to the stationmaster at the next well the money would last longer that way but unless i could overcome quickly the distrust which i seemed to inspire in stationmasters there would not be much left for lunch i gave the porter all i could afford a hapenny mentioned apologetically that i was coming back and stepped into the train at the junction i jumped out quickly and dived into the sacred office ive left my ticket on the dressing that is to say i forgot well anyhow i havent got it i began and we plunged into explanations once more this stationmaster was even more unemotional than the last he asked me if i knew anybody who could vouch for me i mentioned herbert diffidently he had never even heard of herbert i showed him my gold watch my silver cigarette case and my emerald and diamond tiepin that was the sort of man i was the best thing you can do he said walking with me to the door is to take a ticket to plymouth and speak to the stationmaster there this is a most interesting game i said bitterly what is home when you speak to the stationmaster at london i suppose ive a good mind to say snap extremely annoyed i strode out and bumped into youll never guess herbert ah here you are he panted i rode after you the train was just going jumped into it been looking all over the station for you its awfully nice of you herbert didnt i say goodbye your ticket he produced it left it on the dressingtable he took a deep breath i told you you would bless you i said as i got happily into my train youve saved my life ive had an awful time i say do you know ive met two stationmasters already this morning whove never even heard of you you must inquire into it at that moment a porter came up did you give up your ticket sir he asked herbert i hadnt time to get one said herbert quite at his ease ill pay now and he began to feel in his pockets the train moved out of the station a look of horror came over herberts face i knew what it meant he hadnt any money on him hi he shouted to me and then we swung round a bend out of sight well well hell have to get home somehow his watch is only nickel and his cigarette case leather but luckily that sort of thing doesnt weigh much with stationmasters what they want is a well known name as a reference herbert is better off than i was he can give them my name it will be idle for them to pretend that they have never heard of me the doctor may i look at my watch i asked my partner breaking a silence which had lasted from the beginning of the waltz oh have you got a watch she drawled how exciting i wasnt going to show it to you i said but i always think it looks so bad for a man to remove his arm from a ladys waist in order to look at his watch i mean without some sort of apology or explanation as though he were wondering if he could possibly stick another five minutes of it let me know when the apology is beginning said miss white perhaps after all her name wasnt white but anyhow she was dressed in white and its her own fault if wrong impressions arise it begins at once ive got to catch a train home theres one at i believe if i started now i could just miss it you dont live in these northern heights then no do you yes i looked at my watch again i should love to discuss with you the relative advantages of london and greater london i said the flats and cats of one and the big gardens of the other but just at the moment the only thing i can think of is whether i shall like the walk home are there any dangerous passes to cross its a nice wet night for a walk said miss white reflectively if only i had brought my bicycle a watch and a bicycle you are lucky look here it may be a joke to you but i dont fancy myself coming down the mountains at night the last train goes at one oclock if thats any good to you all the good in the world i said joyfully then i neednt walk i looked at my watch that gives us five minutes more i could almost tell you all about myself in the time it generally takes longer than that said miss white at least it seems to she sighed and added my partners have been very autobiographical tonight i looked at her severely im afraid youre a suffragette i said as soon as the next dance began i hurried off to find my hostess i had just caught sight of her when our dance isnt it said a voice i turned and recognized a girl in blue ah i said coldly cheerful i was just looking for you come along we broke into a gay and happy step suggestive of twin hearts utterly free from care why do you look so thoughtful asked the girl in blue after ten minutes of it ive just heard some good news i said oh do tell me i dont know if it would really interest you im sure it would well several miles from here there may be a tram if one can find it which goes nobody quite knows where up till onethirty in the morning probably it is now i added looking at my watch i was getting quite good at this just on one oclock and raining hard all is well the dance over i searched in vain for my hostess every minute i took out my watch and seemed to feel that another tram was just starting off to some unknown destination at last i could bear it no longer and deciding to write a letter of explanation on the morrow i dashed off my instructions from miss white with regard to the habitat of trams thrown in by her at the last moment in case the train failed me were vague five minutes walk convinced me that i had completely lost any good that they might ever have been to me instinct and common sense were the only guides left i must settle down to some heavy detective work the steady rain had washed out any footprints that might have been of assistance and i was unable to follow up the slot of a tram conductor of which i had discovered traces in twohundredand fiftyfirst street in threethousandeighthundred andninetyseventh street i lay with my ear to the ground and listened intently for i seemed to hear the tingting of the electric car but nothing came of it and in fourmillionth street i made a new resolution i decided to give up looking for trams and to search instead for london the london that i knew i felt pretty certain that i was still in one of the home counties and i did not seem to remember having crossed the thames so that if only i could find a star which pointed to the south i was in a fair way to get home i set out to look for a star with the natural result that having abandoned all hope of finding a man i immediately ran into him now then he said goodnaturedly could you tell me the way to i tried to think of some place near my london to westminster abbey he looked at me in astonishment his feeling seemed to be that i was too late for the coronation and too early for the morning service or or anywhere i said hurriedly trams for instance he pointed nervously to the right and disappeared imagine my joy there were tramlines and better still a tram approaching i tumbled in gave the conductor a penny and got a workmans ticket in exchange ten minutes later we reached the terminus i had wondered where we should arrive whether grays inn road or southampton row but didnt much mind so long as i was again within reach of a cab however as soon as i stepped out of the tram i knew at once where i was tell me i said to the conductor do you now go back again in ten minutes theres a tram from here every halfhour when is the last theres no last backwards and forwards all night i should have liked to stop and sympathize but it was getting late i walked a hundred yards up the hill and turned to the right as i entered the gates i could hear the sound of music isnt this our dance i said to miss white who was taking a breather at the hall door one moment i added and i got out of my coat and umbrella is it i thought youd gone oh no i decided to stay after all i found out that the trams go all night we walked in together i wont be more autobiographical than i can help i said but i must say its a hard life a doctors one is called away in the middle of a dance to a difficult case of of mumps or something and well there you are a delightful evening spoilt if one is lucky one may get back in time for a waltz or two at the end indeed i said as we began to dance at one time tonight i quite thought i wasnt going to get back here at all the things that matter ronald surveying the world from his taxi that pleasant corner of the world st jamess park gave a sigh of happiness the blue sky the lawn of daffodils the mist of green upon the trees were but a promise of the better things which the country held for him beautiful as he thought the daffodils he found for the moment an even greater beauty in the gladstone bags at his feet his eyes wandered from one to the other and his heart sang to him im going away im going away im going away the train was advertised to go at and at ronald joined the easter holiday crowd upon the platform a porter put down his luggage and was then swallowed up in a sea of perambulators and flustered parents ronald never saw him again at amidst some applause the train came in ronald seized a lost porter just put these in for me he said a first smoker all this lot yours sir the three bags not the milkcans said ronald it had been a beautiful day before but when a family of sixteen which joined ronald in his carriage was ruthlessly hauled out by the guard the sun seemed to shine with a warmth more caressing than ever even when the train moved out of the station and the children who had been mislaid emerged from their hidingplaces and were bundled in anywhere by the married porters ronald still remained splendidly alone and the sky took on yet a deeper shade of blue he lay back in his corner thinking for a time his mind was occupied with the thoughts common to most of us when we go away thoughts of all the things we have forgotten to pack i dont think you could fairly have called ronald overanxious about clothes he recognized that it was the inner virtues which counted that a welldressed exterior was nothing without some graces of mind or body but at the same time he did feel strongly that if you are going to stay at a house where you have never visited before and if you are particularly anxious to make a good impression it is a pity that an accident of packing should force you to appear at dinner in green knickerbockers and somebody elses velvet smokingjacket ronald couldnt help feeling that he had forgotten something it wasnt the spare sponge it wasnt the extra shavingbrush it wasnt the second pair of bedroom slippers just for a moment the sun went behind a cloud as he wondered if he had included the reserve razorstrop but no he distinctly remembered packing that the reason for his vague feeling of unrest was this he had been interrupted while getting ready that afternoon and as he left whatever he had been doing in order to speak to his housekeeper he had said to himself if youre not careful youll forget about that when you come back and now he could not remember what it was he had been doing nor whether he had in the end forgotten to go on with it was he selecting his ties or brushing his hair or the country was appearing field by field the train rushed through cuttings gay with spring flowers blue was the sky between the baby clouds but it all missed ronald what could he have forgotten he went over the days that were coming he went through all the changes of toilet that the hours might bring he had packed this and this and this and this he was all right for the evening supposing they played golf he was all right for golf he might want to ride he would be able to ride it was too early for lawntennis but well anyhow he had put in flannels as he considered all the possible clothes that he might want it really seemed that he had provided for everything if he liked he could go to church on friday morning hunt otters from twelve to one on saturday toboggan or dig for badgers on monday he had the different suits necessary for those who attend a waterpolo meeting who play chess or who go out after moths with a pot of treacle and even in the last resort he could go to bed yes he was all right he had packed everything moreover his hair was brushed and he had no smut upon his face with a sigh of relief he lowered the window and his soul drank in the beautiful afternoon we are going away we are going away we are going away sang the train at the prettiest of wayside stations the train stopped and ronald got out there were horses to meet him better than a car thought ronald on an afternoon like this the luggage was collected nothing left out he chuckled to himself and was seized with an insane desire to tell the coachman so and then they drove off through the fresh green hedgerows ronald trying hard not to cheer his host was at the door as they arrived ronald as happy as a child jumped out and shook him warmly by the hand and told him what a heavenly day it was receiving with smiles of pleasure the news in return that it was almost like summer youre just in time for tea really we might have it in the garden by jove we might said ronald beaming however they had it in the hall with the doors wide open ronald sitting lazily with his legs stretched out and a cup of tea in his hands and feeling already on the friendliest terms with everybody wondered again at the difference which the weather could make to ones happiness you know he said to the girl on his right on a day like this nothing seems to matter and then suddenly he knew that he was wrong for he had discovered what it was which he had told himself not to forget what it was which he had indeed forgotten and suddenly the birds stopped singing and there was a bitter chill in the air and the sun went violently out he was wearing only half a pair of spats stories of successful lives the solicitor the office was at its busiest for it was friday afternoon john blunt leant back in his comfortable chair and toyed with the key of the safe while he tried to realize his new position he john blunt was junior partner in the great london firm of macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton he closed his eyes and his thoughts wandered back to the day when he had first entered the doors of the firm as one of two hundred and seventyeight applicants for the post of officeboy they had been interviewed in batches and old mr sanderson the senior partner had taken the first batch i like your face my boy he had said heartily to john and i like yours replied john not to be outdone in politeness now i wonder if you can spell mortgage one m said john tentatively mr sanderson was delighted with the lads knowledge and engaged him at once for three years john had done his duty faithfully during this time he had saved the firm more than once by his readiness particularly on one occasion when he had called old mr sandersons attention to the fact that he had signed a letter to a firm of stockbrokers your loving husband macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton mr sanderson always a little absentminded corrected the error and promised the boy his articles five years later john blunt was a solicitor and now he was actually junior partner in the firm the firm of which it was said in the city if a man has macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton behind him he is all right the city is always coining pithy little epigrams like this there was a knock at the door of the inquiry office and a prosperouslooking gentleman came in can i see mr macnaughton he said politely to the officeboy there isnt no mr macnaughton replied the latter they all died years ago well well can i see one of the partners you cant see mr sanderson because hes having his lunch said the boy mr thorpe hasnt come back from lunch yet mr peters has just gone out to lunch mr williams is expected back from lunch every minute mr gourlay went out to lunch an hour ago mr beamish tut tut isnt anybody in mr blunt is in said the boy and took up the telephone if you wait a moment ill see if hes awake half an hour later mr masters was shown into john blunts room im sorry i was engaged said john a most important client now what can i do for you mr er masters i wish to make my will by all means said john cordially i have only one child to whom i intend to leave all my money ha said john with a frown this will be a lengthy and difficult business but you can do it asked mr masters anxiously they told me at the hairdressers that macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton was the cleverest firm in london we can do it said john simply but it will require all our care and i think it would be best if i were to come and stay with you for the weekend we could go into it properly then thank you said mr masters clasping the others hand i was just going to suggest it my motorcar is outside let us go at once i will follow you in a moment said john and pausing only to snatch a handful of money from the safe for incidental expenses and to tell the boy that he would be back on monday he picked up the wellfilled weekend bag which he always kept ready and hurried after the other inside the car mr masters was confidential my daughter he said comes of age tomorrow oh its a daughter said john in surprise is she pretty she is considered to be the prettiest girl in the county really said john he thought a moment and added can we stop at a postoffice i must send an important business telegram he took out a form and wrote macmacmacmacmac london shall not be back till wednesday blunt the car stopped and then sped on again amy has never been any trouble to me said mr masters but i am getting old now and i would give a thousand pounds to see her happily married to whom would you give it asked john whipping out his pocketbook tut tut a mere figure of speech but i would settle a hundred thousand pounds on her on the weddingday indeed said john thoughtfully can we stop at another postoffice he added bringing out his fountainpen again he took out a second telegraph form and wrote macmacmacmacmac london shall not be back till friday blunt the car dashed on again and an hour later arrived it a commodious mansion standing in its own welltimbered grounds of upwards of several acres at the frontdoor a graceful figure was standing my solicitor dear mr blunt said mr masters it is very good of you to come all this way on my fathers business she said shyly not at all said john a week or or a fortnight or he looked at her again or three weeks and the thing is done is making a will so very difficult its a very tricky and complicated affair indeed however i think we shall pull it off er might i send an important business telegram macmacmacmacmac london wrote john very knotty case date of return uncertain please send more cash for incidental expenses blunt yes you have guessed what happened it is an everyday experience in a solicitors life john blunt and amy masters were married at st georges hanover square last may the wedding was a quiet one owing to mourning in the brides family the result of a too sudden perusal of macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughtons bill of costs as mr masters said with his expiring breath he didnt mind paying for our mr blunts skill nor yet for our mr blunts valuable time even if most of it was spent in courting amy nor again for our mr blunts tips to the servants but he did object to being charged the firstclass railway fare both ways when our mr blunt had come down and gone up again in the car and perhaps i ought to add that that is the drawback to this fine profession one is so often misunderstood the painter mr paul samways was in a mood of deep depression the artistic temperament is peculiarly subject to these moods but in pauls case there was reason why he should take a gloomy view of things his masterpiece the shot tower from battersea bridge together with the companion picture battersea bridge from the shot tower had been purchased by a dealer for seventeen and sixpence his sepia monochrome night had brought him an iou for five shillings these were his sole earnings for the last six weeks and starvation stared him in the face if only i had a little capital he cried aloud in despair enough to support me until my academy picture is finished his academy picture was a masterly study entitled roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll and he had been compelled to stop halfway across the channel through sheer lack of ultramarine the clock struck two reminding him that he had not lunched he rose wearily and went to the little cupboard which served as a larder there was but little there to make a satisfying meal half a loaf of bread a corner of cheese and a small tube of chinesewhite mechanically he set the things out he had finished and was clearing away when there came a knock at the door his charwoman whose duty it was to clean his brushes every week came in with a card a lady to see you sir she said paul read the card in astonishment the duchess of winchester he exclaimed what on earth show her in please hastily picking up a brush and the first tube which came to hand he placed himself in a dramatic position before his easel and set to work how do you do mr samways said the duchess g goodafternoon said paul embarrassed both by the presence of a duchess in his studio and by his sudden discovery that he was touching up a sunset with a tube of carbolic toothpaste our mutual friend lord ernest topwood recommended me to come to you paul who had never met lord ernest but had once seen his name in a hapenny paper beneath a photograph of mr arnold bennett bowed silently as you probably guess i want you to paint my daughters portrait paul opened his mouth to say that he was only a landscape painter and then closed it again after all it was hardly fair to bother her grace with technicalities i hope you can undertake this commission she said pleadingly i shall be delighted said paul i am rather busy just now but i could begin at two oclock on monday excellent said the duchess till monday then and paul still clutching the toothpaste conducted her to her carriage punctually at on monday lady hermione appeared paul drew a deep breath of astonishment when he saw her for she was lovely beyond compare all his skill as a landscape painter would be needed if he were to do justice to her beauty as quickly as possible he placed her in position and set to work may i let my face go for a moment said lady hermione after three hours of it yes let us stop said paul he had outlined her in charcoal and burnt cork and it would be too dark to do any more that evening tell me where you first met lord ernest she asked as she came down to the fire at the savoy in june said paul boldly lady hermione laughed merrily paul who had not regarded his last remark as one of his best things looked at her in surprise but your portrait of him was in the academy in may she smiled paul made up his mind quickly lady hermione he said with gravity do not speak to me of lord ernest again nor he added hurriedly to lord ernest of me when your picture is finished i will tell you why now it is time you went he woke the duchess up and made a few commonplace remarks about the weather remember he whispered to lady hermione as he saw them to their car she nodded and smiled the sittings went on daily sometimes paul would paint rapidly with great sweeps of the brush sometimes he would spend an hour trying to get on his palette the exact shade of green bice for the famous winchester emeralds sometimes in despair he would take a sponge and wipe the whole picture out and then start madly again and sometimes he would stop work altogether and tell lady hermione about his homelife in worcestershire but always when he woke the duchess up at the end of the sitting he would say remember and lady hermione would nod back at him it was a springlike day in march when the picture was finished and nothing remained to do but to paint in the signature it is beautiful said lady hermione with enthusiasm beautiful is it at all like me paul looked from her to the picture and back to her again no he said not a bit you know i am really a landscape painter what do you mean she cried you are peter samways ara the famous portrait painter no he said sadly that was my secret i am paul samways a member of the amateur rowing association it is true but only an unknown landscape painter peter samways lives in the next studio and he is not even a relation then you have deceived me you have brought me here under false pretences she stamped her foot angrily my father will not buy that picture and i forbid you to exhibit it as a portrait of myself my dear lady hermione said paul you need not be alarmed i propose to exhibit the picture as when the heart is young nobody will recognize a likeness to you in it and if the duke does not buy it i have no doubt that some other purchaser will come along lady hermione looked at him thoughtfully why did you do it she asked gently because i fell in love with you she dropped her eyes and then raised them gaily to his mother is still asleep she whispered hermione he cried dropping his palette and putting his brush behind his ear she held out her arms to him as everybody remembers when the heart is young by paul samways was the feature of the exhibition it was bought for pounds by a retired bottle manufacturer whom it reminded a little of his late mother paul woke to find himself famous but the success which began for him from this day did not spoil his simple and generous nature he never forgot his brother artists whose feet were not yet on the top of the ladder indeed one of his first acts after he was married was to give a commission to peter samways ara nothing less than the painting of his wifes portrait and lady hermione was delighted with the result the barrister the new bailey was crowded with a gay and fashionable throng it was a remarkable case of shoplifting aurora delaine nineteen was charged with feloniously stealing and conveying certain articles the property of the universal stores to wit thirtyfive yards of bock muslin ten pairs of gloves a sponge two gimlets five jars of cold cream a copy of the clergy list three hatguards a mariners compass a box of drawingpins an eggbreaker six blouses and a cabmans whistle the theft had been proved by albert jobson a shopwalker who gave evidence to the effect that he followed her through the different departments and saw her take the things mentioned in the indictment just a moment interrupted the judge who is defending the prisoner there was an unexpected silence rupert carleton who had dropped idly into court looked round in sudden excitement the poor girl had no counsel what if he yes he would seize the chance he stood up boldly i am my lord he said rupert carleton was still in the twenties but he had been a briefless barrister for some years yet though briefs would not come he had been very far from idle he had stood for parliament in both the conservative and liberal interests not to mention his own he had written half a dozen unproduced plays and he was engaged to be married but success in his own profession had been delayed now at last was his opportunity he pulled his wig down firmly over his ears took out a pair of pincenez and rose to crossexamine it was the crossexamination which was to make him famous the crossexamination which is now given as a model in every legal textbook mr jobson he began suavely you say that you saw the accused steal these various articles and that they were afterwards found upon her yes i put it to you said rupert and waited intently for the answer that that is a pure invention on your part no with a superhuman effort rupert hid his disappointment unexpected as the answer was he preserved his impassivity i suggest he tried again that you followed her about and concealed this collection of things in her cloak with a view to advertising your winter sale no i saw her steal them rupert frowned the man seemed impervious to the simplest suggestion with masterly decision he tapped his pincenez and fell back upon his third line of defence you saw her steal them what you mean is that you saw her take them from the different counters and put them in her bag yes with the intention of paying for them in the ordinary way no please be very careful you said in your evidence that the prisoner when told she would be charged cried to think that i should have come to this will no one save me i suggest that she went up to you with her collection of purchases pulled out her purse and said what does all this come to i cant get any one to serve me no the obstinacy of some people rupert put back his pincenez in his pocket and brought out another pair the historic crossexamination continued we will let that pass for the moment he said he consulted a sheet of paper and then looked sternly at mr jobson mr jobson how many times have you been married once quite so he hesitated and then decided to risk it i suggest that your wife left you yes it was a long shot but once again the bold course had paid rupert heaved a sigh of relief will you tell the gentlemen of the jury he said with deadly politeness why she left you she died a lesser man might have been embarrassed but ruperts iron nerve did not fail him exactly he said and was that or was that not on the night when you were turned out of the hampstead parliament for intoxication i never was indeed will you cast your mind back to the night of april th what were you doing on that night i have no idea said jobson after casting his mind back and waiting in vain for some result in that case you cannot swear that you were not being turned out of the hampstead parliament but i never belonged to it rupert leaped at the damaging admission what you told the court that you lived at hampstead and yet you say that you never belonged to the hampstead parliament is that your idea of patriotism i said i lived at hackney to the hackney parliament i should say i am suggesting that you were turned out of the hackney parliament for i dont belong to that either exactly said rupert triumphantly having been turned out for intoxication and never did belong indeed may i take it then that you prefer to spend your evenings in the publichouse if you want to know said jobson angrily i belong to the hackney chess circle and that takes up most of my evenings rupert gave a sigh of satisfaction and turned to the jury at last gentlemen we have got it i thought we should arrive at the truth in the end in spite of mr jobsons prevarications he turned to the witness now sir he said sternly you have already told the court that you have no idea what you were doing on the night of april th i put it to you once more that this blankness of memory is due to the fact that you were in a state of intoxication on the premises of the hackney chess circle can you swear on your oath that this is not so a murmur of admiration for the relentless way in which the truth had been tracked down ran through the court rupert drew himself up and put on both pairs of pincenez at once come sir he said the jury is waiting but it was not albert jobson who answered it was the counsel for the prosecution my lord he said getting up slowly this has come as a complete surprise to me in the circumstances i must advise my clients to withdraw from the case a very proper decision said his lordship the prisoner is discharged without a stain on her character briefs poured in upon rupert next day and he was engaged for all the big chancery cases within a week his six plays were accepted and within a fortnight he had entered parliament as the miners member for coalville his marriage took place at the end of a month the wedding presents were even more numerous and costly than usual and included thirtyfive yards of book muslin ten pairs of gloves a sponge two gimlets five jars of cold cream a copy of the clergy list three hatguards a mariners compass a box of drawingpins an eggbreaker six blouses and a cabmans whistle they were marked quite simply from a grateful friend the civil servant it was three oclock and the afternoon sun reddened the western windows of one of the busiest of government offices in an airy room on the third floor richard dale was batting standing in front of the coalbox with the fireshovel in his hands he was a model of the strenuous young englishman and as for the third time he turned the government indiarubber neatly in the direction of squareleg and so completed his fifty the bowler could hardly repress a sigh of envious admiration even the reserved matthews who was too old for cricket looked up a moment from his putting and said well played dick the fourth occupant of the room was busy at his desk as if to give the lie to the thoughtless accusation that the civil service cultivates the body at the expense of the mind the eager shouts of the players seemed to annoy him for he frowned and bit his pen or else passed his fingers restlessly through his hair how the dickens you expect any one to think in this confounded noise he cried suddenly whats the matter ashby youre the matter how am i going to get these verses done for the evening surprise if you make such a row why dont you go out to tea good idea come on dale you coming matthews they went out leaving the room to ashby in his youth harold ashby had often been told by his relations that he had a literary bent his letters home from school were generally pronounced to be good enough for punch and some of them together with a certificate of character from his vicar were actually sent to that paper but as he grew up he realized that his genius was better fitted for work of a more solid character his post in the civil service gave him full leisure for his adam a fragment his history of the microscope and his studies in rural campanology and yet left him ample time in which to contribute to the journalism of the day the poem he was now finishing for the evening surprise was his first contribution to that paper but he had little doubt that it would be accepted it was called quite simply love and death and it began like this love o love all other things above why o why am i afraid to die there were six more lines which i have forgotten but i suppose they gave the reason for this absurd diffidence having written the poem out neatly harold put it in an envelope and took it round to the evening surprise the strain of composition had left him rather weak and he decided to give his brain a rest for the next few days so it happened that he was at the wickets on the following wednesday afternoon when the commissionaire brought him in the historic letter he opened it hastily the shovel under his arm dear sir wrote the editor of the surprise will you come round and see me as soon as convenient harold lost no time explaining that he would finish his innings later he put his coat on took his hat and stick and dashed out how do you do said the editor i wanted to talk to you about your work we all liked your little poem very much it will be coming out tomorrow thursday said harold helpfully i was wondering whether we couldnt get you to join our staff does the idea of doing aunt miriams cosy corner in our afternoon edition appeal to you at all no said harold not a bit ah thats a pity he tapped his desk thoughtfully well then how would you like to be a war correspondent very much said harold i was considered to write rather good letters home from school splendid theres this little war in mexico when can you start all expenses and fifty pounds a week youre not very busy at the office i suppose just now i could get sick leave easily enough said harold if it wasnt for more than eight or nine months do that will be excellent heres a blank cheque for your outfit can you get off tomorrow but i suppose youll have one or two things to finish up at the office first well said harold cautiously i was in and id made ninetysix but if i go back and finish my innings now and then have tomorrow for buying things i could get off on friday good said the editor well heres luck come back alive if you can and if you do we shant forget you harold spent the next day buying a war correspondents outfit the camel the travelling bath the putties the pith helmet the quinine the sleepingbag and the thousandandone other necessities of active service on the friday his colleagues at the office came down in a body to southampton to see him off little did they think that nearly a year would elapse before he again set foot upon england i shall not describe all his famous coups in mexico sufficient to say that experience taught him quickly all that he had need to learn and that whereas he was more than a week late with his cabled account of the first engagement of the war he was frequently more than a week early afterwards indeed the battle of parsons nose so realistically described in his last telegram is still waiting to be fought it is to be hoped that it will be in time for his aptlynamed book with the mexicans in mexico which is coming out next month on his return to england harold found that time had wrought many changes to begin with the editor of the evening surprise had passed on to the morning exclamation you had better take his place said the ducal proprietor to harold right said harold i suppose i shall have to resign my post at the office just as you like i dont see why you should i should miss the cricket said harold wistfully and the salary ill go round and see what i can arrange but there were also changes at the office harold had been rising steadily in salary and seniority during his absence and he found to his delight that he was now a principal clerk he found too that he had acquired quite a reputation in the office for quickness and efficiency in his new work the first thing to arrange about was his holiday he had had no holiday for more than a year and there were some eight weeks owing to him hullo said the assistant secretary as harold came in youre looking well i suppose you manage to get away for the weekends ive been away on sick leave for some time said harold pathetically have you youve kept it very secret come out and have lunch with me and well do a matinee afterwards harold went out with him happily it would be pleasant to accept the editorship of the evening surprise without giving up the governmental work which was so dear to him and the assistant secretarys words made this possible for a year or so anyhow then when his absence from the office first began to be noticed it would be time to think of retiring on an adequate pension the actor mr levinski the famous actormanager dragged himself from beneath the car took the snow out of his mouth and swore heartily mortal men are liable to motor accidents even kings cars have backfired but it seems strange that actormanagers are not specially exempt from these occurrences mr levinski was not only angry he was also a little shocked when an actormanager has to walk two miles to the nearest town on a winter evening one may be pardoned a doubt as to whether all is quite right with the world but the completest tragedy has its compensations for some one the pitiable arrival of mr levinski at the dukes head unrecognized and with his fur coat slightly ruffled might make a sceptic of the most devout optimist and yet eustace merrowby can never look back upon that evening without a sigh of thankfulness for to him it was the beginning of his career the story has often been told since in about a dozen weekly papers half a dozen daily papers and three dozen provincial papers but it will always bear telling again there was no train to london that night and mr levinski had been compelled to put up at the dukes head however he had dined and was feeling slightly better he summoned the manager of the hotel what does one do in this dam place he asked with a yawn the manager instantly recognizing that he was speaking to a member of the aristocracy made haste to reply othello was being played at the town theatre his daughter who had already been three times told him that it was simply sweet he was sure his lordship mr levinski dismissed him and considered the point he had to amuse himself with something that evening and the choice apparently lay between othello and the local directory he picked up the directory by a lucky chance for eustace merrowby it was three years old mr levinski put on his fur coat and went to see othello for some time he was as bored as he had expected to be but halfway through the third act he began to wake up there was something in the playing of the principal actor which moved him strangely he looked at his programme othello mr eustace merrowby mr levinski frowned thoughtfully merrowby he said to himself i dont know the name but hes the man i want he took out the gold pencil presented to him by the emperor the stationmaster had had a tiepin and wrote a note he was finishing breakfast next morning when mr merrowby was announced ah goodmorning said mr levinski goodmorning you find me very busy and here he began to turn the pages of the directory backwards and forwards but i can give you a moment what is it you want you asked me to call on you said eustace did i did i he passed his hand across his brow with a noble gesture i am so busy i forget ah now i remember i saw you play othello last night you are the man i want i am producing oom baas the great south african drama next april at my theatre perhaps you know i have read about it in the papers said eustace in all the papers he might have added every day for the last six months good then you may have heard that one of the scenes is an ostrich farm i want you to play tommy one of the ostriches asked eustace i do not offer the part of an ostrich to a man who has played othello tommy is the kaffir boy who looks after the farm it is a black part like your present one but not so long in london you cannot expect to take the leading parts just yet this is very kind of you cried eustace gratefully i have always longed to get to london and to start in your theatre its a wonderful chance good said mr levinski then thats settled he waved eustace away and took up the directory again with a businesslike air and so eustace merrowby came to london it is a great thing for a young actor to come to london as mr levinski had warned him his new part was not so big as that of othello he had to say hofo tsetse which was alleged to be kaffir for down sir to the big ostrich but to be at the st georges theatre at all was an honour which most men would envy him and his association with a real ostrich was bound to bring him before the public in the pages of the illustrated papers eustace curiously enough was not very nervous on the first night he was fairly certain that he was wordperfect and if only the ostrich didnt kick him in the back of the neck as it had tried to once at rehearsal the evening seemed likely to be a triumph for him and so it was with a feeling of pleasurable anticipation that on the morning after he gathered the papers round him at breakfast and prepared to read what the critics had to say he had a remarkable press i give a few examples of the notices he obtained from the leading papers mr eustace merrowby was tommy daily telegraph the cast included mr eustace merrowby times mr eustace merrowby daily chronicle we have no space in which to mention all the other performers morning leader this criticism only concerns the two actors we have mentioned and does not apply to the rest of the cast sportsman where all were so good it would be invidious to single out anybody for special praise daily mail the acting deserved a better play daily news tommy morning post as eustace read the papers he felt that his future was secure true the era careful never to miss a single performer had yet to say mr eustace merrowby was capital as tommy and the stage tommy was capitally played by mr eustace merrowby but even without this he had become one of the men who count one whose private life was of more interest to the public than that of any scientist general or diplomat in the country into eustace merrowbys subsequent career i cannot go at full length it is perhaps as a member of the garrick club that he has attained his fullest development all the good things of the garrick which were not previously said by sydney smith may safely be put down to eustace and there is no doubt that he is the ringleader in all the subtler practical jokes which have made the club famous it was he who pinned to the back of an unpopular member of the committee a sheet of paper bearing the words kick me and the occasion on which he drew the chair from beneath a certain eminent author as the latter was about to sit down is still referred to hilariously by the older members finally as a convincing proof of his greatness let it be said that everybody has at least heard the name eustace merrowby even though some may be under the impression that it is the trademark of a sauce and that half the young ladies of wandsworth common and winchmore hill are in love with him if this be not success what is the younger son it is a hard thing to be the younger son of an ancient but impoverished family the fact that your brother thomas is taking most of the dibs restricts your inheritance to a paltry two thousand a year while pride of blood forbids you to supplement this by following any of the common professions impossible for a st verax to be a doctor a policeman or an architect he must find some nobler means of existence for three years roger st verax had lived precariously by betting to be a st verax was always to be a sportsman rogers father had created a record in the sporting world by winning the derby and the waterloo cup with the same animal though in each case it narrowly escaped disqualification roger himself almost created another record by making betting pay his book showing how to do it was actually in the press when disaster overtook him he began by dropping in sporting parlance a cool thousand on the jack joel selling plate at newmarket on the next race he dropped a cool five hundred and later on in the afternoon a cool seventy five pounds ten the following day found him at lingfield where he dropped a cool monkey to persevere with the language of the racing stable on the solly joel cup picked it up on the next race dropped a cool pony dropped another cool monkey dropped a cool wallaby picked up a cool hippopotamus and finally in the last race of the day dropped a couple of lukewarm ferrets in short he was as they say at tattersalls corner entirely cleaned out when a younger son is cleaned out there is only one thing for him to do roger st verax knew instinctively what it was he bought a new silk hat and a short black coat and went into the city what a wonderful place dear reader is the city you madam who read this in your daintily upholstered boudoir can know but little of the great heart of the city even though you have driven through its arteries on your way to liverpool street station and have noted the bare and smoothly brushed polls of the younger natives you sir in your country vicarage are no less innocent even though on sultry afternoons you have covered your head with the financial supplement of the times in mistake for the literary supplement and have thus had thrust upon you the stirring news that bangobangos were going up and i dear friends am equally ignorant of the secrets of the stock exchange i know that its members frequently walk to brighton and still more frequently stay there that while finding a home for all the good stories which have been going the rounds for years they sometimes invent entirely new ones for themselves about the chancellor of the exchequer and that they sing the national anthem very sternly in unison when occasion demands it but there must be something more in it than this or why are bangobangos still going up i dont know and i am sorry to say that even roger st verax a director of the bangobango development company is not very clear about it all it was as a director of the bangobango exploration company that he took up his life in the city as its name implies the company was originally formed to explore bangobango an impenetrable district in north australia but when it came to the point it was found much more profitable to explore hampstead clapham common blackheath ealing and other rich and fashionable suburbs a number of hopeful ladies and gentlemen having been located in these parts the company went ahead rapidly and in a new prospector was sent out to replace the one who was assumed to have been eaten in roger first heard the magic word reconstruction and to his surprise found himself in possession of twenty thousand pounds and a directorship of the new bangobango mining company in a piece of real gold was identified and the shares went up like a rocket in the stock exchange suddenly woke to the fact that rubber tyres were made of rubber and in a moment the great boom was sprung upon an amazed city the bangobango development company was immediately formed to take over the bangobango mining company together with its prospector if alive its plant shafts and other property not forgetting the piece of gold and more particularly to develop the vegetable resources of the district with the view of planting rubber trees in the immediate future a neatly compiled prospectus put matters very clearly before the stayathome englishman it explained quite concisely that supposing the trees were planted so many feet apart throughout the whole property of five thousand square miles and allowing a certain period for the growth of a tree to maturity and putting the average yield of rubber per tree at in round figures so much and assuming for the sake of convenience that rubber would remain at its present price and estimating the cost of working the plantation at say roughly pounds why then it was obvious that the profits would be anything you liked up to two billion a year while this was important more land could doubtless be acquired if the share holders thought fit and even if you were certain that a rubbertree couldnt possibly grow in the bangobango district as in confidence it couldnt still it was worth taking shares purely as an investment seeing how rapidly rubber was going up not to mention the fact that roger st verax the wellknown financier was a director and so on in short the bangobango development company was in the language of the city a safe thing let me hasten to the end of this story at the end of roger was a millionaire and for quite a week afterwards he used to wonder where all the money had come from in the old days when he won a cool thousand by betting he knew that somebody else had lost a cool thousand by betting but it did not seem to be so in this case he had met hundreds of men who had made fortunes through rubber he had met hundreds who bitterly regretted that they had missed making a fortune but he had never met any one who had lost a fortune this made him think the city an even more wonderful place than before but before he could be happy there remained one thing for him to do he must find somebody to share his happiness he called on his old friend mary brown one sunday mary he said with the brisk confidence of the city man i find im disengaged next tuesday will you meet me at st georges church at two i should like to show you the curate and the vestry and one or two things like that why whats happened i am a millionaire said roger calmly so long as i only had my beggarly pittance i could not ask you to marry me there was nothing for it but to wait in patience it has been a long weary wait dear but the sun has broken through the clouds at last i am now in a position to support a wife tuesday at two he went on consulting his pocket diary or i could give you half an hour on monday morning but why this extraordinary hurry why maynt i be married properly with presents and things my dear said roger reproachfully you forget i am a city man now and it is imperative that i should be married at once only a married man with everything in his wifes name can face with confidence the give and take of the bustling city a few friends margery i a twice told tale is that you uncle said a voice from the nursery as i hung my coat up in the hall ive only got my skin on but you can come up however she was sitting up in bed with her nightgown on when i found her i was having my bath when you came she explained have you come all the way from london all the way then will you tell me a story i cant im going to have my dinner i only came up to say goodnight margery leant forward and whispered coaxingly will you just tell me about beauty and e beast but ive told you that such heaps of times and its much too long for tonight tell me half of it as much as that she held her hands about nine inches apart thats too much as much as that the hands came a little nearer together oh well ill tell you up to where the beast died fought he died she corrected eagerly yes well how much will that be as much as i said i nodded the preliminary business settled she gave a little sigh of happiness put her arms round her knees and waited breathlessly for the story she had heard twenty times before once upon a time there was a man who had three daughters and one day what was the mans name margery i said reproachfully annoyed at the interruption you know i never tell you the mans name tell me now oswald i said after a moments thought i told daddy it was thomas said margery casually well as a matter of fact he had two names oswald and thomas why did he have two names in case he lost one well one day this man who was very poor heard that a lot of money was waiting for him in a ship which had come over the sea to a town some miles off so he was it waiting at weymouf somewhere like that i spex it must have been weymouf because theres lots of sea there yes im sure it was well he thought hed go to weymouth and get the money how much monies was it oh lots and lots as much as five pennies yes about that well he said goodbye to his daughters and asked them what theyd like him to bring back for a present and the first asked for some lovely jewels and diamonds and like mummys locket is that jewels that sort of idea well she wanted a lot of things like that and the second wanted some beautiful clothes what sort of clothes oh frocks and well frocks and all sorts of er frocks did she want any lovely new stockings yes she wanted three pairs of those and did she want any lovely yes i said hastily she wanted lots of those too lots of everything margery gave a little sob of happiness go on telling me she said under her breath well the third daughter was called beauty and she thought to herself poor father wont have any money left at all if we all go on like this so she didnt ask for anything very expensive like her selfish sisters she only asked for a rose a simple red rose margery moved uneasily i hope she said wistfully this bit isnt going to be about you know it never did before about what good little girls and bad little girls and fings like that my darling no of course not i told it wrong beauty asked for a rose because she loved roses so and it was a very particular kind of red rose that she wanted a sort that they simply couldnt get to grow in their own garden because of the soil go on telling me said margery with a deep sigh of content well he started off to weymouth what day did he start it was monday and when oh well anyhow i told daddy it was tuesday tuesday now let me think yes i believe youre right because on monday he went to a meeting of the vegetable gardeners and proposed the health of the chairman yes well he started off on tuesday and when he got there he found that there was no money for him at all i spex somebody had taken it said margery breathlessly well it had all gone somehow perhaps somebody had swallowed it said margery a little carried away by the subject by mistake anyhow it was gone and he had to come home again without any money he hadnt gone far how far asked margery as far as that and she measured nine inches in the air about fortyfour miles when he came to a beautiful garden was it a really lovely big garden bigger than ours oh much bigger bigger than yours i havent got a garden margery looked at me wonderingly she opened her mouth to speak and then stopped and rested her head upon her hands and thought out this new situation at last her face flushed with happiness she announced her decision go on telling me about beauty and the beast now she said breathlessly and then tell me why you havent got a garden my average time for beauty and the beast is ten minutes and if we stop at the place when the beast thought he was dead six minutes twentyfive seconds but with the aid of seemingly innocent questions a determined character can make even the craftiest uncle spin the story out to half an hour next time said margery when we had reached the appointed place and she was being tucked up in bed will you tell me all the story was there the shadow of a smile in her eyes i dont know but im sure it will be wisest next time to promise her the whole thing we must make that point clear at the very start and then we shall get along ii the literary art margery has a passion for writing just now i can see nothing in it myself but if people will write i suppose you cant stop them will you just lend me your pencil she asked remind me to give you a hundred pencils some time i said as i took it out and then youll always have one you simply eat pencils oo i gave it you back last time only just you inveigle me down here what do i do im not going to say that again for anybody well may i have the pencil i gave her the pencil and a sheet of paper and settled her in a chair baby said margery to herself planning out her weekly article for the reviews baby baby she squared her elbows and began to write there she said after five minutes composition the manuscript was brought over to the critic and the author stood proudly by to point out subtleties that might have been overlooked at a first reading baby explained the author baby yes thats very good very neatly expressed baby i like that shall i write some more said margery eagerly yes do write some more this is good but its not long enough the author retired again and in five minutes produced this b a b y thats baby explained margery yes i like that baby better than the other one its more spread out and its bigger its one of the biggest babies ive seen shall i write some more dont you write anything else ever i like writing baby said margery carelessly baby yes but you cant do much with just that one word suppose you wanted to write to a man at a shop dear sir you never sent me my boots please send them at once as i want to go out this afternoon i am yours faithfully margery it would be no good simply putting baby because he wouldnt know what you meant well what would it be good putting ah thats the whole art of writing to know what it would be any good putting you want to learn lots and lots of new words so as to be ready now heres a jolly little one that you ought to meet i took the pencil and wrote got got got got margery her elbows on my knee and her chin resting on her hands studied the position yes thats old got she said hes always coming in when you want to say ive got a bad pain so i cant accept your kind invitation or when you want to say excuse more as ive got to go to bed now or quite simply youve got my pencil got got said margery got got got got with appropriate action it makes a very nice recitation is that a g said margery busy with the pencil which she had snatched from me the gentleman with the tail you havent made his tail quite long enough thats better margery retired to her study charged with an entirely new inspiration and wrote her second manifesto it was this g o t got she pointed out i inspected it carefully coming fresh to the idea margery had treated it more spontaneously than the other but it was distinctly a got one of the gots have you any more words she asked holding tight to the pencil youve about exhausted me margery what was that one you said just now the one you said you wouldnt say again oh you mean inveigle i said pronouncing it differently this time yes write that for me it hardly ever comes in only when you are writing to your solicitor whats solicitor hes the gentleman who takes the money hes always coming in then write solicitor i took the pencil it was my turn for it and wrote solicitor then i read it out slowly to margery spelt it to her three times very carefully and wrote solicitor again then i said it thoughtfully to myself half a dozen times solicitor then i looked at it wonderingly i am not sure now i said that there is such a word why i thought there was when i began but now i dont think there can be solicitor it seems so silly let me write it said margery eagerly taking the paper and pencil and see if it looks silly she retired and as well as she could for her excitement copied the word down underneath the combined effort then read as follows solicitor solicitor solctor yes youve done it a lot of good i said youve taken some of the creases out i like that much better do you think there is such a word now im beginning to feel more easy about it im not certain but i hope so do i said margery with the pencil in one hand and the various scraps of paper in the other she climbed on to the writingdesk and gave herself up to literature and it seems to me that she is well equipped for the task for besides having my pencil still of which i say nothing for the moment she has now three separate themes upon which to ring the changes a range wide enough for any writer these are baby got solicitor supposing that there is such a word solicitor got baby and got baby solicitor indeed there are really four themes here for the last one can have two interpretations it might mean that you had obtained an ordinary solicitor for baby or it might mean that you had got a specially small one for yourself it lacks therefore the lucidity of the best authors but in a woman writer this may be forgiven iii my secretary when five years ago i used to write long letters to margery for some reason or other she never wrote back to save her face i had to answer the letters myself a tedious business still i must admit that the warmth and geniality of the replies gave me a certain standing with my friends who had not looked for me to be so popular after some months however pride stepped in one cannot pour out letter after letter to a lady without any acknowledgment save from oneself and when even my own acknowledgments began to lose their first warmth when for instance i answered four pages about my new pianola with the curt reminder that i was learning to walk and couldnt be bothered with music why then at last i saw that a correspondence so onesided would have to come to an end i wrote a farewell letter and replied to it with tears but bless you that was nearly five years ago each morning now among the usual pile of notes on my plate from duchesses publishers moneylenders actormanagers and whatnot i find likely enough an envelope in margerys own handwriting not only is my address printed upon it legibly but there are also such extra directions to the postman as england and important for its more speedy arrival and inside well i give you the last but seven my dear uncle i thot you wher coming to see me to night but you didnt why didnt you baby has p t o hurt her knee isnt that a pity i have some new toys isnt that jolly we didnt have our five minutes so will you krite to me and tell me all about p t o your work from your loving little margie i always think that footnotes to a letter are a mistake but there are one or two things i should like to explain a just as some journalists feel that without the word economic a leading article lacks tone so margery feels and i agree with her that a certain cachet is lent to a letter by a pto at the bottom of each page b there are lots of grownup people who think that write is spelt rite margery knows that this is not so she knows that there is a silent letter in front of the r which doesnt do anything but likes to be there obviously if nobody is going to take any notice of this extra letter it doesnt much matter what it is margery happened to want to make a k just then at a pinch it could be as silent as a w you will please therefore regard the k in krite as absolutely noiseless c both margery and bernard shaw prefer to leave out the apostrophe in writing such words as isnt and dont d years ago i claimed the privilege to monopolise on the occasional evenings when i was there margerys last ten minutes before she goes back to some heaven of her own each night this privilege was granted it being felt no doubt that she owed me some compensation for my early secretarial work on her behalf we used to spend the ten minutes in listening to my telling a fairy story always the same one one day the authorities stepped in and announced that in future the ten minutes would be reduced to five the procedure seemed to me absolutely illegal and i should like to bring a test action against somebody but it certainly did put the lid on my fairy story of which i was getting more than a little tired tell me about beauty and the beast said margery as usual that evening theres not time i said weve only five minutes tonight oh then tell me all the work youve done today a little unkind youll agree but you know what relations are and so now i have to cram the record of my days work into five breathless minutes you will understand what bare justice i can do to it in the time i am sorry that these footnotes have grown so big let us leave them and return to the letter there are many ways of answering such a letter one might say my dear margery it was jolly to get a real letter from you at last but the at last would seem rather tactless considering what had passed years before or one might say my dear margery thank you for your jolly letter i am so sorry about babys knee and so glad about your toys perhaps if you gave one of the toys to baby then her knee but i feel sure that margery would expect me to do better than that in the particular case of this last letter but seven i wrote dearest margery thank you for your sweet letter i had a very busy day at the office or i would have come to see you pto i hope to be down next week and then i will tell you all about my work but i have a lot more to do now and so i must say goodbye your loving uncle there is perhaps nothing in that which demands an immediate answer but with businesslike promptitude margery replied my dear uncle thank you for your letter i am glad you are coming next week baby is quite well now are you p t o coming on thursday next week or not say yes if you are i am p t o sorry you are working so hard from your loving margie i said yes and that i was her loving uncle it seemed to be then too late for a pto but i got one in and put on the back love to baby the answer came by return of post my dear uncle thank you for your letter come erly on p t o thursday come at half past nothing baby sends her love and so do p t o i my roking horse has a sirrup broken isnt that a pity say yes or no goodbye from your loving margie of course i thanked baby for her love and gave my decision that it was a pity about the rockinghorse i did it in large capitals which as i ought to have said before is the means of communication between margery and her friends for some reason or other i find printing capitals to be more tiring than the ordinary method of writing my dear uncle wrote margery but we need not go into that what i want to say is this i love to get letters particularly these but i hate writing them particularly in capitals years ago i used to answer margerys letters for her it is now her turn to answer mine for me chum it is chums birthday tomorrow and i am going to buy him a little whip for a present with a whistle at the end of it when i next go into the country to see him i shall take it with me and explain it to him two days firmness would make him quite a sensible dog i have often threatened to begin the treatment on my very next visit but somehow it has been put off the occasion of his birthday offers a last opportunity it is rather absurd though to talk of birthdays in connection with chum for he has been no more than three months old since we have had him he is a black spaniel who has never grown up he has a beautiful astrakhan coat which gleams when the sun is on it but he stands so low in the water that the front of it is always getting dirty and his ears and the ends of his trousers trail in the mud a great authority has told us that but for three white hairs on his shirt upon so little do class distinctions hang he would be a cocker of irreproachable birth a still greater authority has sworn that he is a sussex the family is indifferent it only calls him a silly ass why he was christened chum i do not know and as he never recognizes the name it doesnt matter when he first came to stay with us i took him a walk round the village i wanted to show him the lie of the land he had never seen the country before and was full of interest he trotted into a cottage garden and came back with something to show me youll never guess he said look and he dropped at my feet a chick just out of the egg i smacked his head and took him into the cottage to explain my dog i said has eaten one of your chickens chum nudged me in the ankle and grinned two of your chickens i corrected myself looking at the fresh evidence which he had just brought to light you dont want me any more said chum as the financial arrangements proceeded then ill just go and find somewhere for these two and he picked them up and trotted into the sun when i came out i was greeted effusively this is a wonderful day he panted as he wriggled his body i didnt know the country was like this what do we do now we go home i said and we went that was chums last day of freedom he keeps inside the front gate now but he is still a happy dog there is plenty doing in the garden there are beds to walk over there are blackbirds in the apple tree to bark at the world is still full of wonderful things why only last wednesday he will tell you the fishmonger left his basket in the drive there was a haddock in it if youll believe me for masters breakfast so of course i saved it for him i put it on the grass just in front of his study window where hed be sure to notice it bless you theres always something to do in this house one is never idle and even when there is nothing doing he is still happy waiting cheerfully upon events until they arrange themselves for his amusement he will sit for twenty minutes opposite the garden bank watching for a bumblebee to come out of its hole i saw him go in he says to himself so hes bound to come out extraordinarily interesting world but to his inferiors such as the gardener he pretends that it is not pleasure but duty which keeps him dont talk to me fool cant you see that ive got a job on here chum has found however that his particular mission in life is to purge his masters garden of all birds this keeps him busy as soon as he sees a blackbird on the lawn he is in full cry after it when he gets to the place and finds the blackbird gone he pretends that he was going there anyhow he gallops round in circles rolls over once or twice and then trots back again you didnt really think i was such a fool as to try to catch a blackbird he says to us no i was just taking a little run splendid thing for the figure and it is just chums little runs over the beds which call aloud for firmness which in fact have inspired my birthday present to him but there is this difficulty to overcome first when he came to live with us an arrangement was entered into so he says by which one bed was given to him as his own in that bed he could wander at will burying bones and biscuits hunting birds this may have been so but it is a pity that nobody but chum knows definitely which is the bed chum you bounder i shout as he is about to wade through the herbaceous border he takes no notice he struggles through to the other side but a sudden thought strikes him and he pushes his way back again did you call me he says how dare you walk over the flowers he comes up meekly i suppose ive done something wrong he says but i cant think what i smack his head for him he waits until he is quite sure i have finished and then jumps up with a bark wipes his paws on my trousers and trots into the herbaceous border again chum i cry he sits down in it and looks all round him in amazement my own bed he murmurs given to me i dont know what it is in him which so catches hold of you his way of sitting a reproachful statue motionless outside the window of whomever he wants to come out and play with him until you can bear it no longer but must either go into the garden or draw down the blinds for the day his habit when you are out of sitting up on his back legs and begging you with his front paws to come and do something a trick entirely of his own invention for no one would think of teaching him anything his funny nautical roll when he walks which is nearly a swagger and gives him always the air of having just come back from some rather dashing adventure beyond all this there is still something and whatever it is it is something which every now and then compels you to bend down and catch hold of his long silky ears to look into his honest eyes and say you silly old ass you dear old silly old ass betty the hotel child i was in the lounge when i made her acquaintance enjoying a pipe after tea and perhaps i dont know closing my eyes now and then would you like to see my shells she asked suddenly i woke up and looked at her she was about seven years old pretty dark and very much at ease i should love it i said she produced a large paper bag from somewhere and poured the contents in front of me ive got two hundred and fiftyeight she announced so i see i said i wasnt going to count them i think theyre very pretty ill give you one if you like which one will you choose i sat up and examined them carefully seeing how short a time we had known each other i didnt feel that i could take one of the good ones after a little thought i chose quite a plain one which had belonged to a winkle some weeks ago thank you very much i said i dont think you choose shells at all well she said scornfully thats one of the ugly ones it will grow on me i explained in a year or two i shall think it beautiful ill let you have this one too said she picking out the best now shall we play at something i had been playing at something all day a little thinking in front of the fire was my present programme lets talk instead i suggested whats your name betty i knew it was betty you look just like betty whats yours somehow i hadnt expected that after all though it was only fair orlando i said what a funny name i dont like it you should have said so before its too late now what have you been doing all day playing on the sands what have you been doing ive been playing in the sand too i suppose betty you know nearly everybody in the hotel oh i play with them all sometimes yes then tell me betty do you ever get asked what time you go to bed they all ask me that said betty promptly i think i should like to ask you too i said just to be in the movement when is it halfpast six she looked at the clock so weve got half an hour ill get my ball before i had time to do anything about it the ball came bouncing in hit me on the side of the head and hurried off to hide itself under an old lady dozing in the corner betty followed more sedately wheres my ball she asked has it come in i said in surprise then it must have gone out again it noticed you werent here i believe youve got it i swear i havent betty i think the lady in the corner knows something about it betty rushed across to her and began to crawl under her chair i nervously rehearsed a few sentences to myself it is not my child madam i found it here surely you can see that there is no likeness between us if we keep quite still perhaps it will go away ive got it cried betty and the old lady woke up with a jerk what are you doing child she said crossly your little girl madam i began but bettys ball bit me on the head again before i could develop my theme your little girl sir began the old lady at the same moment i said it first i murmured betty i went on aloud what is your name my child youve just said it i mean i corrected myself quickly where do you live kensington i looked triumphantly at the old lady surely a father wouldnt need to ask his own child where she lived however the old lady was asleep again i turned to betty we shall have to play this game more quietly i said in fact we had better make some new rules instead of hitting me on the head each time you can roll the ball gently along the floor to me and i shall roll it gently back to you and the one who misses it first goes to bed i gave her an easy one to start with wishing to work up naturally to the denouement and she gave me a very difficult one back not quite understanding the object of the game youve got to go to bed she cried clapping her hands youve got to go to bed youve got to go to bed youve all right i said coldly dont make a song about it it was ten minutes past six i generally go to bed at eleventhirty it would be the longest night i had had for years i sighed and prepared to go you neednt go till halfpast said betty kindly no no i said firmly rules are rules i had just remembered that there was nothing in the rules about not getting up again then ill come with you and see your room no you mustnt do that youd fall out of the window its a very tricky window im always falling out of it myself then lets go on playing here and we wont go to bed if we miss very well i agreed really there was nothing else for it robbed of its chief interest the game proved after ten minutes or so to be one of the duller ones whatever people say i dont think it compares with cricket for instance it is certainly not so subtle as golf i like playing this game said betty dont you i think i shall get to love it i said looking at the clock there were still five minutes and i rolled down a very fast googly which beat her entirely and went straight for the door under the old rules she would have gone to bed at once alas that look out i said as she went after it theres somebody coming in somebody came in she smiled ruefully at us and then took bettys hand im afraid my little girl has been worrying you she said prettily i knew youd say that said betty cinderella being an extract from her diary picked up behind the scenes tuesday sometimes i think i am a very lucky girl having two big sisters to look after me i expect there are lots of young girls who have nobody at all and i think they must be so lonely there is always plenty of fun going on in our house yesterday i heard sister fred telling sister bert something about her old man coming home very late one night i didnt quite understand who the old man was or what it was all about but i know sister bert thought it was very funny and i seemed to hear a lot of people laughing perhaps it was the fairies and then whenever sister bert sits down she always pulls her skirt right up to her knees so as people can see her stockings i mean theres always something amusing happening of course i have a good deal of work to do and all the washing up but my sisters are so big and strong that one cant expect them to bother themselves with niggling little things like that besides they have so many other things to do only this morning when sister bert was just going to sit down sister fred pulled away her chair and she sat on the floor and her legs went up in the air she said it was a grand slam which some of us thought very funny i didnt laugh myself because i never go out anywhere and so i dont understand topical remarks but i do think it is nice to live in such an amusing house later a wonderful thing has happened two messengers came from the prince an hour ago to invite us to the ball tonight id never seen a messenger in my life so i peeped out of the chimney corner at them and wondered if they would stay to tea but instead of that my sisters put up what they call a trapeze i never knew we had one before and the messengers did some extraordinary things on it i thought they would kill themselves after it was over sister fred told them a lot of stories about the old man and altogether it was quite different from what i expected ours is a funny house as soon as the messengers had gone my sisters began to get ready for the ball i knew i shouldnt be able to go because i havent got a frock and i simply couldnt wear anything of theirs they are so much bigger than i am they finished dressing downstairs for some reason where anybody might have seen them they are so funny about things like that and we had a lot of laughter about the clothes being too tight and so on i think anything like that is so amusing then they went off and here i am all alone it is getting dark and so i am going to cheer myself up by singing a little later i am going to the ball my fairy godmother whom i had often heard about suddenly came to see us i told her my sisters were out and she asked where they had gone and wouldnt i like to go too so of course i said i should love it so i am going and she has got a frock for me and everything she is very kind but not quite so fairylike as i expected wednesday i have had a lovely time and i think i am in love i got to the ball just as the juggling and the ventriloquism were over it must be a delightful court to live in and there was such a sensation as i appeared the prince singled me out at once he has the pinkest cheeks and the reddest lips of any man i know and his voice is soft and gentle and oh i love him one wants a man to be manly and a woman to be womanly and i dont think i should love a man if he were at all like sister fred or sister bert the prince is quite different we were alone most of the time and we sang several songs together my sisters never recognized me it was most surprising i heard sister fred telling a very finelooking gentleman a story about a lodger whatever that is who had a bit of a head it sounded very humorous wherever sister fred goes there is sure to be fun i am indeed a lucky girl to have two such sisters and to be in love with a prince sister bert sat down on the floor twice it was most amusing a terrible thing happened just as the clock struck twelve all my clothes turned into rags and i just ran out of the room i was so frightened then i remembered what my fairy godmother had said about leaving before twelve oclock i suppose she knew what would happen if i didnt im afraid i left a glass slipper behind i hope she wont mind about it well ive had a lovely time even if i never see the prince again i shall always have this to look back to i dont mind what happens now thursday i am going to marry the prince i cant believe it is true perhaps it is only a dream and i shall wake up soon but even if its a dream its just as good as if it were real it was all because of the slipper i left behind the prince said that he would marry the person whom it fitted because he had fallen in love with the lady who wore it at the ball me and so everybody tried it on and they came to our house and sister bert tried it on she pulled her skirt up to her knees and made everybody laugh but even then she couldnt get into it and sister fred made a lot of faces but she couldnt so i said let me try and they all laughed but the prince said i should and of course it fitted at once then they all recognized me and the prince kissed me and a whole lot of people came into the house who had never been invited and we had the trapeze out again and there was juggling and ventriloquism and we all sang songs about somebody called flanagan whom i dont think i have ever met and sister bert kept sitting down suddenly on the floor but the prince didnt think this was at all funny so i expect i must have been right all the time when i have only pretended to laugh i used to think that perhaps i hadnt a sense of humour and then the prince kissed me again and my fairy godmother came in and kissed us both of course we do owe it all to her really and i shall tell charming so i do think i am a wonderful person father christmas outside in the street the rain fell pitilessly but inside the childrens shop all was warmth and brightness happy young people of all ages pressed along and i had no sooner opened the door than i was received into the eager stream of shoppers and hurried away to fairyland a slight block at one corner pitched me into an old whitebearded gentleman who was standing next to me instantly my hat was in my hand i beg your pardon i said with a bow i was oh im sorry i thought you were real i straightened him up looked at his price and wondered whether i should buy him what do you mean by real he said i started violently and took my hat off again i am very stupid this morning i began the fact is i mistook you for a toy a foolish error i am a toy in that case i said in some annoyance i cant stay here arguing with you goodmorning and i took my hat off for the third time dont go stop and buy me youll never get what you want if you dont take me with you ive been in this place for years and i know exactly where everything is besides as i shall have to give away all your presents for you its only fair that an attendant came up and looked at me inquiringly how much is this thing i said and jerked a thumb at it the father christmas yes i think ill have it ill take it with me you neednt wrap it up i handed over some money and we pushed on together you heard what i called you i said to him a thing so dont go putting yourself forward he gazed up innocently from under my arm what shall we get first he asked i want the engineroom the locomotive in the home the boys own railroad track thats downstairs but did you really think of an engine i mean isnt it rather large and heavy why not get a i smacked his head and we went downstairs it was a delightful room i was introduced to practically the whole of the great western railways rolling stock engine three carriages and a guards van thats right then i shall want some rails of course shut up will you i said angrily when the attendant was out of hearing its the extra weight he sighed the reindeer dont like it and these modern chimneys youve no idea what a squeeze it is however those are very jolly i said when i had examined the rails i shall want about a mile of them threepence hapenny a foot then i shant want nearly a mile i got about thirty feet and then turned to switches and signals and lamps and things i bought a lot of those you never know what emergency might not arise on the nursery floor and if anything happened for want of a switch or two i should never forgive myself just as we were going away i caught sight of the jolliest little clockwork torpedo boat i stopped irresolute dont be silly said the voice under my arm youll never be asked to the house again if you give that why not wait till the children have fallen into the bath once or twice with all their clothes on and then ask the mother why not i see i said stiffly and we went upstairs the next thing we want is bricks bricks said father christmas uneasily bricks yes theres bricks have you ever thought of one of those nice little woolly rabbits where do we get bricks bricks you know i dont think mothers are as fond as all that of bricks i got the mothers present yesterday thanks very much this is for one of the children they showed me bricks and they showed me pictures of what the bricks would build palaces simply palaces gone was the balbuswall of our youth gone was the fort with its arrowholes for the archers nothing now but temples and moorish palaces jove i should love that i said i mean he would love that do you want much land for a house of that size i know of a site on the nursery floor but well of course we could always have an iron building outside in the passage for the billiard table we paid and moved off again what are you mumbling about now i asked i said youll only make the boy discontented with his present home if you teach him to build nothing but castles and ruined abbeys and things and you will run to bulk half of those bricks would have made a very nice present for anybody yes and when royalty comes on a visit where would you put them theyd have to pig it in the boxroom if were going to have a palace lets have a good one very well what do your children hang up stockings or pillowcases we went downstairs again having provided for the engineer and the architect i said we now have to consider the gentleman in the dairy business i want a milkcart you want a milkcart you want a milkcart you want a why not have a brewers dray why not have something really heavy the reindeer wouldnt mind theyve been out every day this week but theyd love it what about a nice skatingrink what about i put him head downwards in my pocket and approached an official do you keep milkcarts i said diffidently he screwed up his face and thought i could get you one he said i dont want you to build one specially for me if they arent made i expect its because mothers dont like them it was just an idea of mine oh yes theyre made i can show a picture of one in our catalogue he showed it to me it was about the size of a perambulator and contained every kind of can i simply had to let father christmas see look at that i exclaimed in delight good lord he said and dived into the pocket again i held him there tightly and finished my business with the official father christmas has never spoken since sometimes i wonder if he ever spoke at all for one imagines strange things in the childrens shop he stands now on my writingtable and observes me with the friendly smile which has been so fixed a feature of his since i brought him home miss middleton i taking a call may i come in said miss middleton i looked up from my book and stared at her in amazement hullo i said hullo said miss middleton doubtfully are you going to have tea with me thats what i was wondering all the way up its all ready in fact ive nearly finished theres a cake today too miss middleton hesitated at the door and looked wistfully at me i suppose i suppose she said timidly you think i ought to have brought somebody with me in a way im just as glad you didnt ive heaps of chaperons outside on the stairs you know theres no place like outside for chaperons and the liftman believes im your aunt at least perhaps he doesnt but i mentioned it to him i looked at her and then i smiled and then i laughed so thats all right she said breathlessly and i want my tea she came in and began to arrange her hat in front of the glass tea i said going to the cupboard i suppose youll want a cup to yourself there you are dont lose it milk sugar miss middleton took a large piece of cake what were you studying so earnestly when i came in she asked as she munched a dictionary but how lucky i came because i can spell simply everything what is it you want to know i dont want to know how to spell anything thank you but i believe you can help me all the same miss middleton sat down and drank her tea i love helping she said well its this ive just been asked to be a godfather miss middleton stood up suddenly do i salute she asked you sit down and go on eating the difficulty is what to call it oh do godfathers provide the names i think so it is what they are there for i fancy that is about all there is in it i believe and cant you find anything in the dictionary well i dont think the dictionary is helping as much as i expected it only muddles me did you know that algernon meant with whiskers im not thinking of calling it algernon but thats the sort of thing they spring on you but i hate algernon anyhow why not choose quite a simple name had you thought of john for instance no i hadnt thought of john somehow or gerald gerald i like very much what about dick she went on eagerly yes dick is quite jolly by the way did i tell you it was a girl miss middleton rose with dignity for your slice of plum cake and your small cup of tea i thank you she said and i am now going straight home to mother not yet i pleaded ill just ask you one question before i go where do you keep the biscuits she found the biscuits and sat down again a girls name i said encouragingly yes well is she fair or dark shes very small at present what there is of her is dark i believe well there are millions of names for dark girls we only want one or two barbara is a nice dark name is she going to be pretty her mother says she is i didnt recognize the symptoms very pretty and very clever and very highspirited her mother says is there a name for that i always call them whoppers said miss middleton how do you like alison mary that was my first idea oh i thought it was always william and mary or else victoria and albert i didnt say alice and mary stoopid i said alison a scotch name but how perfectly sweet why werent you my godfather would you have given me a napkin ring probably i will now if you like then you approve of alison mary i love it thank you very much and will you always call me alison in future i say i began in alarm im not giving that name to you its for my godchild oh no alisons are always fair youve just made that up i said suspiciously how do you know sort of instinct the worst of it is i believe youre right of course i am that settles it now what was your next idea angela angelas said miss middleton are always fair why do you want all the names to yourself you say everythings fair why can you only think of names beginning with a try another letter suppose you try now miss middleton wrinkled her brow and nibbled a lump of sugar dorothy she said at last because you can call them dolly there is only one or dodo and it isnt a bird then theres violet my good girl you dont understand any of these common names the parents could have thought of for themselves the fact that they have got me in at great expense to myself shows that they want something out of the ordinary how can i go to them and say after giving a vast amount of time to the question i have decided to call your child violet it cant be done miss middleton absently took another lump of sugar and catching my eye put it back again i dont believe that youve ever been a godfather before she said or that you know anything at all about what it is youre supposed to be going to do there was a knock at the door and the liftman came in miss middleton gave a little cough of recognition a letter sir he said thanks and as i was saying aunt alison i went on in a loud voice you are talking rubbish bah i said angrily and i threw the letter down would you like to be left alone suggested miss middleton kindly it is from the childs socalled parents and their wretched offspring is to be called violet daisy violet daisy said miss middleton solemnly trying not to smile why stop there i said bitterly why not geranium and artichoke and the whole blessed garden artichoke said miss middleton gravely is a boys name well i wash my hands of the whole business now no napkin ring from me here have i been wasting hours and hours in thought and then just when the worst of it is over they calmly step in like this i call it yes said miss middleton eagerly i call it simply yes violet daisy i finished with a great effort ii out of the hurlyburly our dance i said and its no good pretending it isnt come on said miss middleton its my favourite waltz i expect ive said that to all my partners tonight its my favourite too but youre the first person ive told the worst of having a dance in your own house said miss middleton after we had been once round the room in silence is that you have to dance with everybody have you said that to all your partners too i expect so i must have said everything dont look so reproachfully at me you are looking reproachful arent you i let go with one hand and felt my face yes i said thats how i do it well you neednt bother because none of them thought i meant them men never do i shall have to think that over by myself i said after a pause theres a lot in that which the untrained observer might miss anyhow its not at all the sort of thing that a young girl ought to say at a dance im older than you think said miss middleton oh bother i forgot you know how old i am perhaps youve been ageing lately i have this last election has added years to my life i came here to get young again i dont know anything about politics father does all the knowing in our family hes on the right side isnt he i think he is he says he is oh well he ought to know yes the truth is i came here to be liked again people and i have been saying awfully rude things to each other lately oh why do you want to argue about politics but i dont want to its a funny thing but nobody will believe me when i say that i expect its because you say it after youve finished arguing instead of before perhaps thats it i never argue with mother i simply tell her to do something and she tells me afterwards why she hasnt really i think mrs middleton has done wonderfully well considering some parents dont even tell you why they havent oh id recommend her anywhere said miss middleton confidently we dropped into silence again anyhow it was my favourite waltz you did say didnt you the first dance we had together said miss middleton dreamily that you preferred not to talk when you danced didnt i say that i should prefer to do whatever you preferred that sounds more like me i dont think it does a bit no perhaps youre right besides i remember now what i did say i said that much as i enjoyed the pleasant give and take of friendly conversation dearly as i loved even the irresponsible monologue or the biting repartee yet still more was i attached to the silent worship of the valses mazy rhythm but i went on to say but i added with surprising originality every rule has an exception you are the exception may i have two dances and then well try one of each what did i say you said sir something tells me that we shall be great friends i like your face and i like the way your tie goes under your left ear i cannot give you all the dances on the programme because i have my mother with me tonight and you know what mothers are they notice but anything up to half a dozen distributed at such intervals that ones guardians will think its the same dance you are heartily welcome to and if you care to take me in to supper there is i have the information straight from the stable a line in unbreakable meringues which would well be worth our attention thats what you said but what a memory i can remember more than that i can rememher the actual struggle i got my meringue down on the mat both shoulders touching in one minute fortythree seconds the band died slowly down until no sound could be heard above the rustle of frocks and suddenly everybody realized that it had stopped bother said miss middleton thats just like a band i said bitterly ill tell it to go on again its my band it will be your devoted band if you ask it prettily enough miss middleton went away and came back to the sound of music looking rather pleased with herself did you give him the famous smile i asked yes that one i said would you mind playing that one again please and then and then you looked as if you were just going to cry and at the last moment you smiled and said hooray and he said certainly madam isnt that right i believe youre cleverer than some of us think said miss middleton a trifle anxiously i sometimes think so too however to get back to what we were saying i came here to recover my usual calm and i shant be at all calm if im only going to get this one dance from you as an old friend of the family who has broken most of the windows i beg for another to get back to what i was saying ive simply got to do a lot of duty dances cant you take me to the zoo or the postimpressionists instead id rather do both i mean all three no i mean both well perhaps i would too you know i think youd be doing good ive had a horrible week canvassing and standing in the streets and shouting and reading leaders and arguing and saying my point is perfectly simple and and swearing and all sorts of things its awfully jolly to to feel that theres always well all this and i looked round the room to come back to isnt that beautiful miss ellison i introduced you to just now part of all this oh yes its all part but miss middleton sighed then that nice young man with the bald head will have to go without but i only said id see if i could give him one and i have seen havent i the band really stopped this time and we found a comfortable corner thats very jolly of you i said as i leant back lazily and happily now lets talk about christmas iii another milestone youre very thoughtful said miss middleton whats the matter i am extremely unhappy i confessed oh but think of foster and hobbs and woolley i thought of foster i let my mind dwell upon hobbs it was no good i am still rather sad i said why doesnt anybody love you millions adore me fiercely it isnt that at all the fact is ive just had a birthday oh i am sorry many happy thank you i thought it was tomorrow miss middleton went on eagerly and id bought a cricketing set for you but i had to send it back to have the bails sawn in two or would you rather have had a bicycle id rather have had nothing i want to forget about my birthday altogether oh are you as old as that yes i said sadly i am as old as that i have passed another landmark im what they call getting on we gazed into the fire in silence for some minutes if its any comfort to you said miss middleton timidly to know that you dont look any older than you did last week im not sure that i feel any older then except for birthdays how do you know you are older i looked at her and saw that i could trust her may i confess to you i asked but of course she cried eagerly i love confessions she settled herself comfortably in her chair make it as horrible as you can she begged i picked a coal out of the fire with the tongs and lit my cigarette i know that im getting old i said i know that my innocent youth is leaving me because of the strange and terrible things which i find myself doing oooooh said miss middleton happily to herself last monday about three oclock in the afternoon i no i cant tell you this its too awful is it very bad said miss middleton wistfully very i dont think you oh well if you must have it here it is last monday i suddenly found myself reading carefully and with every sign of interest a little pamphlet on life insurance miss middleton looked at me quickly smiled suddenly and then became very grave i appeared i went on impressively to be thinking of insuring my life have you done it no certainly not i drew back in time but it was a warning it was the writing on the wall tell me some more said miss middleton after she had allowed this to sink in well that was monday afternoon i told myself that in the afternoon one wasnt quite responsible that sometimes one was only half awake but on tuesday morning i was horrified to discover myself before breakfast doing dumbbells the smellingsalts quick said miss middleton as she closed her eyes doing dumbbells ten lunges to the east ten lunges to the west ten lunges were you reducing your figure i dont know what i was doing but there i found myself on the cold oilcloth lunging away lunging and lunging and i stopped and gazed into the fire again is that all you have to tell me said miss middleton thats the worst but there have been other little symptoms little warning notes which all mean the same thing yesterday i went into the bank to get some money as i began to fill in the cheque conscience whispered to me thats the third five pounds youve had out this week well of all the impertinence what did you do made it ten pounds of course but there you are you see whats happening this morning i answered a letter by return of post and did you notice what occurred only just now at tea of course i did said miss middleton indignantly you ate all the muffins no i dont mean that at all what i mean is that i only had three lumps of sugar in each cup i actually stopped you when you were putting the fourth lump in oh yes i said bitterly i am getting on miss middleton poked the fire vigorously about the lunges she said ten to the east ten to the west ten to the nornoreast ten to yes well i should have thought that that was just the thing to keep you young it is thats the tragedy of it i used to be young now i keep young and i used to say ill insure my life some day but now i think about doing it today when once you stop saying some day youre getting old you know some day said miss middleton you must tell me all about the crimea not now she went on quickly because youre going to do something very silly in a moment if i can think of it something to convince yourself that you are still quite young yes do let me i really think it would do me good well what can you do can i break anything i asked looking round the room i really dont think you must mothers very silly about things like that im so sorry father and i would love it of course can i go into the kitchen and frighten the cook miss middleton sighed mournfully isnt it a shame she said that mothers object to all the really nice things mrs middleton is a little difficult to please i shall give up trying directly what about blacking my face and calling on the vicar for a subscription i should laugh in church on sunday thinking of it i always do i lit another cigarette and smoked it thoughtfully i have a brilliant idea i said at last something really silly something preposterously foolish it seems to me just now the most idiotic thing i could possibly do tell me beseeched miss middleton clasping her hands i shall i said gurgling with laughter insure my life ivthe herald of summer miss middleton has a garden of which she is very proud miss middletons father says it belongs to him and this idea is fostered to the extent that he is allowed to pay for the seeds and cuttings and things he is also encouraged to order the men about but i always think of it as miss middletons garden particularly when the afternoons are hot and i see nothing but grimy bricks out of my window she knows all the flowers by name which seems to me rather remarkable i have come i announced feeling that some excuse was necessary to see the lobretias dont say that they are out i mean of course do say that they are out but i dont think we have any she said in surprise ive never heard of them what are they like theyre just the ordinary sort of flower that people point to and say thats a nice lobretia dash it youve got a garden you ought to know i am afraid smiled miss middleton that there isnt such a flower not yet perhaps somebody will invent it now theyve got the name then i suppose i must go back to london i said getting up bother stay and inspect the meter pleaded miss middleton or ask father for a subscription for the band surely you can think of some excuse for being here i will stay i said sitting down again and talk to you between ourselves it is one of the reasons why i came i thought you might like to hear all the latest news er weve started strawberries in london miss middleton sighed and shook her head but not here she said i was afraid not but i thought id remind you in case well after all what are strawberries lets talk about something else do you know that this is going to be the greatest season of history ive got a free pass to the earls court exhibition so i shall be right in the thick of it oh i thought last season was the great one it was spoilt by the coronation the papers say you remember how busy we were at the abbey we hadnt time for anything else what else do the papers say i seem to have missed them lately ive had a thousand things to do well the sardine defence league has just been formed i think of putting up for it i suppose you have to swear to do one kind action to a sardine everyday lets both join and then we shall probably get a lot of invitations do they have a tent at the eton and harrow match asked miss middleton anxiously i will inquire i wonder if there is a vicepresidency vacant i should think a vicepresident of the sardine defence league could go anywhere vpsdl said miss middleton thoughtfully it would look splendid i must remember to send you a postcard tomorrow tea came and i put my deckchair one rung up to meet it it is difficult in a horizontal position to drink without spilling anything and it looks so bad to go about covered with tea this is very jolly i said do you know that my view during working hours consists of two broken windows and fifty square feet of brick its not enough its not what i call a vista on fine days i have to go outside to see whether the sun is shining you oughtnt to want to look out of the window when youre working youll never be a mayor well it all makes me appreciate the country properly i wish i knew more about gardens tell me all about yours when are the raspberries ripe not till the end of june i was afraid youd say that may i come down and see your garden at the end of june one day when im not at earls court you can give all the gardeners a holiday that day i hate to be watched when im looking at flowers and things are you as fond of raspberries as all that why didnt i know im not a bit mad about them really but theyre a symbol of summer on a sloshy day in november as i grope my way through the fog i say to myself courage the raspberries will soon be ripe but that means that summer is half over the cuckoo is what im listening for all through november i heard it in april this year i looked round to see that nobody was within earshot i havent heard it yet i confessed it wasnt really so much to see the lobretias as to hear the cuckoo that i came to have tea with you i feel just the same about it its the beginning of everything and i said to myself miss middleton may not have a firstrate show of lobretias because possibly it is an unfavourable soil for them or they may not fit in with the colour scheme but she does know what is essential to a proper garden and shell have a cuckoo yes we do ourselves very well said miss middleton confidently well i didnt like to say anything about it before because i thought it might make you nervous and so ive been talking of other things but now that the secret is out i may say that i am quite ready i stopped and listened intently with my head on one side there was an appalling silence i dont seem to hear it i said at last but i havent heard it here yet miss middleton protested it was in hampshire the cuckoos here are always a bit late you see our garden takes a little finding it isnt so well known in in africa or wherever they come from as hampshire yes but when ive come down specially to hear it cuckoo said miss middleton suddenly and looked very innocent there that was the nightingale but its the cuckoo i really want to hear i am sorry about it if you like ill listen to you while you tell me who you think ought to play for england i cant make it more summery for you than that unless roses are any good no dont bother i said in some disappointment youve done your best we cant all have cuckoos any more than we can all have lobretias i must come again in august when one of the pioneers may have struggled here of course in hampshire cuckoo said somebody from the apple tree there cried miss middleton thats much better i said now make it come from the laburnum lieutenant im not doing it really she said at least only the first time cuckoo said somebody from the apple tree again there was no doubt about it i let my deckchair down a rung and prepared to welcome the summer now i said were off epilogue you may believe this or not as you like personally i dont know what to think it happened on the first day of spring do you remember it a wonderful day and on the first of spring all sorts of enchantments may happen i was writing my weekly story one of those things with a he and a she in it he was reginald a fine figure of a man she was dorothy rather a dear i was beginning in a roundabout sort of way with the weather and the scenery and the birds and how reginald was thinking of the spring and how his young fancy was lightly turning to thoughts of love when suddenly at that moment i was called out of the room to speak to the housekeeper about something in three minutes i was back again and i had just dipped my pen in the ink when there came a cough from the direction of the sofa and there as cool as you please were sitting two persons entirely unknown to me i beg your pardon i said the housekeeper never told me whom have i the what did you thanks said the man im reginald are you really i cried jove i am glad to see you i was just just thinking of you how are you im sick of it said reginald sick of what of being accepted by dorothy i turned to the girl you dont mean to say yes im dorothy im sick of it too dorothy i cried by the way let me introduce you reginald this is dorothy shes sick of it too thanks said reginald coldly we have met before surely not just let me look a moment no i thought not you dont meet till the next paragraph if you wouldnt mind taking a seat i shant be a moment reginald stood up look here he said do you know who i am youre just reginald i said and theres no need to stand about looking so dignified because i only thought of you ten minutes ago and if youre not careful i shall change your name to harold youre reginald and youre going to meet dorothy in the next paragraph and youll flirt with her mildly for about two columns and at the end i expect no i am almost sure that you will propose and be accepted never said reginald angrily thats what weve come about said dorothy i rubbed my forehead wearily would one of you explain i asked i cant think whats happened youre at least a paragraph ahead of me reginald sat down again and lit a cigarette its simply this he said trying to keep calm you may call me what you like but i am always the same person week after week nonsense why it was richard last week but the same person and gerald the week before gerald yes he was rather a good chap just the same only the name was different and who are we we are you as you imagine yourself to be i looked inquiringly at dorothy last week he went on you called me richard and i proposed to phyllis and i accepted him said dorothy you i said what were you doing there i should like to know last week i was phyllis the week before went on reginald i was gerald and i proposed to millicent i was millicent and i accepted him the week before that i was good heavens think of it i was george a beastly name i agree i said you gave it me yes but i wasnt feeling very well that week i was mabel put in dorothy and i accepted him no no no no dont say that i mean one doesnt accept people called george you made me did i im awfully sorry yes i quite see your point the week before went on reginald remorselessly i was dont go back into february please february is such a rotten month with me well now whats your complaint just what i said explained reginald you think you have a new hero and heroine every week but youre mistaken we are always the same and personally i am tired of proposing week after week to the same girl there was just something about reginald that i seemed to recognize just the very slightest something then who are you really i asked if youre always the same person yourself not really yourself of course but yourself as you fondly imagine you are i laughed scornfully youre nothing of the sort how ridiculous the hero of my own stories indeed myself idealized then i suppose you think youre rather a fine fellow i sneered i suppose you think i am no i dont i think you are a silly ass saying im my own hero im nothing of the sort and i suppose dorothy is me too im the girl youre in love with said dorothy idealized im not in love with any one i denied indignantly then your ideal girl ah you might well be that i smiled i looked at her longingly she was wonderfully beautiful i went a little closer to her and weve come said reginald putting his oar in again to say that were sick of getting engaged every week i ignored reginald altogether are you really sick of him i asked dorothy yes as sick of him as i am i i daresay then lets cross him out i said and i went back to the table and took up my pen say the word i said to dorothy steady on began reginald uneasily all i meant was personally as you know i said to dorothy i think hes a silly ass and if you think so too i say look here old chap dorothy nodded i dipped the pen in the ink then out he goes i said and i drew a line through him when i looked up only dorothy was there dorothy i said at last but my name isnt really dorothy you know she said with a smile its dorothy this week and last week it was phyllis and the week before then what is it really tell me so that i may know my ideal when i see her again i got ready to write the name down i dipped my pen in the ink again and i drew a line through dorothy and then i looked up questioningly at her and fool fool she was gone ii faut vivre youll see the story in one of the papers this week youll recognize it because he is called harold and she is called lucy at the end of the second column he proposes and she accepts him lucy of all names it serves them right
