chapter one moose malloy it was a warm day almost the end of march i was over on main street looking up at the sign of a second floor nightclub called florians there was a man near me looking up at the sign too his eyes dreamy and a little shiny with tears as if he was thinking of other people other times hed known there he was a big man but not much taller than six and a half feet and not much wider than a bus his hands hung at his sides in one of them was a forgotten cigar smoking between his enormous fingers passersby were looking at him he was interesting to look at too with his old gangster hat worn wool jacket with little white footballs on it for buttons a brown shirt yellow tie grey trousers and snakeskin shoes with white bits over the toes a bright yellow handkerchief the same colour as his tie was stuck in the top pocket of his jacket main street isnt the quietest dressed street in the world but even there you couldnt miss him he was like a spider on a bowl of pink icecream he stood completely still then slowly smiled and moved towards the door at the bottom of the steps up to the club he went in and the door closed behind him a couple of seconds later it burst open again outwards something flew out fast and landed between two cars on the street a young black man in a purple suit with a little white flower in his buttonhole stood up slowly making a sad sound like a lonely cat shook himself and walked painfully away down the street silence traffic started again it was none of my business at all so i walked over to the door to take a look inside a hand as big as an armchair reached out of the darkness of the door and took hold of my shoulder squeezing hard the hand picked me up and pulled me in through the door up a step or two a large face looked at me and a quiet voice said blacks in here now huh just threw one out you see me throw him out he let go of my shoulder it wasnt broken but i couldnt feel my arm i kept quiet there was talking and laughter from upstairs the voice went on quietly and angrily velma used to work here my little velma havent seen her for eight years and now this is a black place huh he took hold of my shoulder again wanting an answer i said yes it was but my voice sounded broken and weak he lifted me up a few more steps and i tried to shake myself free i wasnt wearing a gun but the big man could probably just take it away from me and eat it so it wouldnt have helped go up and see i said trying to keep the pain out of my voice he let go of me again and looked at me with his sad grey eyes yeah good idea lets you and me go on up and have a drink or two they wont serve you i told you its for blacks only up there i said but he didnt seem to hear me havent seen velma in eight years eight long years since we said goodbye and she hasnt written for six dont know why she used to work here lets go on up now huh so we went up the stairs to the club he let me walk but my shoulder still hurt and the back of my neck was wet the talking and laughter stopped dead when we walked in the silence was cold and heavy like a stone eyes looked at us heads turned a big thicknecked black with a flattened face slowly stood up straight near the bar getting ready to throw us out he came towards us my big friend waited for him silently and didnt move when the black put his hand on the front of my friends brown shirt and said no whites in here brother sorry this places for blacks only wheres velma thats all he said the big black man nearly laughed velma no velma here white boy shes not in the business any more maybe velma used to work here the big man said he spoke as if he was dreaming and take your dirty hand off my shirt that annoyed the black people didnt speak like that to him not in his job throwing drunks out of the club he took his hand off the shirt and then suddenly pulled back his arm and hit the big man hard on the side of the face he was very good at hitting people hard but this time it was a mistake the big man didnt even move he just stood there then he shook himself and took the black man by the throat he picked him up with one hand turned him in the air put his other enormous hand against the black mans back and threw him right across the room he went over a table and landed with a crash against the wall the whole room shook the black man didnt move he just lay there in the corner the big man turned to me some guys he said are stupid now lets get that drink we went over to the bar in ones and twos like shadows the other customers were moving towards the door getting out of there fast beer the big man said to the whiteeyed barman whats yours beer i said we had beers i turned and looked at the room it was empty now except for the big black man moving painfully out of the corner on his hands and knees suddenly old and out of a job the big man turned and looked too but didnt seem to see him you know where my velma is he asked the barman beautiful redhead she was sometimes sang here too we were going to get married when they sent me away sent you away i asked stupid question where dyou think ive been these last eight years he looked quite pleased with himself prison malloys my name moose malloy the great bend bank job that was me on my own too forty thousand dollars you spending it now i asked just trying to be polite he looked at me sharply i was lucky just at that moment there was a noise behind us it was the big hurt black man going through another door at the other end of the room where does that door go to moose malloy asked the frightened barman bosss office sir maybe the boss knows where my little velma is said malloy and crossed the room to the door it was locked but he shook it open with one hand went through and shut it behind him there was silence for a minute or two i drank my beer and the barman watched me then suddenly there was a short hard sound from behind the door the barman froze mouth open eyes white in the dark i started moving towards the door but it opened with a bang before i got there moose malloy came through and stopped dead a strange smile on his face he was holding a gun he came across to the bar your boss didnt know where velma is either tried to tell me with this he waved the gun at us wildly then he started towards the door and we heard his steps going down fast to the street i went through the other door to the bosss office the big black man wasnt there any more but the boss was he was in a tall chair behind a desk with his head bent right back over the back of the chair and his nose pointing up at the ceiling his neck was broken it had been a bad idea to pull that gun out when he was talking to moose malloy there was a telephone on the desk so i called the police by the time they arrived the barman had gone and i had the whole place to myself chapter two the right kind of bottle a detective named nulty took the investigation i went with him to the th street police station and we talked in a small uncomfortable room which smelled of cheap cigars nultys shirt was old and his jacket was worn he looked poor enough to be honest but he didnt look as if hed be able to face moose malloy and win he picked up my business card from the table and read it philip marlowe private investigator one of those guys huh so what were you doing while this moose malloy was breaking the black guys neck i was in the bar and he hadnt promised me he was going to break anybodys neck ok funny guy just tell me the story straight nulty didnt like my jokes so i told him about moose malloy the size of the man what he was wearing why he was there and what happened in that nightclub bar but i dont think he went in there to kill anybody i finished not dressed like that he just went there to try to find his girl this velma who used to work at florians when it was still a white place the phone rang on his desk he picked it up and listened wrote something on a piece of paper and put it down again that was information theyve got all the details on malloy i and a photo i think you should start looking for the girl malloys going to be looking for her so if you find her youll find him try velma nulty thats my advice you try her he said i laughed and started for the door hey wait a minute marlowe i stopped and looked back at him i mean if youre not too busy maybe youve got time to have a look for the girl id remember your help too you pis always need a friend down here among us boys and i wouldnt forget it not ever it was true i wasnt at all busy i hadnt had any real business for about a month even this job would make a change from doing nothing no money in it but a friend inside the police station might be useful one day thats how when id eaten some lunch and bought a bottle of good whisky i found myself driving north again on main street following an idea that was playing around in my head florians was closed of course i parked round the corner and went into a small hotel that was on the opposite side of the street from the club a man with a very old tie pinned in the middle with a large green stone was sleeping peacefully behind the desk he opened one eye and saw the bottle of good whisky standing on the counter right in front of his nose he was suddenly awake he studied the bottle carefully and he studied me he looked satisfied you want information brother youve come to the right place with the right kind of bottle he took two small glasses out from under his desk filled them both and drank one straight down yes sir certainly is the correct bottle he refilled his glass now how can i be of help to you brother theres not a hole in the road round here that i dont know by its first name i told him what had happened at florians that morning he looked at me without much surprise and just shook his head what happened to the guy who owned florians about six or eight years ago i asked him mike florian dead brother went to meet our maker five maybe six years ago drank a bit too much they said left a wife named jessie what happened to her dont rightly know brother try the phone book clever guy that why hadnt i thought of the phone book he pushed the book across the desk to me and i looked there was a jessie florian who lived at west th place i wrote down the address shook hands with the man behind the desk put the bottle back in the pocket of my jacket and went out to my car finding malloy looked so easy now too easy chapter three always yours west th place was a drylooking brown house with some drylooking brown grass in front of it some half washed clothes hung stiffly on a line to one side of the house the bell didnt work so i knocked a fat woman with a red face came to the door blowing her nose her hair was grey and lifeless mrs jessie florian wife of mike florian i asked her eyes opened in surprise why she asked mikes been dead five years now who dyou say you were im a detective i said id like some information she stared at me for a long minute then pulled the door open and turned back into the house the front room was untidy and dirty the only good piece of furniture was a handsome radio playing dance music quietly in one corner it looked new the woman sat down and i did too i sat on an empty whisky bottle in the back corner of the chair i wasnt too comfortable sitting on an empty bottle so i pulled it out and put it on the floor by my chair im trying to find a redhead used to work at your husbands place over on main street i said singer named velma i dont know her last name i thought you might be able to help me i brought out my nearlyfull bottle of whisky and put it on the arm of my chair her eyes fixed immediately on the bottle in a greedy stare i was right a little whisky was going to help me again here she got up went out to the kitchen and came back with two dirty glasses i poured her enough whisky to make her fly she took it hungrily and put it down her throat like medicine i poured her another her eyes were brighter already man this stuff dies painlessly with me she said now let me think a redhead you say yeah maybe i can help you ive got an idea she got up with some difficulty and went out towards the back part of the house the radio went on playing a love song to me there were crashing noises from the room at the back a chair had fallen over i got up and walked quietly over i looked round the edge of the open door she was standing in front of a large open box full of old books and pictures and envelopes she took one envelope fatter than the others and quickly hid it down one side of the box then she picked up some others shut the box and started back to the front room i was sitting listening to the music by the time she got there she gave me a bright smile and handed me the old envelopes then she took the whisky bottle and went back to nurse it in her chair i opened the envelopes one by one and looked through the old shiny blackandwhite photographs of singers and dancers and oldtime jokers that were in them one or two of them might have had red hair you couldnt tell from the photographs why am i looking at these i asked her she was having some trouble pouring the whisky into the glass now looking for velma you said could be one of those girls she was playing games with me laughing at me while she finished my whisky i stood up walked across the room and into the back room where the box was there was an angry shout behind me i reached down the side of the box pulled out the fatter envelope and went back into the front room she was standing in the middle of the floor her eyes angry and dangerous sit down i said you arent playing games with moose malloy now its not that easy this time moose what about moose the name had frightened her hes out of prison and looking for his girlwith a gun hes already killed one guy who didnt want to tell him where velma is she went white lifted the bottle to her mouth and poured the rest of the whisky straight down her throat a lovely old woman i liked being with her i opened the envelope in my hand and took out an old picture of a pretty girl in a funny hat with hair that might have been red it was signed always yours velma valento i held it up in front of the old woman why hide it i asked why is it different from the others where is she i put the photograph back into the envelope and put the envelope into my pocket shes dead she was a good girl velma was but shes dead now get out of here im old and im sick get out she suddenly lifted the empty bottle and threw it at me it went off into a corner and banged against a wall then she sat down in her chair closed her eyes and went to sleep the radio was still playing in the corner i went out to my car and drove back to the th street police station to nultys smelly little office nutty was sitting there looking at a police photograph of moose malloy i told him about my visit to the hotel on main street and to mrs florian with my bottle of whisky i told him about the dirty house and the new sixtydollar radio in the front room there and i showed him the photograph of velma valento nice he said but whats happened to her dead thats what the florian woman said but then why did she hide the photo i think shes afraid of moose i think shes afraid that moose thinks shes the person who told the police about his bank job and got him put away in prison for eight years somebody told them maybe he knows who it was maybe he wants to find that person but its your job to find out whats happening here i said im going home hey you arent leaving me in this mess are you he asked whats the hurry no hurry at all i said but theres nothing more i can do i walked to the door and out nulty didnt even say goodbye chapter four purissima canyon i was back in my office at about fourthirty when the phone rang a cool voice said philip marlowe the private detective i said yes maybe the voice introduced itself my names lindsay marriott i live at cabrillo street id be very happy if you could come and discuss something with me this evening ill be there i said i needed a job what time he said seven so i watched the sunlight dancing on my desk until almost seven had a word or two with nulty on the phone when he rang to see if i had any new ideas i hadnt and then i went out to cabrillo street it was dark by the time i got there cabrillo street was a dozen or so houses hanging onto the side of a mountain by the beach with the pacific ocean crashing in below them there were two hundred and eighty steps up from the street to marriotts house so i had to sit down for a few minutes at the top and try to start breathing quietly again before i knocked on the door it opened silently and i was looking at a tall man with fair hair wearing a white suit with a blue flower in its buttonhole yes he said its exactly seven and here i am i answered and you are hed forgotten all about me philip marlowe i said same as i was this afternoon i didnt think i liked this guy ah yes quite right he stepped back and said coldly come in the carpet was so thick it almost swallowed my shoes on the way through to the livingroom where marriott arranged himself on a yellow sofa and lit a french cigarette i lit a camel and waited i asked you to come because i have to pay some money to two men tonight and i thought i should have someone with me he said eventually you carry a gun sometimes i said but i dont often shoot people blackmail is it certainly not im simply buying something and ill be carrying a lot of money since i dont know these men i thought but they know you do they ii dont know im doing this for a friend you see how much money and what for i asked i didnt like his smile he was lying to me why dont you just tell me the whole story mr marriott if im going to hold your hand tonight i think i should know why he didnt like that but in the end i got the full story three men had stolen a valuable diamond ring from his friend without a name a few nights before when she was coming home from a restaurant in the city and now they were selling it back for eight thousand dollars he had spoken to one of the men on the phone two or three times to help his friend and now he was waiting for another call to tell him where to meet them tonight with the money so why did you only call me this afternoon mr marriott that worries me and why did you choose me who told you about me he laughed no one told me about you i picked your name from the phone book and i only decided to take someone with me this afternoon i hadnt thought of it before so whats the plan i asked do i hide in the back of the car and what do i do if these guys pull out a gun and shoot you or knock you on the head take your eight thousand and run nothing i could do would stop them these guys are robbers marriott theyre hard i think i should walk away from this job marriott but im stupid so i wont ill come with you but ill drive the car and ill carry the money and you do the hiding in the back of the car ok he shook his head and looked unhappy but in the end he agreed then the phone rang marriotts face went white as he took the call he listened i could hear a voice talking at the other end but i couldnt hear the words purissima canyon i know itright he put the phone down you ready marlowe lets go i had never heard of purissima canyon but marriott said it was quite near and that we had to be there in twelve minutes he gave me an envelope with all that money in it i stuck it in my pocket and we left fog had come in from the ocean now so i drove marriotts big foreign car quite slowly we found purissima canyon without difficulty it was a quiet lonely place in the hills behind the city no houses no lights it was as dark as a midnight church i stopped at the end of the dirt road and switched off the engine stay there i whispered to marriott hidden in the back of the car your friends may be waiting off the road here ill take a look i got out and walked along a small path down the hill i stopped suddenly and stood in the dark listening not a sound i turned to go back to the car still nothing no one here i whispered into the back of the car could be a trick he didnt answer there was a quick movement just behind my head and afterwards i thought i may have heard the sound of the stick in the air before it hit my head maybe you always think that afterwards i opened my eyes and looked up at the stars i was lying on my back i felt sick all i could hear was insects in the night i stood up carefully my hat was still on my head i took it off and felt underneath it a bit soft and painful on one side but still working well enough good old head id had it a long time and i could still use it well a little at least i turned to look for the car but it was gone the envelope with the eight thousand dollars was gone too i started to walk slowly back along the dark road suddenly i saw the dark shape of the car in front of me round a corner it was silent lightless all the doors shut i went up to it lit a match and looked inside while the match was burning empty no marriott no blood no bodies nothing suddenly i heard the sound of a cars engine i didnt jump more than three feet in the aid lights cut through the darkness coming down the road towards me the lights stopped for a minute just round the next corner then they came on down the road i hid behind marriotts car the lights came on down the hill and stopped right in front of marriotts car there was a laugh a girls laugh a strange sound in that place then a girls voice said all right i can see your feet come out with your hands nice and empty ive got a gun on your ankles i came up slowly hands up and looked straight at the light shining in my face ok dont move who are you is that your car the voice asked but she sounded a bit frightened like me why did you stop up the road there i asked so you ask the questions huh she said well i was looking at a man tall with fair hair not any more she said quietly might have had fair hair once i didnt say anything for a moment then i said all right lets go and look at him im a private investigator marlowes the name philip marlowe my cards in my wallet shall i get it out and show you no you just walk in front of me and well go and take a look at whats left of your friend i turned away from the light and went on up the dusty road round the corner the girl with the gun was right behind me chapter five dont call me annie she shone her light on the body his fair hair was dark with blood now and more of it ran from the corner of his mouth he wasnt pretty to look at i went through his pockets but there was nothing very interesting just coins and keys a small knife someones business card that sort of thing i put the business card in my pocket might be useful later the girl watched you shouldnt do that she said then somebody must have hated him to do that to him somebody yeah but it wasnt me so who was it i didnt think it was you she replied could have been you couldnt it i dont know what are you doing out here alone at this time of night and whats your name my names riordan anne and dont call me annie i just go out for a drive sometimes at night i like these hills at night theyre peaceful well usually they are i saw a light down here and thought it was odd so i came down to see you do take some chances miss riordan a young lady out in these hills alone at night going down a dark valley to investigate i had a gun and what happened to your head she was shining her light right at me now you dont look too good mr marlowe i think i should get you out of here id be grateful if youd drive me to my car its at cabrillo street near the beach he lived there i pointed down at marriotts body sure but shouldnt someone stay with him and shouldnt we call the police she asked no i said not yet id like time to think about this first so we got into her little car and she drove me out of there my head hurt we didnt talk then she said you need a drink come back to my place and clean yourself up have a drink and call the police from there its just over on west th thanks i said but i should get back to my car i didnt want her mixed up in this thing so she drove me back to the bottom of the steps up to marriotts house where i had left my car i got out said thanks and gave her my card then i went over to the west los angeles police station on my own feeling cold and sick it was an hour and a half later they had taken marriotts body away and i had told my story three times to a man named randall the back of my head was hurting i sat there looking at the cigarette between my fingers and felt about eighty years old randall said coldly your story sounds silly marlowe we went through the whole thing again detail by detail and randall came up with some ideas about the murder which i didnt like they werent right i told him he didnt like that either but in the end he let me go home the fog had completely cleared now i wanted a drink badly but the bars were all closed i drove home fast i got up at nine the next morning drank three cups of black coffee and read the morning papers there was a short piece about moose malloy but nothing about lindsay marriott i was just leaving when the phone rang it was nulty and he sounded annoyed marlowe whatre you doing on malloy nothing ive got a headache you mean you havent got him yet he hung up without answering i drove over to my office opened the outside door and went in anne riordan looked up from the magazine she was reading and smiled at me in daylight her hair was a rich red colour she had grey eyes a small cheeky nose and a wide mouth she had a nice smile it was a face i thought i would like pretty but not beautiful i opened the inside door and she followed me through into my office sat down and took one of my cigarettes you probably didnt think youd see me again so soon hows your head ill live were the police nice to you same as usual i left you out of my story dont know why because they might be nasty to me and because i might be useful to you do you want to know who marriotts friend was the lady who lost her valuable ring i froze i hadnt said anything to her about the ring marriott was trying to get back for his friend i didnt say anything about a ring last night i said slowly so youd better tell me what you know and how you know it my father was a police officer hes dead now but it was easy for me to find out that randall is investigating the marriott murder and i went over to see him he told me then i went over to the best jewellers shop in town and asked the manager there i told him i was a writer wanting to do a piece about famous and expensive diamonds he told me the name of that diamond and who it belongs to easy you see it belongs to a very rich lady in bay city a mrs grayle shes much younger than her husband and is very beautiful she sometimes runs around town with other men like lindsay marriott i found out that last bit from a friend in one of the newspapers he gave me a photo of mrs grayle too look she pushed a photograph of a young woman across my desk i looked at it beautiful about thirty years old mrs grayle had it all so i called mrs grayle and said i was your secretary shell see you this afternoon she wants to get her diamond ring back and she might want you to help her do that you have been busy havent you i said she looked serious and hurt yes i could certainly get to like that face a lot i thought i smiled at her listen anne killing marriott was a stupid mistake i dont think this gang meant to murder him at all they wanted the money for the ring thats all and i guess its all right if i try to help mrs grayle get the ring back now that the gang have got their money for it she nodded youre wonderful she said softly but youre crazy the word hung in the air as she got up went very quickly to the door and out i sat and thought about things then i took out that business card i had taken from marriotts pocket last night and looked at it plain and expensivelooking with the name jules amthor on it and under that the word psychiatrist no address just a stillwood heights phone number there was something about mr amthor and his card found in a dead mans pocket that wasnt quite right could be interesting i thought so i picked up the phone and tried the stillwood heights number chapter six a glass of something golden a womans voice answered dry and foreignsounding no she said i couldnt speak to mr amthor but she could take a message and maybe amthor could see me next week i spelled out my name address and phone number for her and then said i wanted to see amthor about lindsay marriott i spelled that for her too i said i wanted to see her boss soon soon fast she understood i hung up and poured myself a drink from the office bottle ten minutes later she called back and said amthor would see me at six that evening that hed send a car to fetch me i was halfway to the lift on my way to get some lunch when an idea hit me i stopped and pushed my hat back on my head before going back into the office and calling a man i knew i wanted to find out who owned old jessie florians house on west th place he could help me he called me back about three minutes later with the answer man named lindsay marriott he said i think i thanked him put the phone down and sat staring at the wall for a couple of minutes then i went down to the coffee shop ate lunch got my car out of the carpark and drove east again to west th place i didnt have a bottle with me this time i went first to the house next door where an old woman lived and watched everything in the street from her windows she would have some answers i asked her if a big man had been into mrs florians house the day before and she described moose malloy to me exactly she also said mrs florian always received a letter by special delivery on the first day of every month tomorrow was the first of april april fools day i asked her to be sure to notice if the special letter came as usual thanked her and walked across to the house next door no one answered when i knocked and rang i tried again no answer the door was open so i went inside the radio was turned off but mrs florian was there in the bedroom in bed she opened her eyes slowly and looked at me good afternoon mrs florian i said are you sick you get him she answered who the moose no not yet but we will why you frightened of him no answer to that i put a camel in my mouth and waited one thing i said after a minute or two i found out who owns this house lindsay marriott her body went stiff under the bedclothes like wood her eyes froze suddenly she threw back the covers and sat up with her eyes flaming and pointed a little gun at me but i was too quick for her i stepped backwards through the door and out think about it mrs florian i shouted back over my shoulder i went out of the house fast but nothing happened she probably couldnt walk straight enough to follow me and shoot me in the back i drove away i went to see nulty at the th street police station you he said as i came in the door i thought you werent helping me with the malloy investigation any more you still got that picture of velma valento its really mine and id like to keep it i said he found it under some papers and gave it to me i put it in my pocket and left nulty looking hopeless and helpless behind his desk the phone was ringing as i walked back into my office it was the rich and beautiful mrs grayle marriotts friend who had lost her diamond ring so carelessly and she wanted to see me as soon as possible she gave me her address aster drive bay city i was there almost before she had said goodbye aster drive was full of nice big houses near the ocean the man at the gate of the grayles place was ugly and unfriendly but he let me in eventually and i parked next to the five or six cars in the driveway the house itself wasnt much smaller than buckingham palace i rang the doorbell a manservant opened it and showed me into a large expensive room the three people in there stopped talking when i came in one of them was anne riordan holding a glass of something golden in one hand another was an older man with a sad face and the third was mrs grayle she was better than her photograph perfect a dream in fact and she was giving me an interesting smile nice of you to come mr marlowe she said this is my husband i shook hands with mr grayle and smiled at anne riordan wondering what she was doing there mr grayle poured me a whisky and then left anne riordan said she had to be going too she left too without another look at me do you think you can help me mrs grayle asked id be so happy if you could help i was so shocked to hear about lin marriott poor lin who knew the true value of that diamond ring i asked did he ive wondered about that she replied her face getting a hard look on it he was with me that night so he knew i was wearing the diamond on my hand all evening and what happened out there how did these guys take it off you they must have followed us from the trocadero where we had dinner lin was driving we were in a dark street when suddenly a car passed us fast and just hit the side of our car then stopped in front of us a tall thin man in a coat with his hat low over his face got out and pulled a gun on us another man came up on the other side of our car and took my jewellery and my handbag they gave my bag back after going through it then they left and we went home the next day i got a call from one of them and lin agreed to talk to them for me i think you know the rest of it yeah all except the blackmail marriott was a blackmailer wasnt he he was blackmailing you wasnt he you dont have to tell me why she stopped to think yes he was she said slowly he lived from blackmailing rich women like me i had some of the story but she wanted to meet me later that evening at a club in town there was more to tell me i drove out of the gate waving to the ugly man there and stopped just outside when i saw anne riordans car standing at the side of the street she gave me a nice smile who told you marriott played his ladyfriends for money i asked her just a guess she said you probably want me to stay out of this business dont you but i thought i was helping a little sorry if i wasnt it was nice to know you anyway and she started her car and drove away fast down the street i watched her go it was nearly six when i reached my office again i lit a cigarette and sat down to wait chapter seven the house on the hill the man smelled i could smell him from the other side of my office when he came in mr jules amthors driver he gave me one of mr amthors cards but i had seen one before in a more interesting place he also gave me a hundred dollars from mr amthor that was interesting i locked the office and the man drove me over to stillwood heights getting green lights all the way some guys are lucky like that we drove up a long driveway with bright red flowers down the sides and stopped in front of a large lonely house right on top of the hill the man opened the door for me and i got out he led me into the house into a lift where his smell was even worse than before and up there was a desk with a woman behind it when we stopped and the doors opened she was the owner of the voice on the telephone i gave her the hundred dollars sorry it was a nice thought but i cant take this i have to know what the job is before i take any money for it she nodded stood up and pressed a button on the wall a hidden door opened noiselessly and closed again after i had gone through it without her there was nobody in the dark room i was now in i stood for thirty seconds wondering if someone was watching me then another door opened quietly on the other side of the room and a tall thin straight man in a black suit walked in quickly and sat down on a chair by a table in the middle of the room how can i help you he asked his eyes deep and very black seemed to look at me without seeing me without feeling anything you seem to forget why i came i said by the way i gave that hundred dollars back to your secretary i wanted to know why your card was found in the pocket of a dead man last night his face didnt change there are things i do not know he said after a second or two and this is one of them anybody can take one of my cards i almost believed him almost but not quite then why did you send me a hundred dollars i asked my dear mr marlowe he said coldly i am not a fool i am in a difficult business always in danger from doctors who do not believe in my work as a psychiatrist i like to know why people are asking questions about me so i told him the whole story of my meeting with marriott and about marriotts murder nothing changed in his face then i had another idea i asked do you know a mrs grayle too by any chance he did she had seen him about some problem once thats what i liked about this job everyone knew everyone marriott grayle and now amthor i was sitting there feeling pleased with myself when suddenly all the lights went out the room was as dark as death i kicked my chair back and stood up but it was no good i was too slow i smelled the man behind me just before he took me by the throat and lifted me into the air i stopped breathing the only good thing about that was that i couldnt smell him any more a voice said softly let him breathe a little the fingers round my throat loosened and i fought my way free from them just in time for something hard to hit me on the mouth i tasted blood the voice said get him on his feet stupid man i think he can stand on his own now the lights went on again and the arms dropped away i stood shaking my head trying to think straight then i went for the smile on amthors face with everything i had in my right arm it wasnt too bad i hit the smile straight in the middle amthor looked surprised very angry and hurt suddenly there was a gun in his hand sit down fool he said pointing it at me blood was coming out of his nose i sat down near the table suddenly everything in my head went black maybe i went to sleep just like that with the nasty thin man in the black suit pointing his gun at me i wasnt too sure when i thought about it later when i woke up i was in a small room with white walls and no window my throat felt as if someone had jumped on it and i couldnt see clearly it was as if there was smoke in front of my eyes filling the room i was in a bed i began to remember things amthor and the man who smelled breaking amthors nose that made me feel better but then they must have given me some sort of drug to knock me out or to make me talk and now i was having a hard time coming out of it i sat up on the bed and put my feet on the floor i started to walk across the little room it wasnt easy it was as if i had drunk too much but slowly the smoke started to clear from in front of my eyes i walked and walked and walked round the room with my knees shaking but my head getting clearer all the time there was a bottle of whisky on a small table in one corner but it smelled funny more drugs in it maybe so i didnt take a drink but i could use it another way i picked it up went over to the door and shouted fire fire steps came running a key was pushed into the lock and the door jumped open i was flat against the wall to one side and i hit him with the bottle as he came in a small square strong man in a white coat another friendly psychiatrist maybe he was out cold on the floor with funnysmelling whisky and pieces of broken bottle all over him i went through his pockets and took his keys then i tied him to the bed with his white coat one of his keys opened the cupboard in the corner of the room and all my clothes were in there so was my gun but someone had kindly taken all the bullets out of it i locked the man in the room and went quietly across the carpet listening to the silence of the house and holding the empty gun in front of me there was an open door with a light on in the room just in front of me i heard a man cough very carefully i looked into the room he was reading a newspaper i could only see the side of his face he needed a shave but mr moose malloy was having a nice comfortable time hiding in this place wherever it was it was time for me to get out though to go far away fast so i left him there and moved quietly on i walked on quietly through the empty house past rooms with white walls and medicine bottles and metal tables with instruments on them i saw a clock which told me it was almost midnight but i didnt meet any of the lovely people who worked in the place at last i came to the front door it wasnt locked i walked out into the night it was a cool night no moon the house was on the corner of a street the sign said descanso street i started to walk as fast as i could listening for the scream of police cars coming to take me back there but nothing happened i knew i was somewhere near the address anne riordan had told me for her apartment at th street i worked my way across the streets towards it and then realized i was still holding my gun in my hand i put it away fast and kept on walking the fresh air helped i started to feel a bit better the light was still on at number so i rang the bell a voice from behind the door said who is it marlowe the door opened and anne riordan stood there looking at me her eyes went wide and frightened my god she cried you look like a ghost chpater eight brains behind the business i was halfsitting and halflying in a deep chair in her comfortable livingroom with its pleasant furniture and curtains anne sat opposite her eyes dark and full of worry she had made me three cups of black coffee and two eggs with some toast and i had told her some of the story but not all of it i had not told her the bit about moose malloy amthors a nasty hard guy i said but i dont think hes clever enough to be the brains of a jewel gang perhaps im wrong but my guess is that i wouldnt have got out of his little hospital if he was boss of a gang like that id be dead but hes frightened of something isnt he he doesnt like the questions youre asking i nodded i think marriott carried amthors card in his pocket that night exactly because he wanted it to be found if anything happened to him so we know that the jewel robbery had something to do with marriotts murder and im beginning to think amthor had something to do with the jewel robbery but i dont think hes the top man her smile was warm but as sharp as a razor at the same time i forgot you were such a great detective you get blood all over your face you get yourself locked up in a hospital for two days shot full of drugs and after all that you arrive at the most obvious answer wonderful i stood up yeah im a little slow and tired tonight would you be kind enough to drive me to a taxi stand i need a good nights sleep so that i can think out a better answer and i dont want to stay anywhere too near those guys in that hospital people round there dont seem to like me too much she went quiet you could stay here and you promise youll lock your door she went red and stood up sometimes i think youre the greatest thing ive ever seen and sometimes i think youre the worst the lowest youre sick she walked out of the room fast and came back with her coat on her red hair looking as angry as her face she drove me all the way home silent and angry and when she dropped me at the door of my apartment she said goodbye in a frozen voice she drove away before i had my keys out of my pocket in the morning i felt a lot better my head still hurt and my tongue still felt dry and sticky inside my mouth but i had known worse mornings my left foot felt fine it didnt hurt at all so i kicked the corner of the bed with it on my way to the bathroom i was just calling myself some very rude names when there was a loud knock on the door police detective randall stood there brown suit hat very clean and tidy and a nasty look in his eye he pushed the door and i stood back he came in and looked around whereve you been marlowe wanted to talk to you ive been sick in a hospital i lit a cigarette and i havent had my morning coffee yet im not feeling too friendly i thought i told you to keep out of this investigation leave it alone didnt i i could make trouble for you but i havent you know why yeah you couldnt find me very slowly he took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket trying to control himself his hand was shaking when he lit his match i went out to the kitchen to make some coffee he didnt like that either but he followed me out this jewel gang has been around hollywood for the last ten years he said this time they went too far killed a man i think i know why i got the cream from the refrigerator poured two cups of coffee and we sat down was that a joke about being in hospital he asked no i ran into some trouble over at stillwood heights and some kind people put me in a hospital just over the line in bay city place for drink and drugs problems nice little place shot me full of drugs and kept me there for two days until i woke up and walked out to see a friend bay city he said man named jules amthor why did you take that card marlowe you should have told me about it you see your friend over in bay city the redhead she told me she likes you she was hoping to help you out of a tight corner with me her father was a police officer remember ah hell trying to help me nice girl not my type though he smiled his first smile of the day he probably only let himself have four smiles a day i could see he didnt believe me so i went on this is what i think if its any use to you randall i think marriott was a blackmailer of rich women mrs grayle told me so but i think he was also the finger man for the jewel gang the boy who could point them in the right direction tell them where the really expensive pieces were and exactly when and where to move in on his lady friends when he took them out to dinner you see in this grayle robbery marriott had taken mrs grayle to the trocadero and he was driving the car on their way home he could choose the streets they took and the gang could follow i think they killed marriott because people were starting to put two and two together about him and the answer was four he wasnt useful to them any more so this was his last job for them but marriott guessed something was going wrong and got frightened he asked me to go along with him and he had the little trick of amthors card in his pocket he was trying to show us who the real brains behind the business were a guy quite nasty enough and clever enough and also a guy who could get information about rich women when they came to talk to him about their problems a very friendly psychiatrist and marriotts trick with amthors card worked too didnt it i think your ideas about marriott may be right he said but you havent told me the whole story everything you know have you marlowe marriott had twentythree thousand dollars in the bank thats a lot of money but theres also the little matter of that nice house he owned up on west th place number that interest you at all he picked up a spoon and started to turn it in his hand i didnt answer just looked at him he went on you see i can put two and two together as well marlowe and that brings a large exprisoner called moose malloy into the picture doesnt it im listening i said so i called up detective nulty who i hear is investigating that one and he told me you were trying to find a girl called velma something malloys girl he said youd been to see a woman by the name of jessie florian and her address was guess where west th place the place marriott i owned so here i am early this sunny morning asking you a few questions and youre not helping me much i went over to my jacket hanging on the back of a chair i wondered if theyd taken my two photos out at the hospital place but they were both still there the one of velma valento from mrs florians box and the one of mrs grayle which anne riordan had given me i gave the one of velma to randall first he studied it carefully then i put the one of mrs grayle next to it he looked at it and nodded for twenty million id marry her myself he said theres another thing i ought to tell you i said this hospital i was in down on descanso in bay city theyre running a hiding place for gangsters there too i saw moose malloy there last night in a room randall sat very still watching me sure he asked i didnt make a mistake i said even though i was full of drugs it was him all right he stood up lets go and see this mrs florian together you and me i told him everything i knew about this business while we were on our way chpater nine the montecito the old woman in the house next door was still watching everything that moved in the street and her eyes were just as sharp as ever she didnt have anything new to tell us so we walked across to the next house the same washing was still hanging stiffly on the washing line at the side of the house there was no answer when we rang the bell and none when we knocked at the door the door was locked this time we went round to the back door that was locked too but randall kicked it open and we walked past a row of empty whisky bottles in the kitchen into the livingroom the place smelled horrible the radio was off nice radio said randall mrs florian was in the bedroom she hadnt been dead for very long long enough to be completely dead though randall looked at her this was done the quiet way he said just one large pair of hands round her neck enormous hands look at the marks on her neck you look at them i said and turned away feeling ill again we went back to randalls office at the police station and randall made me make a full report on the story i had told him in the car and on the murder we had found at west th place i signed four copies now let me tell you something marlowe he said sitting back in his chair her neck was broken first and then the murderer started to hit her why did he hit her when she was already dead answer he was angry with her a thousand dollars was paid to the person who gave malloys name to the police after the great bend bank job eight years ago and i think the florians got some of that money malloy may have thought the same thing maybe he was just trying to make her tell him who gave the police his name it was malloy who killed her all right even if it was a mistake perhaps hes just too strong perhaps i answered now heres some advice for you marlowe from a friend he used another one of his four smiles for the day on me go home and forget this whole investigation completely leave it alone if you dont youll find yourself deep in trouble you wont be able to climb out of understand i said i understood he looked at me for ten seconds then he smiled again he was doing a lot of smiling that day enough for a whole week i stood up and said goodbye went home to get my car and ate some lunch in hollywood before i drove over to bay city it was a beautiful afternoon sunny but cool i went to see the chief of police a fat man named john wax who sat doing nothing in a big office marked private i told him i was working for mrs grayle and that i was trying to find out more about jules amthor the psychiatrist and about the odd hospital for drink and drugs problems right there under his nose in bay city could he help it was the name grayle which made him sit up straight in his chair he asked me to go and lock the door pulled out a bottle from somewhere in his desk and poured two drinks he looked hurt as he drank his drink but in the end he agreed to help me in any way he could he sent a man down with me to look at the hospital on descanso street it was a pleasant place by daylight with a garden full of flowers of all sorts it was quiet and still in the early afternoon sun outside two men were studying at tall tree as if they were wondering how to move it and another was sitting in a car down the street reading a newspaper my friendly bay city policeman just drove straight past the house he wasnt smiling los angeles police what the hell are they doing down here this is our part of town our side of the line the chief wont be pleased he drove round the next corner and stopped who are the big guys in crime down here in bay city i asked him what kind of problems do you face down here he didnt answer straight away then he said very quietly so that i could only just hear man named laird brunette runs this town runs all the crime in bay city owns those two gambling ships out in the ocean there too just beyond where we can reach them we cant touch his gambling business or any other business out there he stopped hed said enough his eyes started to worry that hed said too much thanks i said and gave him my hand he had given me my next idea i found a hotel room down by the waterfront in bay city and waited until it was dark i could hear people talking together and cars passing along the street outside i thought about the whole story of malloy and velma marriott and the beautiful mrs grayle the attractive miss anne riordan the slow and stupid nulty the fat and lazy john wax and the clever and deadly detective randall i thought of psychiatrists and jewel gangs and hard men who took me by the throat and tried to stop me breathing i thought about a lot of things it got darker i needed a drink i needed a holiday in the sun i needed a home in the country and i needed a friend but all i had was a coat and a hat and a gun i got up washed my face and got ready for the nights work in front of me outside i walked slowly along the seafront and back again watching the faces in the crowd and the lights of the two gambling ships out there on the dark ocean a hamburger seller was shouting get hungry friends get hungry nice fat hamburgers here get hungry i stopped and asked him the names of the two ships montecito and royal crown he said looking at me with careful eyes why are you interested i laughed and waited while he served a young couple with hamburgers then he came close and said quietly you want to hide out there itd cost you a lot friend not less than fifty to take you out there the montecito is the one youd want i left him wondering why i had asked him at all and walked further along the seafront found a place to have dinner and sat down with a drink the dinner tasted like a postmans sack and the waiter looked as if hed cut my throat for a dollar but the drink was good i took a watertaxi out to the montecito for a quarter of a dollar it was a long way out over the dark sea i stared at the orange lights of bay city getting further and further away disappearing now and then as the boat rode down between two waves when we arrived a darkeyed young man in a blue jacket stepped in front of me as i went up the steps sorry mister no guns on the boat its part of my clothes i told him im here to see mr brunette on business never heard of him he said with a face like stone get back in the taxi and get on your way fast were not in bay city now were not even in california so move i got back in the boat blue jacket watched me with a silent smile the taximan didnt say a word the whole way back as i got off at the waterfront he handed me a quarter dollar some other night maybe he said in a tired voice there was a very big guy with red hair dirty shoes and torn sailors trousers in the crowd waiting for the next taxi he didnt fit in at all as i went past him he took my elbow i stopped whats the matter with you i asked i wasnt feeling polite even though he was three inches taller than me and heavier too couldnt get onto the ship he asked between his teeth trouble getting on with that gun under your coat huh he looked up and down the waterfront i can help maybe can be done you know fifty dollars i started to walk away but he kept hold of my elbow ok twentyfive for a friend i dont have any friends i said and walked away he didnt try to stop me he followed me slowly along the waterfront through the crowds i stopped to watch some people playing bingo and he came up next to me a handsome guy with blue eyes as big as moose malloy but he looked younger and faster on his feet he said into my ear whats your business private investigation i was on the police here once i can recognize guys like you he smiled know a man named brunette then i asked the smile stayed on his face i can borrow a very quiet boat friend and theres a place along there with no lights where we can leave and come in again without anyone seeing us he pointed along the waterfront with his chin i know where theres a delivery door on the montecito which you can open and get in too i got my wallet out and gave him twentyfive in new notes he disappeared quietly among the crowd with a smile give me ten minutes my names red was all he said the noise of the bars and crowds died away behind me and i found the nice dark place along the waterfront ten minutes later with no trouble there were some steps down to the sea i went down them as carefully as a cat and a big black shape suddenly appeared out of the darkness next to me he pointed down to a boat riding on the sea with its engine going almost noiselessly and said ok get in we moved out into the blackness of the sea and the wave again it was not the happiest moment of my life as we went out across the dark water i told this big friendly giant why i was there that i wanted to talk to a man called laird brunette that i wanted to find an exprisoner and murderer called moose malloy who might be hiding out on the montecito i told him more than i meant to but he listened and thought a bit and then said yeah brunette runs all the gambling the drugs and the women in this town maybe he runs that hospital they put you in too but i just dont think brunette would be behind that jewel robbery you were talking about hes big time and thats too small i dont think he had anything to do with that and i dont think brunette would hide a man like malloy he said unless theres something other than money behind it which is worrying him he moved his hands on the wheel of the boat and said i dont like these guys at all i really hate them in fact so i had a friend we moved quietly in towards the enormous black side of the montecito there were two big iron doors in the side of the ship just higher than our little boat we stopped near them and rode up and down on the waves listening everything was quiet except the sound of water and the music up above us chapter ten my little velma red threw a rope up over the side of the montecito and pulled himself up quietly to the two iron doors there was a sound of metal over my head and then i started up the rope it was the longest journey ive ever made it finished inside the oily bittersmelling darkness of the ship with rats running across the boxes and ropes on the floor a voice next to my ear said quietly from here we go straight up through the engineroom therell probably be one guy in there might have a gun but thats no problem then ill show you the way up to the gambling rooms thats where youre going to find brunette ill wait for you in the engineroom you may need some help up there you got family on this ship or something i asked but he was already in front of me the rats running away from his enormous feet in the darkness the man in the engineroom was no problem as red had promised he hit him hard once and caught him as he fell then he showed me the stairs up to the music and the people how long will you be he asked dont know an hour or less i guess but dont wait for me get out now im going to make some trouble on this ship and i went away up the steps i came out on an open walkway on the ocean side of the ship there was a man with a small machinegun in the shadows there i went up behind him silently and put my gun in his back i have a very loud gun i said but it doesnt have to go off all i want is to talk to brunette now why dont you show me the way nice and peacefully he took a moment or two to think about all that then he said ok follow me across to that door were going down to the offices past the gambling tables we went into the bright lights inside the ship and through the gambling rooms where sixty or seventy people were trying not to lose their shirts i put my gun away under my coat as we went two quiet men in black dinner jackets came through a door on the other side of a bar and came towards us people round here dont seem to follow their orders the short one said youre brunette i said suddenly of course he turned and opened a door behind him in here we can talk more easily i followed him through into a comfortable small office with photographs on the tables and a small private bar in one corner he sat down he has a gun brunette said a hand took the gun away from me and put it down on brunettes desk anything more boss a voice asked not now he turned to me and said who are you and what do you want my names marlowe im a private detective and i want to talk to a man called moose malloy im investigating a murder the murder of a man named marriott that murder has something to do with another one of an old woman which was done by malloy malloy was staying at a hospital for drug problems over in bay city hiding from the law and now hes disappeared i think he could be hiding here on your nice gambling boat youre simple brunette said why should i hide gangsters here im in another business sorry but i cant do anything for you but id like to know how you got onto my ship i just cant remember you do take some terrible chances mr marlowe he smiled a nasty cold smile just give this to malloy first i said and i reached across his desk took a card and wrote five words on it itll mean something important to him ok he said if i can get this to malloy i will i dont know why im doing it for you he pushed my gun back across the desk to me and stood up but i promise nothing marlowe he put out his hand and i shook it i went back to bay city the ordinary way in a watertaxi there was already a new man at the top of the steps blue jacket was gone i wondered if he was already dead or working down in the engineroom for letting me get onto his bosss ship with my gun back on the waterfront i found red get your man he asked no but i think brunette will find a way to get a message to him for me could take hours could take days i might never find him alive i drove back to my apartment in hollywood and called the grayle number mrs grayle agreed to come over to my apartment and go out somewhere for a drink then i lay down on my bed and tried not to go to sleep i failed though i could have slept for a week i woke up slowly and stared at the light of the lamp on the ceiling something moved gently in the room moose malloy with a gun in his hand and his hat pushed back on his head he saw me open my eyes glad you came over i said your door wasnt locked so i came on in you waiting for visitors a lady she may not come but id prefer to talk to you a smile touched the corners of his mouth id like to talk about the killing of a woman jessie florian i think that was a bad mistake you didnt mean to kill her you just wanted her to tell you something thats all isnt it you wanted her to tell you where velma was but she didnt even know velma was too clever for her the smile had gone from his mouth he kept quiet there was a knock on the door i got up from the bed and went through to the livingroom to open it malloy stayed in the bedroom in the dark she stood there halfsmiling beautiful in a highnecked white evening dress with deep red stones circling the creamy white of her neck her smile died when she saw me in my old work suit and her eyes went cold i stood to one side and held the door open she walked in past me and then turned quickly annoyed have a drink i said then lets talk not about stolen diamond rings but about murder i went through to the kitchen and mixed some drinks leaving her staring at my back when i came back she was sitting coolly in my best chair blowing smoke from her cigarette up at the ceiling personally i dont believe that lindsay marriott was the finger man for a jewel gang though thats what the police seem to think i began and i dont think he was a blackmailer either funny isnt it mrs grayle and i dont think he was killed by any gang or that he was going to purissima canyon that night to buy back a diamond ring for you i dont think a diamond ring was ever stolen in fact i think he thought he was going there to help someone with a murder but in fact he was going there to die someone wanted lin marriott dead her smile was like broken glass now suddenly she wasnt beautiful any more she was wild and very dangerous all she said was and who did he think he was going to help murder mr marlowe me philip marlowe and ill tell you why simply because i was trying to find a girl who used to sing at a nightclub over on main street a place called florians her boyfriend was looking for her too an exprisoner named moose malloy perhaps i was helping malloy find this girl and i was starting to ask all the wrong questions so he was told i had to die she nodded and said very interesting if i knew what you were talking about and you do i said we stared at each other she had her right hand inside her little white handbag now i knew what she held in it but she wasnt ready yet these things take time lets stop playing games shall we mrs grayle a girl who came up the hard way eventually married a very very rich man and went to live with him at his place near the ocean aster drive but one day an old woman recognized her and this old woman started to blackmail our beautiful young lady the old woman had to be kept quiet marriott helped his beautiful friend by paying some money to the old woman on the first of every month special delivery but he and the old woman were the only two people who knew the secret some day the young womans boyfriend was going to get out of prison and come looking for his girlfriend and she didnt want him to find her so when this private investigator started pushing his nose in and asking questions marriott had to die even though he thought he was going to help murder me he knew too much he was the real danger not me so you killed him didnt you mrs grayle her gun came out then she pointed it at me and smiled i did nothing but moose malloy stepped through the door of the bedroom with a larger gun in his hand he didnt look at me at all he spoke softly thought i knew the voice i tried to remember that voice for eight years while i was away i liked your hair better when it was red though hello baby she turned the gun on him get away from me she said and i just realized in there who it was that gave my name to the police after the great bend bank job you little velma you sent me away for eight years my little velma she shot him five times he stayed standing then he fell face down she ran to the door and out i didnt try to stop her i turned malloy over carefully and put a pillow under his head but after five shots in the body even moose malloy wasnt going to live very long then i called randall at his home and told him what had happened the police cars were there with a doctor a couple of minutes later and the doctor said he had a chance i knew he wouldnt want it he didnt he died in the night it took three months to find velma randall told me the details she was hiding in the most obvious place one night a detective with a good memory walked into a nightclub in new york and heard a singer he liked there but something about her face made him go back and look at the wanted photographs on the wall of his office she was there all right so he went back to the club and showed her her name and picture on the list but he was too careless she pulled a gun out of her bag when he was taking her in and shot him three times then she used her last two bullets on herself velma was tired of running away
