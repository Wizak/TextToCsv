enid blyton fifth formers of st clares back for the winter term st clares had stood silent and empty during eight weeks of the summer holiday except for the sound of mops and brushes and a tradesman ringing at the bell the place had been very quiet the school cat missed the girls and wandered about miserably for the first week or two but now everything was different the school coaches were rolling up the hill full of chattering laughing childrenst clares was beginning a new winter term who would think this was a winter term said pat osullivan to her twin isabel the sun is as hot as it was in the summer we might be able to have a few games of tennis still i shall certainly have a swim in the pool said bobby ellis whose face seemed even more freckled than usual i hope theres fresh water in todayi might have a swim after tea ah you bobbee always you must play tennis or swim or run or jump said claudine the little french girl and your freckles never did i see so many on one face i have been careful in the hot sun these holidaysnot one freckle did i catch the girls laughed claudine was always terrified of getting frecklesbut never did one appear on her pale face and white hands the girls poured into the school running up the familiar steps shouting to one another dumping their lacrosse sticks everywhere hallo hilary hallo janet oh theres carlotta looking more like a gypsy than ever hey carlotta where did you go for your holidays you look as dark as a gypsy i have been to spain said carlotta some of my people live there you know i had a grand time theres mirabelgolly shes awfully tall now said isabel gladys looks more like a mouse than ever beside her hallo said the big strapping mirabel coming up hows every one hallo mirabel hallo gladys said the girls youve been spending the hols together havent you i bet you played tennis and swam all the time both mirabel and gladys were fond of games and this term mirabel was anxious to be sports captain at st clares she had been in the fifth form for two terms and annie thomas the sports captain had let mirabel help her now annie had left and there was a chance that mirabel might be captain for there was no one in the sixth form really fitted to have that post lets go and look at our classroom said bobby ellis it was going to be redecorated in the hols i know lets see what its like they all trooped upstairs to the big fifth formroom certainly it looked very nice painted a pale banana yellow the light was clean and clear in the room and the view from the windows a lovely one weve only got this term hereand then we go up into the sixth form said hilary fancy being at the top of the school i remember when i first came to st clares i thought the fifth and sixth formers were almost grownup i hardly dared to speak to them i expect the young ones think the same thing of us said janet i know most of them scuttle out of my way when i come alonglike frightened rabbits i have a young sister in the second form this term said claudine the french girl she came over with me from france lookthere she is the little antoinette the girls looked out of the window they saw a girl of about fourteen very like the palefaced darkhaired claudine standing watching the others she looked very selfpossessed dont you want to go down and show antoinette round a bit said pat i bet she feels lonely and new ah antoinette would never feel so said claudine she can stand on her own toes like me stand on her own feet you mean said bobby with a chuckle youll never get those english sayings right claudine ahtheres old mamzelle the girls watched mamzelle going out into the garden an anxious look on her face she is looking for the little antoinette said claudine she has not seen her for two years ah antoinette will now be swamped in love and affection my aunt will think her little niece antoinette is as wonderful as me her niece claudine mamzelle was claudines aunt and this fact was at times useful to claudine and at other times embarrassing for antoinette just then it was most embarrassing the little french girl had been enjoying herself watching the excited english girls catching hold of one anothers arms swinging each other round chasing one another and generally behaving in the usual schoolgirl waya way however that the demure antoinette had not been used to then quite suddenly an avalanche descended upon her two plump arms almost strangled her and a loud and excited voice poured out french endearments in first one ear and then another loud kisses were smacked on each cheek and then another hug came which made antoinette gasp for breath ah la petite antoinette mon petit chou cried mamzelle at the top of her voice all the girls stopped playing and stared at antoinette and mamzelle they giggled it was plain that antoinette was not at all pleased to be greeted in public in this way she disentangled herself as best she could she caught sight of her elder sister claudine leaning out of a high window grinning in delight she pointed up to her at once dear tante mathilde there is my sister claudine who looks for you now that she has seen you greet me she will wish you to greet her too mamzelle glanced up and saw claudine still holding antoinette she waved frantically and blew kisses ah there is the little claudine too claudine i come to embrace you antoinette wriggled away and lost herself in the nearby crowd of girls mamzelle turned her steps towards the door that led to the stairs i come i come she called to claudine and i go said claudine pushing away the giggling girls mamzelle will be quite overcome this term with two nieces here so when poor mamzelle panted into the fifthform classroom to embrace her second niece claudine was not to be found i have missed her but i will find her cried mamzelle and she beamed round at the fifth formers there ah bobbee you have come backand you angela and alisonall of you the dear girls and you are going to work hard for me this term so hardfor is it not next term that you go up into the top form the sixth form that is indeed a solemn thought the french teacher went out of the room hunting for her dear claudine the girls laughed dear old mamzelle said hilary i shall never forget her if i live to be a hundred the tricks weve played on herdo you remember those awful stinkballs you had janet when we were in the fourth form i laughed till i cried then when i saw mamzelles face as the smell reached her theres only one new girl this term said janet in our form i mean i saw her name on the list downstairs shes called annemarie longden and felicity ray has come up from the fourth form about time too said mirabel shes older than most of the fifth already i think shes a bit batty no shes notits only that shes a real musical genius said gladys youve said yourself heaps of times that she is mirabel she doesnt seem to care about anything but musicother lessons just roll off her like water off a ducks back shes always bottom of everything except music well miss cornwallis wont be very thrilled if felicity takes no notice of anything but music said bobby who had reason to know that the fifthform mistress was what the girls called among themselves a real slavedriver i bet felicity will know more geography history and maths this term than she has ever known all the time she has been at school any other girls said mirabel well its funny alma puddens name was down on the list of fifth formers said janet but shes sixth form isnt she i mean when she came last term she was put into the sixth formbut now her name is down for our form perhaps shes been put back into the fifth for some reason well i wish she wasnt said bobby i cant say she thrills me shes so like her namepuddeny shes a bit like a suet pudding fat and stodgy and dull shes got a beastly temper said hilary i guess she wont be too pleased at coming down into the fifth form matron appeared at the door of the classroom with a tall slender darkeyed girl whose pale blonde hair made her eyes seem very black indeed hallo fifth formers she said her cheerful smile beaming at every one all back good girls now dont any of you dare to go down with mumps or measles chicken pox or anything else ive brought you the only new girl for your formannemarie longden annemarie smiled nervously she was not pretty but her golden hair and dark eyes made her rather striking hallo she said awkwardly are you all fifth formers what are your names hilary who was head of the form introduced every one quickly these are the osullivan twins pat and isabel youll probably know tother from which in a few terms this is janet and this is roberta commonly called bobby youll always know her by her freckles look out for these two for they know more tricks than any one else annemarie smiled politely hilary went on dragging first one girl forward and then another this is dorisshe can mimic any one under the sun shell be mimicking you before long annemarie annemarie did not look as if this thrilled her very much she thought doris looked a rather clumsy stupid girl she did not see the intelligent eyes and humorous mouth of the born actress that doris was heres carlotta dark as a gypsy went on hilary carlotta gave her usual cheeky grin and please let me tell you annemarie that i was once a circusgirl and rode horses in a circusring said carlotta angela is sure to tell you that sooner or later so i may as well tell you now the goldenhaired beautiful girl called angela flushed with annoyance it was quite true that she looked down on carlotta and always hadbut she had hoped that carlotta had not thought of it the last term or two carlotta had a very sharp tongue and lashed out unmercifully at any one she disliked hilary hurried on hoping to avert a quarrel between the hottempered carlotta and the annoyed angela this is angela she said our dream of beauty youve forgotten the honourable said a malicious voicecarlottas the honourable angela favorleigh angela must have her label shut up carlotta said hilary angela scowled making her lovely face quite ugly for a moment then she tossed her head and went out of the room she had learnt by now that beauty and wealth were no match for a sharp wit like carlottas angela might be the most beautiful girl in the school and the richest but carlotta could always defeat her in a squabble this is pam the brains of the form said hilary pulling a plain undergrown girl forward with great big glasses on her shortsighted eyes she works much too hard but nobody can stop her some one peeped in at the door it was claudine come to see if her aunt was still there its all right mamzelle is still looking for you but not here said carlotta annemarie this is claudine the bad girl of the formshe only works at what she likes she always gets what she wantsand she doesnt care how she does it she has been here quite a long time already trying to learn what she calls the english sense of honour but she hasnt even smelt it yet ah you bad carlotta said the goodhumoured claudine always you make fun of me i am not so bad and not so good mirabel and gladys were pulled forward and the plain quiet pauline who had once been as big a boaster as angela but had learnt a bitter lesson and was now a much nicer girl there you arethats the lot said hilary except felicity our musical genius who is coming up from the fourth form and hasnt arrived yetand alma pudden who comes down from the sixth i havent seen her about yet either i hope you dont do anything wonderful said bobby to annemarie what with pams brilliant brains and angelas filmstar beauty and felicitys musical genius the fifth form has got enough wonderful people in it i hope youre a nice ordinary person annemarie wellim not said annemarie flushing red im im a poet there was a deep silence after this a poet what exactly did annemarie mean by that what do you meanyou write poetry or something said bobby oh help you cant help being a poet if you are one said annemarie youre born a poet my grandfather was a famous poet and my greataunt was a great writer its in the familyand its come out in me i suppose im always writing poetry mostly in the middle of the night help said bobby again weve had many queer things at st claresbut not a poet as far as i remember you and felicity will make a pair she gets up in the middle of the night to write a tuneyou get up to write poems wellyoull be able to keep each other company another girl put her head in at the door and the twins yelled to her alison where have you been come and be introduced to our poet a pretty dainty girl came into the room smiling it was the twins cousin alison this is alison said pat our little featherhead thinks of nothing but her hair and her complexion and whether she has a shiny nose and alison would have scowled or burst into tears a few terms before at this candid introduction but she was thickerskinned now she merely lunged out at pat and nodded amiably at annemarie youd better look out claudine she said your aunt is coming along the passage you cant escape now said hilary youve got to go through with itgo on it pleases old mamzelle she really is fond of you goodness knows why mamzelle swept into the room saw claudine and flung herself on her ma petite claudine how are you how are your dear father and mother and all the family i have seen the little antoinetteah how lonely and shy the poor child looked i have cakes and biscuits for you both in my roomyou will come now this very minute and eat them with me claudine let herself be taken off the others laughed funny to think of claudine being a fifthformer perhaps she will turn over a new leaf now shes so high up in the school but that was the last thing claudine meant to do she went her own way saying what she pleased doing what she pleased and always would it was surprising that so many people liked her studies of their own it was the rule at st clares that as soon as any girl had been in the fifth form for two terms she should be allowed to have a small study of her own which she shared with one other girl these studies were tiny places and the girls could if they wished furnish them themselves though the school provided such things as a table chairs and a carpet and shelves most girls contented themselves with putting up a picture or two bringing their own vases for flowers a tablecloth or so and a clock a few were more ambitious and got a carpet from home and maybe even an armchair the girls themselves chose the companion with whom they wanted to share a study this was not usually difficult because by the time they reached the top forms the girls had all more or less made their own friends and when they were in the fourth form had planned with whom they were going to share the study it was fun arranging about the studies the pairs had to go to matron and tell her they were going to share a study and then matron would allot one to them fancy you having a study she would say dear meit seems no time at all since you were in the first form and i nearly gave you a spanking for not reporting your sore throats to me pat and isabel osullivan were to share a study of course mirabel and gladys wanted to as well angela had asked alison to share with herboth girls had the same dainty tastes i bet there will be nothing but mirrors all the way round the walls of your study said bobby to alison it was a standing joke that alison always looked into any mirror she passed or even in the glass of pictures to see if her hair was all right bobby and janet were to share a study both were tomboys with a love for practical jokes what tricks would be hatched out in their study one odd pair was pam boardman the brainy one of the form and doris edward who was always near the bottom for all her brilliance at mimicry and acting doris could not do ordinary lessons well and admired pams brains deeply pam had tried to help the bigger girl at times and a warm friendship had sprung up between them which made doris suggest sharing a study pam had left st clares once but had missed it so much that her parents had sent her back again some time later the lonely little pam who had never had a real friend at once welcomed the idea of sharing a study with doris doris made her laugh she teased her and put on her big glasses and mimicked her she was good for pam whom is carlotta going with wondered pat hilary perhaps they like one another very much but nohilary as headgirl of the form had the honour of a study all to herself so carlotta could not share with her she chose claudine matron was openly doubtful about this youll have a mighty bad effect on each other she said youre both as cheeky and dontcarish as can be what youll be like if you share a study i cant think but mindany broken furniture or reports of rowdiness and youll go down to the common room of the fourth formers oh matronhow can you think that we should be rowdy said claudine putting on her most innocent look i shall keep our study beautifully so beautifully did i not in the holidays embroider two tablecloths and three cushioncovers for our study annemarie and felicity were to share a study although felicity had not been two terms in the fifth form and annemarie was new matron did not want them to be the only two without a study two geniuses together said bobby with a laugh they ought to use up the midnight oil all right writing poems and tunes no one had asked pauline to share a study with them and she had no friend to ask she was not a girl that any one liked much for she was envious and had been very boastful till the others had found out that all her wonderful tales were made up she had gone into her shell and no one knew quite what the real pauline was like you had better share with alma pudden said matron ticking them off on the list youre the only two left oh said pauline dismally she didnt like alma very much nobody did she was so fat and unwieldy and badtempered but there was no one else to share with so that was that wellthats the lot of you said matron shutting her book you all know the studyrules dont you you can have your teas there by yourselves if you dont want to go to the diningroom you can get in some one from the first or second form to do any little job you want done you can do your prep there in the evenings and you can go up to bed when you want to providing it is not after ten oclock the girls felt free and independent having little rooms of their own the studies were cosy corners dens bits of homethey could be arranged how the girls liked and the tiny fireplaces could burn cosy fires to sit by angela of course furnished hers like a miniature palace she bundled out every bit of the school furniture there and got her mother to send down things from her own bedroom she went down to the town with alison and the two had a wonderful time choosing curtain material cushioncovers and rugs they cost a lot of money alison hadnt very much but angela had had magnificent tips from wealthy uncles and aunts in the holidays and had saved them up for her study she spent lavishly and would let no one into their room till it was finished then she and alison gave a housewarming as they called it they had ordered in cakes and sandwiches from the local baker and had bought lemonade and gingerbeer the table was loaded with eatables and a bright fire burnt in the grate though the day was far too hot the girls crowded in curiously they gasped at the polished furniture beautiful mirrors and pictures the two armchairs and the lovely rugs they fingered the silk curtains and looked at the brilliant chrysanthemums in the vases well said bobby just wait till matron sees all this shell tell miss theobald you have too much money to spend angela i dont see that its anything to do with matron said angela stiffly alison and i dont consider there is enough beauty or comfort at st claresnot as much as we are used to at home anywayand now that we have a study of our own we dont see why we cant fill it with our own ideas dont you like it bobby wellits a bit too showy for me said bobby you know my simple tastes but you certainly have made a marvellous job of it angelaand this tea is super the other girls added what they wanted to their studies claudine put out her embroidered tablecloths and cushioncovers carlotta added a few things she had brought from spain one thing especially giving the little study colour and charactera deep red embroidered shawl from seville the only people whose study was quite plain and without character was the one shared by pauline and alma neither of them had any taste or much money and except for a blue vase contributed by pauline and a teacosy as plump as alma herself given by alma the little study was as bare as in the holidays alma pudden had a most unfortunate name it would not have mattered a bit if she hadnt been so like a suet pudding to look at but she was her school tunic always looked like a sack tied round in the middle her eyes were almost hidden in her round pasty face it was the fifth formers who nicknamed her pudding and she hated it which was not to be wondered at if she had laughed and said yes i am rather puddingy but i shall thin out soon the others would probably have liked her and called her pudding more in affection than in derision but alma flew into one of her bad rages when she was teased she had queer tempersnot hot ones quickly flaring up and down like carlottas or janetsbut cold spiteful rages try as they would the others could not like anything about poor alma poor pauline found sharing a study with alma very dull indeed alma seldom had any intelligent remark to make and though she pored over her prep she rarely got good marks she was selfish too and always took the more comfortable chair and helped herself to more cakes than pauline felicity and annemarie found it rather trying to live together in the same study felicity thought there was nothing in the world but music and she was always singing or trying out tunes on her violin when annemarie wanted to work or to write felicity must you play that awful gloomy tune again annemarie would say im trying to get the last verse of this poem right what poem is it the one you were doing last week felicity would say well its a dreadful poem all words and no meaning you are no poet annemarie why should i stop my music in order that you should write thirdrate poetry felicity did not mean to be rude or even hurtful she was as bobby said quite batty about her music she was working for a stiff exam the lram and was very young indeed to take it miss theobald the head mistress did not want her to work for it and had already told felicitys people that the girl must live an ordinary life and take more interest in ordinary things she is growing onesided miss theobald explained to felicitys parents who came to see her one day sometimes i think she doesnt live in this world at all that is bad for a young girl she is already far too old for the fourth form and yet is not fit to do the work of the fifth but i think i had better put her up into the fifth where the girls there of her own age will wake her up a bit i wish you would say that felicity must put off working for this difficult music exam for a year or two she has plenty of time before her but felicitys people were too proud of their brilliant daughter to put off any exam it would be wonderful to have a girl who was the youngest to pass such an exam put her up in the fifth form if you wish miss theobald said felicitys father but dont let her slacken in any way in her music studies we have been told she is a genius and a genius must be helped and encouraged in every way of course said the head mistress but we must be sure that our ways of encouragement are the right ones surely i dont like all this hard musical work for so young a girl when it means that other quite necessary work has to be scamped but it was no use talking like that to felicitys parents their girl was brilliant and she must go on being even more brilliant i and so it was that felicity was put up into the fifth form to be with girls of her own age even though her work was far below the forms standardand yet had to work even harder at her music than before she did not like or dislike annemarie she was there and had to be put up with but so long as she did not interfere too much with her music felicity did not really notice her study companion but annemarie was jealous of felicity and her undoubted genius annemarie was convinced that she too was a genius her people were sure she was as well they had her best poems framed they recited them to visitors who were too polite to say what they really thought and they tried to get publishers to print them it was most annoying that the girls at st clares didnt seem to think anything of her loveliest poems there was that one beginning down the long lanes of the future my tearbedimmed eyes are peering only angela and alma had been impressed with it neither of them had enough brains to know a good poem from a bad one and they could not see the wouldbe cleverness and insincerity of the long and ostentatious poem whats it mean said carlotta i may be very stupid but i dont understand a word of it why are your eyes tearbedimmed annemarie are you so afraid of your future well im not surprised if thats the way youre going to earn your living you wont get much money its tosh said bobby you write something you really feel annemarie and maybe youll get something good out of your mind this is all pretencejust trying to be awfully grownup when youre not so annemarie was bitterly disappointed that her genius was not recognized whilst every one apparently agreed that felicity really was gifted still on the whole the study companions got on fairly well some of them much better than others of course the twins rarely quarrelled and had so much the same tastes and likings that sharing a study was for them a thing of delight bobby and janet too were very happy together and so were mirabel and gladys it was queer at first to get used to sending for the younger ones to do odd jobs but on the whole that was quite a good idea too many of the first formers for instance had been headgirls or at least in the top forms of their prep schools and it did them good to be at the bottom of another school having at times to rush off to do the bidding of the older girls the twins remembered how they had hated it at first we thought it was beneath our dignity to light someones fire do you remember said pat to isabel as she poked up the fire that a first former had just been in to light for her it was jolly good for us we were so stuck upthought such a lot of ourselves too we got our corners rubbed off all right we get to know the younger ones too said isabel they chatter away to us when they come to do their jobs im getting to like some of the little first formers very much one or two of them will be very good at gamesthey are awfully keen angela sends for the young ones far too much though said pat frowning she and alison make them do too many jobs theyve got a bit of power and they are using it badly better get hilary to tick them off said isobel yawning golly its five to ten come on wed better pack up and go to bed isnt it ran to go when we like so long as its not after ten oclock said pat imitating matrons crisp voice hurryor it will be after ten the new english teacher that term there were a great many more girls at st clares in the younger forms and miss theobald decided to engage an extra mistress to take some of the work off the shoulders of the classmistresses so to the interest of all the girls miss willcox appeared she was present at assembly the second day and looked round with vague rather soulful eyes her names miss willcox the girls whispered to one another shes awfully clever shes going to take english she writes she has had a book of poetry published the girls all gazed at miss willcox with awe they thought that any one must indeed be clever to have written a book miss willcox gazed back at the girls her eyes dreamy and far away what could she be thinking of another book perhaps it was always exciting to have a new teacher what would she be like in class strict humorous lenient dull would she be a good one to play a few tricks on i think she looks most interesting said alison i do really i think she looks as if all kinds of beautiful thoughts are passing through her mind shes probably wondering what there will be for lunch said bobby i always suspect those people that look dreamily into the distance annemarie does it sometimes and i know jolly well that half the time shes wondering if felicity has remembered to get the cakes for tea or something like that and the other half shes thinking of nothing at all annemarie wished she could think of something smart to say back but she never could wellpoets were always misunderstood she knew that people laughed at them and jeered at their workbut then years after they were dead people said how wonderful they were perhaps miss willcox will know that i am a real poet she thought it would be nice to have some one on my side i daresay if miss willcox reads my poems and likes them she will make the others change their minds ill work awfully hard in her classes and get on her good side miss willcoxs lessons were certainly interesting they were filled with plays and poetry and the girls were allowed to debate anything they liked so long as it had to do with literature there was no doubt that miss willcox knew her stuff as bobby put it she was very widely read had an excellent memory and really did know how to pick out things that would interest the girls and make them think she was a strange woman to look at thoughuntidy vague and given to bits and pieces as janet said a scarf wound round her neck a brilliant belt a very striking handkerchief she wore goldheaded pins in her black hair and her dresses all had a drapy look about them they did not really fit her she had an affected voice which rather spoilt her reading of poetry for she pitched it deep and low when really it should have been quite ordinary she had graceful dramatic gestures which filled alisons romantic soul with delight alison copied one or two of the gestures she flung out her hand dramatically when she was telling pat and isabel something and hit bobby with the back of her fingers hey said bobby our featherhead is copying miss willcox alison youre not going to lose your heart to her are you alison went red she always blushed very easily which annoyed her i dont know what you mean she said i admire miss willcox i must say her knowledge of english literature is marvellous oh alison groaned bobby dont say youre going to worship miss willcox havent you got over that silly habit yet you never choose the right people to worship either why isnt miss willcox the right person said alison trying to speak coldly though she felt very hot and cross shes clevershes written a book of most marvellous poetryshes got a lovely deep voice and i think shes most picturesquelooking untidy and messy you mean said bobby in disgust picturesquelooking indeed what an idiot you are alison i think miss willcox wants smartening up and making tidy goldtopped pins in her hairgosh it nearly made me sick to see them bobby was going to extremes and did not mean all she said she was such a downright boyish person she so much hated nonsense and show that people like miss willcox made her go off the deep end and say more than she meant oh miss willcox is not so bad as you make out bobby said pat seeing that alison looked as if she was about to burst into tears and shes not so wonderful as you make out either alison anyway for goodness sake dont put on a worshipping act this term youve been fairly sensible the last two terms or so alison turned away remember miss quentin said bobby warningly dont make the same mistake again miss quentin had been worshipped by alison when she was in a lower form and alison had been bitterly hurt by her because she had found out that the mistress was laughing at her behind her back she had learnt a hard lesson then and had been more careful whom she gave her heart to but now it looked as if she was going to start all over again its no good trying to stop her said pat watching her cousin as she left the room her head high in the air and her cheeks burning you only make her worse bobby she goes all loyal and intense well ive said my say said bobby it wouldnt matter a bit if only alison would choose somebody decent but she never does if miss willcox was sensible shed nip alison in the bud said pat miss cornwallis soon nips any silliness in the bud so do the other mistresses i can see that miss willcox is going to encourage that awful annemarie too welllet her said bobby if she wants the alisons and annemaries of the world sitting at her feet shes welcome to them come onlets go and see if the court is hard enough for tennis they passed alma pudden on the way out the girl looked rather dull and miserable pat felt sorry for her come and have a game she called make up a four i cant run said alma in her usual dull voice im too fat well it will get your fat down a bit said isabel come on but noalma was almost as obstinate at refusing any exercise as claudine was claudine got out of all games if she could and even out of the nature walks at first she had arranged matters so that matron piled mending on her which had to be done in games timebut matron had got wise to this little trick after a time and claudine suddenly found that she had not enough mending to make an excuse for missing outdoor life but claudine was not to be defeated in anything if she did have to put on games clothes and shoes and appear on the field or court she would be taken with violent cramps or would feel sick and have to go off it was simply amazing how she managed to slide out of the things she disliked she and carlotta were a real pair in their study carlotta would not do things she disliked either if she could get out of them but she used open and direct methods whereas claudine really enjoyed getting her way secretly putting on an innocent face all the time they both made war against mirabel who to her intense delight had been made sports captain for the school that term as she had hoped gladys had been made vicecaptain and this pleased them both gladys was small but very quick and deft on the playingfield or tennis court and a fine little swimmer also she was very good at dealing with some of the shy younger girls who were a bit afraid of mirabels heartiness and drive mirabel was a typical sports captain loudvoiced hearty in manner strapping in figure and not very sensitive to the feelings of others she was always trying to make alison claudine angela and carlotta take more interest in the games and they were just as determined not to it annoyed her intensely when they would not turn up at practices she had arranged or got bored on the field and talked this mirabel she is a pest complained claudine to her aunt mamzelle always she wants me to go to the field and make myself hot and dirty and untidy can you not tell her my heart is weak ma tante claudine have you a weak heart my child this you have never told me before cried mamzelle in alarm have you a pain you must go to matron this was the last thing that claudine wanted to do matron was the one person who consistently disbelieved all that claudine said no i have no pain said claudine demurely only just a little flutter herenow and again when i run or go up the stairs mamzelle looked at claudine hard she loved her dearly but it did sometimes cross her mind that her niece might deceive her in order to gain her own ends claudine had pressed her hand over the place where she thought her heart was to show where the flutter camebut unfortunately she wasnt indicating the right place tiens said mamzelle halfalarmed still but a little angry that is not your heart that is your stomach maybe you need a dose of good medicine claudine disappeared at once she was not going to have any of matrons good medicine she made up her mind to find out exactly where her heart was so that another time she would not make a mistake after a few days the fifth form settled down into their usual familiar routine they tackled their new work grumbled and groused laughed and talked played games and went to bed tired out it was a good life an interesting full and friendly one sometimes the fifth formers felt a little sad when they thought that they had only one more form to go intoand then st clares would be left behind for ever there was to be a stiff exam halfway through the term which every one was to take even doris and alma and felicity who felt absolutely certain they would not be able to pass it but it wont do you any harm to work for it said miss cornwallis in her crisp voice if you could just get a pass i should feel you had achieved something i shall allow you to relax all of you after the exam is over but i must insist that you do your very best for the first half of the term and really study hard so there was some very hard work done in the little studies that term carlotta groaned over her maths and claudine puzzled over grammar felicity tried to learn her english literature and to write essays which usually ended abruptly because she had suddenly thought of a new tune annemarie rushed through all her prep except the english and then spent laborious hours over that hoping to win approval from miss willcox even doris and angela worked though neither of them liked it school was funbut it was hard work too angela loses her temper the little first formers came and went at the bidding of the fifth they ran errands they made toast for tea and they chattered about their affairs to any one who would listen mirabel was always kindest to those who were good at games she encouraged them to practise well at catching and running for lacrosse she made up the teams for the school and coached them well in her spare time the younger girls thought she was wonderful you know that little molly williams is awfully good said mirabel to gladys when she was making up the teams one day ive a good mind to let her play in the third team gladys and jane teal is good too if she would practise running a bit more she could be quite fast little antoinette is just as bad as claudine said gladys i cant get her to practise at all or to take any interest in games claudine doesnt back as up there either she is always telling antoinette good excuses to make im tired of claudine and her silly ways said mirabel impatiently shes cunning shell get herself expelled one day oh noshe isnt as bad as that said gladys quite shocked shes just different from us thats all shes better than she was i should hope so after all these terms at st clares said mirabel writing the list of girls for the third team wellive put molly williams downshell be thrilled its a pity angela and alison order the young ones about so much said gladys they have always got one or other of them in their study doing something for them angela even got jane teal in to do some mending for her and thats not allowed ill speak to jane about it said mirabel in her direct way ill tell her shes not supposed to do angelas mending and she must use that time to get out on the practice field wellwouldnt it be better to tell angela that not jane said gladys it would come better from angela if she told jane to stop doing her mending than it would from you ill deal with jane myself said mirabel very much the sports captain rather overbearing and arrogant that morning janes fond of angela said gladys as mirabel went out of the roon mirabel snorted she looks up to me no end she said im pretty certain shell do what i want and not what angela says you really can leave these things to me gladys mirabel found jane teal and called to her hie jane come here a minute the fourteenyearold jane small slight and quick went to mirabel her face flushing she wondered if mirabel was going to tell her she was to play in the third team with molly what a thrill that would be jane said mirabel in her direct way i want you to do a bit more practising in the field the next few weeks youll be good if you really do practice you ought to have been out this week i hear youve been doing angelas mending instead and you know you dont need to do that i like to said jane flushing again im good at sewing and angela isnt i like doing things for her well you give that up and pay more attention to games said mirabel im in charge of games and i want the good players doing their best i will do my best said jane proud to hear the great mirabel say that she was one of the good players but i did promise angela to do all her mending this termat least i offered to mirabel well you must tell her you cant said mirabel who quite failed to see that anything mattered except what she wanted herself but shell be very cross and upset and i do like doing things for her said jane halffrightened but obstinate i i think shes beautiful mirabel dont you i dont see what thats got to do with it said mirabel impatiently anyway im your sports captain and youve got to do as youre told if you dont i shant let you play in even the fourth team let alone the third mirabels tone was sharp she turned on her heel and went off jane looked after her and tears smarted in her eyes she admired mirabel so muchand she did like angela so much too angela had such a lovely smile and she said such nice things the other girl she shared her study with was nice tooalison jane went to find her friend sally she told her all that mirabel had said and sally listened well said sally youll have to do what mirabel tells you if you want to play in the third team and have some good matches why dont you go to angela and tell her what mirabel has said you know quite well that if she is as sweet and kind as you say she is shell say at once that of course you mustnt do her mending any more ohthats a good idea said jane looking happier i couldnt bear to upset angela sally i do really think shes wonderful i should be miserable if she was angry with me tell her when you go and make toast for her tea today said sally so that afternoon rather tremblingly jane began to tell angela what mirabel had said angela she began putting a piece of bread on to the toastingfork angela ive brought your mending back ive done everything even that stocking that had a ladder all the way down the back of the leg thanks jane said angela and gave jane a smile that thrilled her buti dont believe ill be able to do it much more went on jane why ever not demanded angela you promised you would i hate people who back out of things when they have promised to do them well you seemirabel spoke to me about it today said jane rather desperately she saidshe said oh i can guess what she said said angela sneeringly she said you were a wonderful playerand you must practise moreand you mustnt do odd jobs for that horrid angela and you meekly said you wouldnt little turncoat oh angela dont talk like that said poor jane its not fair of course mirabel didnt speak against you but i have to do what she says dont i shes sports captain i dont see why any one has to do what dear hearty loudvoiced mirabel says said angela i dont see why because shes mad on something she should expect every one else to be mad on it too this passion for games games games i agree with claudine that its silly oh but angela said jane shocked games are lovely and they make you get the teamspirit too and play for your side instead of yourselfand dont preach at me said angela angrily youre only a halfbaked first former i dont care what you do anyway go and practise running and catching morning noon and night if you want to i shall certainly not allow you to do anything for me in future i dont like turncoats leave that toast and go and find violet hill and send her to me she can do my jobs instead of you jane was horrified at this outburst she had given her heart to the beautiful radiant angela and now it was treated as rubbish angela didnt want her any more she would have that silly violet hill who adored angela from afar and would do anything for a smile from her jane gave a sob and rushed out of the room in a few minutes violet hill came in thrilled to be sent for angela gave her orders in a lazy voice amused to see how the little first former almost trembled with excitement as she tidied up the room and hung on angelas lightest word alison came in after a while and looked surprised to see violet there instead of jane wheres our devoted jane she asked angela told her in a few words what had happened violet hill listened eagerly she was glad that jane was in disgrace she would show angela how much nicer she violet was when violet went out alison spoke rather shortly to angela you shouldnt have said all that in front of violet you know how keen jane was on youshell have a fit if she knows all this will be passed round her form serves her right said angela viciously angela you make these kids awfully silly said alison after a pause i dont really think you treat them properly you oughtnt to let them think youre so wonderful i bet poor jane is crying her eyes out you know miss theobald dislikes that kind of thing angela went pale with rage she always hated being found fault with she glared at alison and tried to think of something really cutting she found what she wanted at last really alison she said in her lightest most jeering voice really alisonwho are you to talk of thinking people wonderful youre a perfect ninny over that wonderful miss willcox of yours arent you why youre even trying to copy that deep voice of hers it just makes me laugh alison was deeply hurt when she was fond of any one she could not bear to hear a single word said against them miss willcox is an absolutely sincere person she said with dignity thats why i like her youve no interest in english literature or anything at all really except yourself angelaso you cant understand my admiring any one with such an interesting character as miss willcox tosh said angela rudely the two girls said no more to each other that evening angela fumed in silence and alison wrote a long and as she fondly hoped intelligent essay for miss willcox it was not a very happy evening angela had her knife into mirabel after that she did not dare to go and tackle mirabel openly about jane because she was afraid of mirabels rudeness mirabel was tasting power for the first time as sports captain and she was rather arrogant and blunt in her speech also she was very thickskinned and angela despaired of being able to say anything that would hurt her so she had to content herself with looking at her sneeringly and saying mocking things behind her back but as sneering glances and words were typical of angela when she was upset about something no one took much notice mirabel least of all angela made things up with alison not so much because she wanted to but because she simply had to have some one to talk to and air her views to also alison genuinely admired her looks and her clothes and it was always pleasant to bask in admiration of that sort alison was not foolish with angela as she had been when she first came she no longer spoilt her and praised her and agreed with everything but she could not hide her real admiration of the lovely girl with her shining golden hair and brilliant blue eyes she was glad to make up the quarrel with angela for she wanted to talk about miss willcoxhow wonderful she was in class what beautiful poetry she wrote how well she recited in that soulful voice of hers so in return for admiration angela listened rather into bored to all that alison wanted to say they were friends againbut it would not take much to turn them into enemies once more hard workand a little fun the fifth form were certainly working very hard miss cornwallis kept their noses to the grindstone as pat said and piled prep on to them miss willcox expected a great deal of them too miss theobald the head took the form for one or two lessons and although she did not give them a great deal of prep the girls felt that what she did give them must be specially well done when mamzelle piled prep on them too the girls grew indignant gracious what with all that maths to do and that map to draw and those french poems to memorize and that essay for miss willcox well all have nervous breakdowns groaned bobby only pam boardman did not seem to mind she had an amazing memory and had only to look at a page once to know it by heart doris envied her this gift from the bottom of her heart ive no memory at all for lessons she sighed what i learn in the morning ive forgotten in the evening well if youre going to be an actress youll have parts to learn wont you said pam the funny thing is when i act a part and say the words out loud i can remember them quite easily said doris i never forget them then its sitting hunched up over a book reading and rereading the words that gets me down well doris stand up and recite the words out loud and act them if you want to said pam a gleam of fun coming into her solemn eyes heretake this french poemits all about the sobeautiful countryside as mamzelle would say recite it out loud act the cows and the sheep frisk when you come to the part where the little lambs play and waddle like a duck when you get to them youll soon learn it so to the amazement of pat and isabel who looked in at pams study to borrow a book doris threw herself heart soul and body into the french pastoral poem she declaimed the poem loudly with gestures of all kinds she frisked like a lamb she chewed cud like a cow she waddled like a duck it was perfect the girls shrieked with laughter dons had turned the solemn and rather heavy french poem into a real comedy now do you know it said pam when doris finished and sat down panting in a chair doris screwed up her nose and thought hard let me see she said it begins like this but until she got up and acted the poem as she had done before she could not remember a word it was evidently the acting that brought the words to her mind well you do know the poem said pam pleased you wont forget it now mamzelle will be pleased with her chere doris tomorrow doris however was not in mamzelles good books the next day her french exercise was nothing but mistakes and was slashed right across with mamzelles thick blue pencil mamzelle never spared her blue pencil when she was annoyed and a page disapproved of by her was always a terrible sight ah you doris began mamzelle when she was going through the work with her class you have i had you on my thumb under my thumb said bobby with a grin mamzelle glared at her and resumed have i had you on my thumb for all these terms and still you do not know that a table is she not he why are you not in the kindergarten why can you still not pronounce the french r all the others can you are a great big stupid girl yes mamzelle said poor doris meekly when mamzelle flew into a rage it was best to be meek but for some reason doriss meekness irritated mamzelle even more ahyou mock at me now yes mamzelle you say with your tongue in your mouth and butter melting in your cheek cried mamzelle getting things mixed up as usual the girls giggled you mean with your tongue in your cheek and butter that wont melt in your mouth suggested bobby again do not tell me what i mean bobbee said mamzelle exasperated always you interrupt doris stand up doris stood up her humorous mouth twitching she would act this scene afterwards for the benefit of the girls how they would laugh i your written work is very bad now let me hear your oral work demanded mamzelle you have learnt the french poem yesthen let me hear it begin doris couldnt think of a single word she stared into the distance racking her brains she knew there were all kinds of animals in itbut how did the words go she did learn it mamzelle said pams voice earnestly i heard her say it all through without looking at the book once then i too will hear it now said mamzelle begin doris pam sat just behind doris she whispered the first line to her doris beganand then she suddenly knew that if only she could act the poem she could say every wordbut not one line would come unless she acted it oh dearshe couldnt possibly act it in front of mamzelle who loved french poetry and would think she was making fun of it well doris i wait i wait patiently said mamzelle who was anything but patient at that moment can you or can you not say the poem to me yes i can said doris butbut only if i act it then act it said mamzelle losing the last of her patience but if you are not telling me the truth ma chere doris i complain to miss theobald act itbut say the poem through without mistake so in despair doris acted the french poem in her usual exaggerated ridiculous manner waggling herself chewing the cud waddling friskingand of course as soon as she acted the poem she knew it all the way through without a single mistake she certainly had a queer memory the girls were thrilled and amused at doriss rendering of the solemn poem but they felt certain that mamzelle would be exceedingly angry it was claudine that saved the situation she clapped her hands in delight she threw back her head and laughed her infectious laugh she held her sides and almost doubled herself up oh ma tante ma tante she cried to her aunt the clever doris the marvellous doris such a poem she makes of itand not one single mistake ah never never shall i forget this poem now mamzelle pushed her glasses on to her nose more firmly her face changed she let out a roar of delighted laughter and the class breathed loudly in relief so long as mamzelle saw the joke it was all right mamzelle took off her glasses and wiped her streaming eyes it is clever very clever doris she said it is not the right way to recite such a poem no but it is very clever and very amusing i will forgive you this time for your bad work it is true that you know the poem and you have made it very funny is it not so claudine claudine agreed we too will say the poem like that she suggested her eyes gleaming with fun but mamzelle was not going so far as that ah non she said doris has a gift that way one girl is funny but fourteen fifteen girls would not be funny tiens look at the clock we have wasted half the lesson on this bad clever doris get out your books please doris found that she could learn anything if only she said it out loud and put ridiculous actions to the words but so often she could not repeat what she had learnt unless she accompanied it with the absurd actions miss willcox did not think this was funny she called it playing the fool and said it was very bad taste as for doing such a thing in miss cornwalliss class or miss theobalds it was quite unthinkable however much the girls begged doris to recite the latest maths rules with appropriateor inappropriateactions she would not im not going to get expelled just to make you laugh she said i must go on plodding away and get pams help as much as i can ill never be any good at lessons but youll always be able to make people laugh said isabel id almost rather do that than anything but im not much good at it id rather write a book or paint a beautiful picture said alison so would i said annemarie much rather to leave something of oneself behind something one has made or creatednow thats really worthwhile deirdre fans said carlotta mockingly alison had found out that miss willcoxs first initial was d and had asked her what it stood for deirdre said miss willcox and alison had thought it a most beautiful name almost picturesque enough for her darling miss willcox deirdre willcoxa lovely name for a poet she had told angela and angela had told every one else both annemarie and alison were always round miss willcox and the girls now called them deirdre fans it annoyed them very much alison was sorry now that she had told any one miss willcoxs nameshe would have liked to be the only one that knew it she and annemarie both vied with each other for miss willcoxs attentions alison was jealous of annemarie because she could write poetry and miss willcox encouraged her to bring her her poems annemarie was jealous of alison because she felt sure that miss willcox liked alison the better of the two which was quite true a little of annemarie and her intenseness went a very long way youre both silly said bobby who never could understand what she called sloppiness cant you see that any one who encourages a couple of idiots like you cant be worth sucking up to but this kind of remark only made alison and annemarie more devoted it even brought them together a little in their common indignation which amused the girls very much the deirdre fans were the cause of a lot of fun that halfterm angela and the younger girls little jane teal turned up on the lacrosse field and practised zealously much to mirabels satisfaction there you are she said to gladys triumphantly you see a little plain talking has done jane teal a lot of good i shall make her a very good player in no time gladys had noticed that jane had done exactly what mirabel had told her but she had also noticed too that jane looked rather miserable she doesnt seem very happy about it she said and it doesnt seem to me that she puts much heart into all her practising i bet angela made things very unpleasant for her when she told her she couldnt do her mending any more oh wellits a good thing if jane gets that sort of nonsense knocked out of her said mirabel i cant bear these kids that go round worshipping people well a lot of them think no end of you said gladys and you like them to thats different said mirabel at once they look up to me because im sports captain because i make them work hard and because i dont stand any nonsense i should tick them off if they got sloppy over me wellall the same i think little jane looks miserable said gladys dont frown like that at me mirabel after all im your vicecaptain and i have a right to say what i think to you mirabel looked in surprise at gladys who was often called the mouse because she said so little and was so quiet mirabel was fond of gladysin fact she was the only girl in the school that she had any real affection for at all all the same she didnt think she could allow gladys to find fault with her decisionswhat was the sense of being captain if you didnt make your own decisions and stick to them a little power had gone to mirabels head you can say what you like to me of course said mirabel stiffly but that doesnt mean i shall pay attention to your suggestions im afraid gladys i shall listen to them of coursebut i am the one to decide everything gladys said no more mirabel was not going to be a very easy person to live with that term gladys wished she was bold like carlotta or downright like bobby or a strong character like hilarythey always seemed able to cope with others in the right way but gladys was afraid of hurting them or of making them angry angela made a fuss of violet hill in order to punish poor jane she gave her one of her best hairslides and a book which sent the foolish violet into transports of delight violet showed them to jane and sally look she said isnt angela a dear shes so generous i think shes wonderful i do think you were silly to quarrel with her jane i think angela is worth three of mirabel jane looked miserably at the book and the hairslide angela had never given her a present she wished she could dislike angela but she couldnt every time she saw the goldenhaired girl with her starry eyes set in her oval face she thought how wonderful she was sally was sorry for jane cheer up she said angela isnt worth worrying about i believe shes only making up to violet just to make you jealous i think shes being beastly but jane would not hear a word against angela however much she had been hurt by her violet too was cross at sallys remarks as if angela would give me presents just to make jane jealous she said sharply if you ask me i think she gave me them because i mended her blue jumper so neatly it took me hours do you do her mending then said jane jealously of course said violet i dont care what mirabel says to meif i prefer to do things for angela i shall do them violet told angela how upset jane was and angela was glad she could be very spiteful when anything upset her she was especially sweet to violet and to the other first former who came when violet could not come the two of them thought she was the nicest girl in the whole school antoinette claudines little sister also at times had to do jobs for the fifth and sixth formers she did not like angela and always found excuses not to go to her study even when an urgent message was sent that young sister of yours is a perfect nuisance angela complained to claudine cant you knock some sense into her claudine when i sent for her yesterday she sent back to say that she was doing her practisingand now i hear that she doesnt even learn music she might have been practising something else suggested claudine politely maybe lacrosse angela snorted dont be silly antoinette gets out of games just like you dothe very idea of thinking she might put in a bit of practice is absurd i believe you encourage her in these bad waysslipping out of anything she doesnt like claudine looked shocked ah but surely the little antoinette loves everything at this soenglish school dont pretend to me said angela exasperated i should have thought that in all the terms you have been here claudine you would have got more englishyoure just as french as ever you were claudine would not lose her temper at this ungracious speech it is good to be french she said in her light amiable voice if i were english i might have been you angelaand that i could not have borne better a hundred times to be a french claudine than an english angela angela could not think of any really good retort to this and by the time she had found her tongue claudine had gone over to speak to mamzelle angela knew she had gone to mamzelle on purposeno one would dare to attack claudine with mamzelle standing by mamzelle was intensely loyal to her two nieces all right thought angela spitefully ill just get that slippery sister of hers and make her do all kinds of things for me ill speak to hilary about it and shell tell antoinette shes jolly well got to come when i or alison send for her hilary knew that antoinette was being very naughty about coming when she was sent forbut she knew too that angela used the younger girls far too much she used her prettiness and charm to make them into little slaves so she was not very helpful to angela when the girl told her about antoinette ill tell her she must obey the fifth and sixth formers she said but angela dont go too far please most of us know that you are using your power too much in that direction what about mirabel said angela at once doesnt she throw her weight about too much shes unbearable this term just because shes sports captain theres no need to discuss mirabel said hilary what weve all got to realize this term the term before we go up into the sixth is that this is the form where we first shoulder responsibilities and first have a little power over others youre not given power to play about with and get pleasure from angela as you seem to think youre given it to use in the right way dont be so preachy said angela really are we never going to have any fun or good times again at st clares every one looks so serious and solemn nowadays bobby and janet never play tricks in class we never have a midnight feast we never remember that we are all working jolly hard said hilary walking off you cant work hard and play the fool too wait till the exam is over and then maybe we can have a bit of fun hilary spoke to antoinette and the small darkeyed french girl listened with the utmost politeness yes hilary i will go to angela when she sends for me said antoinette but always she sends for me at sobusy a time well make your excuses to me not to angela said hilary firmly antoinette looked at hilary and sighed she knew that hilary would not believe in her excuses and would insist in that firm polite way of hers that antoinette should do as she was told angela saw hilary speaking to antoinette and was pleased she decided to give antoinette a bad time she would teach her to toe the mark properly violet i shant want you for a few days she told the adoring violet send me antoinette instead oh but angeladont i do your jobs well enough for you said violet in dismay antoinette is such a mutt she cant do a thing really she cant let me do everything antoinette can sew and darn beautifully said angela taking pleasure in hurting violet who had been very silly that week you made an awful darn in one of my tennis socks violets eyes filled with tears and she went out of the room alison looked up from her work angela stop it she said i think youre beastly making the kids adore you and then being unkind to them anywayyoull have a hard nut to crack in antoinette she wont adore you shes got her head screwed on all right she would adore me if i wanted her to boasted angela who knew the power of her prettiness and smiles and who could turn on charm like water out of a tap she wouldnt said alison shes like claudine sees through every one at once and sizes them up and then goes her own way entirely liking or disliking just as she pleases i bet ill make antoinette like me as much as any of those silly kids said angela you watch and see youll be surprised alison ill watchbut i shant be surprised said alison i know little antoinette better than you do antoinette defeats angela the next time she was sent for antoinette arrived promptly all smiles she was just as neat and chic as claudine quickwitted and most innocentlooking miss jenks the second form mistress had already learnt that antoinettes innocent look was not to be trusted the more innocent she looked the more likely it was that she had misbehaved or was going to misbehave you sent for me angela said antoinette yes said angela putting on one of her flashing smiles i did antoinette will you clean those brown shoes over there please im sure youll do it beautifully antoinette stared at angelas beaming smile and smiled back angela felt sure she could see intense admiration in her eyes the polish please said antoinette politely youll find it in the cupboard top shelf said angela how chic and smart you always look antoinettejust like claudine ah claudine is she not wonderful said antoinette angela i have five sisters and i like them all but claudine is my favourite ah claudinei could tell you things about claudine that would make you marvel that would make you wish that you too had such a sister and but angela was not in the least interested to hear what a wonderful sister claudine was and she was certain she would never wish she had one like her angela preferred being a spoilt only child you had to share things with sisters erthe polish is in the cupboard top shelf she said her bright smile fading a little the polishah yes said antoinette taking a step towards the cupboard but only a step now claudine is not the only wonderful sister i havethere is louise ah i wish i could tell you what louise is like louise can do every embroidery stitch there is and when she was nine she won better get on with my shoes antoinette said angela beginning to lose patience a hurt look came into antoinettes eyes and angela made haste to bestow her brilliant smile on her again antoinette at once cheered up and took another step towards the cupboard she opened her mouth plainly to go on with her praise of louise or some other sister but angela picked up a book and pretended to be absorbed in it dont talk for a bit she said to antoinette ive got to learn something antoinette went to the cupboard she took a chair and stood on it to get the polish then she stepped down with a small pot in her hand and a little secret smile on her mouththe kind of smile that claudine sometimes wore angela did not see it antoinette found a brush and duster and set herself to her task she squeezed cream on to the shoes and smeared it on well then she brushed it in and then rubbed hard with the soft duster she held the pair of shoes away from her and looked at them with pride done said angela still not looking up in case antoinette began talking again they are finished said antoinette shall i clean yet another pair angela it is a pleasure to work for you angela was delighted to hear this ahaalison would soon see that she could win the heart of antoinette as easily as any one elses yes antoinetteclean all the shoes you like she said smiling sweetly how beautiful that pair look do they not said antoinette such beautiful shoes they are too ah no girl in the school wears such fine clothes as you angelaso beautifully made so care fully finished you have more chic than any english girlyou might be a parisian ive been to paris and bought clothes there two or three times said angela and was just about to describe all the clothes when antoinette started off again ah clothesnow you should see my sister jeanne such marvellous clothes she has like those in the shops at parisbut all of them she makes herself with her clever fingers such style such chic such you seem to have got a whole lot of very clever sisters said angela sarcastically but antoinette did not seem to realize that angela was being cutting it is true she said i have not yet told you about marie now marie antoinette finish the shoes and let me get on with my work said angela who felt that she could not bear to hear about another sister of antoinettes theres a good girl she used her most charming tone and antoinette beamed yes angela yes i am too much of a chattertin am i not box not tin said angela now do get on antoinette its lovely to hear your chatter but i really have got work to do antoinette said no more but busied herself with three more pairs of shoes she stood them in the corner and put the empty pot of cream into the wastepaper basket i have finished angela she said i go now tomorrow you will want me is it not so yes come tomorrow at the same time said angela switching on a charming smile again and shaking back her gleaming hair youve done my shoes beautifully thank you antoinette slipped out of the room like a mouse she met claudine at the end of the passage and her sister raised her eyebrows where have you been antoinette you are not supposed to be in the fifth form studies unless you have been sent for i have been cleaning all angelas shoes said antoinette demurely then she glanced swiftly up and down the corridor to see that no one else was in sight and shot out a few sentences in rapid french claudine laughed her infectious laugh and pretended to box her sisters ears tiens quelle mechante fille what will angela say antoinette shrugged her shoulders grinned and disappeared claudine went on her way and paused outside angelas study she heard voices alison was there now too claudine opened the door hallo said alison come for that book i promised you wait a minuteive put it out for you somewhere she caught sight of all angelas shoes standing gleaming in a comer i say did young violet clean them like that for you she doesnt usually get such a polish on noantoinette did them said angela she was telling me all about your sisters and hers claudine ah yes said claudine there is my sister louise and my sister marie and my sister oh dont you start on them for goodness sake said angela whats the matter alison what are you staring at have you used up all that lovely facecream already said alison in a surprised voice and she picked an empty pot out of the wastepaper basket angela how extravagant of you why there was hardly any out of it yesterdayand now its all gone what have you done with it nothing said angela startled i hardly ever use that its so terribly expensive and difficult to get i keep it for very special occasions whatever can have happened to it it really is empty the two girls stared at each other puzzled claudine sat on the side of the table swinging her foot her face quite impassive then angela slapped the table hard and exclaimed in anger its that fool of an antoinette shes cleaned my shoes with my best facecream oh the idiot all that lovely cream gonegone on my shoes too but your shoes they look so beautiful remarked claudine maybe the little antoinette thought that ordinary shoepolish was not good enough for such fine shoes shes an idiot said angela i wont have her do any jobs again perhaps thats why she did this said alison dryly its the kind of thing our dear claudine would do for the same kind of reason isnt it claudine shall i tell antoinette you will not need her again because you are very angry at her foolishness said claudine ah she will be so sad the poor child angela debated she felt sure that antoinette had made a real mistake she was certain the girl liked her too much to play such a trick on her how thrilled antoinette had seemed when she had smiled at her no the girl had made a genuine mistake angela would give her another chance ill try her again she said ill forgive her this time we all make mistakes sometimes how true said claudine now my sister marie hardly ever does she make a mistake but once oh get out said angela rudely its bad enough to have you and antoinette here without having to hear about your dozens of sisters claudine removed herself gracefully and went to find antoinette to report the success of her trick antoinette grinned cest bien she said very good another time i will again be foolish oh so foolish angela sent for her again the next day antoinette entered with drooping head and downcast eyes oh angela she said in a low meek voice my sister claudine has told me what a terrible mistake i made yesterday how could i have been so foolish i pray you to forgive me all right said angela dont look so miserable antoinette by the way i think ill call you toniits so much friendlier than antoinette isnt it antoinette appeared to greet this idea with rapture angela beamed how easy it was to get round these young ones wellshe would get all the work she could out of this silly french girl she would wind her round her little fingerand then she would send her packing and teach her a good sharp lesson what would you have me do today antoinette asked in her meek voice more shoes no said angela no more shoes make me some anchovy toast toni please said antoinette not understanding oh deardont you know what anchovy toast is sighed angela well you make ordinary buttered toast and for goodness sake toast the bread before you put the butter onthen you spread it with anchovy paste youll find it in the cupboard make enough for three people annemarie is coming to tea to read us her new poem ah the wonderful annemarie said antoinette getting out the bread now one of my sisters the one called louise once she wrote a poem and toni ive got to go and see some one said angela getting up hurriedly get on with the toast and do it really carefully to make up for your silly mistake yesterday angela believe me your little toni will give you such toast as never you have had before said antoinette with fervour she held a piece of bread to the fire angela went out determined not to come back till antoinette had made the toast and was safely out of the way talk about a chatterbox she seemed to have a neverending flow of conversation about her family she might start on her brothers nextif she had any as soon as angela had gone out of the room antoinette put aside her artless ways and concentrated on her job she made six pieces of toast very rapidly and spread them with butter then she got a pot down from the cupboard shelfbut it was not anchovy it was the pot of brown shoe polish that she should have used the day before it looked exactly like anchovy as she spread it on the toast carefully the little monkey spread the brown paste piled the slices on a plate and set them beside the fire to keep warm then she slipped out of the room and made her way to the noisy common room of her own form soon alison came in and sat down by the fire then angela popped her head round the door and saw to her relief that antoinette was gone i simply couldnt stay in the room with that awful chatterbox drivelling on about her sisters said angela ah shes made a nice lot of toast hasnt she hallo heres annemarie annemarie came in her big eyes dark in her pale face you look tired said angela been burning the midnight oil i wish i could write poems like you annemarie i worked on a poem till past twelve said annemarie in her intense voice its a good thing no one saw the light in my study ahteas ready how lovely lets tuck in and then ill read my latest poem three disgusted girls angela lifted the toast on to the table i got antoinette to make anchovy toast for us she said it looks good doesnt it take a slice annemarie annemarie took the top slice it seemed to have rather a peculiar smell annemarie looked rather doubtfully at it its all right said alison seeing her look anchovy always smells a bit funny i think she and annemarie took a good bite out of their toast at the same second the shoecream tasted abominable annemarie spat her mouthful out at once all over the table alison with better manners spat hers into her handkerchief angela took a bite before she realized what the others were doing then she too spat out at once and clutched her mouth with her hands oh oh what is it im poisoned she rushed to the nearest bathroom and the others followed their tongues hanging out annemarie was promptly sick when she reached the bathroom tears poured from her eyes and she had to sit down angela what filthy paste how could you buy such stuff she said horrible said alison rinsing her mouth out over and over again all that toast wasted too its wicked angela whatever possessed you to get paste like that ive never tasted anchovy like that before and i hope i never shall again ugh angela was feeling ill and very angry what in the world had that idiot antoinette done they went back to the study and angela opened the door of the little cupboard she took down the pot of anchovy it was untouched so antoinette couldnt have used it then what had she used there was only jam besides the paste alison picked up the pot of brown shoecream and opened that it was practically empty look said alison angrily she used the shoecreamplastered all the toast with it she deserves a good spanking angela was white with anger she put her head out of the door and saw a first former passing hey molly she called go and find antoinette and tell her to come here at once yes angela said molly and went off very soon antoinette appeared her dark eyes wide with alarm and her lips trembling as if with emotion antoinette how dare you put shoecream on our toast almost screamed angela you might have poisoned us all cant you tell the difference between anchovy paste and shoepolish you absolute idiot youve made us all ill matron will probably hear about it you ought to be reported to miss jenks you ought to ah ah do not scold your little toni so said antoinette you have been so kind to me angela you have smiled you have called me toni do not scold me so i will give up my teatime i will make you more toast and this time i will spread it with the anchovy there shall be no mistake this time if you think im ever going to trust you to do a single thing for me again youre mistaken said angela still tasting the awful taste of shoecream in her mouth i might have known a french girl would play the fool like this i tell you youve made us all ill annemarie was sick i am desolated wailed antoinette ah angela i prayyou to let me come again tomorrow tomorrow i will be good so good tomorrow you will call me toni and smile at me again tomorrow tomorrow ill get violet hill said angela clear out antoinette youre a perfect menace antoinette cleared out and there was peace well said angela shell wish shed been more sensible tomorrow serves her right i was nice to her and she thought the world of mebut i cant put up with idiots shell be jolly sorry when she sees i dont mean to give her another chance i dont feel like any tea now said alison looking at the remains of the toast with dislike do you annemarie no said annemarie and shuddered i still feel sick i dont even know if i can read my poem it doesnt go very well with shoepolish oh do read it annemarie begged angela who really did admire her poems whats it about its all about the sadness of spring said annemarie reaching for her poem its a very sad poem really all your poems are sad said alison why are they annemarie i like poems that make me feel happy i am not a very happy person said annemarie very solemnly and looked intense poets arent you know but some must have been objected alison i know lots of very cheerful poems shut up alison said angela read your poem annemarie annemarie began her poem it was very doleful full of impressive words and rather dull neither alison nor angela liked it very much but they couldnt help feeling impressed however could annemarie write like that she must indeed be a genius it must be nice for you sharing a study with felicity who thinks as much of music as you do of poetry said alison you ought to get felicity to set some of your poems to music that would be wonderful ive asked her she wont said annemarie shortly the truth was that felicity would not admit that annemaries poems were worth tuppence it was very humiliating to annemarie write something real and ill put a tune to it felicity had said im not going to waste my music on secondrate stuff the door opened suddenly and matron looked in i hear yon poor girls have had a nasty dose of shoepolish she said i hope it wasnt anything very serious angela thought she would take the chance of getting antoinette into trouble so she exaggerated at once oh matron it was awful we had our mouths absolutely full of the beastly stuff annemarie must have swallowed a lot because she was sick i shouldnt be surprised if we are ill seriously ill tonight said angela im sure i swallowed some said annemarie looking solemn i expect we all did then you must come and have a dose at once said matron that shoecream contains a poisonous ingredient which may irritate your insides for a week or more unless i give you a dose to get rid of it come along with me straightaway the three girls stared at her in alarm they simply could not bear matrons medicines they were really so very nasty angela wished fervently that she had not exaggerated so much she tried to take back what she had said oh well matron she said with a little laugh it wasnt as bad as all that you know we spat out practically all of it and we rinsed our mouths out at once were perfectly all right now i dare say said matron but id rather be on the safe side i dont want you in bed for a week with a tummy upset of some sort come along ive got something that will stop any trouble immediately but matron began alison it was no good nobody could reason with matron once she had really decided to give any one a dose the three girls had to get up and follow her they looked very blue and felt most humiliated as a rule matron left the fifth and sixth formers to look after themselves and seldom came after them suggesting medicine they felt like first or second formers trooping after her for a dose matron took them to her room and measured out the medicine into tablespoons one for each of them it tasted almost as nasty as the shoepolish toast pooh said alison trying to get the taste out of her mouth why dont you get some nicetasting medicines matron ive never tasted any so beastly as yours well ive got a much worse one here said matron would you just like to try it of course not said alison then a thought struck her matronhow did you know wed had shoepolish on our toast today we hadnt told a soul who told you why the poor little antoinette told me said matron corking up the bottle poor child she came to me in a terrible state saying she had poisoned you all by mistake and what was she to do if you died in the night and couldnt i do something about it the three girls listened to this with mixed feelings so it was antoinette who not only provided them with shoepolish toast but also with medicine from matron the little horror youve no idea how upset she was went on matron briskly poor little soul i felt really sorry for her an english girl might have been amused at the mistake she had made but antoinette was so upset i had to comfort her and give her some chocolate its wonderful what chocolate will do to soothe the nerves of a first or second former nothing but babies really the thought of antoinette eating matrons chocolate was too much for angela alison and annemarie they felt that they simply must get hold of antoinette and tell her what they thought of her where is antoinette do you know matron asked angela wishing she could get the combined tastes of shoepolish and medicine out of her mouth i sent her to her aunt mamzelle said matron im sure she would cheer her up and make her think she hadnt done such a dreadful thing after all fancy thinking she really had poisoned you the three fifthformers went back to the study it wouldnt be a bit of good going to fetch antoinette now she would probably be having a nice cosy tea with mamzelle who would be fussing her up and telling her everything was all right a mistake was a mistake and not to worry pauvre petite antoinette ill send for her tomorrow and jolly well keep her nose to the grindstone said angela angrily i told her she neednt do anything more for mebut ill make her now ill make her sorry she ever played those tricks clever little beastgoing off to matron and playacting like that shes worse than claudine alison was alarmed to hear that angela was going to make antoinette do some more jobs for them for goodness sake dont be silly she said to angela antoinette is far too clever for us to get even with shell only do something even worse than she has already done i told you she wouldnt be like the others silly and worshipping i told you she would size you up i told you shut up alison said angela i hate people who say i told you i told you i wont have antoinette if you think shell play worse tricks shed end in poisoning us i should think i wish i could pay her out though its partly your own fault all this said alison if only youd treat the younger ones like the others do sensibly and properly we shouldnt have all these upsets annemarie thought it was time to go she always said that quarrels upset her poetic feelings so she went taking her mournful poem with her wed better not say a word about this to any one said angela else the whole school will be laughing at us we wont let it go any further but alas for their plansantoinette told the story to everyone and soon the whole school was enjoying the joke it made angela furious for she hated being laughed at it humiliated alison too for even miss willcox got to hear of it and teased her and annemarie what about a little essay on anchovy sauce she said poor alison poor annemarie what a shame miss willcox is in a bad temper miss willcox was in a bad temper she had just had back from her publishers her second book of poems with a polite note to say that they were not as good as the first ones and they regretted they did not see their way to put them into bookform miss willcox had an excellent opinion of her own writings just as annemarie had of hers also she had boasted in advance of her second book of poemsand now it would not be published she was disappointed and like many rather weak characters her disappointment turned to resentment instead of to a determination to go on and do better so she went to her english class looking rather grim and feeling that she could not stand any nonsense or bad work that morning as a whole the class had been working really very well for miss willcoxs lessons were interesting alma pudden had not been able to keep up with the class very well and doris could not learn by heart with any success unless she was allowed to act what she said felicity too was only really interested if the poems or plays aroused her sense of rhythm and music the girls were rather tired that morning they had had a strenuous halfhour with the gymmistress who feeling rather brisk had put them through a great many vigorous exercises then had come a very hard threequarters of an hour over maths and then the english lesson the girls were feeling that they wanted to relax a littlebut here was miss willcox demanding intense concentration and attention carlotta let out an enormous yawn which drew miss willcoxs wrath upon her then claudine said she felt sick and please could she go out of the room it is astonishing how many times you manage to feel sick when you want to miss some part of a lesson said miss willcox irritated go straight to matron please and tell her i would rather not said claudine politely i do not feel sick enough for that i can be sick in here if you would rather i stayed for the lesson it looked as if miss willcox was going to overwhelm claudine with her wrath when felicity made them all jump she began to tattoo on her desk swaying to and fro in ecstasy ladiladila she sang oh lalaladila felicity what in the world are you doing cried miss willcox incensed with rage felicity took not the slightest notice with eyes still closed she continued her swaying and her singing at times thumping the desk to accent the rhythm felicity almost shouted miss willcox one of her goldtopped pins falling out of her hair on to the desk she didnt notice it do you hear what i say what has come over this class this morning bobby gave felicity a bang on the shoulder felicity opened her eyes with a start and gazed round the room she did not in the least seem to take in the fact that she was in class and that miss willcox was furious with her she shut her eyes again and began swaying shes musicmad said bobby shes in a kind of musicdream miss willcox i dont believe she can help it hie felicity she goes like this in our study at night very often said annemarie i often think she does it on purpose she always does it when i want to read one of my poems out loud jolly sensible of her remarked pat ladiladila hummed felicity miss willcox stared at her very hard she simply could not make out if the girls actions were genuine or put on boomdiboom diboom finished felicity and banged the desk hard ah ive got it at last the girls laughed acting or not it was very funny felicity beamed round i have it she said the melody ive had in my mind for the last two weeks it goes like thisladiladila now it was miss willcoxs turn to bang on the desk it was seldom that she really did lose her temper for she considered that meant a loss of dignity and miss willcox always liked to appear dignified and selfcontrolled but really felicity was too much for any one leave the room commanded miss willcox her voice trembling with anger i wont have any one in my class playing the fool like this you shouldnt have come up into the fifth formyou should have gone down into the third go out of the room said felicity puzzled why must i i didnt mean to interrupt the lessoni didnt do it on purpose it came over me suddenly now i am quite all right leave the room ordered miss willcox again the girls were silent it was almost unheardof for a fifth form girl to be sent from the room if miss theobald heard of it there would be serious trouble for felicity felicity got up and walked out of the room as if she was in a dream she looked puzzled and shocked she stood outside the door and leaned against the wall her head ached then the new melody came back again into it and she began to sing it quietly the sound came into the silent classroom annemarie tell felicity to go to her study and to write out the whole of the act of the play she is now missing said miss willcox i will not have this behaviour felicity thinks shes a genius said annemarie shes always acting like this i didnt ask for any comment said miss willcox she always forgot to put on her deep rather drawling voice when she was in a temper and her voice now sounded rather harsh and unpleasant almost every one got into trouble that morning doris was scolded for not knowing her part in the play they were reading alma was hauled up for eating sweets like any silly little first former said miss willcox in disgust taking the bag away from the fat unhappy alma poor old pudding whispered pat to isabel i believe eating is her only pleasure in life pat what did you say demanded miss willcox pat went red welli cant very well tell you she said not wishing to repeat what she had said and hurt alma miss willcox at once felt certain that pat had been saying something rude about her miss games this afternoon and write out your part in the play instead she snapped pat looked upset but did not dare to argue with miss willcox in her present mood the girls grew nervous pauline dropped her books on the floor and made miss willcox jump she got a few sharp words that made her squirm and look at the mistress with resentment bobby debated whether or not to cheer things up by making miss willcox and the class laugh but decided that nothing on earth would get a smile out of the mistress that morning whatever could be wrong with her she was not usually like this only alison and annemarie gazed at her with admiration that morning they both thought that their beloved miss willcox looked lovely with her dark soulful eyes flashing a bit of miss willcoxs hair came down and hung by her ear alison saw her feeling about for the pin that usually kept it up and walked from her seat she picked up the pin that had dropped and put it on miss willcoxs desk with one of her rather sweet smiles somehow the action and the smile soothed miss willcox thank you alison she said using the deep voice that always thrilled annemarie and alison you are always on hand to help annemarie felt jealous she never liked it when miss willcox praised alison in any way she sat looking gloomy the class was amused to see this little byplay after the reading of the play was finished there were five minutes left has any one found anything interesting to read asked miss willcox who always encouraged the class to bring any poem they liked or to quote any prose lines they came across which pleased them apparently no one had weve been working too hard this week to read much said hilary we havent time for anything till this awful exam is over miss willcox said annemarie nervously smiling could i read the class a poem of mine please i would so like to know if you like it miss willcox was not really in the mood to hear poems by any one since her own had been sent back but the class thinking that they could sit back and have a little rest for five minutes applauded annemaries suggestion loudly annemarie flushed with pleasure she thought they were welcoming her poem it didnt enter her silly little head that the girls wanted a rest and wouldnt listen to a word of it well said miss willcox rather ungraciously you can read it if you like annemarie annemarie got a piece of paper out of her desk covered with her sprawling handwriting which was always far too big she cleared her throat and began putting on a deep voice that was supposed to be a flattering imitation of miss willcoxs own style the lonely mill lost in the wreathing mists of time silent as years that are lost brooding nobody but angela listened the whole class was bored to tears by annemaries pretentious solemn and insincere poetry annemarie let herself go and her voice rang quite sonorously through the classroom but she was not allowed to finish it miss willcox had listened in a state of irritation and stopped her halfway through the poem was plainly an imitation of one of her own poems in the book she had had published and of which the adoring annemarie had bought a copy her poem was called the deserted farm and the whole plan of it was much the same as annemaries even to the ideas in the different verses as an imitation it was very cleverbut annemarie had not meant it to be an imitation she had thought she was writing a most original poem and had not even realized that she had drawn on her memories of miss willcoxs own poem stop said the mistress and annemarie stopped puzzled she glanced at miss willcox who was frowning when you write something really original something out of your own mind something which isnt copied from my work or any one elses ill listen to it annemarie said miss willcox putting on her deep drawling voice again but miss willcoxi didnt copy it from anywhere stammered annemarie horrified ii only tried to model it on your own style which i admire very much even if annemaries poem had been as good as one by shakespeare miss willcox would not have admired it that morning when she was still smarting from the sending back of her own precious collection of poems dont make excuses she said coldly if i were you i should tear the poem up nowtheres the bell put your books together and go out for break alison you can stay and help me for a few moments i want these papers put in order in tears poor annemarie went out of the roomand with smiles alison helped miss willcox the other girls hurried out thankfullywhat a nerveracking english lesson it had been about geniuses sport and mending you werent sick after all claudine said angela rather maliciously as they went out it passed said claudine airily happily felicity took miss willcoxs attention or i might have had to go to matron wed better go and get felicity out of her study said isabel to pat i wonder if shes written out the act of that play its an awfully long one they went to felicitys study annemarie was there crying she scowled at the others when they came in cheer up silly said pat what does it matter what dear deirdre says about your poem i bet shes jealous thats all you dont know anything about poetry sniffled annemarie i dont believe you heard a word of my poem anyway quite right i didnt said pat id listen if i understood what you were trying to say in your poems annemarie but it always seems to me as if you havent got anything to say youre all unkind to me sobbed annemarie thoroughly upset by two thingsthe fact that her precious poem had been scoffed at and that her adored miss willcox had snubbed her oh dont be such a baby said pat and turned to look at felicity who was writing feverishly in a corner copying out the play in a nervous very small handwriting bad luck felicity said pat come on out now though do you good to get a blow in the air this morning you look awful i dont know what happened to me in class today said felicity raising her head for a minute you see ive been working so hard on my music and the tune ive been groping for suddenly came to meand my mind just went after it and i forgot everything else its because youre a genius said pat kindly for she liked felicity who put on no airs at all and was not in the least conceited geniuses always do funny unusual things you know they cant help it they like working in the middle of the night they go without food for days sometimes they walk in their sleep they are absentmindedoh theyre not like ordinary people at all so cheer upyou cant help being a genius personally i think youre working too hard annemarie listened to this sympathetic speech with sniffles and a discontented look she thought herself just as much a genius as felicitybut nobody ever talked to her like that nobody ever called her a genius except angelaand angela really didnt know the difference between a nursery rhyme and a great poem life seemed very hard to poor annemarie just then perhaps thought annemarie suddenly perhaps if i do some queer things like felicity does the girls will realize im a genius too its worth trying anywayso long as i dont get myself into a row its no good doing anything in miss willcoxs classafter felicitys performance it would be silly she cheered up a little and went out for break felicity would not go out she was intent on finishing the writing out of the play so that she could once more give her mind freely to the music that seemed always all around her felicity was finding things very hard that term the work in the fifth form was more difficult than in the fourth and there was the strain of the exam to face she was also working even harder at her music and very often could not sleep at night mirabel also was working very hard at the sports standard of the whole school she wanted to raise the standard of the lacrosse so that even the fourth and third teams would win all their matches what a feather it would be in her cap if she did gladys did not approve of all this intense drive for high efficiency in games and gym and running practice youre trying to do too much too quickly she said to mirabel youll get much better results if you go more slowly mirabel look at this practice list of yours for the first form youll make them all fed up with games if you insist on so much time being given to them do them good said mirabel intent on the second form list these kids ought to be very grateful for the interest i take in them that jane teal for instance she is ten times better since she did what i told her and put in more practice shes the best catcher in the first form well you can drive people like jane teal who always want to do the best they can for any one they like said gladys but you cant drive every one some just get obstinate i think youre not at all sensible with some of the fourth formersand you really ought to know better than to go after people like carlotta and angela and claudine i wish you wouldnt always find fault with me gladys said mirabel impatiently youre quite different from what you used to be you used to like being guided by me you said i was the strong one and you quite looked up to me i know said gladys and i do now i only wish i had half your strength of will and purpose mirabel but as i accepted the post of vicecaptain which does bring with it the responsibility of sharing with you most of your decisions i cant sit back and not say things i ought to say i dont want to say themi know you wont like some of thembut id be a very poor thing if i didnt say them mirabel really was surprised at gladys always she had been the leader of the two and gladys had followed meekly and willingly it was something new for mirabel to find gladys sticking up for her own ideas and actually going against her sometimes i mirabel should have admired her quiet friend for this but instead glorying in her position of sports captain she only felt resentful i mean to make st clares the best sports school in the country she said obstinately i shant listen to any excuses of overwork or tiredness from any one theyll just have to put as much into their games as they do into their schoolwork every one is not as big and strong as you are said gladys looking at the huge strapping girl i dont wonder you are going to train as a gamesmistress youre just cut out for it you could take gym and games the whole day long and then go for a tenmile walk in the evening but do do remember mirabel old thing that youngsters like jane teal really havent the strength to do all you do jane teal had most conscientiously done all that mirabel had asked her for she was a loyal and hardworking girl she felt proud when mirabel told her that she was now the best at ballcatching in lacrosse in the whole of her big form but she had never stopped worrying about angela and she longed to make up the quarrel with her and do things for her again she sat in prep and debated things in her mind how could she become friends with angela again how could she do her jobs instead of violet who after the upset with antoinette had been taken back into favour again she could not for the life of her think how to get back into angelas good books you seem to be lost in dreams jane said miss robertas voice i cant think you are doing your maths with that faraway expression on your face ii was just thinking of something said jane embarrassed and bent her head to her work the next day violet went down with a very bad cold and was taken off to the san by matron sniffling and feeling very sorry for herself she called to jane as she went find that schoolstory for me and my new jigsaw puzzle and bring them in sometime to me she said and jane promised she would accordingly she went to violets locker after morning school and looked for the things she wanted she found themand she also found two pairs of angelas stockings and two vests all wanting quite a lot of mending she stared at them violet would be away from school for three or four days should she jane do the mending and take it back to angela and ask if she might take violets place till she came back it would be lovely to go to her study again and tidy up the beautiful place look at the pictures on the wall fill the vases with waterdo all the things she loved doing angela would smile at her again and everything would be all right jane mended everything beautifully spending all her free time on the stockings and the vests some of her free time should have been spent in learning a part in a play the first form were doing how could she learn it when she had to go to bed early like all the other first formers ill take my torch to bed with me and when the others are asleep ill switch it on under the bedclothes and learn my part then thought jane she was pleased at having thought of such a good way out no one would know she did not think of how tired she would feel the next day she took the things to angela that afternoon when angela sent for violet she went in timidly her heart beating fast for she was afraid of angelas sneers and snubs alison was there alone she was surprised to see jane hallo kid she said wheres violet in the san with a cold said jane i mended angelas things instead where is she alison having a talk with mirabel said alison mirabel had been having serious talks with all the fifth form that day asking them to help her in making the sports standard for st clares much higher she would certainly not have much success with angela who detested getting hot and untidy oh said jane disappointed and put the mended stockings and vests down then her face brightened for angela came into the room and shut the door violently she looked cross that idiot of a mirabel she said to alison not seeing jane at first she wants to turn us all into tomboys like herself great strapping creatures striding along instead of walking shouting instead of speaking playing jane is here said alison warningly angela turned and saw her she still looked cross and jane hastened to explain why she was there violets ill please angela she said so i have done your mending myself i hope you dont mind ii would like to do it for you again if youll let me angela stared at jane unsmilingly but what about dear mirabel and her anxiety to make you into a wonderful little sportswoman she said in a mocking voice i can do both said jane anxiously i can make time for my work and my games and for anything youd like me to do too angela knew it would annoy mirabel if she heard that she was making jane spend her time on all kinds of jobs for her so she nodded her head and gave the girl a slight smile which was heaven to jane all right she said ill have you again im tired of that silly violet anyway with her big cowseyes you can come instead filled with delight jane sped off everything was all right again the wonderful angela had smiled at her she didnt mind if she had to work in bed every night so long as angela went on being nice to her mirabel makes herself a nuisance mirabel was really making herself a nuisance just then especially with the fifth form who were working very hard indeed for the exam she was trying to get them interested in the younger ones to make them go and take practice games with them they objected to this very much its a silly idea said pat those babies much prefer to practise on their own they dont like being chivvied about by us big ones besides weve got to work said hilary exasperated i cant imagine when you do any extra work for the exam mirabelim sure you spend all your evenings in your study preparing your sports lists and list for matches and goodness knows what it was true that mirabel was doing very little extra work she was trusting to scrape through the exam but she did not care whether she got good marks or not her whole soul was in the running of the school games and she often annoyed the gamesmistress intensely but mirabels thick skin made her quite invulnerable to cutting remarks or snubs she just drives on like a tank said bobby nobody can stop her shell have us all trailing after her helping her in her sports ideas just because were so tired of arguing with her you cant argue with mirabel said doris she never listens to a word any one says i doubt if she even listens to gladys now its a pity gladys isnt a stronger character she might have some influence over our headstrong mirabel gladys used to have influence over her said pat do you remember when mirabel first came to st clares and was rude and defiant and said she wouldnt stay longer than halfterm whatever happened yes said isabel remembering she was simply unbearablequite unreasonable and it was the little mouse gladys who got her round and made her stay on and become quite a decent member of st clares but mirabel has got swelledhead now shes sports captain said bobby gladys cant do anything with her i heard her arguing with mirabel the other day and all that happened was that mirabel got angry and shut her up i have never liked this mirabel of yours remarked claudine who had consistently got out of games and gym whenever she could all the time she had been at st clares she is always hunting me here there and everywhere calling upon me to do this and that the girls smiled claudine usually found it quite easy to evade people who wanted her to do something she disliked but few people were so persistent as mirabel no matter where claudine hid herself mirabel would run her to earth produce a list of games and try to pin claudine down to a practice yesterday in my great despair i went to speak to miss theobald said claudine raising her eyebrows and her shoulders in an amusing way there was mirabel close behind me waving a great list and there was i taking to my toes heels said bobby laughing i run fast said claudine and i find myself outside miss theobalds door what shall i do to get away from this dreadful mirabel i knock at the door i go in the girls were amused and wondered what claudine could have found so suddenly to say to miss theobald what excuse did you make asked janet i held a long conversation with miss theobald said claudine solemnly ah we talked and we talked whilst the poor mirabel she waited patiently outside the door what on earth did you talk about said bobby curiously claudine looked mischievous there was no miss theobald there she said i talked to myself and then i talked again as if i was answering the door was shut how could the good patient mirabel know that only i claudine was in the room was mirabel outside the door when you went out said bobby alasmiss theobald herself came to the door when mirabel was still standing there said claudine the poor mirabel she must have been so surprised to see miss theobald as surprised as i was suddenly to hear her voice outside the door me i did not stay in the room any longer i jumped out of the window the gardener was there and he too jumpedhow do you say ithe jumped out of his skin the girls yelled at the thought of claudine jumping oat of miss theobalds window in order to avoid both mirabel and miss theobald none of the others except perhaps carlotta would have thought of doing such a thing you really are the limit said bobby what is this limit that you are always talking of inquired claudine never mind what happened next said hilary who always enjoyed claudines pranks ah welli went in at the sidedoor said claudine and i heard miss theobald and mirabel being most surprised at each other miss theobald said my dear mirabel how can claudine be talking to me in the drawingroom if i am here outside the door do not be foolish the girls giggled didnt miss theobald open the door asked janet yes said claudine and there was no one in the room ah it was good to see poor mirabels face then so surprised it was so puzzled and miss theobald she was quite cross did mirabel ask you what had happened said pat grinning ah yesshe asks me so many times said claudine and i say i do not understand mirabel speak to me in french but the poor mirabel her french is so bad i do not understand that either shhere is mirabel said pauline as the sports captain came into the room you always knew when mirabel was comingshe walked heavily she flung doors open and her voice was loud and confident she came towards the girls i say she said ive just got miss theobalds permission to call a big sports meeting tomorrow night in the assembly hall seven oclock its to discuss all the matches this termand there are some jolly important ones seven oclock dont forget and i shall expect every member of the fifth form to be there the younger girls are all coming of course and it wouldnt do to let them see any of us slacking or not attending the meeting yes but mirabelits saturday night and you know we were going to have a dance protested angela you know that it was all arranged the third and fourth form were coming too it was to be real fun well i put the meeting tomorrow night because the dance isnt a bit important and the meeting is said mirabel we can have a dance any other saturday but ive got quite a lot of new ideas to put before the school ive been working them all out you might ask us if we would agree to exchanging a dance fervour silly meeting said alison youre so jolly highhanded i shant come to the meeting ive got better things to do mirabel looked shocked how could there be better things to do than attend a sports meeting and discuss the ins and cuts of matches she stared at alison and frowned youve got to come she said miss theobald said claudine jumped out of the window i could arrange the meeting and tell every one to attend it wont take long you always say thatbut your meetings take hours said carlotta you stand up and talk and talk and talk i shant come i shall report any one who doesnt said mirabel beginning to look angry mirabelput the meeting another time said hilary youre only getting every ones back up you really are we want a little fun tomorrow night weve au worked hard this week im sorry said mirabel stiffly the meeting will be held tomorrow night and nothing will prevent it not even your wish my dear hilary you may be head of the form but i am head of the whole school for sports she went out and shut the door loudly she knew the girls would say hard things about her but she didnt care she meant to have her way the girls would thank her all right when every single match against other schools was won she would put st clares at the top she has a wasp in her hat that girl said claudine disgusted a bee in her bonnet you mean said pat how yon do get things mixed up claudine yes old mirabel certainly has got a bee in her bonnetitssports sports sports with her all the time and every one else has got to be dragged into it too i love gamesbut honestly i find myself not wanting to turn out on the field now simply because i know mirabel will be there ready to check au shirkers and latecomers shall we have to go to this beastly boring meeting said felicity i wanted to work at my music and i wanted to finish my new poem said annemarie at once well have to go if miss theobald has agreed to let mirabel call the meeting said hilary reluctantly i suppose she told miss theobald that we were all keen on the meeting its a nuisancebut well have to turn up maybe the meeting will not be held after all said claudine not a hope said bobby i know mirabel once she makes up her mind about something that something happens shes a born dictator shell be appalling in the sixth form i think maybe the meeting will not happen after all said claudine looking dreamily into space what do you mean said bobby i have a feeling here said claudine pressing a hand to her tummy it tells me this feeling that something will stop the meeting tomorrow night what can it be hilary looked suspiciously at claudine who was wearing one of her most innocent and angelic expressions claudine returned her look with candid wideopen eyes are you planning anything said hilary because if so dont you cant meddle with things like school meetings once youre a fifth former how true t said claudine with a sigh and went off to her study with carlotta that night when every one in claudines room was asleep the little french girl slipped out of bed and went along the corridor she went down the stairs and soon returned with something that shone brightly each time she passed under a dimmed light she deposited it in an unused chest outside the dormitory door covered it with an old rug and then slipped along another corridor to the dormitory in which her sister antoinette slept she awoke antoinette by a light touch and knelt by her sisters bed to whisper out out whispered back antoinette yes yes claudine i will do as you say do not fear it will be done claudine slipped back to bed like a little white ghost she climbed between the sheets grinning to herself dear mirabel it will be difficult for you to hold your meeting tomorrow poor mirabel you will be disappointed foolish mirabel you cannot get the better of the little french claudine with these pleasant thoughts claudine fell fast asleep the meeting is spoilt the third fourth and fifth forms were very much annoyed and upset by mirabels command to attend the sports meeting on saturday night they had looked forward to the dance so muchit was just like mirabel to spoil everything she walks about with those long strides of hers as if she owns the whole school said belinda of the fourth form i used to like games but now im getting fed up with them complained rita of the third form mirabel ticks me off in public on the field as if i were one of the first form i wont stand it but she did stand it because mirabel was a very strong personality determined to get her own way she was using her power to the utmost and beyond the fifth formers all put away their various occupations that saturday night as seven oclock drew near they grumbledas they shut their books rolled up their knitting put away their letters but not one of them refused to go when the time came for they knew that as fifth formers they must turn up even if only as a good example to the younger ones mirabel was standing on the platform of the assembly hall running through the list of things she meant to say she glanced up as the girls came filing in her quick eyes watching to see that every one turned up woe betide any unlucky first or second former who did not arrive mirabel would be after them the next day antoinette came up to mirabel the sports captain glanced up impatiently what is it antoinette please mirabel may the second form have a new ball to practise with said antoinette it seems that we have lost the one we had and we are oh so keen to practise hard for you hm said mirabel rather disbelievingly for antoinette could not by any means have been called keen on games why didnt violet come to me about it violet is in the san said antoinette well come to me on monday about the ball i cant possibly deal with matters like that now said mirabel you ought to know better than to come just before an important meeting like this yes mirabel said antoinette and sidled away mirabel thought of her with exasperation she was a slacker just like claudinebut she would pin her down and make her play games properly if it took her three terms to do it the girls all filed in mirabel caught sight of jane teal in the firstform benches looking rather pale jane was gazing at angela who was looking very beautiful that evening she had had her hair washed and it glistened like finest gold mirabel frowned she wished that jane and the other first formers would stop raving about that foolish angela she ran her eyes over the fifth form they all seemed to be therebut wait a minute where was felicity mirabel spoke to annemarie who was passing by the platform at that moment wheres felicity shes coming mirabel said annemarie shortly for she like every one else resented giving up a jolly dance for a dull meeting she had some music to finish copying out she said she was just coming well i shall begin without her said mirabel shes always unpunctual such a bad example for the younger ones its a minute past seven already every one was now in their seats there was a great shuffling of feet and an outbreak of coughing from the second form who were a very lively lot this term mirabel went to the front of the platform she looked enormous there she began very selfconfidently for she was seldom at a loss for words when her beloved games were the subject good evening girls she began in her loud determined voice i have called this important meeting here tonight for a very special reason i want to make st clares the head of all the schools in the kingdom in their proficiency at games of all kinds i want us to have hockey as well i want us to there came an interruption a firstform girl stood up and stopped mirabel jane isnt well she says she wont leave the meeting but she must mustnt she it was sally jane teals friend every one turned to look at poor jane who white in the face felt quite faint with embarrassment take her out sally said mirabel rather impatiently she did not like being interrupted in her opening speech sally helped jane out are you going to be sick she asked in a loud whisper which embarrassed poor jane even more she was terribly upset at holding up mirabels meeting but she really did feel queer the two went out and mirabel resumed her speech which went on for three or four minutes i want us to win all our lacrosse matches i want us to form a hockey team that is unbeatable i want us to but what else mirabel wanted nobody ever knew there came a sudden and unusual noise that made every one jump violently it was the loud clanging of the school firebell clang clang clang clang mirabel stopped and listened startled fire this was not just a practice alarm she was soremiss theobald would never choose a time like this for an unexpected firepractice she knew there was an important meeting being held the first and second formers looked uneasily at one another and then looked for a lead from the older ones there were no mistresses present hilary stood up her face quite calm help me to get the first and seconds out quietly she said to the twins and to janet and bobby well march them into the grounds out by the side door mirabel also took quick command her strong voice rang out reassuringly thats the school firebell you all know what to do stand please the girls stood glad to have a leader mirabel saw that hilary the twins bobby and janet had moved across to the younger girls and she saw that she could expect the utmost help from them some of the first formers looked father scared right turn roared mirabel follow hilary wentworth march in perfect order without any panic at all the first and second forms marched out led by hilary who undid the garden door and went into the grounds it was a dark night but the girls knew the grounds well pat and isabel took out the second form bobby and janet and the headgirl of the third form then marched off with that form the fourth formers followed with the fifth sniffing the air eagerly to see if they could smell smoke wheres the fire cried belinda i cant see a sign anywhere mirabel went out of the hall last pleased to find that fihe could handle an emergency so efficiently her loud confident voice had at once instilled trust into every girl she wondered where the fire was the first of the mistresses to arrive on the scene was mamzefle miss theobald was out and the french mistress had been left in charge for that evening the loud distressed voice of mamzdle was heard long before she appeared in the doorway ah where are the girls yes yesin the assembly hall to think that a fire should come when miss theobald is out girls where are you claudine antoinette show yourselves to me i pray you are you safe quite safe came claudines amused voice and then antoinette left the darkness of the grounds and went to where mamzelle stood in the doorway i too anf safe she said in her demure voice mamzelle threw her arms round antoinette as if she had rescued her from flames ah my little antoinette do not be afraid i am here your strong aunt mathilde wheres the fire mamzelle called a voice ah the fire where is it repeated mamzelle still feeling rather dazed then matron appeared on the scene and took command at once she had sped round the school immediately she had heard the firebell to see where the fire could be she had been to the place where the firebell was kept to see who was ringing itbut the firebell was standing in its place and no one was near it she was puzzled but as her nose eyes and ears told her that certainly there was no fire raging anywhere near she felt sure that some one had been playing a joke matron had been long enough at st clares to smell a joke a mile away by now girls come in at once she said in her crisp cool voice there is no fire but i must congratulate you on responding to the bell so quickly and quietly and going out of doors in this sensible way well we were all at a meeting said hilary who was near the door it was easy we just marched out but matronwho rang the bdl then we shall no doubt find that out later said matron dryly in the meantime please march indoors again the girls all marched in some of them were shivering for it was a cold night matron saw this and hoped the san would not be inundated with people having colds the following week she looked at her watch and made up her mind quickly you will all go to your common rooms and your studies at once she said headgirls make up the fires in the common rooms please and see that the rooms are warm in ten minutes time come to the kitchen two girls from each form and there will be jugs of hot cocoa ready which i want you all to drink as soon as possible this was pleasant news the girls hurried in glad to think of warm fires and hot cocoa but mirabel was annoyed she spoke to matron matron im sorry but im afraid the girls must go back to the hall we were just beginning a most important meeting shall i tell them or will you matron looked hard at the selfconfident mirabel we shall neither of us tell them she said you heard what i said to them theyve had a spell out there in the cold and i dont want them to get chills there will be no meeting tonight hurrah said one or two low voices as the girls hurrying in heard this welcome news good old matron mirabel ought to have known that one person she could never flout was matron she began to argue but matronthis is a most important meeting i shall have to go to miss theobald im afraid and ask her for her authority to continue my meeting if you wont give the girls permission very well go and ask her said matron who knew quite well that miss theobald was out so off went mirabel angry and determined bitterly disappointed that her wonderful meeting was spoilt but miss theobald was not in her drawingroom it was most annoying mirabel hardly dared to go back and take up the matter with matron again she had not at all liked the tone of matrons voice her spirits sank and she felt rather miserable then her face grew grim well i shall find out who rang that bell and spoilt my meeting anyway and wont i give them a dressingdownin front of the whole school too who rang the firebell mirabel went storming to her study gladys was there warming herself in front of a cheerful little fire pity the meeting was spoilt she said thinking that mirabel would be in need of a little comfort about it you were making a very good speech mirabel gladys who do you think rang that firebell said mirabel grimly is that cocoa in the jug ill have a cup not that im cold but i do feel a bit upset at having the meeting completely spoilt by some silly idiot who thinks it clever to play a practical joke like that gladys said nothing she had no idea at all who the culprit could be mirabel stirred her cocoa violently and went on talking who wasnt there well felicity wasnt of course gladys could it have been felicity of course not said gladys i dont suppose felicity even knows there is a firebell let alone where it is welli shall certainly find out where she was all the time said mirabel this is really the sort of idiotic joke claudine would playbut she was there all the time i saw her myselfand antoinette was there too because she came up and spoke to me at the beginning of the meeting and she was out in the grounds with the others said gladys remembering didnt you see her go up to marazelle and speak to her when mamzelle yelled out for claudine and antoinette yes said mirabel frowning well who else wasnt there violet is in the san every one else was there as far as i can remember i ticked people off as they came in because i wasnt going to let any one get out of the meeting if i could help it gladys offered no suggestion mirabel suddenly slapped the table hard and made gladys jump dont mirabel she said dont be so violent mirabel took no notice of coursejane teal went out didnt sheand sally do you think either of them would have done it i shouldnt think so for a moment said gladys why jane is very fond of you and sally is far too sensible to do a thing like that i shall find out said mirabel her face hard gladys looked rather distressed dont go about it too angrily she said youll only put peoples backs up i dont care if i do said mirabel and she didnt gladys sighed if only mirabel did care a little mora about other peoples feelings she would rind them easier to tackle she was always complaining that people would not cooperate with her or help her mirabel gulped down her cocoa im going off to felicitys study first she said see you later she went out of the room gladys took up some knitting she was making a jumper for her mother and she had very little sparetime for it with all her exam work sports work and mirabels incessant demands to cope with she couldnt help feeling rather glad that she had an unexpected hour to get on with her knitting mirabel went into felicitys study felicity was there trying her violin softly whilst annemarie sat over the fire a pencil and notebook on her knee trying to compose a wonderful new poem she kept frowning at felicitys soft playing but felicity was quite unaware of annemaries frowns or even of annemarie herself she jumped violently when mirabel came into the room then thinking she had come to see annemarie she went on with her soft playing mirabel spoke to her roughly fehcity why werent you at the sports meeting this evening felicity looked startled oh mirabelim so sorry i really did mean to come and i forgot all about it i was playing my violin and somehow forgot i had said i would go how awful of me where were you when the firebell went said mirabel firebell said felicity looking astonished what firebell she never hears anything but her music when shes really wrapped up in it said annemarie you know how she behaved in class the other day mirabel i dont expect she heard the bell at all i didnt said felicity looking really bewildered now did it ring was there a fire what happened oh youre hopeless said mirabel and went out of the study felicity stared at annemarie who made an impatient noise stuffed her fingers in her ears and tried to go on with her poem mirabel went to find jane teal and sally they were in the firstform common room jane still looking rather pale but better she flushed when mirabel came in quite thinking that the sports captain had come to see how she was but mirabel hadnt she came straight to the point jane and sallydid either of you ring the firebell when you left the meeting the girls stared at her in surprise it would not have occurred to either of them to spoil such an important meeting jane felt very hurt to think that mirabel should imagine her to be capable of such a thing wellhavent either of you tongues said mirabel the whole of the first form had now gathered round the three and were listening with the greatest interest of course we didnt said sally indignantly as if wed do a thing like that anyway poor jane was feeling awfully ill she had a terrible headache shes always having headaches shut up sally said jane who knew that mirabel did not look very kindly on such tilings as headaches did you leave jane alone at all said mirabel to sally yesyon came back to the meeting without her didnt you then she could easily have slipped out of your common room and rung the bell couldnt she ok said sally really indignant as if jane would do a mean thing like that yes i did leave her here as she seemed a bit better and i went back to the meeting and as soon as i sat down the bell rang but it wasnt jane ringing it jane was terribly upset to think that mirabel should even think she could spoil a meeting of hers her lips trembled and she could not trust herself to speak now dont burst into tears like a baby said mirabel to jane im not saying you did do itim only saying that you had the chance to do it it just puzzles me to know who could have done it because everybody was at the meeting except you and felicityand im pretty certain that felicity didnt even know st clares possessed such a thing as a firebell well it looks as if i must have done the deed then said jane bitterly trying to keep the tears out of her eyes think it was me if you like i dont care t now thats not the way to talk to your sports captain said mirabel im surprised at you jane well i suppose i shall find out one day who rang that bell she went out of the room and shut the door unnecessarily loudly the first formers looked at one another beast said sally i shant do one single minutes more lacrosse practice than i can help nor shall i said hilda and the others all agreed jane mopped her eyes and the others comforted her never mind jane dont you worry about it we all know you didnt do it i wish i knew who had done it said sally her eyes sparkling id go and pat her on the back and say jolly good show the others laughed and agreed it was queer how in a few short weeks mirabel had changed from an object of great admiration into one of detestation miss theobald had to be told about the strange ringing of the firebell apparently done by nobody at all she was rather inclined to take a serious view of it and mirabel was pleased i am glad you too think it is a serious matter to have an important prearranged meeting completely spoilt by somebodys stupid ragging said mirabel oh dear me i was not thinking of your meeting was miss theobalds rather damping reply i was thinking that i cannot have the firebell rung without proper cause if it is then the girls will not take warning when the bell is rung for a real fire that is a very serious matternot the interruption of your meeting oh said mirabel rather crestfallen well could i have the meeting next saturday night instead miss theobald im afraid not said the head mistress the heads of the third fourth and fifth forms have already been to me to ask me if they may have the postponed dance then mirabel i dont think we can possibly expect them to postpone it again these forms are working very hard this term and very well i want them to relax when they can mirabel left miss theobald angry and depressed she went into her study and sat down at the table to do some work whats the matter said gladys hilary and the headgirls of the third and fourth have been to miss theobald behind my back and got her to say they could have their dance this coming saturday said mirabel gloomily its absolutely the only chance i have of getting the whole school together on saturday evenings and they know it deceitful beasts dont be silly said gladys feeling a wave of anger they probably never even imagined youd actually want them to give up another saturday evening do be sensible mirabel and look herewhy have you left little jane teal out of next weeks matches shes very good and you know it it will break her heart to be left out when youve as good as told her she might play im not satisfied that she didnt have something to do with the ringing of that bell said mirabel well said gladys exasperated you might at least wait till you are sure before you punish her like this i think shes a very decent little kid i must say and im dead certain she wouldnt do a thing like that look here im captain not you said mirabel losing her temper i keep on having to remind you of that i wont have you preaching at me and interfering gladys went rather white she hated rows of any sort and always found it difficult to stand up to mirabel for any length of time she took up a book and said no more mirabel took up a book too and looked at it frowning but she did not see a word that was printed there she was turning over and over in her mind the same questionwho rang that firebell she would have been interested in a little conversation between claudine and antoinette if she could have heard it very good ma petite claudine remarked to antoinette it was good to show yourself so well to mirabel at the beginning of the meeting and to appear out in the grounds when tante mathilde called us there is no one who thinks of you no one at all clang clang clang said antoinette her dark eyes gleaming with mischief i felt like the old town crier at home clang clang clang the meeting will not be held clang clang clang ah it is a good bell to ring sh here come the others said claudine slip away antoinette be sure i will help you if you want me to since you have done this thing for me some of the fifth formers came up what mischief are you thinking of said bobby to claudine you look pleased i was remembering how i said i feel as if there will be no sports meeting said claudine and i was right was i not bobbee the term goes on the girls soon forgot about the strange ringing of the firebellall except mirabel who felt sure jane must have done it in fact she went even further in her thoughts and suspected angela of having put jane up to doing it she took no notice at all of poor jane left her out of the matches and altogether made her life miserable angela tried to make things up to jane delighted at the chance of making a fuss of somebody neglected by mirabel poor jane was in a great state of mind upset because mirabel was unkind to her thrilled because angela was sweet to her and overtired with all her learning in bed at night with the light of her torch she had headaches felt terribly sleepy all the day and could not see properly for she was spoiling her eyesight by reading in bed by the dim light of the torch she was not the only one with headaches just then felicity always more or less afflicted with them was having them almost continuously also to annemaries alarm felicity had begun to walk in her sleep at night this was something that felicity had done as a child when her mind was overtaxed and now she had begun to do it again annemarie slept in the bed next to felicitys and was awakened one night to see a dim white figure stealing out of the door she sat up and switched on her torch felicitys bed was empty has she gone to the study to do some more work thought annemarie what an idiot she is id better go and get her shell get into an awful row if miss cornwallis finds out annemane flung her dressinggown round her shoulders and went after felicity to her surprise felicity did hot go in the direction of their study instead she went down the stairs and into the assembly room she climbed up the platform steps and stood in the middle of the platform felicity whispered annemarie astonished what are you doing felicity j felicity took absolutely no notice at all she bowed gracefully took a step backwards and then raised her arms as if she was playing a violin it was queer to see her in the light of the moon that shone through a nearby window up and down went felicitys right arm as the girl played an imaginary tune on an imaginary violin her eyes were wide open fixed and staring annemarie shivered to see them she went up the steps and touched felicity on the arm the girl made no response she went on with her tuneless playing and then bowed as if she had finished annemarie took her by the arm to her surprise felicity came quite readily with her are you awake or asleep felicity said annemarie fearfully as they went up the stairs there was no reply felicity was fast asleep though her eyes were wide open annemarie took her safely to her bed and got her in felicity cuddled down shut her eyes and breathed deeply annemarie got into bed too but lay awake a long time puzzling over felicitys sleepwalking it must be because shes a genius thought the jealous annemarie she does queer things as all geniuses seem to do sleepwalking must be a sign of genius i suppose i wish i did unusual things too then maybe every one would think i was a geniusas i am suppose i start a little sleepwalking of my own if only the girls would wake up and see it it would be a good way of showing them im a genius too but they all sleep so soundly still it was an idea and annemarie pondered over it a good deal making up her mind that when a suitable chance came she too would sleepwalk felicity did not remember anything about her sleepwalking the next day and was halfinclined to disbelieve annemaries account of it she shrugged her shoulders and went off to her musiclesson she could not find interest in anything but her beloved music these days annemarie was still trying her best to win back miss willcoxs smilesbut as the only way she knew was by pestering her to read her poems she was not very successful she so badly wanted praise and admiration for her talents that she did not see that miss willcox only had time for those who gave praise and admiration to her miss willcox was in many ways a grownup annemarie posing and posturing soaking up adulation and flattery from anyone who would give it to her she had no time for people like annemarie who also demanded it for this reason alison was very much her favourite alison had a real gift for making herself a willing slave to people of miss willcoxs type like jane for angela alison was pleased to do all kinds of jobs at all kinds of hours if she could please her idol miss willcox took advantage of this and kept the devoted alison quite busy felicity raised her arms as if playing the violin its a pity said her cousins shes even beginning to dress like miss willcoxrather untidy and bitty so she was she would appear in class with a startling belt round her slim waist or a scarf round her neck and had even managed to get some pins rather like miss willcox wore in her haironly alisons were gilttopped not gold dear little deirdre fan said bobby mockingly when she saw the pins holding back alisons pretty curly hair golly you and annemarie really are a pair look at annemarie shes got on a brooch just like the big ones our deirdre wears it was really funny to see the way the two girls vied with each other to imitate miss willcox but miss cornwallis was not pleased she eyed the two girls each day and said nothing at first for the fifth formers were allowed more freedom with their clothes than the forms below but when alison appeared with two scarves of different colours twined round her neck and annemarie came with an outsize pewter brooch that had a brilliant orange stone in the middle miss cornwallis could bear it no longer have you a sore throat alison she inquired jxlitely alison looked surprised no miss cornwallis she said then why two scarves alison said miss cornwallis still in a tone of great politeness which rang a warning in the ears of the class how well they knew that extrapolite tone it always spelt danger ii thought they looked nice stammered alison also hearing the warning in that cold polite voice well alison i had thought till this term that you had good taste said miss cornwallis you always looked tidy and neat and daintywellturned out in fact but this term you look like a thirdrate imitation of some little shopgirl who thinks the more colours and scarves and pins and brooches she wears the better she looks oh said poor alison scarlet in the face and annemarie seems to be going the same way said miss cornwallis looking at the wouldbe poet in a way that made her squirm and long to take off the enormous brooch what is that dinnerplate you are wearing annemarie do you really think it becomes you annemarie removed the brooch with trembling fingers she could not bear to have any faults pointed out in public thats better said miss cornwallis i dont know if you are imitating any one either of youbut let me tell you thisimitation is not always the sincerest form of flattery when you make yourselves look such silly little sights poor little deirdre fans whispered bobby to janet that was a crack at dear miss willcox i bet corny knows all about what sillies they are over her that was the end of alison and annemarie trying to dress like miss willcoxbut they still went on trying to imitate her deep drawling voice her graceful gestures and her rather roundshouldered walk the girls got very tired of it and tried to tease them out of it but alison thrilled because her dear deirdre was making such a friend of her was not in a state to listen to anything the others said and annemarie was too obstinate if alison could imitate miss willcox and please her by doing so then annemarie meant to as well tempers began to be rather short as the exam drew near hard work and worrying about the exam made most of the fifth form feel harassed and worn only bobby kept cheerful and claudine of course did not turn a hair even carlotta worried a little for she wanted to please her father who had said he would be proud if she passed this rather stiff exam well pauline worried a lot too she was not brainless and could do quite well if she tried but she did not like her studycompanion alma shes queer she told alison she doesnt seem to work at all just sits and stares at her book and eats and eats like a cow chewing cud shes always grumbling toosays the food isnt enough here and she wants more sweets and isnt allowed them its awful to swot over your work when a person like that sits opposite glowering and grumbling and chewing poor old pudding said alison thinking of the fat dull alma who was always at the bottom of the form the mistresses did not seem to be unduly upset at almas position in fact they rather seemed to take it for granted which was queer miss cornwallis always had a few sharp words to say to any of the others who stayed too long at the bottom of the form but she rarely spoke sarcastically to alma about her work its awful to live with somebody like alma all the time sighed poor pauline carlotta heard her and made a suggestion come in and share our study with me and claudine when you get too fed up she said generously for she did not really like pauline very much its a bit bigger than most peoples so therell be a corner for you if you like but dont do it too often or youll get almas back up oh thank you said pauline gratefully it will make such a difference if i can sometimes pop in next door to your study carlotta you will be cheerful company after alma she really is a pudding carlotta and claudine got on very well together the younger girls who came to do jobs for them liked them very much antoinette often came and strangely enough never made the kind of extraordinary mistakes she had made in angelas study one day antoinette found her sister alone and spoke to her with dancing eyes claudine our form is to have a midnight feast do you remember telling me of the fine feast you had when you were in the fourth formyou had a midnight picnic by the swimmingpool yes i remember said claudine and she sighed it is a pity to be in the fifth form we are so good now we do not have midnight feasts we do not play tricks you will enjoy your feast my little antoinette claudine could you tell us a good place to keep our cakes and tins and gingerbeer in asked antoinette we cant keep them in the common room and we darent hide them in our dormitory tell me where we can keep them in safety claudine thought hard there is a big cupboard just outside my study she said at last it has a key you shall put your things there antoinette and i will take the key then everything will be safe and i can give you the key when you wish for it you have only to put your head into my study and wink at meand i will come out with the key oh thank you a million times said antoinette the second form will be so pleased what a fine sister you are she disappeared and in due time the cupboard was piled full of eatables and drinks claudine removed the key now no one will find them she said and hung the key on a nail in her study but somebody did find them which was very unfortunate alma and the store cupboard alma did not at all like the way pauline deserted the study they both shared in the evenings pauline would sit for a little while trying to study then exasperated by almas continually chewing of chocolate gum or toffee she would gather up her books and disappear where are you going alma would call after her but pauline did not bother to reply so alma decided to see where pauline went to she popped her head out of her study door in time to see pauline go into the next study which was claudines and carlottas she stood and frowned pauline was not really friendly with either of themso why thought alma should she keep popping into their study she sat and brooded over the matter the next time that pauline disappeared she made up her mind to follow her into the next study after a while and see exactly what she was doing there it so happened that carlotta had had a big box of sugared candies sent to her by her grandmother and in her usual generous way she opened it and laid it on the table in front of claudine and pauline help yourselves whilst you work she said claudine looked longingly at the delicious candied sweets there were bits of lemon and orange and nut all candied round beautifully claudine however thought a great deal of her complexion which was very good and she took only one sweet meaning to make it last all the evening but pauline helped herself liberally she had very little pocketmoney to buy herself luxuries and sweets of this kind did not often come her way just as she was choosing her fourth sweet the door opened and alma came in could you lend me a maths book she asked rather selfconsciously oh youre here pauline i say what gorgeous sweets you never told me you had a lovely box like that pauline she thought it was paulines box because the girl was helping herself to them carlotta gave pauline no time to reply nor did claudine they both disliked alma and were afraid that seeing pauline there she might sit down and stay for the whole evening then there would be no sweets left heres the maths book alma said carlotta and threw her one shut the door after you added claudine alma glared she thought them very rude as indeed they were but who could bear to have alma sitting there all the evening pauline looked uncomfortable as alma went out and banged the door after her almost shaking the pictures from the wall shell be simply beastly to me now she said i suppose she spied after me and saw where i went whats the matter with her shes so terribly fat and pastylooking just overeating i should think said carlotta beginning to write an essay now shut up for a bit both of you i want to think alma was very angry that the three girls in the study had not asked her to have even one sweet she did no work at all that evening she sat and brooded over that enormous box of sweets alma had a craving for that kind of thing theyre mean pigs she thought really mean i shall get even with them though ill wait till carlotta and claudine are out and ill slip in and help myself to a few sweets i suppose theyre paulines and she took them in there to share with the others instead of sharing them with me so alma kept a watch to see when carlotta and claudine went out there was a little alcove some way up the passage over which a curtain hung if she stood there quite quietly she could see when the two girls left their study two evenings later her patience was rewarded pauline had gone to a debate alma slipped into the alcove and waited to see if carlotta and claudine would go to it at halftime as she had heard them say they would sure enough in a short while the study door opened and carlotta and claudine came out they went down the corridor talking alma waited till their footsteps had died away she was just going to slip out of the alcove and into the study when she heard footsteps returning she peeped out to see who it was it was claudine hurrying back she had just met antoinette who had given her a tin of sugar biscuits to hide in the cupboard with the other things claudine ran into her study took down the key of the cupboard went outside and unlocked it pushed in the tin then locked the door again and hung the key on its nail alma watched in the greatest amazement claudine hurried off to join the debate downstairs alma stepped out of the alcove her little eyes gleaming so that was where the fifth form kept their stores they must be going to have a party of some kind and they hadnt told her a word about it alma was trembling with rage how mean every one was it had been bad enough in the starchy sixth form the last term but really the fifth form were even worse the way they left her out of things alma walked into her own study and sat down heavily she looked across at the cupboard there there was absolutely nothing to eat nothingand it was ages till suppertimeand even then there wouldnt be much to eat she wondered where claudine kept the key of that store cupboard it would be fun just to have a peep inside and see what was therenot to eat any of it of courseoh no thought alma she wouldnt do that mean though the others had been not to ask her to share but she would dearly like to look there was no one about at all she tiptoed to claudines study and pushed open the door she looked round for the key could that be the one hanging on the nail by the fireplace she took it off and went to the cupboard in the passage outside with trembling fingers she slipped the key into the lock it turned easily it was the key alma opened the cupboard and looked inside the things that were there it seemed as if every single thing she liked was theresardines and tinned milk strawberry jam and pineapple in tins gingerbeer and a box of sweets biscuits and chocolate it was quite impossible for alma to resist the temptation to pilfer the cupboard just one of those chocolates just a biscuit to go with itjust a sweet or twot guiltily the girl helped herself then hearing footsteps hurriedly shut the door turned the key and slipped back into her own study she waited till the footsteps had gone by then ran into claudines study next door and returned the key to its nail for quite a long time alma sat and brooded over her discovery she felt certain that the fifth form were going to have a party she hadnt heard a word about itbut then nobody ever told her anything alma badly wanted the things in the cupboard her continual craving for food made her find excuses for the wrong thing she wanted to do its only right i should share even if they dont ask me im a fifth former and i ought to share in their treats well i shall share but in secret instead of with them at the party that will punish them for their meanness it will give them a shock to find a lot of the things gone it was a curious secret to have but alma found great pleasure in thinking about that store cupboard in bed at night and in class the next day she hugged the secret to herself and gave claudine many triumphant glances which the french girl was quite at a loss to understand alma began to go to the store cupboard whenever claudines study was empty she was very artful for she was careful not to take things whose absence would be very noticeable she did not take much of the barley sugar in the bottle there for instance because she knew it might catch claudines eye but she carefully took all the bottom row of the box of chocolates which would not be noticed till the first row was eaten she took a few biscuits from each row in the big tin not one whole row she drank half of each gingerbeer bottle but filled each one up with water so that it would seem as if the bottles had not been tampered with she enjoyed being cunning like this poor almaher whole interest seemed to lie in food more food and yet more food fat unwieldy and pastyfaced with no friends few brains and a sly suspicious nature she was not a happy person she had a wonderful time pilfering the store cupboard claudine added a few more things to it never suspecting that many had already gone alma was very clever at getting the key and taking food when no one was about if she had only used half as much brain in class as she did in stealing from the cupboard she would not have been so far down at the bottom of the form then one evening something happened pauline claudine and carlotta had gone down to the common room of the fourth form to discuss something with the girls there and alma alone in her study planned to take some biscuits and some chocolateperhaps she might even take a tin of sardines as there were now five or six of them she could open them when she was alone in her own study she stole out and got the key from the study next door she had just put it into the lock of the cupboard and turned it when she heard some one coming in a panic she fled to her own study next door only just disappearing in time but the key fell out of the lock with a clang and lay on the floor it was alison coming she heard the key fall and was surprised she picked it up when she came to it and put it into the cupboard lock the door swung open and to alisons surprise she saw the stores there she was still staring in amazement when claudine came along gave an exclamation and slammed the door shut she glared at alison did you get the key from my study well really alison i did not think it of you what business is it of yours alison was puzzled from your study she said of course not some one must have been at the cupboard and opened it when i came along because i heard footsteps scurrying away and then heard the key fall out of the lock i put it back the door swung open and i saw the things i dont want to know anything at all about the food claudine and i certainly shant tell any onebut its obvious that somebody knows about the cupboard isnt it claudine believed alison at once alison might be weak and silly in many ways but she was honest and truthful claudine swung the door open and looked into the cupboard very thoughtfully so some one knew of the storessome one knew where the key was kept some one knew the secret it wasnt long before claudine discovered that the someone had also taken various things from the stores she shut the door and locked it angry and puzzled some ones been at the things she said to alison but as far as i know only i and my little sister antoinette knew the hidingplace the second form are to have a midnight feast and i have kept their food under lock and key for them who could have found out the hidingplace and who could be dishonest enough to steal the things i cant imagine said alison amazed it is such a mean lowdown thing to do who ever did it is absolutely despicable its unbelievable anyway claudine if i were you id keep the key somewhere about your person then the thief whoever it is wont be able to get it almaalisonand annemarie alma heard all this conversation quite clearly she felt a wave of anger against alison interfering little busybody now she alma would not be able to feast herself on the hidden goodies any more she sat per fectly still hoping that neither of the girls would come into her study and see her there she felt guilty and was sure her guilt would show in her face but they did not come it did not occur to either of them that the thief would be anywhere near they felt sure she had run away maybe it was a second former but how disgusting whoever it was the next time alma had a chance of tiptoeing into the study next to hers the key was missing she had feared it would be she supposed that claudine had it round her neck in safety now alma would not be able to enjoy those delicious deceitful little feasts any more the girl made a curiously big thing out of the whole happening and for a few days thought of nothing else she hated alison for being the unwitting cause of depriving her of the food she craved for ill pay her out she thought spoiling things for me like this ill get even with her alma was strangely clever in underhand ways stupid people can often be cunning and alma was no exception she set her wits to work and alison began to go through an unpleasant and most annoying time things kept disappearing out of her study never angelas things but always alisons wheres my hairslide wailed alison its gone and i only saw it on the windowsill this morning have you borrowed it angela of course not said angela youve dropped it somewhere then it was alisons hairbrush that disappeared from her dressingtable in the dormitory she hunted all over for it and then had to report the loss to matron who was not very pleased how can you possibly mislay a aatrbrush she said to alison i suppose youve been using it in a bedroom battle or something and its flown out of the window we fifth formers dont have bedroom battles said alison with much dignity then her geometry outfit went it completely and utterly vanished and no amount of hunting brought it to light bobby had two and lent her one but for goodness sake dont lose it she said you seem to be losing everything this term the same day alisons knitting needles disappeared out of the scarf she was knitting and the stitches all pulled out loose when she took the work out of her bag now this is very queer said alison and she held it up to show angela lookthe needles are goneand au the stiches are dropped angelawhat do you think of that well said angela i think some ones doing beastly things to you alison i do really and i bet i know who it is too who said alison feeling shocked and hurt some one who is awfully jealous of you said angela you dont meanannemarie said alison still more shocked oh angelasurely she wouldnt do mean things like this do you think that shes been taking all those things of mine that disappeared too oh noshe couldnt be as low down as that people say that when any one is jealous they dont mind what they do said angela and you know annemarie is awfully jealous because you are so well in with your dear deirdre and at the moment she isnt in deirdres good books why she cant see that her dear idol is bored stiff with her poems i really dont know shes a beast if she is really taking my things and spoiling my knitting said alison almost in tears the girl always loved to be liked by every one and it hurt her very much to think that one of her own form could be so unkind i shant listen to a single one of her silly poems now so much to annemaries surprise neither angela nor alison evinced the slightest interest in a long new poem called the weary heart which she went along to their study to read out loud that evening were busy said alison shortly and you ought to be too said angela virtuously the exam is coming jolly near it wont take long to read my poem to you said annemarie crestfallen this is how it begins do get out said angela im doing maths and they dont go with poetry even if the poem is called the weary heart which is very descriptive of mine at the moment why dont you write a poem called the missing knittingneedles said alison unexpectedly annemarie stared at her puzzled why knittingneedles she inquired at last well you ought to know oughtnt you said alison but annemarie didnt thinking that alison and angela were rude and unkind and a little mad she went away carrying her precious poem with her she bumped into miss willcox on her way and gave a gasp ohmiss willcoxplease would you read this i spent hours over it last night miss willcox took the poem and glanced at it it was the same kind as usual pretentious full of long words solemn sad and far too long miss willcox felt impatient she determined to be candid with annemarie now that she had her alone look here annemarie she said in her deep voice i want to give you a little adviceand i want you to listen to it carefully and follow it oh yes miss willcox said annemarie fervently i will indeed i will well said miss willcox you cant write poetry and you may as well know it you can rhyme and get the metre rightbut your ideas are rubbish real poetry has ideas in it beautiful pictures great feelings tear up all your poems annemarie and set your mind on the coming exam that is my advice to you you think youre a genius well youre not you are just an ordinary little schoolgirl who has got swelled head and thinks she can write it is my opinion that unless your character changes considerably you never will write a really good poem miss willcox swept off glad to have relieved her mind of the irritation that annemarie and her neverending poems always aroused in her annemarie struck absolutely dumb gazed after her too hurt even for tears her knees felt rather weak she went to her study and sat down felicity was there conning over some music theory humming softly to herself she did not even see annemarie come in it took a little time for all that miss willcox had said to sink in poor annemarie had had the greatest shock of her life all her great ideas about herself began to totter and waver wasnt she a genius couldnt she write marvellously she began to feel as if she wasnt annemarie any moreshe was nobody nobody at all she gave a sudden loud sob that entered even felicitys ears whats up said felicity looking round oh you wouldnt understand said annemarie bitterly youre a genius you dont seem to live in this world you dont notice anything that goes on at all you dont even know im here half the time well what does it matter im nobody not even annemarie ive had everything stripped away from me everything i cared about dont exaggerate so said felicity mildly surprised at this curious outburst cant you find the right rhyme for one of your poems is that what has upset you oh youre impossible said annemarie and threw a book at felicity which surprised her even more annemarie went out of the room felicity was at once absorbed in her work again little creases between her eyes her headache bothering her as usual annemarie was hurt shocked and resentful she wondered if miss willcox could possibly be right after all she knew about poetry so she ought to know if anne maries was good or bad annemarie thought a great deal about miss willcox that evening and what she had said her resentment made her begin to see the english mistress rather more dearly than usual she remembered how the girls laughed at her posing and pretence her vague ways and soulful looks almost in a flash her adoration turned to detestation poor annemarie all the things she cared for had indeed been reft from her suddenly her pride in herself and in her genius was gone her hopes for the future her confidence that miss willcox liked and admired her even her poems nowseemed worthless she half thought she would do as miss willcox had so coldly advised her and tear them up but a doubt still persisted in her mind about the teachers ability to know really know whether her annemaries poems were good suppose she tore them up and wrote no more and suppose after all miss willcox was wrong and her poems were goodwhat a loss to the world they might be if only i could find out whether or not miss willcox is as good a judge as she always sets out to be thought annemarie quite obsessed by the subject but how could i i dont see how i could then a way came to her and she thought so deeply about it that she didnt even hear alison speaking to her as she passed ill do it thought annemarie exultantly ill do it ill find some littleknown poem of one of the very great poetsmatthew arnold perhaps or browsingand ill write it out in my own handwritingand next time we have to write a poem for miss willcox ill send in not a poem of my own but a classic she got up to go to the school library to look through the books of poets there if miss willcox praises the poem i shall know she genuinely appreciates good poetryif she sneers at it thinking it is mine i shall know she doesnt ah miss willcox we shall see annemarie was soon busy turning over the pages of matthew arnold tennyson and browning she felt as if her whole happiness her whole future depended on this she must be careful not to choose a poem at all wellknown or certainly miss willcox would recognize it she must choose one as like her own style as possible something yearning and soulful and rather highbrow ah annemarie meant to test miss willcox no matter whether she cheated or not in doing so now that her liking for miss willcox had so suddenly vanished annemaries jealously of alison disappeared too silly little alison she thought pityingly as she shut one book of poems and opened another but alison not knowing anything about miss willcoxs unkindness to annemarie and its result still thought that the other girl was jealous of her and put down the annoying disappearances of her things to spite on annemaries part alma knew this and rejoiced it made things much easier for her if alison so clearly suspected some one else she took a few more things enjoying poor alisons exasperation and annoyance to alma the loss of the hidden food in the cupboard was as great a blow as miss willcoxs words had been to annemarie mirabel is very highhanded the second formers decided to have their feast in their own dormitory which was conveniently far from any mistresss quarters they asked the first form to join them and there was great rejoicing among the younger ones at this jolly decent of them said sally i vote we get in a spot of food ourselves dont you think so jane jane was not as thrilled as the others she had been very quiet and subdued lately hurt at mirabels neglect of her and at her unjust suspicion regarding the ringing of the firebell which mystery still had not been cleared up she worked hard for angela finding comfort in the older girls liking and praise and still did a good deal of her work at night under the sheets cheer up jane sally kept saying you look like a hen caught in the rain do cheer up jane tried to smile she had been very afraid of suddenly bursting into tears lately a most unusual thing for her to do it will be fun having a midnight feast she said trying to think it would be fun but somehow nothing seemed fun lately it was so awful to be left out of matches when she knew she was better than the others what was the use of practising hard every spare minute she had when mirabel kept treating her like this it wasnt fair thought jane resentfully it really wasnt claudine had told antoinette of the pilfering of the cupboard and the second formers were annoyed and puzzled for antoinette had told no one of the hidingplace still there was plenty of food left so never mind antoinette went to claudine claudine we are to have our feast tomorrow night can i have the key of the cupboard please i and one of the others will come up here very quietly just before midnight and get the things here is the key said claudine taking it off a thin string she wore round her neck now dont make a noise tomorrow night whatever you do have a good time i wish i was coming too antoinette grinned she was enjoying this first term at st clares like claudine she had slipped out of things she did not like had played many undetected pranks and had enjoyed the fun and the jolly companion ship she took the key and went off she hadnt gone far before she retraced her footsteps how many bottles of gingerbeer were there would there be enough now that the first form was coming she slipped the key in the lock and turned it alma in her study heard the click of the lock how well she knew it she peeped out of the door why it was antoinette at the cupboard not claudine she went out of the door antoinette jumped violently and shut the door what have you got in that cupboard said alma in a smooth voice let me see before antoinette could object she grabbed the key from her and opened the cupboard then she pretended to be very surprised at the contents good gracious what is all this does it belong to you antoinette antoinette hesitated she disliked alma and did not trust her but what could she do if she was rude alma might be most unpleasant i see it is a secret said alma longing to take one of the tins of pineapple give me one of those tins antoinette and i will not tell any one of this at all i suppose you are going to have a midnight feast yes tomorrow said antoinette disliking alma even more im sorry i cant give you a tin alma i should have to ask the others first it is not a nice thing for you to ask anywayi do not like a bargain of this sort antoinette shut the door firmly and locked it again before alma had made up her mind what to do she took the key from the lock and stuffed it into her pocket eyeing alma defiantly i will ask the others if you may have a tin of pineapple if you wish me to alma she said butsurely you do not wish me to alma scowled of course she could not have antoinette telling the second form that she wanted a tin of pineapple she tried to laugh it off dont be silly i didnt really mean it i dont like pineapple welli hope you enjoy your feast you wont tell tales of us will you said antoinette distrusting alma more and more you promise that wont you the second form would think you were terrible to tell such a tale alma you have the english sense of honour have you not this honour that always you english girls are talking of of course said alma walking off with what dignity she could muster she went into her study she thought of the food in that cupboard she thought of antoinettes halfveiled insolence probably she would tell the second formers about the tin of pineapple she had asked for and they would nudge each other when she passed and giggle alma wished she could tell tales and get the feast stopped but who would listen to her she would not dare to carry tales to miss theobald or miss corowallis nor was she certain that hilary the headgirl of the form would even listen to her then a thought struck her what about mirabel mirabel was so keen on sportsand there was a match the day after next she would not be at all pleased if she knew that the first and second form were going to have a midnight feast just before the match mirabel should be told about it and maybe in her blunt overbearing way she would stop it that would punish antoinette all right alma did not dare to go to mirabel direct she printed a note so that her handwriting would not be recognized and did not sign her name at the end do not expect the third team to win its match on friday said the note they will all be up at midnight mirabel found the note on her table in the study that evening she picked it up in curiosity and read it gladys she said tossing the note over to her what in the world does this mean gladys read it distastefully its a wretched anonymous letter she said sent by some one who wants to tell tales and doesnt dare to do it openly beastly tear it up and put it in the wastepaper basket dont take any notice of it thats the way to treat letters of that sort yes but gladysthe third lacrosse team wont win their match if they are up at midnight argued mirabel and i do want them to ive set my heart on it i suppose theyre going to have a midnight feast or something silly kids theyll be tired out next day well didnt you enjoy midnight feasts when yon were in the lower forms said gladys have you forgotten what fun they were we didnt have them just before an important match said mirabel we didnt gladys for goodness sake dont think of stopping the feast or whatever it is said gladys alarmed you cant interfere like that mirabel and be such a spoilsport mirabel thought for a few moments i know what to do ill send a note to katie whos head of the second form and inform her that i have heard there is to be something going on at midnight tomorrow and i would like her to see that it is put off till after the match they will respect my wishes i am surethen they can play the match properly without being tired and have their feast afterwards well i shouldnt even do that said gladys i dont think the feast will really make much difference to the matchand anyway only about a quarter of the girls are playing in ithardly that you never back me up in anything now said mirabel frowning she said no more but busied herself in writing a short note to the headgirl of the second form katie got it that day and read it in surprise she showed it to antoinette however did mirabel get wind of our plans she said have you told any one antoinette wellonly alma said the french girl and she told katie what had happened at the store cupboard how awful said katie shocked at the tale and at almas behaviour i sayi wonder if she was the one who pilfered our stores perhaps said antoinette she is not a nice girl that one katie called a meeting of the second formers in the common room and read them mirabels note it was as might be expected rather arrogant and peremptory evidently mirabel expected to be obeyed and that was that i vote we have the feast tomorrow night as planned said yolande mirabel has been throwing her weight about too much lately i call that a most uncivil note anyway what business is it of hers shes always interfering now every one followed yolandes lead it was curious how unpopular mirabel had become she had tried to drive every one too fast and now they were digging their toes in and refusing to budge id better not answer this note of mirabels today had i said katie ill answer it after weve had the feast then she cant stop it mirabel was surprised to have no answer from katie giving an undertaking to postpone the feast till after the match but it did not occur to her at all that the first and second formers would dare to defy her she felt puzzled and thought that katie was not very mannerly surely she knew that an answer should always be sent at once to any request from one of the top form girls the first and second form were getting excited it was the first time they had had a feast at night and to them it seemed a terribly exciting thing every single girl was going violet was back from the san now after a bout of flu and was looking forward to it too jane tried to look forward to it but she was feeling very unhappy then a dreadful quarrel blew up between her and violet and jane felt as if she couldnt bear things any more violet had come back from the san expecting to do angelas jobs as usual she had been disappointed because angela had not even sent a kindly message to her when she was ill never mindangela would be very glad to see her back doing her cleaning and mending as before thought violet but angela didnt want violet mooning round again she had got used to the quiet and efficient little jane who so long as she got a smile and a word of praise now and again seemed to be quite content violet was too talkative and always liked to recount all her thoughts and doings which was very boring to the selfcentred angela so to violets enormous dismay angela did not greet her warmly and merely informed her that perhaps she would like to go and see to paulines jobs as jane was doing everything necessary violet did not dare to argue with angelar but rushed off to jane at once you underhand thing she said her eyes sparkling with anger you go behind my back when im ill and worm yourself into angelas good graces againand do all the things she was letting me do jane teal i shall never speak to you again and neither will half the first form jane tried to defend herself but violet had a ready tongue and could say some bitter cutting things jane was tired out and unhappy and she burst into tears just like you said violet scornfully you think youll get sympathy just because you cry wellyou just burst into tears with angela and see what she says she cant stand anything of that sort jane could not help feeling that perhaps she had done a mean trick to violet she hardly slept at all that night and in the morning she awoke with a sore throat and a headache which made her feel more miserable than ever its a good thing im not playing in the match tomorrow she thought and wondered if mirabel would ever put her name down for a match again jane felt rather queer that day she had a high temperature and didnt know it she did badly on the lacrosse field and mirabel ticked her off she could not concentrate in class and miss roberts was not pleased violet avoided her and some of the other first formers who were friends of violets did not speak to her either i wish i was at home thought jane longingly if i could just tell mother all about it id feel better i cant write it in a letter i wish i could go home the idea grew and grew in her worried mind and at last jane made a plan she would never have made if she had been quite well instead of going to the feast she would go home luckily for her her home was actually in the next village four miles away jane felt sure she could easily walk there in the middle of the night then she would see her mother tell her everything and things would be all right again she did not know she was beginning to have flu and had a temperature she had no idea she was not normal just then sally could not get a word out of her and was worried poor janeshe was not having an easy time just then but never mind she thought ill be home tonight a surprising night that friday night was to be a most astonishing one for mamzelle though she did not know it she never forgot it and whenever she took a holiday in her beloved france she would often recount the happenings of that night to show her enraptured listeners how queer were the english girls it was the night of the feast and the first and second formers were to have it at twelve oclock sharp in one of their dormitories antoinette had already secreted some of the things on the top of a high cupboard in her dormitory and meant to fetch the rest just before midnight mirabel unfortunately had seen antoinette hurrying along the corridor outside her study carrying various suspicious parcels she had called alter antoinette but antoinette had thought it advisable not to hear and had scurried fast round the corner almost knocking over miss willcox mirabel stared after the disappearing antoinette in exasperation really these kids were getting too uncivil for words she went back into her own study and frowned could those kids be going to have their feast that night after allwhen she had asked them not to could they flout her request in that waysurely not all the same a doubt persisted in mirabels mind and she could not get rid of it she said nothing to gladys but she made up her mind to keep awake that night and to go along to the first or second form dormitories about midnight to see if anything was happening and if there iswont i give them a talking to thought mirabel grimly ill report them too ill make them see they cant disregard my orders now annemarie had planned to stage a sleepwalking act that night she had thought of quite a lot of things to do which were extraordinary and might make people say ah she does those because shes a genius as so often was said of the absentminded felicity but she rather doubted her ability to carry them off in front of the sharpeyed quickminded members of the fifth form it would never do to put on some sort of genius act and have the others roar with laughter disbelieve in it and tell her it was all put on it was getting to be quite imperative to annemarie to be thought really clever she had to do something to cancel out the damping effect of miss willcoxs words who would be taken in most easily she thought for a while and then decided on mamzelle she had heard of the many tricks the girls had played on the french mistress through the years and she felt sure she would take in mamzelle mamzelle would exclaim and waggle her hands and tell every one she would say ah la petite annemarie she walks in her sleep she recites poetry as she walks she is a genius we must be careful of her we must cherish this talented girl one day she will be famous yes certainly mamzelle would be the best one to impress the middle of the night would be the best time she would find some means of waking mamzelle and bring her out in the passage and then she would let her see her apparently walking in her sleep reciting lines and lines of poetry mamzelle would be most impressed and perhaps even miss theobald would think that annemarie was a genius and ask to see some of her poems annemarie was really very pleased with her idea she quite looked forward to putting it into practice that night about halfpast twelve or so she thought that would be the best time every one will be asleep by then she had of course chosen a most unfortunate night for her sleepwalking for quite a number of people were going to be wideawake all the first and second formers would be revelling in their feast jane teal would be stealing through the school meaning to run off home mirabel would be on the prowl to find out if the younger girls were really having their feast alma would be snooping about to see if there was likely to be any food left in the cupboard antoinette and one or two others would be fetching the rest of the food and felicity was to choose that night for sleepwalking toobut genuine sleepwalking in her case so there would be quite a number of people wandering about though annemarie hadnt the remotest idea of this all the girls went off to bed as usual at their ordinary times the first and second formers went first giggling with excitement vowing that they wouldnt sleep a wink till midnight antoinette and sally were to be responsible for rousing any one who did go to sleep it was thrilling to look forward to such an escapade the third and fourth formers went off to bed later the fifth and sixth could stay up till ten oclock and usually did they all retired as usual even felicity who often did not go till much later lost as usual in her music it was astonishing that no mistress had discovered her light burning so late in her study but so far no one had then the mistresses went to bed yawning having a last word together before they parted mamzelle was the last to go she had a pile of french essays from the sixth form to go through and had left them rather late i will correct these and then go she thought glancing at the clock halfpast eleven already how slow i have been tonight at just about five minutes to twelve mamzelle went into her bedroom at twelve oclock she was getting into bed and the bed was about to creak under her rather heavy weight when some sound caught her ears it sounded as if something hard had been dropped on the floor immediately above her head mamzelle sat on the side of the bed and pondered over the various possible causes of the noise it was not the cat it was not the unexpected groan or creak that furniture sometimes gave at night it was not any mistress on the prowl because all had gone to bed then what could it be mamzelle thought hard she knew that the fifth form studies were above her bedroom stretching in a long couple of rows down and around two corridors surely no one could possibly be up still the fifth form must all be in bed another small sound decided mamzelle she had better go and investigate it might be a burglar mamzelle had a horror of burglars but she felt it her duty to find out whether there was one in the school or not feeling extremely brave and arming herself with a hairbrush she put on her dressinggown and slippers tied the girdle tightly round her plump waist and opened her bedroom door all the passages and corridors of st clares were lighted throughout the night but with specially dimmed lights it was possible to see a figure but not to make out who it was the corridors looked rather eerie to mamzelle as she set out on her journey of investigation the first thing that mamzelle did was to fall over the school cat who was an enormous black fellow much given to wandering around at night seeing mamzelle perfectly clearly though she could not see him at all he advanced upon her and tried to rub against her ankles delighted to see a fellowwanderer in the night mamzelle gave a muffled shriek and almost overbalanced one of her big feet caught the cat on its side and it gave one of its yowls mamzelle recognized the cats voice and was relieved to find that it was not a burglar lying on the floor to catch her foot but only the cat sssst she said in a piercing sibilant whisper and the cat fled grieved at mamzelles lack of friendliness mamzelle went up the stairs to the next floor where she had heard the noise antoinette was up there on her third journey to collect the eatables with sally to her horror she suddenly heard mamzelles piercing ssssst noise from the floor below she clutched sally somebodys about did you hear that oh how tiresome sally what shall we do theres an alcove near here whispered sally look where that curtain is well get behind there with our tins and bottles quick maybe whoever it is will pass by dont sneeze or anything the two girls pressed themselves behind the curtain their hearts beating fast they heard mamzelles foot steps coining along making a soft swishing noise in her big bedroom slippers they stood quite still mamzeue came to the alcove she thought the curtain bulged suspiciously and she put out a trembling hand she distinctly felt some soft body behind it she gave a gasp antoinette and sally decided to make a bolt for it and suddenly shot out from the alcove dropping a gingerbeer bottle on poor mamzelles toes she gave an anguished groan lifted her foot and did a few heavy hops over to the opposite wall putting out a hand to steady herself when she got there she caught sight of two figures racing down the dim passage and round the corner she had no idea whether they were burglars or girls as she felt her corns tenderly wrath swept over her how dared people drop things on her feet in the middle of the night and then run away without apologizing mamzelle determined to chase the scamps whoever they were and run them to earth she did not see the gingerbeer bottle lying at her feet and she fell over it as she went swiftly down the passage stubbing her other foot this time the bottle went rolling off and hit the wall mamzeue stopped again and groaned she ran down the passage and came to the corner there was no one to be seen there the passage went completely round the third floor of the building and came back again where it began and mamzelle thought it would be a good idea to go the whole way and see if any one was about on that floor so off she set determined to run to earth whoever was up so late at night padpadpad went her feet and every now and again mamzelle set her pincenez firmly on her nose for they had an irritating way of jumping off when she ran padpadpadthe chase was onl mamzelle on the warpath alma was the next one to be dimly seen by mamzelle she had teen certain that antoinette would go to the store cupboard that night and would probably make two or three visits probably in between she would leave the door open then thought greedy alma she might be able to pop in and take something for herself a tin of pineapple for instance she seemed to crave for a tin of pineapple so making sure that the rest of her dormitory were asleep alma rose quietly from her bed and went up the stairs to the third floor she made her way to the cupboard just at the same moment as mamzelle panting came round the last of the four comers of the corridor back again to where the alcove was the store cupboard was quite near mamzelle saw a figure in the passage ahthere was one of the midnight wanderers at least mamzelle would teach them to drop things on her poor toes she crept up behind the unsuspecting alma who was half in the cupboard groping about for a tin of some kind alma had the shock of her life when she felt a hand on her shoulder she lunged out in fright and struck poor mamzelle square in the middle mamzelle doubled up at once and gave such a deep groan that alma was horrified she could not move an inch but stood there trembling mamzelle recovered rapidly she felt certain that this must be a burglar rifling cupboards he was dangerous he had given her a terrible blow the big coward mamzelle was not going to come to grips with him giving alma a sudden push which landed her among the tins bottles and old rugs she shut the door firmly locked it and took the key ha said mamzelle addressing the alarmed alma in the cupboard now i have you under key and lock i go for the police with this terrifying threat she padded of to telephone to the police she went downstairs congratulating herself heartily on her smartness and bravery and feeling her middle tenderly to see if she was bruised as soon as she got downstairs she saw jane teal who had chosen that moment to creep away from the others put on her hat and coat and go to find a sidedoor she could open quietly but poor little jane was now feeling very ill the flu was sending her temperature high and she felt as if she was in a dream all she wanted was to get to her mother and to do that she knew she must get out of st clares and walk and walk so hardly knowing what she was doing she felt with a feverish hand along the wall to find the sidedoor she muttered to herself as she went i must find the door thats the first thing i must find the door mamzelle heard the muttering and stopped in amazement and alarm could this be yet another burglar who was this person groping along the wallwith a hat on too mamzelle could not see in the dim light what kind of a person it was but having got the idea of burglars firmly in her mind she felt certain this must be another probably the second of the two she had first seen racing down the upstairs passage she began to tiptoe cautiously after jane jane felt along the wall till she came to a door here is a door she muttered i must open it and go out ive found a door but it was not the sidedoor leading into the garden it was the door of the second form games cupboard full of lacrosse sticks old goalnets a few discarded raincoats and such things as this jane opened the door and went into the cupboard mamzelle triumphant saw a chance of repeating her recent brilliance and of locking this second burglar into a cupboard too she darted forward shut the door and locked it leaving poor jane in the darkness among things that felt most extraordinary to her hot little fingers i want to go home said jane and suddenly sank down on to a pile of sticks and nets for her legs felt as if they would no longer cany her she lay there feverish and halfdreaming not knowing or caring in the least where she was mamzelle could not help feeling very proud of herself what other mistress at st clares could catch and imprison two burglars in one night like this mamzelle began to think she was wasted as a french mistress she should have been in the police force now i go to the telephone she said to herself thinking with delight of the astonishment of the police when they heard her news but she was not yet to broadcast her news for even as she went into the hall she saw somebody else this time it was felicity walking in her sleep trying to find the assembly room so that she might once again mount the platform and play her imaginary violin she walked solemnly her eyes wide open humming a melody in a low soft voice she had on her white nightgown and mamzelle was absolutely petrified to see this figure walking towards her making a queer low humming tiens said mamzelle and took a step backwards for the first time she began to wonder whether the nights happenings were real or whether she might be dreaming it seemed astonishing that so many people were about in the middle of the night this could not be a burglar it looked like something unearthlya spirit wandering about lost and lone mamzelle shivered burglars she had been able to deal withbut spirits were different they faded away they disappeared into thin air if they were touched and mamzelle did not like things of that sort she decided not to go to the telephone just then as she would have to meet this wandering spirit face to face she would retire to her bedroom for a little while till the spirit had returned to wherever it had come from so mamzelle turned tail and fled but for some reason felicity fast asleep as she was seemed to perceive mamzelle as she disappeared towards the stairs into her dreaming mind came the idea that this person might take her to the platform so that she might play her wonderful compositions and she followed mamzelle up the stairs her eyes glassy and wide open her hands outstretched mamzelle glanced behind and was most alarmed to find the white spirit following her she had not bargained for this at all she almost ran to get to her bedroom on the second floor felicity followed seeming almost to float up the stairs for she was tall and thin and much too light for her age mamzelle bolted into her bedroom and sat down on her bed out of breath the door opened and felicity came in her eyes still wide open as mamzelle had her light on she saw at once that what she had thought was a frightening apparition was only felicity tims said mamzelle putting her hand up to her forehead tiens what kind of a night is this when burglars and children walk around felicity my child are you awake there was something rather terrifying about felicitys white unawakened face mamzelle saw that she was sound asleep and was afraid to wake her she was more lјan relieved when felicity feeling the bed drew back the covers got into it and shut her eyes in a minute or two she was apparently sleeping quite peacefully mamzelle stared down at the pale face on her pillow to have two burglars shut into two separate cupboards and a sleepwalking girl in her bed was rather bewildering she could not make up her mind whether to telephone to the police or to go and call miss theobald and show her felicity mamzelle had had enough experience of girls to know that sleepwalking was not a good thingsomething had happened to make felicity act in this way and that something must be investigated there was a noise upstairs again antoinette and sally had returned to the cupboard for eatables and had found the door locked the key gone and a prisoner in the cupboard in amazement and fear they fled back to their dormitory to tell the others mamzelle disturbed by the noise they made went out of her bedroom and as an afterthought turned the key in the lock in case felicity should try a little more sleepwalking she was just in time to see antoinette and sally two vague figures in the distance running back to their dormitory tiens said mamzelle again thunderstruck to find yet more people abroad that night do i sleep or wake everywhere i go i see people fleeing in the night the next person mamzelle saw was mirabel who was creeping down the stairs to see if the second formers were holding their feast after all mamzelle could not believe her eyes was the whole school wandering about that nightor was this yet another burglar mirabel was a tall strapping girl and she wore pyjamas in the dim passage she looked as big as a man and mamzelle felt certain this must be another of the gang of burglars that appeared to be infesting st clares that night she followed her trying to make no noise at all it was becoming quite a commonplace for mamzelle to lock people up that night and she fondly imagined she could somehow imprison this burglar also mirabel went towards the second form dormitories mamzelle afraid that the burglar might scare the girls there humed her steps the school cat reappeared at this moment and tripped poor mamzelle up so that she made a noise mirabel looked round and slipped quickly into one of the bathrooms that ran opposite the dormitories she did not want any of the second formers to know she was snooping round in case by any chance they were not holding the feast after all mamzelle saw with great pleasure that once again she could lock somebody into somewhere she began to think that burglarcatching was the easiest thing in the worldmerely a matter of turning a key in a lock she turned the key in the shut bathroom doorand there was yet another burglar accounted forl mamzelle thought with delight of the surprise and admiration of the other mistresses when they heard of her exploits she felt ready to imprison half a dozen more burglars into cupboards and bathrooms if necessary mirabel was horrified at being locked in she had no idea who had turned the key but thought it was some silly trick of one of the younger girls so she settled down to wait for the door to be undone she felt sure no girl would keep her imprisoned all night long mamzelle decided that she would now go to miss theobald as she felt that no policeman would be inclined to believe a telephone call from her about three lockedup burglars so she padded along the passage to the stairs but just as she was about to descend them she caught sight of yet another night wanderer this time it was annemarie who was now putting on her sleepwalking act in imitation of felicity and was on her way to wake up mamzelle mamzelle could not believe her eyes when she saw yet another sleepwalker no really she must be going mad there could not be so many people rushing about at night in the school passages annemarie saw mamzelle standing under one of the dimmed lamps and recognized her at first she got a shock for she had expected mamzelle to be in bed and not ambling about but as soon as she was sure it really was mamzelle she acted exactly as if she was walking in her sleep she glided by mamzelle her eyes set and staring just as felicitys had been muttering a poem mamzelle hesitated to grab her for she had heard it was bad to awaken sleepwalkers suddenly so she did not touch annemarie but followed her whispering under her breath the poor child here is another who walks in her sleep i will follow her annemarie led mamzelle a fine dance and finally ended up outside the second form dormitories the girl on guard there gave the alarm when she saw the two figures coming and there was a terrific scramble as bottles and tins and plates were pushed under beds the candles were blown out and girls got hurriedly into bed those who didnt belong to that dormitory squeezing into wardrobes and under beds annemarie still acting wandered into the second form dormitory meaning to walk to the end and backbut she fell over an empty bottle and gave an exclamation mamzelle followed her into the room and switched on the light annemarie dazed by the sudden light blinked in confusion watched in amazement by girls in bed then remembering her sleepwalking act she once again became glassyeyed and glided between the beds the girls sat up giggling shes pretending called antoinette ah no she walks in her sleep the poor poor child said mamzelle what can we do for her i will cure her ma tante said the irrepressible antoinette and leapt out of bed she took a jug of cold water and threw it all over poor annemarie who angry and wet turned and gave antoinette such a ticking off that all the girls knew at once that she certainly had not been sleepwalking before but only playacting mamzelle realized it too and tried to haul annemarie out of the room scolding her vigorously and telling her to go and change her wet things at once so engrossed was she that she entirely failed to see any signs of the midnight feast nor did she notice any of the girls squashed into the wardrobes or under the beds antoinette threw the jug of cold water at annemarie golly said sally as soon as mamzelle had gone ofl with annemarie i dont believe she even saw the signs of our feast not even that bottle that rolled out from under a bed bit of luck for us said violet come on lets finish everything up quickly and hide the things and get to bed before mamzelle thinks of coming back the girls giggled mirabel shut in the bathroom just opposite heard them and knew they were still enjoying their feast she grew very angry indeed she felt certain one of the second formers had locked her in and she was determined to report the whole lot of them and have them well punished mamzelle took annemarie to matrons room and woke matron up explaining volubly about annemarie and why she was wet annemarie her sleepwalking act quite ruined wept copiously fearing that she would be tiie laughing stock of the school next day now stop that silly crying said matron briskly giving annemarie a vigorous rubdown with a very rough towel she had long ago sized up annemarie as a silly swollenheaded girl just the kind to act about like this i must go said mamzelle remembering the various people she had locked up that night i have burglars to see to matron stared what did you say she inquired i said i have burglars to see to said mamzelle with dignity i have spent the night chasing people round the corridors and locking them up i go to miss theobald now and she will telephone to the police ah the people i have chased tonight you would not believe it matron matron didnt she thought mamzelle must be dreaming well you go and get miss theobald and the police and whatever else you like she said rubbing annemarie so hard that she groaned but dont bring me any more wet girls to dry in the middle of the night i dont approve of them mamzelle went off she came to miss theobalds bedroom and knocked on the door a surprised voice came from inside yes who is it it is mamzelle said mamzelle and opened the door pardon me for coining at this time of the night miss theobaldbut i have burglars locked up in cupboards and a sleepwalker in my bedroom a little unlocking miss theobald listened to mamzelles tale in the utmost astonishment it seemed to her as if all the corridors of st clares must have been peopled with burglars robbers thieves and others the whole of the nightbut what was even more astonishing was the thought of mamzelle who was terrified even of mice and beetles valiantly chasing the burglars and more remarkable still locking them up wholesale she could hardly believe it she looked closely at mamzelle and wondered if the french mistress could possibly have dreamt it all she got out of bed and put on her dressinggown i think before i telephone the police you had better show me where you locked these men up she said mamzelle trotted her off to the cupboard where she had locked in little jane teal there was no sound from there at all miss theobald was puzzled she rapped on the door still no sound jane had fallen into a feverish doze miss theobald suddenly heard the sound of overloud breathing quick and hoarse she felt sure it was no burglar there she unlocked the door to mamzelles dismay and switched on the light inside the big cupboardand there before poor mamzelles startled eyes lay little jane teal obviously ill fullydressed even to her hat this childs ill said the head mistress feeling janes burning hot hand flu i should think and a very high temperature with it what on earth is she doing dressed up like this with hat and coat on was she going out mamzelle was dumbfounded she could not think of a word to say miss theobald gently awoke jane and helped her to her feet she could hardly stand between them the two mistresses took her to matrons room who at one glance saw that jane was seriously ill ill carry her to the san she said ill sleep there with her myself tonight matrons capable strong arms lifted the halfunconscious jane easily and bore her away to the quiet and comfortable san where all the ill girls were nursed there was no one there at the moment matron soon had jane undressed and in bed with a hot water bottle well said miss theobald thankful to have found poor jane before worse befell her what about your next burglar mamzelle mamzelle fervently hoped that the next prisoner would prove to be a burglar even if he leapt out at them and escaped she led the way to the bathroom opposite the second form dormitory the second formers were still awake and heard the footsteps and voices in wonder as the footsteps passed their door they sat up and whispered who is it whats up antoinette leapt out of bed and padded to the door she peeped out cautiously to her enormous astonishment she saw the head mistress standing by the bathroom door with mamzelle her aunt antoinette gaped as she saw miss theobald rap quietly on the door and say whos in here a voice answered something an angry voice miss theobald heard that it was a girls voice and not a mans and she unlocked the door out shot mirabel expecting to see a group of grinning second formersand stopped short in amazement when she saw mamzelle and the head mistress mamzelles eyes almost dropped out of her head she had shut her biggest burglaror so she thoughtinto the bathroomand now it was only mirabel that big detestable loudvoiced mirabel whose talk was all of games games and yet more games mamzelle snorted in disgust i want to complain said mirabel in a loud voice surprised but unabashed by the sight of the head i came to see if the second formers were having a midnight feast which i had forbiddenand one of them locked me in this beastly cold bathroom i want to report them miss theobald i know they held a feast and theres a most important match tomorrow and i demand that the girl who locked me in shall be punished it was mamzelle who locked you in said miss theobald you had no right to be wandering about at night like this mamzelle thought you were a burglar and locked you in antoinette stiffled a giggle and rushed back into the dormitory she related in whispers what she had heard the girls were halfamused and halfangryamused to think that mirabel had been locked up and angry to think she had been sneaking round and had reported them then mamzelles loud voice penetrated into the listening dormitory what is this untruthful thing you say mirabel the second formers had no feast tonight did not i go there to chase annemarie after i had locked you in and the good girls were all in bed and asleep not a thing to be seen not a tin not a bottle you are a bad untruthful girl trying to get others into trouble to protect yourself from blame mirabel was speechless she glared at mamzelle and miss theobald hastened to intervene well if mamzelle was in the second form dormitory and the girls were in bed and asleep it seems to me that you must be mistaken mirabel im not said mirabel rudely mamzelle isnt speaking the truth go into the second form dormitory and ask the girls if i or mamzelle are right miss theobald then you will see i shall do nothing of the sort said the head mistress coldly be more polite mirabel you forget yourself mirabel simmering with rage dared say no more go back to bed said miss theobald i will settle this tomorrow i do not feel very pleased with you mirabel mirabel went back to bed with an angry heart she knew she was right those second formers had had a feast and mamzelle must be shielding thembecause of antoinette she supposed well she would get even with the little beasts she would cancel the match next day no one should play she would show those youngsters she was sports captain and make them toe the line t well said miss theobald looking at mamzelle as mirabel retreated what about your next burglar mamzelle mamzelle took the head up to the corridor that ran round the fifth form studies she was feeling rather nervous now that her burglars were all turning into girls it was really most extraordinary miss theobald rapped on the cupboard in which alma was imprisoned almas voice was heard let me out its awful in here the head unlocked the door and alma staggered out stiff and cold miss theobald looked at her in surprise why were you wandering about at night she said sharply ieri heard a noise said alma stammeringly for she was afraid of the head and some one locked me in that cupboard miss theobald switched her torch on and lighted up the inside of the cupboard she saw at a glance that it had been used as a storingplace for food you went to take food from here i suppose alma she said was it your own food i wasnt taking any said alma i waswell i was just looking this girl is always eating said mamzelle in disgust always she chews something always she sucks go back to bed alma said miss theobald i will see you in the morning alma scuttled off thankfully miss theobald turned rather coldly to mamzelle any more burglars she asked oh miss theobald truly i am sorry to have made so many mistakes said mamzelle passing her hand through her hair in bewilderment i pray you to forgive me to dont worry about it said miss theobald it is perhaps a good thing that all this has happened it seems that a great deal is going on this term at st clares that i must inquire into nowwho is this girl you had in your bedroomthe one you found sleepwalking felicity said mamzelle fervently hoping that felicity would still be there she hurried down the stairs to her room and unlocked the door felicity was still there lying asleep in bed she looked very young and thin and even in her sleep her face wore a harassed worried look miss theobald looked at her for some time this girl is obviously overworking she said and sighed her music is too much for her but her parents insisted on her taking her exams i think mamzelle if you dont mind well leave her in your bed you had better sleep in the bed in miss harrys roomshe is away for a few days i suppose you have no more lockedup girls to show me tonight no said mamzelle looking so crestfallen that the head smiled she patted mamzelles plump arm you meant well she said if they had all been burglars as you thought you would have done a good nights work anyway it is a good thing that so many things have come to light good night miss theobald went back to bed worrying about little jane teal alma mirabel and felicity it looked as if jane had been trying to run away she must find out about that mamzelle got into a strange bed cold and puzzled why had so many girls been wandering about that night ah that detestable mirabel how dare she say that she mamzelle was telling an untruth that night and that dreadful alma did she go snooping round every night to steal food from cupboards there was something wrong with her that girl tomorrow i will talk with claudine and antoinette thought mamzelle screwing up her eyes trying to go to sleep they have good sense they will tell me everything it is a pity that english girls have not the good sense of french girls it will be a pleasure to talk to my good little claudine and antoinettethey do not wander round at night for me to lock up alas to think that i made so many prisoners and now not one remains a few upsets the next day the whole school knew the story of the night escapades and how mamzelle had locked up so many girls there was a great deal of giggling and chattering and annemarie had her leg pulled about her sleepwalking how can i help sleepwalking she asked trying to assume a dignity she did not feel felicity sleepwalks too doesnt she and you dont laugh at her miss willcox heard about annemaries sleepwalking act and laughed too she even teased her about it in class which hurt annemarie more than anything and made her quite determined to get even with miss willcox if she could felicity did not appear in class that day it was reported that she had gone to the san for a rest and would not be taking the exam which was the next week jane teal was very ill indeed sally had been allowed to see her and had come back rather scared matrons worried about her and so is the doctor said sally her mother is there in the san too im not allowed in any more matron shooed me out i heard matron say that janes worried about something and she cant get out of her what it is but i know its all this business with mirabel and angela and i know jane reads in bed late at night with a torch she learns her english and latin that way she told me so wellhadnt you better go and tell matron what you know said katie she might put things right for jane then she cant silly said sally you know what worries jane more than anythingihes upset because mirabel believes she rang that firebell to stop her meeting and thats why mirabel is so beastly to her if only we could find out who did ring that bell and make them own up it would take a great load off poor janes mind violet hill was feeling uncomfortable that morning when she heard how ill jane was she remembered her quarrel with jane and the unkind things she had said she wished she hadnt now it will be a good thing to play in the match this after noon said sally take our minds off everything well feel better out on the field playing or watching but mirabel threw a bombshell that morning she put a notice on the board and soon every one was round it astonished and angry the match today is cancelled owing to the behaviour of the team members said the notice and it was signed by mirabel well said sally would you believe it how has she got the nerve to stick up a notice like that and what right has she to cancel our match shes got the right because shes sports captain said violet beast i vote we send her to coventry and dont speak a word to her or smile at her or turn up at any practices at all every one agreed it was an unheard of thing for the lower forms to treat an upper form girl in this way but they felt so indignant that not one member of the first or second form backed out of the agreement just because they had dared to have a feast in spite of mirabel she was treating them abominably and putting up a notice in public to make them look small gladys saw the notice and was shocked she went straight to mirabel mirabel i how could you put up that notice whatever were you thinking of you cant cancel the match i can and i have said mirabel grimly ive sent a telegram to the school we were playing they wont be coming we shall have a practice match instead i have just written out another notice about thatthe practice is to be at three oclock and every girl must attend from the two lowest forms mirabel you must be mad said gladys quite alarmed at her friends grim face you cant put all the girls against you like this you really cant youll only get the worst out of them instead of the best ive told you before that i wont have you interfering with my decisions said mirabel then what is the use of my being vicecaptain said gladys not a bit of use i cant help you because you wont let me well youre not much use if you really want to know said mirabel coldly and went out of the room to pin the lacrosse practice notice on the board the girls held an informal meeting about the practice and one and all determined not to turn up it was saturday and if they wished they could go for naturerambles all the first and second forms decided to do this even antoinette who detested walking so to the astonishment of miss roberts and miss jenks the whole of the two lowest forms went off in the sunshine together taking with them nature notebooks and collecting tins and jars chattering loudly as they passed by the windows of the mistresses common room well said miss roberts looking after the laughing girls whats come over them why this sudden violent and wholesale interest in nature i thought there was to be a match or lacrosse practice or something mirabel turned up on the playing fields at five to three grimfaced and determined but nobody else arrived mirabel waited till ten past three and then rather white went back to the school one of the third formers hardly able to hide her smiles told her politely that the first and second formers had all gone out for a nature walk then mirabel knew that she had lost it had been her will against the wills of the first and second form and they had won they had ignored her orders they had shown her what they thought of her and her authority she sat down in her study feeling dismayed she saw a note on the table addressed to her and opened it it was a formal resignation from gladys i wish to resign my post as vicecaptain as i feel i cannot be of any use to you gladys mirabel threw the note on to the floor she felt un happy and bitter she had been so pleased to be sports captain she had worked so hard for that position she had had such high hopes of putting st clares at the very top of the lacrosse and tennis schools now the girls had defied her and even her best friend had deserted her it was a bitter hour for mirabel the girls came back from their walk rosycheeked and merry they heard from the third form how mirabel had gone out alone to the playing field and had waited there in vain they also heard that gladys had resigned as vicecaptain and they were pleased good old gladys they said we always thought it was funny she should back mirabel up in her unpleasant ways when mirabel appeared in public at all that weekend the girls carefully turned away from her almost as if i was in quarantine for something beastly thought mirabel bitterly the girl was very worried and unhappy but far too proud to appeal even to gladys for comfort gladys was miserable too and would have made things up with mirabel at once if her friend had turned to her or had admitted that she had been too highhanded with the younger ones but mirabel was cold and standoffish and gave gladys no chance to be friendly the exam was to be held the next week and most of the girls were feeling the strain only a few like clever pam or the placid hilary did not seem to worry felicity was not to take the exam a specialist had come from london to see her he spoke to miss theobald very seriously this girl is on the verge of a nervous breakdown he said her mind seems full of music and nothing but music see how she plays an imaginary violin and strains to hear the tune she must do no more work in music for a year miss theobald nodded how she wished felicitys proud parents had not insisted on their gifted girl working for that difficult music exam how much better it would have been for her to have dropped her music for a while and to have entered into the ordinary normal life of the other fifth formers instead of losing herself night and day in her beloved music now her music might suffer because felicitys brain had been worked too hard parents fault i suppose said the specialist writing a few notes in his casebook why will parents of gifted children always push them so hard just selfishness said miss theobald wellyou think we must keep felicity in bed for a timethen let her get up and wander round a bit without any lessonsand then gradually join in with the others without doing any music at all she can play at her music but not work at it said the specialist let her enjoy it without worrying about it she will probably do that anyhow when she knows she is not to work for the music exam for at least another two years felicitys parents came to see her worried and dismayed they remembered how miss theobald had pleaded with them not to push felicity on so quickly they were frightened when they saw her white face and enormous darkrimmed eyes dont worry too much said miss theobald we have stopped her in time her sleepwalking gave us warning mamzelle discovered that and so we have been able to deal with felicity quickly soon she will be a nonnal happy girl again and when she knows she need not work night and day for her music exam a great weight will be off her mind and she will laugh and chatter and be as cheerful as the others it was a rather subdued father and mother that went home that day miss theobald might have said i told you so to us said felicitys mother but she didnt poor felicityi feel we are very much to blame for all this the other sleepwalker annemarie was not having a very good time whenever the first or second formers saw her coming they immediately put on glassy stares and with outstretched hands began to glide here and there annemarie hated this teasing and when it spread to the fifth form too and glassy eyes appeared there also annemarie was very near tears its beastly of you she said to alison and angela who laughed at her i know i shant pass the exam if you all jeer at me like this its mean of you well youre pretty mean yourself said alison you keep on doing beastly things to me dont you where have you put my geometry set you hid last week annemarie stared in surprise she hadnt the least idea what alison was talking about oh dont put on that wideeyed innocent look said alison impatiently we all know you can act but dont try to take us in by it i know jolly well youre jealous of me because miss willcox likes me better than she likes you and youre trying to get back at me by hiding my things and making silly bits of trouble for me im not said annemarie her voice trembling with indignation i wouldnt dream of doing such a thing i havent touched your things and as for being jealous of you you neednt worry ive no time for miss willcox now im sure shes not as clever as you think and whats more ill show you she isnt dont be silly said alison and dont talk about miss willcox like that youre just plain jealous and youre taking my things and being beastly just to get even with me i tell you im not playing tricks on you and im not jealous cried annemarie you can keep miss willcox all to yourself i dont ever want to see her again deirdre willcox indeed her name is doris just plain dorisi saw it written in one of her books i bet she calls herself deirdre just because she thinks doris is too ordinary shes aasilly pretender annemarie flung herself out of the room and alison stared after her in rage angela laughed you two amuse me she said im glad i dont go off the deep end about any one like you do silly i call it oh do you said alison in a cutting voice well let me tell you youre just as bad in another wayyou smile sweetly at the lower form kids and get them all round you to wait on youthen when youre tired of them you just tick them offand theyre as miserable as can be i bet youre partly responsible for jane teal trying to run away angela opened her mouth to answer heatedly but just then the door opened and annemarie popped her head in again ill show miss doris willcox up tomorrow in front of the whole class she said you see if i dont then youll have to say im right and youll be jolly sick you didnt see through her so there the door banged and annemarie disappeared im tired of annemarie and her silly ways said alison who still thought that it was she who was playing tricks on her and had no idea it had been alma let her do what she likes i shall always like miss willcox annemarie traps miss willcox annemarie had prepared her little trap for miss willcox and she had prepared it very carefully every week miss willcox set the girls some kind of composition to do and they sent in their entries which were carefully gone through by her and marked this week the subject set was a poem it had to bft only eight lines long the first and third lines had to rhyme and the second and fourth the fifth and seventh and the sixth and eighth the subject has to be thoughts the fifth form grumbled they didnt like writing poetry they couldnt write poetry it was a silly waste of time for them in exam week it was just like miss willcox to set a poem for them to do so they grumbled and groaned but all the same they managed to produce something that could be called a poem annemarie had hunted through the poets for a lesserknown poem that would suit her purpose if only she could find one that would just do and by great good fortune she suddenly found exactly what she wanted it was a little eightline poem by matthew arnold called despondency which seemed to annemarie to be just what she wanted she copied it out in her big rather sprawly handwriting really it seemed as if it was her own poem it was just as sad as the ones she liked to write annemarie sent the poem in with those of the others of her form she signed her name at the bottom now miss doris willcox we will see if you know good poetry when yon see it the english lesson duly arrived and alison glanced curiously at annemarie who seemed excited was she really going to cany out her silly threat and do something to miss willcox alison felt a little disturbed ought she to warn deirdre miss willcox arrived carrying the sheaf of poems in her hand she looked as soulful as ever and wore a trailing crimson scarf round her swanlike neck the first part of the lesson was given to the reading of a play then came the time set apart for the commenting on the girlsown work miss willcox pulled the sheaf of poems towards her not a very good set she remarked slipping the elastic band off the papers i suppose the exam has had an effect on your creative powers pains is the bestquite a praiseworthy little effort simple and honest claudine i cant pass yours you may have meant it to be funny but it isnt claudine made a face which fortunately for her miss willcox did not see miss willcox dealt with every ones poems rapidly quoting from one or two praising here and there and condemning the efforts of doris angela and carlotta then she came to the last one which was annemaries she looked round the class a rather spiteful look in her large eyes and now at last we come to the poet of the class annemarie a sad heartrending poem as usual listen to the wailings of our poet thoughts the thoughts that rain their steady glow like stars on lifes cold sea which others know or say they know they never shone for me thoughts light like gleams my spirits sky but they will not remain they light me once they hurry by and never come again miss willcox read these lines out in a mockheroic way exaggerating the feeling in them making fun of the whole poem she put down the paper annemarie why must you write like this it is all so silly and insincere and quite meaningless what for instance can you possibly mean by stars on lifes cold sea what is lifes cold sea just words that came into your head and you put them down because they sounded grand lifes cold sea ridiculous annemarie stared at miss willcox steadily she felt very triumphant that wasnt her poem it was written by a great poet not by annemarie at all that just showed that miss willcox didnt know a thing and wasnt any judge of good poetry miss willcox didnt like the steady queerly triumphant look on annemaries face she felt a wave of anger against her yon have the scansion and the rhyming quite correct she said scornfully to annemarie but all the same i consider your poem the worst of the form miss willcox said annemarie suddenly in a high dear voice im so sorryi think i must have made a mistake in sending in that poem i dont believe it is mine after all the class turned to look at annemarie she sat tensely still with that triumphant look on her face what do you mean said miss willcox impatiently not your poem then whose is it i must say it tounds exactly like yours itsits very kind of you to say that said annemarie because you seethat poem is by matthew arnold not by me at all im glad yon think his poetry is like mine i feel honoured though i dont suppose if he were alive he would be at all pleased to hear the things you have just said about bis little poemits queer to think you consider ms poem the worst in the form there was dead silence alison turned scarlet seeing the trap annemarie had set for miss willcox and the prompt way in which she had fallen headlong into it annemarie pulled a volume of matthew arnolds poems from her desk and opened it at a certain page heres the poem she said getting up from her desk its called despondency not thoughts ill show it to you miss willcox miss willcox had gone white she knew it had been a trap nowannemaries revenge for the cruel words she had spoken to her some days back she had shown her up in front of the whole class oh why why had she said that the poem was the worst in the form why had she said such spiteful things only to hurt annemarie and because she thought she wanted taking down two or three pegs alison was terribly distressed she hated to see miss willcox trapped like thatand she also hated to think that the teacher had allowed herself to be trapped because of her own petty spite she looked with dislike at the triumphant annemarie you have cheated annemarie said miss willcox trying to regain her dignity i shall have to report you to miss theobald for a grave act of deceit yes miss willcox said annemarie maliciously and the english mistress knew that it would be no good reporting annemariefor annemarie would also report her own side of the matter and miss theobald would not think very much of a teacher who condemned lines by a great poet just because she thought they were written by a schoolgirl she disliked the bell rang and never did miss willcox feel so relieved to hear it she gathered up her books and sailed out the girls rounded on annemarie that was a beastly thing to do said hilary i thought it was funny said claudine you would said pat it was certainly clever but it wasnt a decent thing to do i know it wasnt said annemarie defiantly but i wanted to get my own back and i did well i hope youre happy about it said alison bitterly trying to humiliate a good teacher in front of the whole class did she feel sorry for poor little dorisdeirdre then began annemarie but hilary was not going to allow any spite of that sort shut up both of you she said maybe you wont be such an ass over miss willcox now alisonand perhaps now youve taken your revenge annemarie youll cool off and try to behave decently for the rest of the term alison has complained to me about your behaviour to her and its got to stop i dont know what you mean by my behaviour to alison said annemarie puzzled she complains thai i take her things and play tricks on her but i dont why should i im not jealous of her or anything she can keep miss wiflcox all to herself if she wants to i dont mind most of the class although they thought it was not a nice thing to humiliate a mistress publicly had secretly enjoyed the excitement alma certainly had for she had often been held up to ridicule by miss willcox for her complete inability to appreciate any fine literature at all she was glad to see her defeated by annemarieand she was glad too when she heard alison openly accusing annemarie of the tricks she alma had been playing on the unsuspecting alison ill play just one more and that shall be the last she thought i know she had a box of sweets sent to her today ill slip in and take those when she isnt there and shell blame annemarie again but alma tried her tricks once too often when she slipped into alisons study it was empty and she picked up the box of sweets quickly she hurried to her own study and ran in to her dismay both alison and angela were there waiting to ask pauline something alison immediately saw the box of sweets in almas hand those are my sweets she said yon beast yon took them out of my study alma youre a thief im sure you were a thief before tooyou pilfered the cupboard outside when the second formers hid their stuff there angela isnt she absolutely awful alma stood there stubbornly trying to think of some way out i wasnt going to eat them she said at last i was only playing a trick on you because i dont like you you were stealing said alison furiously you know you meant to eat them this will have to be told to hilary its simply awful for a fifth former to be caught stealing alma sat down suddenly feeling frightened she had had a solemn and very serious talking to by miss theobald about being found in the cupboard the other night and it had been impossible to convince the head mistress that she had not been doing anything wrong if this got to her ears matters would be even more serious i didnt steal them alison she said desperately i tell you i was just paying you out because you stopped me going to the cupboard where the second formers put their foodthough you didnt know it i took your knittingneedlesand your geometry setand other things only to spite you though not to steal them theyre all here look she unlocked her desk in the corner and before alisons astonished eyes lay all the things she had missed during the last week or two bring them into my study said alison completely at a loss to know what to do or say ill have to think about this what a beast you are almaespecially as you knew i was blaming annemarie all the time alma took everything back weeping alison took one look at the puffy pasty face and turned away in dislike how could a girl who had been in the top form do things like this perhaps that was why she had been dropped back into the fifthmaybe because of some disgrace or other a few things are cleared up wait till the exams are over before you make any fuss about alma said angela to alison oh dearno wonder annemarie didnt know what we were talking about when we kept accusing her of taking your things i shall have to apologize to her said alison gloomily blow almawhat a firstclass idiot she is really isnt she queer i dont understand her at all sometimes i think shes daft the exams were now pressing on the girls and they were working feverishly only pam appeared to find them easy hilary worked through her papers methodically and so did pat and isabel bobby and janet but carlotta claudine and angela got very hot and bothered so queerly enough did mirabel which was unusual for her but she had given so much of her time to the organizing of the school games that she had not worked as well at her exam tasks as the others had these awful questions she said as she read one after another i cant seem to answer any of them t at last the exams were over and the whole form heaved a sigh of relief what a week it had been the girls wanted to yell and laugh and stamp and rush about they became very boisterous even the quiet pam but the teachers turned a blind eye and a deaf ear on the yelling girls and did not even appear to see carlotta doing cartwheels all round the gym thank goodness we havent got to wait long for the results said doris i hate having to wait weeks miss cornwallis says we shall know in a few days hows little jane teal said pat remembering the first former for the first time for a few days is she better shes over the flu said isabel but matron says shes still worried in her mind when she was so ill she kept raving about the firebell and mirabel and angela i rather think theres going to be a few inquiries made about certain members of our form soon poor jane its rotten to think no one ever owned up about that bell but let jane take the blame it made mirabel simply beastly to her she is the only person that hasnt been to see jane in the san did you know just like her said pat the exam results came oat and were posted up on the board pam and hilary were top with honours the others came in turn down the list carlotta was glad to see she had passed doris just scraped through too and so did claudine and alison three girls failed they were angela almaand most surprisingly mirabel alma had not expected to pass angela was amazed that she hadnt i as for mirabel she was humiliated beyond words to think that she sports captain of st clares should have failed she rushed off to her study filled with shame and horror how every one would sneer gladys who had hardly spoken with mirabel since she had resigned as vicecaptain stared in amazement at the exam results mirabel failed she could hardly believe her eyes with her heart full of sympathy and warmth she hurried off to find her onetime friend mirabel was sitting by the window her humiliation almost more than she could bear gladys went to her and took her hand bad luck old thing she said im awfully sorry you worked too hard at the matches and things thats all dont worry too much about it two others have failed as well mirabel was touched by gladyss warm sympathy she had felt lonely and deserted with tears in her eyes she gazed at gladys and tried to speak i cant bear it she said at last theyll all laugh at me me the sports captain theyll be glad to laugh too they hate me every one hates me where have i gone wrong i meant to do so well lets be friends again mirabel said gladys you need me dont you you wouldnt let me help you at all this termbut let me help you now the girls dont really hate youthey admired you awfully at the beginning of the term and theres no reason why they shouldnt again poor mirabeland poor angela both liked to shine and both had failed what was the use of being sports captain what was the use of being the most beautiful girl in the school if your brains were so poor you couldnt even get as good marks as doris or alisont claudine had been rather quiet for a day or two she had been to see jane teal and taken her a lovely little handkerchief she had embroidered for her then she sought out antoinette and made a proposal to her that surprised that second former very much what tell miss theobald that i rang the firebell said antoinette in surprise and disgust are you mad claudine yes perhaps said claudine thoughtfully i am afraid i have caught a little of this english sense of honour alas i fed uncomfortable here when i think of jane teal worrying about the firebell and of mirabel thinking it is jane it is a great pity but i fear i have caught this sense of honour antoinette oh is it catching said antoinette in alarm i do not want to get it it is an uncomfortable thing to have see how it makes you behave claudine i will go to miss theobald and tell her it was all my fault said claudine at last you do not need to come into it antoinette after all it was my idea and you only carried it out i will go and confess she gave a huge sigh and went off miss theobald was startled and amused to see claudine arriving with a saintly and determined expression on her face miss theobald i have caught the sense of honour from somebody at st clares announced claudine i have come to make a confession i told my little sister to ring the firebell when mirabel was about to hold her stupid meeting i did not mean to own up but now i feel uncomfortable here about it claudine pressed her tummy and miss theobald listened gravely i am glad you have owned up claudine she said it was a silly thing to do but it became a serious thing when some one else was suspected of it please tell hilary i shall not punish antoinette but she too must own up to jane teal and put her mind at rest clandine went out knowing that her real punishment was to be owning up to the serious headgirl of the form hilary did not favour misbehaviour of this kind now that they were topformers and she had a way of talking that at times made claudine feel very small she made her feel small now you dont realize that next term we shall all be in the top form she said to claudine from there we go out into the world we cant behave like naughty childreri in the first form now we have to set an example to the younger ones we have to learn what responsibility means yon should be a preacher hilary said claudine jokingly but hilary was not in a mood to be joked with she took her position as headgirl very seriously all the more so because she knew she would not be headgirl of the sixth she was only staying one term more and the headgirl must be some one staying for three terms every one was wondering who would be chosen claudine went off abashed and found antoinette who was highly indignant at being sent off to jane teal to confess but when she saw janes face she was not sorry she had gone oh said jane was it really you antoinette oh im glad you told me you know i really began to feel it might have been me i was so worried about it whatever will mirabel say mirabel soon heard about it gladys told her she flushed uncomfortably thinking of the hard time she had given poor jane because of her unjust suspicions she thought for a while and then went straight off to the san where jane still was jane ive heard who rang the firebell said mirabel hardly liking to meet janes eyes it wasnt you and i was sure it was i was beastly to youleft you out of matches unfairlyand things like that imim sorry about it i its all right mirabel said jane eagerly i dont mind now not a bit all i want is to get up and practise hard for you again and perhaps play in a match before the term ends janes warm response and loyalty were very pleasant to mirabel who had been very miserable she smiled at the first former left her some barley sugar and went back to her study thinking how nice it was to have some one look at her with liking once again mirabels visit to jane made a great impression on the lower forms jane soon spread it abroad and spoke so glowingly of mirabels kind words to her that the younger ones began to get over their dislike and defiance they had deserted the practice field and had shown little or no interest in games since mirabel had cancelled their matchbut now they gradually drifted back and mirabel found to her delight that they seemed as keen as ever gladys took back her resignation and mirabel set to work humbly and happily to make out games lists again and to arrange matchesbut she let gladys do at least half of it and was careful to listen to her and to take her advice when she gave it the two were much happier than they had ever been before and gladys was glad to see her friend learning from the bad mistakes she had made looks as if mirabel will be a good captain after all said bobby in surprise well wellwere all turning over a aew leaf theres felicity back again not caring two hoots about her music for a bit and being quite one of usand theres annemarie gone all friendly and jolly since alison apologized to her for suspecting her wrongly and theres alison behaving sensibly too now that she sees through dear deirdreand angela isnt being such an idiot with the younger ones since she failed in her exam nothat was a shock that pulled her together a bit said pat shes working hard now did you know that hilary gave her a most awful talkingto she wept buckets of tears and was furious with hilarybut she certainly has been better since its only alma thats still a pain in the neck said isabel i hate speaking to her even i know hilarys gone to tell miss theobald about her taking those things of alisons i bet shell be expelled or something if she isnt careful but alma was not expelled instead hilary explained something to the girls that made them feel rather uncomfortable i told miss theobald all about our trouble with alma said hilary and she told me we must be patient with her and put up with her because she cant help it just now theres something wrong with her glands that cant be put right for about six months thats why shes so fat and always hungry and looks so pasty and funny she was sent off from her last school in disgrace but miss theobald wants to keep hei here and help her till she can have some sort of marvellous operation done that can put her right poor old pudding said doris shes her own enemy i supposeor her glands are whatever they may be i welli suppose we must put up with our alma and grin and bear it when she chews and sucks and gobbles doris began to imitate alma at a meal and the girls screamed with laughter but there was no real unkindness in the laughter one and all were ready to put up with alma now andhelp her even selfish little angela and wild carlotta they were growing up they were fifth formers they could behave decently st clares put its mark on you by the time you were in the fifth form who shall be head of the school after the exam the girls relaxed with pleasure and relief the teachers gave them less prep to do and the fifth formers spent pleasant evenings in their own studies or each others talking and laughing christmas will soon be upon us said pat the rest of this term will fly i always like the christmas term it begins in summertime when the september sun is still hot and it often ends in snow with christmas beckoning round the corner you sound quite poetic said doris annemarie used to say things like that annemarie laughed she had not written any poems for some time for after the success of her trick on miss willcox she had felt rather ashamed of herself after all she had pretended too just like miss willcox she had tried to write poems that sounded very grand but were quite worthless really now annemarie was determined to wait till she had something to say before she wrote poetry again she had had a talk with miss theobald who had heard of annemaries cheating as miss willcox called it the head mistress hadnt much time for the english teacher herself sensing that she was insincere and rather conceitedbut she could not allow any of the girls to flout authority or be insolent without reprimanding them severely so annemarie had had a bad twenty minutes and had come away a sadder and wiser fifth former determined that she would write no more wonderful poetry until as miss theobald said she had something real and honest and sincere in her heart to put into her writing and make it worth while mirabel had got over the shock of failing in the exam and was trying to make the lower forms forget her stupid arrogance and harshness her voice was still loud and clear but not haughty or dictatorial and she no longer walked as if the whole earth belonged to her she was a wiser person altogether and the girls respected her for being able to change herself so completely jane teal was once again working hard for mirabel exulting in her returned health and strength a great weight off her mind angela no longer gave the younger ones so many jobs to do and she and alison did their mending together hilary had made a great impression on angela when she had ticked her off and had really frightened her youre a poor poor thing angela she had told her you use your pretty face and smile to save yourself trouble and you are getting a lazy mind and a lazy body letting other people do the things you ought to do no wonder you failed in the examand failed miserably too if youre not careful youll go on being a failure in all kinds of ways and people will laugh at you instead of admiring and respecting you what do you suppose jane and sally and violet and the rest of your lower form slaves think of their darling beautiful angela now when they see that she and alma tied for bottom place in the exam pull yourself together a bit for goodness sake each term brought different things to learn besides lessons those girls who faced their difficulties saw and understood their faults conquered their failings and became strong characters and leaders would make the finest wives and mothers of the future miss theobald watched the fifth formers carefully and was proud of many of them she remembered them as silly little first formers and a little lesssilly second formers she remembered pat and isabel osullivan the stuckup twins as they had been called when they first came she remembered how mirabel had vowed not to stay longer than half a term and had misbehaved herself dreadfully in her first term she remembered the wildness of carlotta who had come to st clares from circuslife untamed and headstrong she remembered bobby whose brilliant brains were once only used in mad and clever tricksand claudine untruthful deceitful and unscrupulous who was at last finding responsibility and a sense of honour here were all these girls now dependable honestminded hardworking and responsible truly st dares was a school to be proud of before the end of the term came the head mistress must choose the headgirl for the whole school all the sixth were leaving and the fifth were to go up with one or two new girls hilary was the only one of the fifth who was not staying on for one more whole year she was only to stay one term more and then she was to go to india to be with her parents there otherwise hilary would have been head of the sixth and a good responsible head she would have made but now some one else must be chosen the girls wondered who it would be it was a tremendous honour for the headgirl of the sixth would be the headgirl of the whole school a person of great influence it wont be me anyway said doris comfortably im too stupid and it wont be me said carlotta im still too wild nor me said bobby grinning im still too much given to playing tricks didnt mamzelle jump when she drank her glass of milk this morning and found a black beetle at the bottom the girls giggled it was a silly trick but had caused a lot of fun bobby had popped a little tin black beetle into mamzelles glass of midmorning milk and her horror when she had drunk all the muk and then had suddenly seen the beetle at the bottom had been most amusing to watch tiens she had cried what is this black animal i have almost drunk oh la la that it should choose my glass and no one elses the girls recalled all the tricks bobby and janet had played on poor mamzellethe way they had made the plates dancethe dreadful stinkballsand many others they had all been good fun and mamzelle had always joined in the laughter afterwards we break up in three days time said bobby then heyho for the holidaysand when we come back we shall all be sixth formers grave and serious and solemn no tricks thenno gigglesno messing about oh rubbish said carlotta we shant suddenly alter just because were sixth formers we shall be just the same i do wonder who will be headgirt perhaps one of the twins will i hope not said pat at once id hate to be something isabel wasnt and she would hate it too otherwise wed either of us love it its the thing id like best in the world at the moment i love st clares and im proud of belonging to it if i could do something for it i wouldbut i dont want to do something that i cant share with isabel i feel the same about that said isabel but if we did have the honour of being asked either of us to be headgirl wed say no anyway there are plenty of others who would make better headgirls than we should at that very moment the matter was being decided by miss theobald miss cornwallis and mamzelle they were sitting together in the heads drawingroom discussing the very weighty and important question of who should be the next headgirl it was important because the headgirl had a powerful influence on the whole school and was in fact typical of the spirit of st clares they were going down the list of girls hilary cant be of course said miss cornwallis a pity because she has had great experience of being headgirl in three or four forms still perhaps it is time some one else had a chance of showing leadership janet said miss theobald the others shook their heads janet could still be hottempered and wilful at times she had not yet learnt to guard her sharp tongue completely a headgirl had to have complete control of herself not bobby of course said miss cornwallis brilliant trustable but still a little unsteady what about gladys too gentlenot enough of a leader said miss theobald who knew the characters of every girl in a most remarkable way and claudine i am afraid we must also cross out mamzelle mamzelle sighed it had been a secret wish with her for two or three terms that claudine her little claudine might be head of st clares the school in which mamzelle had taught for so many many years but even mamzelle biassed as she was knew that claudine was not fit to lead others if she had been at st clares when she was thirteen now said mamzelle ah then my little claudine might have had time to learn enough to become headgirl both miss theobald and miss cornwallis had their doubts about this in fact miss cornwallis thought that if claudine had been at st clares ever since she was a baby she would still not have been suitable for a headgirl but neither wanted to upset mamzelle who adored her two nieces so they said nothing alma certainly not poor girl said miss theobald she is a most unfortunate child perhaps when she is in really good health she will improve carlotta nowno i think not still rather unaccountable and uncontrolled in her temper i always feel she is still capable of slapping people if she doesnt approve of them mamzelle remembered various slapping episodes in carlottas schoollife and smiled ah she would slap the first formers hard if they did not behave she said she would be an amusing headgirl but perhaps not a very good one felicity no said miss cornwallis she will always be apt to forget everything when her music fills her mind she will perhaps someday be one of the foremost musicians or composers but only in her art will she be fit to lead others angela and alisonneither of them leaders in anyway said miss theobald how good it would be for both of them to be headgirls and feel the weight of leadership and responsibility on their shouldersbut how bad for the school alison is still such a featherhead and angela has a lot to learn yet three more terms to learn it inwell maybe it will be enough annemarie would be hopeless said mamzelle so would pauline that leaves doris pam and the twins said miss theobald looking at her list doris is too stupid said mamzelle still she cannot roll her rs for me in the french way ah she will be a great success on the stage that girl she is so clever a mimic but she is stupid in all other ways though a nice nice girl the others agreed pam would make an ideal headgirl said miss theobald but she is too young almost two years younger than the oldest in the fifth she is staying on two years so perhaps she will be headgirl in the future a nice hardworking quiet and dependable child that only leaves the osullivan twins said miss cornwallis and i am sure that we cannot choose one without the other they are inseparable and always have been the other twin would feel very much left out if we chose one of them ahi have it said mamzelle suddenly banging the table and making the other mistresses jump i have it yes we will have two headgirls why not is not st dares bigger than ever it was has not the headgirl more than enough to do then we will have two headgirls girls who will work together as oneso why not the osullivan twins miss theobald and miss cornwallis looked at each other it was a good idea two headgirls who were twins would certainly work very well together and could share the responsibility well pat and isabel had consistently done good work and had grown into splendid trustworthy and sensible girls yes said miss theobald at last its a very good idea indeed the twins will make fine headgirls it will do them a world of good for they have never undertaken any kind of leadership here so far they shall be joint headgirls i will make the announcement tomorrow so when the whole school was called together for the head to announce the changes in the coming term the names of the two new headgirls were given we have carefully studied the question of who shall be headgirl of the school for the coming year said miss theobald and i think there is no doubt that our choice is wise and will be very popular st clares is growing fast and the headgirl has a great deal to do sometimes too much so we have decided to have two headgirls working together and we have chosen a pair who have been with us from the first form and have made their way up the school steadily and well winning every ones respect and admiration next term the osullivan twins will be our headgirls there was a terrific outburst of cheering clapping and stamping at these words everyone knew the likeaspea twins everyone liked them and trusted them now they were to be headgirls togethersplendid the twins were overwhelmed they blushed scarlet and when they heard the outburst of cheering they felt sudden tears pricking their eyelids it was a wonderful moment for them to be chosen to head the school to lead it to hold the biggest honour st clares had to offer that was something worth while thank you said pat standing up with isabel when the cheering had lessened wellwell do our very best so they willand their best will be very good indeed and there we must leave them about to have their dearest wish headgirls of st clares the finest school they know
