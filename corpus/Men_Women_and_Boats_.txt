to conjecture what stephen crane might have written about the world war had he lived certainly he would have been in it in one capacity or another no man had a greater talent for war and personal adventure nor a finer art in describing it few writers of recent times could so well describe the poetry of motion as manifested in the surge and flow of battle or so well depict the isolated deed of heroism in its stark simplicity and terror to such an undertaking as henri barbusses under fire that powerful brutal book crane would have brought an analytical genius almost clairvoyant he possessed an uncanny vision a descriptive ability photographic in its clarity and its care for minutiae yet unphotographic in that the big central thing often is omitted to be felt rather than seen in the occult suggestion of detail crane would have seen and depicted the grisly horror of it all as did barbusse but also he would have seen the glory and the ecstasy and the wonder of it and over that his poetry would have been spread while stephen crane was an excellent psychologist he was also a true poet frequently his prose was finer poetry than his deliberate essays in poesy his most famous book the red badge of courage is essentially a psychological study a delicate clinical dissection of the soul of a recruit but it is also a tour de force of the imagination when he wrote the book he had never seen a battle he had to place himself in the situation of another years later when he came out of the grecoturkish fracas he remarked to a friend the red badge is all right written by a youth who had scarcely passed his majority this book has been compared with tolstoys sebastopol and zolas la dйbвcle and with some of the short stories of ambrose bierce the comparison with bierces work is legitimate with the other books i think less so tolstoy and zola see none of the traditional beauty of battle they apply themselves to a devoted almost obscene study of corpses and carnage generally and they lack the americans instinct for the rowdy commonplace the natural the irreverent which so materially aids his realism in the red badge of courage invariably the tone is kept down where one expects a height the most heroic deeds are accomplished with studied awkwardness crane was an obscure freelance when he wrote this book the effort he says somewhere was born of pain despair almost it was a better piece of work however for that very reason as crane knew it is far from flawless it has been remarked that it bristles with as many grammatical errors as with bayonets but it is a big canvas and i am certain that many of cranes deviations from the rules of polite rhetoric were deliberate experiments looking to effect effect which frequently he gained stephen crane arrived with this book there are of course many who never have heard of him to this day but there was a time when he was very much talked of that was in the middle nineties following publication of the red badge of courage although even before that he had occasioned a brief flurry with his weird collection of poems called the black riders and other lines he was highly praised and highly abused and laughed at but he seemed to be made we have largely forgotten since it is a way we have personally i prefer his short stories to his novels and his poems those for instance contained in the open boat in wounds in the rain and in the monster the titlestory in that first collection is perhaps his finest piece of work yet what is it a truthful record of an adventure of his own in the filibustering days that preceded our war with spain the faithful narrative of the voyage of an open boat manned by a handful of shipwrecked men but captain blighs account of his small boat journey after he had been sent adrift by the mutineers of the bounty seems tame in comparison although of the two the english sailors voyage was the more perilous in the open boat crane again gains his effects by keeping down the tone where another writer might have attempted fine writing and have been lost in it perhaps is most strikingly evident the poetic cadences of his prose its rhythmic monotonous flow is the flow of the gray water that laps at the sides of the boat that rises and recedes in cruel waves like little pointed rocks it is a desolate picture and the tale is one of our greatest short stories in the other tales that go to make up the volume are wild exotic glimpses of latinamerica i doubt whether the color and spirit of that region have been better rendered than in stephen cranes curious distorted staccato sentences war stories is the laconic subtitle of wounds in the rain it was not war on a grand scale that crane saw in the spanishamerican complication in which he participated as a war correspondent no such war as the recent horror but the occasions for personal heroism were no fewer than always and the opportunities for the exercise of such powers of trained and appreciative understanding and sympathy as crane possessed were abundant for the most part these tales are episodic reports of isolated instances the profanely humorous experiences of correspondents the magnificent courage of signalmen under fire the forgotten adventure of a converted yacht but all are instinct with the red fever of war and are backgrounded with the choking smoke of battle never again did crane attempt the large canvas of the red badge of courage before he had seen war he imagined its immensity and painted it with the fury and fidelity of a verestchagin when he was its familiar he singled out its minor crimson passages for briefer but no less careful delineation in this book again his sense of the poetry of motion is vividly evident we see men going into action wave on wave or in scattering charges we hear the clink of their accoutrements and their breath whistling through their teeth they are not men going into action at all but men going about their business which at the moment happens to be the capture of a trench they are neither heroes nor cowards their faces reflect no particular emotion save perhaps a desire to get somewhere they are a line of men running for a train or following a fire engine or charging a trench it is a relentless picture ever changing ever the same but it contains poetry too in rich memorable passages in the monster and other stories there is a tale called the blue hotel a swede its central figure toward the end manages to get himself murdered cranes description of it is just as casual as that the story fills a dozen pages of the book but the social injustice of the whole world is hinted in that space the upsidedownness of creation right prostrate wrong triumphant a mad crazy world the incident of the murdered swede is just part of the backwash of it all but it is an illuminating fragment the swede was slain not by the gambler whose knife pierced his thick hide he was the victim of a condition for which he was no more to blame than the man who stabbed him stephen crane thus speaks through the lips of one of the characters we are all in it this poor gambler isnt even a noun he is a kind of an adverb every sin is the result of a collaboration we five of us have collaborated in the murder of this swede usually there are from a dozen to forty women really involved in every murder but in this case it seems to be only five men you i johnnie old scully and that fool of an unfortunate gambler came merely as a culmination the apex of a human movement and gets all the punishment and then this typical and arresting piece of irony the corpse of the swede alone in the saloon had its eyes fixed upon a dreadful legend that dwelt atop of the cashmachine this registers the amount of your purchase in the monster the ignorance prejudice and cruelty of an entire community are sharply focussed the realism is painful one blushes for mankind but while this story really belongs in the volume called whilomville stories it is properly left out of that series the whilomville stories are pure comedy and the monster is a hideous tragedy whilomville is any obscure little village one may happen to think of to write of it with such sympathy and understanding crane must have done some remarkable listening in boyville the truth is of course he was a boy himself a wonderful boy somebody called him and was possessed of the boy mind these tales are chiefly funny because they are so true boy stories written for adults a child i suppose would find them dull in none of his tales is his curious understanding of human moods and emotions better shown a stupid critic once pointed out that crane in his search for striking effects had been led into frequent neglect of the timehallowed rights of certain words and that in his pursuit of color he falls occasionally into almost ludicrous mishap the smug pedantry of the quoted lines is sufficient answer to the charges but in support of these assertions the critic quoted certain passages and phrases he objected to cheeks scarred by tears to dauntless statues and to terrorstricken wagons the very touches of poetic impressionism that largely make for cranes greatness are cited to prove him an ignoramus there is the finest of poetic imagery in the suggestions subtly conveyed by cranes tricky adjectives the use of which was as deliberate with him as his choice of a subject but crane was an imagist before our modern imagists were known this unconventional use of adjectives is marked in the whilomville tales in one of them crane refers to the solemn odor of burning turnips it is the most nearly perfect characterization of burning turnips conceivable can anyone improve upon that solemn odor stephen cranes first venture was maggie a girl of the streets it was i believe the first hint of naturalism in american letters it was not a bestseller it offers no solution of life it is an episodic bit of slum fiction ending with the tragic finality of a greek drama it is a skeleton of a novel rather than a novel but it is a powerful outline written about a life crane had learned to know as a newspaper reporter in new york it is a singularly fine piece of analysis or a bit of extraordinarily faithful reporting as one may prefer but not a few french and russian writers have failed to accomplish in two volumes what crane achieved in two hundred pages in the same category is georges mother a triumph of inconsequential detail piling up with a cumulative effect quite overwhelming crane published two volumes of poetry the black riders and war is kind their appearance in print was jeeringly hailed yet crane was only pioneering in the free verse that is today if not definitely accepted at least more than tolerated i like the following love poem as well as any rhymed and conventionally metrical ballad that i know should the wide world roll away leaving black terror limitless night nor god nor man nor place to stand would be to me essential if thou and thy white arms were there and the fall to doom a long way if war be kind wrote a clever reviewer when the second volume appeared then cranes verse may be poetry beardsleys black and white creations may be art and this may be called a book a smart summing up that is cherished by cataloguers to this day in describing the volume for collectors beardsley needs no defenders and it is fairly certain that the clever reviewer had not read the book for certainly crane had no illusions about the kindness of war the titlepoem of the volume is an amazingly beautiful satire which answers all criticism do not weep maiden for war is kind because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky and the affrighted steed ran on alone do not weep war is kind hoarse booming drums of the regiment little souls who thirst for fight these men were born to drill and die the unexplained glory flies above them great is the battlegod and his kingdom a field where a thousand corpses lie mother whose heart hung humble as a button on the bright splendid shroud of your son do not weep war is kind poor stephen crane like most geniuses he had his weaknesses and his failings like many if not most geniuses he was ill he died of tuberculosis tragically young but what a comrade he must have been with his extraordinary vision his keen sardonic comment his fearlessness and his failings just a glimpse of cranes last days is afforded by a letter written from england by robert barr his friend robert barr who collaborated with crane in the ruddy a rollicking tale of old ireland or rather who completed it at cranes death to satisfy his friends earnest request the letter is dated from hillhead woldingham surrey june and runs as follows my dear i was delighted to hear from you and was much interested to see the article on stephen crane you sent me it seems to me the harsh judgment of an unappreciative commonplace person on a man of genius stephen had many qualities which lent themselves to misapprehension but at the core he was the finest of men generous to a fault with something of the oldtime recklessness which used to gather in the ancient literary taverns of london i always fancied that edgar allan poe revisited the earth as stephen crane trying again succeeding again failing again and dying ten years sooner than he did on the other occasion of his stay on earth when your letter came i had just returned from dover where i stayed four days to see crane off for the black forest there was a thin thread of hope that he might recover but to me he looked like a man already dead when he spoke or rather whispered there was all the accustomed humor in his sayings i said to him that i would go over to the schwarzwald in a few weeks when he was getting better and that we would take some convalescent rambles together as his wife was listening he said faintly ill look forward to that but he smiled at me and winked slowly as much as to say you damned humbug you know ill take no more rambles in this world then as if the train of thought suggested what was looked on before as the crisis of his illness he murmured robert when you come to the hedge that we must all go over it isnt bad you feel sleepy and you dont care just a little dreamy curiosity which world youre really in thats all tomorrow saturday the th i go again to dover to meet his body he will rest for a little while in england a country that was always good to him then to america and his journey will be ended ive got the unfinished manuscript of his last novel here beside me a rollicking irish tale different from anything he ever wrote before stephen thought i was the only person who could finish it and he was too ill for me to refuse i dont know what to do about the matter for i never could work up another mans ideas even your vivid imagination could hardly conjecture anything more ghastly than the dying man lying by an open window overlooking the english channel relating in a sepulchral whisper the comic situations of his humorous hero so that i might take up the thread of his story from the window beside which i write this i can see down in the valley ravensbrook house where crane used to live and where harold frederic he and i spent many a merry night together when the romans occupied britain some of their legions parched with thirst were wandering about these dry hills with the chance of finding water or perishing they watched the ravens and so came to the stream which rises under my place and flows past stephens former home hence the name ravensbrook it seems a strange coincidence that the greatest modern writer on war should set himself down where the greatest ancient warrior caesar probably stopped to quench his thirst stephen died at three in the morning the same sinister hour which carried away our friend frederic nineteen months before at midnight in cranes fourteenthcentury house in sussex we two tried to lure back the ghost of frederic into that house of ghosts and to our company thinking that if reappearing were ever possible so strenuous a man as harold would somehow shoulder his way past the guards but he made no sign i wonder if the less insistent stephen will suggest some ingenious method by which the two can pass the barrier i can imagine harold cursing on the other side and welcoming the more subtle assistance of his finely fibred friend i feel like the last of the three musketeers the other two gone down in their duel with death i am wondering if within the next two years i also shall get the challenge if so i shall go to the competing ground the more cheerfully that two such good fellows await the outcome on the other side ever your friend robert barr the last of the three musketeers is gone now although he outlived his friends by some years robert barr died in perhaps they are still debating a joint return there could be perhaps no better close for a paper on stephen crane than the subjoined paragraph from a letter written by him to a rochester editor the one thing that deeply pleases me is the fact that men of sense invariably believe me to be sincere i know that my work does not amount to a string of dried beans i always calmly admit it but i also know that i do the best that is in me without regard to praise or blame when i was the mark for every humorist in the country i went ahead and now when i am the mark for only fifty per cent of the humorists of the country i go ahead for i understand that a man is born into the world with his own pair of eyes and he is not at all responsible for his vision he is merely responsible for his quality of personal honesty to keep close to this personal honesty is my supreme ambition vincent starrett the open boat a tale intended to be after the fact being the experience of four men from the sunk steamer commodore i none of them knew the color of the sky their eyes glanced level and were fastened upon the waves that swept toward them these waves were of the hue of slate save for the tops which were of foaming white and all of the men knew the colors of the sea the horizon narrowed and widened and dipped and rose and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks many a man ought to have a bathtub larger than the boat which here rode upon the sea these waves were most wrongfully and barbarously abrupt and tall and each frothtop was a problem in smallboat navigation the cook squatted in the bottom and looked with both eyes at the six inches of gunwale which separated him from the ocean his sleeves were rolled over his fat forearms and the two flaps of his unbuttoned vest dangled as he bent to bail out the boat often he said gawd that was a narrow clip as he remarked it he invariably gazed eastward over the broken sea the oiler steering with one of the two oars in the boat sometimes raised himself suddenly to keep clear of water that swirled in over the stern it was a thin little oar and it seemed often ready to snap the correspondent pulling at the other oar watched the waves and wondered why he was there the injured captain lying in the bow was at this time buried in that profound dejection and indifference which comes temporarily at least to even the bravest and most enduring when willy nilly the firm fails the army loses the ship goes down the mind of the master of a vessel is rooted deep in the timbers of her though he commanded for a day or a decade and this captain had on him the stern impression of a scene in the greys of dawn of seven turned faces and later a stump of a topmast with a white ball on it that slashed to and fro at the waves went low and lower and down thereafter there was something strange in his voice although steady it was deep with mourning and of a quality beyond oration or tears keep er a little more south billie said he a little more south sir said the oiler in the stern a seat in this boat was not unlike a seat upon a bucking broncho and by the same token a broncho is not much smaller the craft pranced and reared and plunged like an animal as each wave came and she rose for it she seemed like a horse making at a fence outrageously high the manner of her scramble over these walls of water is a mystic thing and moreover at the top of them were ordinarily these problems in white water the foam racing down from the summit of each wave requiring a new leap and a leap from the air then after scornfully bumping a crest she would slide and race and splash down a long incline and arrive bobbing and nodding in front of the next menace a singular disadvantage of the sea lies in the fact that after successfully surmounting one wave you discover that there is another behind it just as important and just as nervously anxious to do something effective in the way of swamping boats in a tenfoot dingey one can get an idea of the resources of the sea in the line of waves that is not probable to the average experience which is never at sea in a dingey as each slatey wall of water approached it shut all else from the view of the men in the boat and it was not difficult to imagine that this particular wave was the final outburst of the ocean the last effort of the grim water there was a terrible grace in the move of the waves and they came in silence save for the snarling of the crests in the wan light the faces of the men must have been grey their eyes must have glinted in strange ways as they gazed steadily astern viewed from a balcony the whole thing would doubtless have been weirdly picturesque but the men in the boat had no time to see it and if they had had leisure there were other things to occupy their minds the sun swung steadily up the sky and they knew it was broad day because the color of the sea changed from slate to emeraldgreen streaked with amber lights and the foam was like tumbling snow the process of the breaking day was unknown to them they were aware only of this effect upon the color of the waves that rolled toward them in disjointed sentences the cook and the correspondent argued as to the difference between a lifesaving station and a house of refuge the cook had said theres a house of refuge just north of the mosquito inlet light and as soon as they see us theyll come off in their boat and pick us up as soon as who see us said the correspondent the crew said the cook houses of refuge dont have crews said the correspondent as i understand them they are only places where clothes and grub are stored for the benefit of shipwrecked people they dont carry crews oh yes they do said the cook no they dont said the correspondent well were not there yet anyhow said the oiler in the stern well said the cook perhaps its not a house of refuge that im thinking of as being near mosquito inlet light perhaps its a lifesaving station were not there yet said the oiler in the stern ii as the boat bounced from the top of each wave the wind tore through the hair of the hatless men and as the craft plopped her stern down again the spray splashed past them the crest of each of these waves was a hill from the top of which the men surveyed for a moment a broad tumultuous expanse shining and windriven it was probably splendid it was probably glorious this play of the free sea wild with lights of emerald and white and amber bully good thing its an onshore wind said the cook if not where would we be wouldnt have a show thats right said the correspondent the busy oiler nodded his assent then the captain in the bow chuckled in a way that expressed humor contempt tragedy all in one do you think weve got much of a show now boys said he whereupon the three were silent save for a trifle of hemming and hawing to express any particular optimism at this time they felt to be childish and stupid but they all doubtless possessed this sense of the situation in their mind a young man thinks doggedly at such times on the other hand the ethics of their condition was decidedly against any open suggestion of hopelessness so they were silent oh well said the captain soothing his children well get ashore all right but there was that in his tone which made them think so the oiler quoth yes if this wind holds the cook was bailing yes if we dont catch hell in the surf canton flannel gulls flew near and far sometimes they sat down on the sea near patches of brown seaweed that rolled on the waves with a movement like carpets on a line in a gale the birds sat comfortably in groups and they were envied by some in the dingey for the wrath of the sea was no more to them than it was to a covey of prairie chickens a thousand miles inland often they came very close and stared at the men with black beadlike eyes at these times they were uncanny and sinister in their unblinking scrutiny and the men hooted angrily at them telling them to be gone one came and evidently decided to alight on the top of the captains head the bird flew parallel to the boat and did not circle but made short sidelong jumps in the air in chickenfashion his black eyes were wistfully fixed upon the captains head ugly brute said the oiler to the bird you look as if you were made with a jackknife the cook and the correspondent swore darkly at the creature the captain naturally wished to knock it away with the end of the heavy painter but he did not dare do it because anything resembling an emphatic gesture would have capsized this freighted boat and so with his open hand the captain gently and carefully waved the gull away after it had been discouraged from the pursuit the captain breathed easier on account of his hair and others breathed easier because the bird struck their minds at this time as being somehow grewsome and ominous in the meantime the oiler and the correspondent rowed and also they rowed they sat together in the same seat and each rowed an oar then the oiler took both oars then the correspondent took both oars then the oiler then the correspondent they rowed and they rowed the very ticklish part of the business was when the time came for the reclining one in the stern to take his turn at the oars by the very last star of truth it is easier to steal eggs from under a hen than it was to change seats in the dingey first the man in the stern slid his hand along the thwart and moved with care as if he were of sиvres then the man in the rowing seat slid his hand along the other thwart it was all done with most extraordinary care as the two sidled past each other the whole party kept watchful eyes on the coming wave and the captain cried look out now steady there the brown mats of seaweed that appeared from time to time were like islands bits of earth they were traveling apparently neither one way nor the other they were to all intents stationary they informed the men in the boat that it was making progress slowly toward the land the captain rearing cautiously in the bow after the dingey soared on a great swell said that he had seen the lighthouse at mosquito inlet presently the cook remarked that he had seen it the correspondent was at the oars then and for some reason he too wished to look at the lighthouse but his back was toward the far shore and the waves were important and for some time he could not seize an opportunity to turn his head but at last there came a wave more gentle than the others and when at the crest of it he swiftly scoured the western horizon see it said the captain no said the correspondent slowly i didnt see anything look again said the captain he pointed its exactly in that direction at the top of another wave the correspondent did as he was bid and this time his eyes chanced on a small still thing on the edge of the swaying horizon it was precisely like the point of a pin it took an anxious eye to find a light house so tiny think well make it captain if this wind holds and the boat dont swamp we cant do much else said the captain the little boat lifted by each towering sea and splashed viciously by the crests made progress that in the absence of seaweed was not apparent to those in her she seemed just a wee thing wallowing miraculously topup at the mercy of five oceans occasionally a great spread of water like white flames swarmed into her bail her cook said the captain serenely all right captain said the cheerful cook iii it would be difficult to describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas no one said that it was so no one mentioned it but it dwelt in the boat and each man felt it warm him they were a captain an oiler a cook and a correspondent and they were friends friends in a more curiously ironbound degree than may be common the hurt captain lying against the waterjar in the bow spoke always in a low voice and calmly but he could never command a more ready and swiftly obedient crew than the motley three of the dingey it was more than a mere recognition of what was best for the common safety there was surely in it a quality that was personal and heartfelt and after this devotion to the commander of the boat there was this comradeship that the correspondent for instance who had been taught to be cynical of men knew even at the time was the best experience of his life but no one said that it was so no one mentioned it i wish we had a sail remarked the captain we might try my overcoat on the end of an oar and give you two boys a chance to rest so the cook and the correspondent held the mast and spread wide the overcoat the oiler steered and the little boat made good way with her new rig sometimes the oiler had to scull sharply to keep a sea from breaking into the boat but otherwise sailing was a success meanwhile the lighthouse had been growing slowly larger it had now almost assumed color and appeared like a little grey shadow on the sky the man at the oars could not be prevented from turning his head rather often to try for a glimpse of this little grey shadow at last from the top of each wave the men in the tossing boat could see land even as the lighthouse was an upright shadow on the sky this land seemed but a long black shadow on the sea it certainly was thinner than paper we must be about opposite new smyrna said the cook who had coasted this shore often in schooners captain by the way i believe they abandoned that lifesaving station there about a year ago did they said the captain the wind slowly died away the cook and the correspondent were not now obliged to slave in order to hold high the oar but the waves continued their old impetuous swooping at the dingey and the little craft no longer under way struggled woundily over them the oiler or the correspondent took the oars again shipwrecks are а propos of nothing if men could only train for them and have them occur when the men had reached pink condition there would be less drowning at sea of the four in the dingey none had slept any time worth mentioning for two days and two nights previous to embarking in the dingey and in the excitement of clambering about the deck of a foundering ship they had also forgotten to eat heartily for these reasons and for others neither the oiler nor the correspondent was fond of rowing at this time the correspondent wondered ingenuously how in the name of all that was sane could there be people who thought it amusing to row a boat it was not an amusement it was a diabolical punishment and even a genius of mental aberrations could never conclude that it was anything but a horror to the muscles and a crime against the back he mentioned to the boat in general how the amusement of rowing struck him and the wearyfaced oiler smiled in full sympathy previously to the foundering by the way the oiler had worked doublewatch in the engineroom of the ship take her easy now boys said the captain dont spend yourselves if we have to run a surf youll need all your strength because well sure have to swim for it take your time slowly the land arose from the sea from a black line it became a line of black and a line of white trees and sand finally the captain said that he could make out a house on the shore thats the house of refuge sure said the cook theyll see us before long and come out after us the distant lighthouse reared high the keeper ought to be able to make us out now if hes looking through a glass said the captain hell notify the lifesaving people none of those other boats could have got ashore to give word of the wreck said the oiler in a low voice else the lifeboat would be out hunting us slowly and beautifully the land loomed out of the sea the wind came again it had veered from the northeast to the southeast finally a new sound struck the ears of the men in the boat it was the low thunder of the surf on the shore well never be able to make the lighthouse now said the captain swing her head a little more north billie said he a little more north sir said the oiler whereupon the little boat turned her nose once more down the wind and all but the oarsman watched the shore grow under the influence of this expansion doubt and direful apprehension was leaving the minds of the men the management of the boat was still most absorbing but it could not prevent a quiet cheerfulness in an hour perhaps they would be ashore their backbones had become thoroughly used to balancing in the boat and they now rode this wild colt of a dingey like circus men the correspondent thought that he had been drenched to the skin but happening to feel in the top pocket of his coat he found therein eight cigars four of them were soaked with seawater four were perfectly scathless after a search somebody produced three dry matches and thereupon the four waifs rode impudently in their little boat and with an assurance of an impending rescue shining in their eyes puffed at the big cigars and judged well and ill of all men everybody took a drink of water iv cook remarked the captain there dont seem to be any signs of life about your house of refuge no replied the cook funny they dont see us a broad stretch of lowly coast lay before the eyes of the men it was of dunes topped with dark vegetation the roar of the surf was plain and sometimes they could see the white lip of a wave as it spun up the beach a tiny house was blocked out black upon the sky southward the slim lighthouse lifted its little grey length tide wind and waves were swinging the dingey northward funny they dont see us said the men the surfs roar was here dulled but its tone was nevertheless thunderous and mighty as the boat swam over the great rollers the men sat listening to this roar well swamp sure said everybody it is fair to say here that there was not a lifesaving station within twenty miles in either direction but the men did not know this fact and in consequence they made dark and opprobrious remarks concerning the eyesight of the nations lifesavers four scowling men sat in the dingey and surpassed records in the invention of epithets funny they dont see us the lightheartedness of a former time had completely faded to their sharpened minds it was easy to conjure pictures of all kinds of incompetency and blindness and indeed cowardice there was the shore of the populous land and it was bitter and bitter to them that from it came no sign well said the captain ultimately i suppose well have to make a try for ourselves if we stay out here too long well none of us have strength left to swim after the boat swamps and so the oiler who was at the oars turned the boat straight for the shore there was a sudden tightening of muscle there was some thinking if we dont all get ashore said the captain if we dont all get ashore i suppose you fellows know where to send news of my finish they then briefly exchanged some addresses and admonitions as for the reflections of the men there was a great deal of rage in them perchance they might be formulated thus if i am going to be drowned if i am going to be drowned if i am going to be drowned why in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea was i allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees was i brought here merely to have my nose dragged away as i was about to nibble the sacred cheese of life it is preposterous if this old ninnywoman fate cannot do better than this she should be deprived of the management of mens fortunes she is an old hen who knows not her intention if she has decided to drown me why did she not do it in the beginning and save me all this trouble the whole affair is absurd but no she cannot mean to drown me she dare not drown me she cannot drown me not after all this work afterward the man might have had an impulse to shake his fist at the clouds just you drown me now and then hear what i call you the billows that came at this time were more formidable they seemed always just about to break and roll over the little boat in a turmoil of foam there was a preparatory and long growl in the speech of them no mind unused to the sea would have concluded that the dingey could ascend these sheer heights in time the shore was still afar the oiler was a wily surfman boys he said swiftly she wont live three minutes more and were too far out to swim shall i take her to sea again captain yes go ahead said the captain this oiler by a series of quick miracles and fast and steady oarsmanship turned the boat in the middle of the surf and took her safely to sea again there was a considerable silence as the boat bumped over the furrowed sea to deeper water then somebody in gloom spoke well anyhow they must have seen us from the shore by now the gulls went in slanting flight up the wind toward the grey desolate east a squall marked by dingy clouds and clouds brickred like smoke from a burning building appeared from the southeast what do you think of those lifesaving people aint they peaches funny they havent seen us maybe they think were out here for sport maybe they think were fishin maybe they think were damned fools it was a long afternoon a changed tide tried to force them southward but the wind and wave said northward far ahead where coastline sea and sky formed their mighty angle there were little dots which seemed to indicate a city on the shore st augustine the captain shook his head too near mosquito inlet and the oiler rowed and then the correspondent rowed then the oiler rowed it was a weary business the human back can become the seat of more aches and pains than are registered in books for the composite anatomy of a regiment it is a limited area but it can become the theatre of innumerable muscular conflicts tangles wrenches knots and other comforts did you ever like to row billie asked the correspondent no said the oiler hang it when one exchanged the rowingseat for a place in the bottom of the boat he suffered a bodily depression that caused him to be careless of everything save an obligation to wiggle one finger there was cold seawater swashing to and fro in the boat and he lay in it his head pillowed on a thwart was within an inch of the swirl of a wave crest and sometimes a particularly obstreperous sea came inboard and drenched him once more but these matters did not annoy him it is almost certain that if the boat had capsized he would have tumbled comfortably out upon the ocean as if he felt sure that it was a great soft mattress look theres a man on the shore where there see im see im yes sure hes walking along now hes stopped look hes facing us hes waving at us so he is by thunder ah now were all right now were all right therell be a boat out here for us in halfanhour hes going on hes running hes going up to that house there the remote beach seemed lower than the sea and it required a searching glance to discern the little black figure the captain saw a floating stick and they rowed to it a bathtowel was by some weird chance in the boat and tying this on the stick the captain waved it the oarsman did not dare turn his head so he was obliged to ask questions whats he doing now hes standing still again hes looking i think there he goes again toward the house now hes stopped again is he waving at us no not now he was though look there comes another man hes running look at him go would you why hes on a bicycle now hes met the other man theyre both waving at us look there comes something up the beach what the devil is that thing why it looks like a boat why certainly its a boat no its on wheels yes so it is well that must be the lifeboat they drag them along shore on a wagon thats the lifeboat sure no by its its an omnibus i tell you its a lifeboat it is not its an omnibus i can see it plain see one of these big hotel omnibuses by thunder youre right its an omnibus sure as fate what do you suppose they are doing with an omnibus maybe they are going around collecting the lifecrew hey thats it likely look theres a fellow waving a little black flag hes standing on the steps of the omnibus there come those other two fellows now theyre all talking together look at the fellow with the flag maybe he aint waving it that aint a flag is it thats his coat why certainly thats his coat so it is its his coat hes taken it off and is waving it around his head but would you look at him swing it oh say there isnt any lifesaving station there thats just a winter resort hotel omnibus that has brought over some of the boarders to see us drown whats that idiot with the coat mean whats he signaling anyhow it looks as if he were trying to tell us to go north there must be a lifesaving station up there no he thinks were fishing just giving us a merry hand see ah there willie well i wish i could make something out of those signals what do you suppose he means he dont mean anything hes just playing well if hed just signal us to try the surf again or to go to sea and wait or go north or go south or go to hell there would be some reason in it but look at him he just stands there and keeps his coat revolving like a wheel the ass there come more people now theres quite a mob look isnt that a boat where oh i see where you mean no thats no boat that fellow is still waving his coat he must think we like to see him do that why dont he quit it it dont mean anything i dont know i think he is trying to make us go north it must be that theres a lifesaving station there somewhere say he aint tired yet look at im wave wonder how long he can keep that up hes been revolving his coat ever since he caught sight of us hes an idiot why arent they getting men to bring a boat out a fishing boat one of those big yawls could come out here all right why dont he do something oh its all right now theyll have a boat out here for us in less than no time now that theyve seen us a faint yellow tone came into the sky over the low land the shadows on the sea slowly deepened the wind bore coldness with it and the men began to shiver holy smoke said one allowing his voice to express his impious mood if we keep on monkeying out here if weve got to flounder out here all night oh well never have to stay here all night dont you worry theyve seen us now and it wont be long before theyll come chasing out after us the shore grew dusky the man waving a coat blended gradually into this gloom and it swallowed in the same manner the omnibus and the group of people the spray when it dashed uproariously over the side made the voyagers shrink and swear like men who were being branded id like to catch the chump who waved the coat i feel like soaking him one just for luck why what did he do oh nothing but then he seemed so damned cheerful in the meantime the oiler rowed and then the correspondent rowed and then the oiler rowed greyfaced and bowed forward they mechanically turn by turn plied the leaden oars the form of the lighthouse had vanished from the southern horizon but finally a pale star appeared just lifting from the sea the streaked saffron in the west passed before the allmerging darkness and the sea to the east was black the land had vanished and was expressed only by the low and drear thunder of the surf if i am going to be drowned if i am going to be drowned if i am going to be drowned why in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea was i allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees was i brought here merely to have my nose dragged away as i was about to nibble the sacred cheese of life the patient captain drooped over the waterjar was sometimes obliged to speak to the oarsman keep her head up keep her head up keep her head up sir the voices were weary and low this was surely a quiet evening all save the oarsman lay heavily and listlessly in the boats bottom as for him his eyes were just capable of noting the tall black waves that swept forward in a most sinister silence save for an occasional subdued growl of a crest the cooks head was on a thwart and he looked without interest at the water under his nose he was deep in other scenes finally he spoke billie he murmured dreamfully what kind of pie do you like best v pie said the oiler and the correspondent agitatedly dont talk about those things blast you well said the cook i was just thinking about ham sandwiches and a night on the sea in an open boat is a long night as darkness settled finally the shine of the light lifting from the sea in the south changed to full gold on the northern horizon a new light appeared a small bluish gleam on the edge of the waters these two lights were the furniture of the world otherwise there was nothing but waves two men huddled in the stern and distances were so magnificent in the dingey that the rower was enabled to keep his feet partly warmed by thrusting them under his companions their legs indeed extended far under the rowingseat until they touched the feet of the captain forward sometimes despite the efforts of the tired oarsman a wave came piling into the boat an icy wave of the night and the chilling water soaked them anew they would twist their bodies for a moment and groan and sleep the dead sleep once more while the water in the boat gurgled about them as the craft rocked the plan of the oiler and the correspondent was for one to row until he lost the ability and then arouse the other from his seawater couch in the bottom of the boat the oiler plied the oars until his head drooped forward and the overpowering sleep blinded him and he rowed yet afterward then he touched a man in the bottom of the boat and called his name will you spell me for a little while he said meekly sure billie said the correspondent awakening and dragging himself to a sitting position they exchanged places carefully and the oiler cuddling down in the seawater at the cooks side seemed to go to sleep instantly the particular violence of the sea had ceased the waves came without snarling the obligation of the man at the oars was to keep the boat headed so that the tilt of the rollers would not capsize her and to preserve her from filling when the crests rushed past the black waves were silent and hard to be seen in the darkness often one was almost upon the boat before the oarsman was aware in a low voice the correspondent addressed the captain he was not sure that the captain was awake although this iron man seemed to be always awake captain shall i keep her making for that light north sir the same steady voice answered him yes keep it about two points off the port bow the cook had tied a lifebelt around himself in order to get even the warmth which this clumsy cork contrivance could donate and he seemed almost stovelike when a rower whose teeth invariably chattered wildly as soon as he ceased his labor dropped down to sleep the correspondent as he rowed looked down at the two men sleeping underfoot the cooks arm was around the oilers shoulders and with their fragmentary clothing and haggard faces they were the babes of the sea a grotesque rendering of the old babes in the wood later he must have grown stupid at his work for suddenly there was a growling of water and a crest came with a roar and a swash into the boat and it was a wonder that it did not set the cook afloat in his lifebelt the cook continued to sleep but the oiler sat up blinking his eyes and shaking with the new cold oh im awful sorry billie said the correspondent contritely thats all right old boy said the oiler and lay down again and was asleep presently it seemed that even the captain dozed and the correspondent thought that he was the one man afloat on all the oceans the wind had a voice as it came over the waves and it was sadder than the end there was a long loud swishing astern of the boat and a gleaming trail of phosphorescence like blue flame was furrowed on the black waters it might have been made by a monstrous knife then there came a stillness while the correspondent breathed with the open mouth and looked at the sea suddenly there was another swish and another long flash of bluish light and this time it was alongside the boat and might almost have been reached with an oar the correspondent saw an enormous fin speed like a shadow through the water hurling the crystalline spray and leaving the long glowing trail the correspondent looked over his shoulder at the captain his face was hidden and he seemed to be asleep he looked at the babes of the sea they certainly were asleep so being bereft of sympathy he leaned a little way to one side and swore softly into the sea but the thing did not then leave the vicinity of the boat ahead or astern on one side or the other at intervals long or short fled the long sparkling streak and there was to be heard the whirroo of the dark fin the speed and power of the thing was greatly to be admired it cut the water like a gigantic and keen projectile the presence of this biding thing did not affect the man with the same horror that it would if he had been a picnicker he simply looked at the sea dully and swore in an undertone nevertheless it is true that he did not wish to be alone he wished one of his companions to awaken by chance and keep him company with it but the captain hung motionless over the waterjar and the oiler and the cook in the bottom of the boat were plunged in slumber vi if i am going to be drowned if i am going to be drowned if i am going to be drowned why in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea was i allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees during this dismal night it may be remarked that a man would conclude that it was really the intention of the seven mad gods to drown him despite the abominable injustice of it for it was certainly an abominable injustice to drown a man who had worked so hard so hard the man felt it would be a crime most unnatural other people had drowned at sea since galleys swarmed with painted sails but still when it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple and he hates deeply the fact that there are no brick and no temples any visible expression of nature would surely be pelleted with his jeers then if there be no tangible thing to hoot he feels perhaps the desire to confront a personification and indulge in pleas bowed to one knee and with hands supplicant saying yes but i love myself a high cold star on a winters night is the word he feels that she says to him thereafter he knows the pathos of his situation the men in the dingey had not discussed these matters but each had no doubt reflected upon them in silence and according to his mind there was seldom any expression upon their faces save the general one of complete weariness speech was devoted to the business of the boat to chime the notes of his emotion a verse mysteriously entered the correspondents head he had even forgotten that he had forgotten this verse but it suddenly was in his mind a soldier of the legion lay dying in algiers there was a lack of womans nursing there was dearth of womans tears but a comrade stood beside him and he took that comrades hand and he said i shall never see my own my native land in his childhood the correspondent had been made acquainted with the fact that a soldier of the legion lay dying in algiers but he had never regarded the fact as important myriads of his schoolfellows had informed him of the soldiers plight but the dinning had naturally ended by making him perfectly indifferent he had never considered it his affair that a soldier of the legion lay dying in algiers nor had it appeared to him as a matter for sorrow it was less to him than the breaking of a pencils point now however it quaintly came to him as a human living thing it was no longer merely a picture of a few throes in the breast of a poet meanwhile drinking tea and warming his feet at the grate it was an actuality stern mournful and fine the correspondent plainly saw the soldier he lay on the sand with his feet out straight and still while his pale left hand was upon his chest in an attempt to thwart the going of his life the blood came between his fingers in the far algerian distance a city of low square forms was set against a sky that was faint with the last sunset hues the correspondent plying the oars and dreaming of the slow and slower movements of the lips of the soldier was moved by a profound and perfectly impersonal comprehension he was sorry for the soldier of the legion who lay dying in algiers the thing which had followed the boat and waited had evidently grown bored at the delay there was no longer to be heard the slash of the cutwater and there was no longer the flame of the long trail the light in the north still glimmered but it was apparently no nearer to the boat sometimes the boom of the surf rang in the correspondents ears and he turned the craft seaward then and rowed harder southward some one had evidently built a watchfire on the beach it was too low and too far to be seen but it made a shimmering roseate reflection upon the bluff back of it and this could be discerned from the boat the wind came stronger and sometimes a wave suddenly raged out like a mountaincat and there was to be seen the sheen and sparkle of a broken crest the captain in the bow moved on his waterjar and sat erect pretty long night he observed to the correspondent he looked at the shore those lifesaving people take their time did you see that shark playing around yes i saw him he was a big fellow all right wish i had known you were awake later the correspondent spoke into the bottom of the boat billie there was a slow and gradual disentanglement billie will you spell me sure said the oiler as soon as the correspondent touched the cold comfortable seawater in the bottom of the boat and had huddled close to the cooks lifebelt he was deep in sleep despite the fact that his teeth played all the popular airs this sleep was so good to him that it was but a moment before he heard a voice call his name in a tone that demonstrated the last stages of exhaustion will you spell me sure billie the light in the north had mysteriously vanished but the correspondent took his course from the wideawake captain later in the night they took the boat farther out to sea and the captain directed the cook to take one oar at the stern and keep the boat facing the seas he was to call out if he should hear the thunder of the surf this plan enabled the oiler and the correspondent to get respite together well give those boys a chance to get into shape again said the captain they curled down and after a few preliminary chatterings and trembles slept once more the dead sleep neither knew they had bequeathed to the cook the company of another shark or perhaps the same shark as the boat caroused on the waves spray occasionally bumped over the side and gave them a fresh soaking but this had no power to break their repose the ominous slash of the wind and the water affected them as it would have affected mummies boys said the cook with the notes of every reluctance in his voice shes drifted in pretty close i guess one of you had better take her to sea again the correspondent aroused heard the crash of the toppled crests as he was rowing the captain gave him some whiskyandwater and this steadied the chills out of him if i ever get ashore and anybody shows me even a photograph of an oar at last there was a short conversation billie billie will you spell me sure said the oiler vii when the correspondent again opened his eyes the sea and the sky were each of the grey hue of the dawning later carmine and gold was painted upon the waters the morning appeared finally in its splendor with a sky of pure blue and the sunlight flamed on the tips of the waves on the distant dunes were set many little black cottages and a tall white windmill reared above them no man nor dog nor bicycle appeared on the beach the cottages might have formed a deserted village the voyagers scanned the shore a conference was held in the boat well said the captain if no help is coming we might better try a run through the surf right away if we stay out here much longer we will be too weak to do anything for ourselves at all the others silently acquiesced in this reasoning the boat was headed for the beach the correspondent wondered if none ever ascended the tall windtower and if then they never looked seaward this tower was a giant standing with its back to the plight of the ants it represented in a degree to the correspondent the serenity of nature amid the struggles of the individual nature in the wind and nature in the vision of men she did not seem cruel to him then nor beneficent nor treacherous nor wise but she was indifferent flatly indifferent it is perhaps plausible that a man in this situation impressed with the unconcern of the universe should see the innumerable flaws of his life and have them taste wickedly in his mind and wish for another chance a distinction between right and wrong seems absurdly clear to him then in this new ignorance of the graveedge and he understands that if he were given another opportunity he would mend his conduct and his words and be better and brighter during an introduction or at a tea now boys said the captain she is going to swamp sure all we can do is to work her in as far as possible and then when she swamps pile out and scramble for the beach keep cool now and dont jump until she swamps sure the oiler took the oars over his shoulders he scanned the surf captain he said i think id better bring her about and keep her headon to the seas and back her in all right billie said the captain back her in the oiler swung the boat then and seated in the stern the cook and the correspondent were obliged to look over their shoulders to contemplate the lonely and indifferent shore the monstrous inshore rollers heaved the boat high until the men were again enabled to see the white sheets of water scudding up the slanted beach we wont get in very close said the captain each time a man could wrest his attention from the rollers he turned his glance toward the shore and in the expression of the eyes during this contemplation there was a singular quality the correspondent observing the others knew that they were not afraid but the full meaning of their glances was shrouded as for himself he was too tired to grapple fundamentally with the fact he tried to coerce his mind into thinking of it but the mind was dominated at this time by the muscles and the muscles said they did not care it merely occurred to him that if he should drown it would be a shame there were no hurried words no pallor no plain agitation the men simply looked at the shore now remember to get well clear of the boat when you jump said the captain seaward the crest of a roller suddenly fell with a thunderous crash and the long white comber came roaring down upon the boat steady now said the captain the men were silent they turned their eyes from the shore to the comber and waited the boat slid up the incline leaped at the furious top bounced over it and swung down the long back of the wave some water had been shipped and the cook bailed it out but the next crest crashed also the tumbling boiling flood of white water caught the boat and whirled it almost perpendicular water swarmed in from all sides the correspondent had his hands on the gunwale at this time and when the water entered at that place he swiftly withdrew his fingers as if he objected to wetting them the little boat drunken with this weight of water reeled and snuggled deeper into the sea bail her out cook bail her out said the captain all right captain said the cook now boys the next one will do for us sure said the oiler mind to jump clear of the boat the third wave moved forward huge furious implacable it fairly swallowed the dingey and almost simultaneously the men tumbled into the sea a piece of lifebelt had lain in the bottom of the boat and as the correspondent went overboard he held this to his chest with his left hand the january water was icy and he reflected immediately that it was colder than he had expected to find it on the coast of florida this appeared to his dazed mind as a fact important enough to be noted at the time the coldness of the water was sad it was tragic this fact was somehow so mixed and confused with his opinion of his own situation that it seemed almost a proper reason for tears the water was cold when he came to the surface he was conscious of little but the noisy water afterward he saw his companions in the sea the oiler was ahead in the race he was swimming strongly and rapidly off to the correspondents left the cooks great white and corked back bulged out of the water and in the rear the captain was hanging with his one good hand to the keel of the overturned dingey there is a certain immovable quality to a shore and the correspondent wondered at it amid the confusion of the sea it seemed also very attractive but the correspondent knew that it was a long journey and he paddled leisurely the piece of lifepreserver lay under him and sometimes he whirled down the incline of a wave as if he were on a handsled but finally he arrived at a place in the sea where travel was beset with difficulty he did not pause swimming to inquire what manner of current had caught him but there his progress ceased the shore was set before him like a bit of scenery on a stage and he looked at it and understood with his eyes each detail of it as the cook passed much farther to the left the captain was calling to him turn over on your back cook turn over on your back and use the oar all right sir the cook turned on his back and paddling with an oar went ahead as if he were a canoe presently the boat also passed to the left of the correspondent with the captain clinging with one hand to the keel he would have appeared like a man raising himself to look over a board fence if it were not for the extraordinary gymnastics of the boat the correspondent marvelled that the captain could still hold to it they passed on nearer to shore the oiler the cook the captain and following them went the waterjar bouncing gaily over the seas the correspondent remained in the grip of this strange new enemy a current the shore with its white slope of sand and its green bluff topped with little silent cottages was spread like a picture before him it was very near to him then but he was impressed as one who in a gallery looks at a scene from brittany or holland he thought i am going to drown can it be possible can it be possible can it be possible perhaps an individual must consider his own death to be the final phenomenon of nature but later a wave perhaps whirled him out of this small deadly current for he found suddenly that he could again make progress toward the shore later still he was aware that the captain clinging with one hand to the keel of the dingey had his face turned away from the shore and toward him and was calling his name come to the boat come to the boat in his struggle to reach the captain and the boat he reflected that when one gets properly wearied drowning must really be a comfortable arrangement a cessation of hostilities accompanied by a large degree of relief and he was glad of it for the main thing in his mind for some months had been horror of the temporary agony he did not wish to be hurt presently he saw a man running along the shore he was undressing with most remarkable speed coat trousers shirt everything flew magically off him come to the boat called the captain all right captain as the correspondent paddled he saw the captain let himself down to bottom and leave the boat then the correspondent performed his one little marvel of the voyage a large wave caught him and flung him with ease and supreme speed completely over the boat and far beyond it it struck him even then as an event in gymnastics and a true miracle of the sea an overturned boat in the surf is not a plaything to a swimming man the correspondent arrived in water that reached only to his waist but his condition did not enable him to stand for more than a moment each wave knocked him into a heap and the undertow pulled at him then he saw the man who had been running and undressing and undressing and running come bounding into the water he dragged ashore the cook and then waded towards the captain but the captain waved him away and sent him to the correspondent he was naked naked as a tree in winter but a halo was about his head and he shone like a saint he gave a strong pull and a long drag and a bully heave at the correspondents hand the correspondent schooled in the minor formulae said thanks old man but suddenly the man cried whats that he pointed a swift finger the correspondent said go in the shallows face downward lay the oiler his forehead touched sand that was periodically between each wave clear of the sea the correspondent did not know all that transpired afterward when he achieved safe ground he fell striking the sand with each particular part of his body it was as if he had dropped from a roof but the thud was grateful to him it seems that instantly the beach was populated with men with blankets clothes and flasks and women with coffeepots and all the remedies sacred to their minds the welcome of the land to the men from the sea was warm and generous but a still and dripping shape was carried slowly up the beach and the lands welcome for it could only be the different and sinister hospitality of the grave when it came night the white waves paced to and fro in the moonlight and the wind brought the sound of the great seas voice to the men on shore and they felt that they could then be interpreters the reluctant voyagers chapter i two men sat by the sea waves well i know im not handsome said one gloomily he was poking holes in the sand with a discontented cane the companion was watching the waves play he seemed overcome with perspiring discomfort as a man who is resolved to set another man right suddenly his mouth turned into a straight line to be sure you are not he cried vehemently you look like thunder i do not desire to be unpleasant but i must assure you that your freckled skin continually reminds spectators of white wall paper with gilt roses on it the top of your head looks like a little wooden plate and your figure heavens for a time they were silent they stared at the waves that purred near their feet like sleepy seakittens finally the first man spoke well said he defiantly what of it what of it exploded the other why it means that youd look like blazes in a bathingsuit they were again silent the freckled man seemed ashamed his tall companion glowered at the scenery i am decided said the freckled man suddenly he got boldly up from the sand and strode away the tall man followed walking sarcastically and glaring down at the round resolute figure before him a bathclerk was looking at the world with superior eyes through a hole in a board to him the freckled man made application waving his hands over his person in illustration of a snug fit the bathclerk thought profoundly eventually he handed out a blue bundle with an air of having phenomenally solved the freckled mans dimensions the latter resumed his resolute stride see here said the tall man following him i bet youve got a regular toga you know that fellow couldnt tell yes he could interrupted the freckled man i saw correct mathematics in his eyes well supposin he has missed your size supposin tom again interrupted the other produce your proud clothes and well go in the tall man swore bitterly he went to one of a row of little wooden boxes and shut himself in it his companion repaired to a similar box at first he felt like an opulent monk in a toosmall cell and he turned round two or three times to see if he could he arrived finally into his bathingdress immediately he dropped gasping upon a threecornered bench the suit fell in folds about his reclining form there was silence save for the caressing calls of the waves without then he heard two shoes drop on the floor in one of the little coops he began to clamor at the boards like a penitent at an unforgiving door tom called he tom a voice of wrath muffled by cloth came through the walls you go t blazes the freckled man began to groan taking the occupants of the entire row of coops into his confidence stop your noise angrily cried the tall man from his hidden den you rented the bathingsuit didnt you then it aint a bathingsuit shouted the freckled man at the boards its an auditorium a ballroom or something it isnt a bathingsuit the tall man came out of his box his suit looked like blue skin he walked with grandeur down the alley between the rows of coops stopping in front of his friends door he rapped on it with passionate knuckles come out of there y ol fool said he in an enraged whisper its only your accursed vanity wear it anyhow what difference does it make i never saw such a vain ol idiot as he was storming the door opened and his friend confronted him the tall mans legs gave way and he fell against the opposite door the freckled man regarded him sternly youre an ass he said his back curved in scorn he walked majestically down the alley there was pride in the way his chubby feet patted the boards the tall man followed weakly his eyes riveted upon the figure ahead as a disguise the freckled man had adopted the stomach of importance he moved with an air of some sort of procession across a board walk down some steps and out upon the sand there was a pug dog and three old women on a bench a man and a maid with a book and a parasol a seagull drifting high in the wind and a distant tremendous meeting of sea and sky down on the wet sand stood a girl being wooed by the breakers the freckled man moved with stately tread along the beach the tall man numb with amazement came in the rear they neared the girl suddenly the tall man was seized with convulsions he laughed and the girl turned her head she perceived the freckled man in the bathingsuit an expression of wonderment overspread her charming face it changed in a moment to a pearly smile this smile seemed to smite the freckled man he obviously tried to swell and fit his suit then he turned a shrivelling glance upon his companion and fled up the beach the tall man ran after him pursuing with mocking cries that tingled his flesh like stings of insects he seemed to be trying to lead the way out of the world but at last he stopped and faced about tom sharp said he between his clenched teeth you are an unutterable wretch i could grind your bones under my heel the tall man was in a trance with glazed eyes fixed on the bathingdress he seemed to be murmuring oh good lord oh good lord i never saw such a suit the freckled man made the gesture of an assassin tom sharp you the other was still murmuring oh good lord i never saw such a suit i never the freckled man ran down into the sea chapter ii the cool swirling waters took his temper from him and it became a thing that is lost in the ocean the tall man floundered in and the two forgot and rollicked in the waves the freckled man in endeavoring to escape from mankind had left all save a solitary fisherman under a large hat and three boys in bathingdress laughing and splashing upon a raft made of old spars the two men swam softly over the ground swells the three boys dived from their raft and turned their jolly faces shorewards it twisted slowly around and around and began to move seaward on some unknown voyage the freckled man laid his face to the water and swam toward the raft with a practised stroke the tall man followed his bended arm appearing and disappearing with the precision of machinery the craft crept away slowly and wearily as if luring the little wooden plate on the freckled mans head looked at the shore like a round brown eye but his gaze was fixed on the raft that slyly appeared to be waiting the tall man used the little wooden plate as a beacon at length the freckled man reached the raft and climbed aboard he lay down on his back and puffed his bathingdress spread about him like a dead balloon the tall man came snorted shook his tangled locks and lay down by the side of his companion they were overcome with a delicious drowsiness the planks of the raft seemed to fit their tired limbs they gazed dreamily up into the vast sky of summer this is great said the tall man his companion grunted blissfully gentle hands from the sea rocked their craft and lulled them to peace lapping waves sang little rippling seasongs about them the two men issued contented groans tom said the freckled man what said the other this is great they lay and thought a fishhawk soaring suddenly turned and darted at the waves the tall man indolently twisted his head and watched the bird plunge its claws into the water it heavily arose with a silver gleaming fish that bird has got his feet wet again its a shame murmured the tall man sleepily he must suffer from an endless cold in the head he should wear rubber boots theyd look great too if i was him id great scott he had partly arisen and was looking at the shore he began to scream ted ted ted look whats matter dreamily spoke the freckled man you remind me of when i put the birdshot in your leg he giggled softly the agitated tall man made a gesture of supreme eloquence his companion upreared and turned a startled gaze shoreward lord he roared as if stabbed the land was a long brown streak with a rim of green in which sparkled the tin roofs of huge hotels the hands from the sea had pushed them away the two men sprang erect and did a little dance of perturbation what shall we do what shall we do moaned the freckled man wriggling fantastically in his dead balloon the changing shore seemed to fascinate the tall man and for a time he did not speak suddenly he concluded his minuet of horror he wheeled about and faced the freckled man he elaborately folded his arms so he said in slow formidable tones so this all comes from your accursed vanity your bathingsuit your idiocy you have murdered your best friend he turned away his companion reeled as if stricken by an unexpected arm he stretched out his hands tom tom wailed he beseechingly dont be such a fool the broad back of his friend was occupied by a contemptuous sneer three ships fell off the horizon landward the hues were blending the whistle of a locomotive sounded from an infinite distance as if tooting in heaven tom tom my dear boy quavered the freckled man dont speak that way to me oh no of course not said the other still facing away and throwing the words over his shoulder you suppose i am going to accept all this calmly dont you not make the slightest objection make no protest at all hey well i i began the freckled man the tall mans wrath suddenly exploded youve abducted me thats the whole amount of it youve abducted me i aint protested the freckled man you must think im a fool the tall man swore and sitting down dangled his legs angrily in the water natural law compelled his companion to occupy the other end of the raft over the waters little shoals of fish spluttered raising tiny tempests languid jellyfish floated near tremulously waving a thousand legs a row of porpoises trundled along like a procession of cogwheels the sky became greyed save where over the land sunset colors were assembling the two voyagers back to back and at either end of the raft quarrelled at length what did you want to follow me for demanded the freckled man in a voice of indignation if your figure hadnt been so like a bottle we wouldnt be here replied the tall man chapter iii the fires in the west blazed away and solemnity spread over the sea electric lights began to blink like eyes night menaced the voyagers with a dangerous darkness and fear came to bind their souls together they huddled fraternally in the middle of the raft i feel like a molecule said the freckled man in subdued tones id give two dollars for a cigar muttered the tall man a vshaped flock of ducks flew towards barnegat between the voyagers and a remnant of yellow sky shadows and winds came from the vanished eastern horizon i think i hear voices said the freckled man that dollie ramsdell was an awfully nice girl said the tall man when the coldness of the sea night came to them the freckled man found he could by a peculiar movement of his legs and arms encase himself in his bathingdress the tall man was compelled to whistle and shiver as night settled finally over the sea red and green lights began to dot the blackness there were mysterious shadows between the waves i see things comin murmured the freckled man i wish i hadnt ordered that new dresssuit for the hop tomorrow night said the tall man reflectively the sea became uneasy and heaved painfully like a lost bosom when little forgotten heartbells try to chime with a pure sound the voyagers cringed at magnified foam on distant wave crests a moon came and looked at them somebodys here whispered the freckled man i wish i had an almanac remarked the tall man regarding the moon presently they fell to staring at the red and green lights that twinkled about them providence will not leave us asserted the freckled man oh well be picked up shortly i owe money said the tall man he began to thrum on an imaginary banjo i have heard said he suddenly that captains with healthy ships beneath their feet will never turn back after having once started on a voyage in that case we will be rescued by some ship bound for the golden seas of the south then youll be up to some of your confounded devilment and well get put off theyll maroon us thats what theyll do theyll maroon us on an island with palm trees and sunkissed maidens and all that sunkissed maidens eh great theyd he suddenly ceased and turned to stone at a distance a great green eye was contemplating the sea wanderers they stood up and did another dance as they watched the eye grew larger directly the form of a phantomlike ship came into view about the great green eye there bobbed small yellow dots the wanderers could hear a faraway creaking of unseen tackle and flapping of shadowy sails there came the melody of the waters as the ships prow thrust its way the tall man delivered an oration ha he exclaimed here come our rescuers the brave fellows how i long to take the manly captain by the hand you will soon see a white boat with a star on its bow drop from the side of yon ship kind sailors in blue and white will help us into the boat and conduct our wasted frames to the quarterdeck where the handsome bearded captain with gold bands all around will welcome us then in the hardoak cabin while the wine gurgles and the havanas glow well tell our tale of peril and privation the ship came on like a black hurrying animal with frothfilled maw the two wanderers stood up and clasped hands then they howled out a wild duet that rang over the wastes of sea the cries seemed to strike the ship men with boots on yelled and ran about the deck they picked up heavy articles and threw them down they yelled more after hideous creakings and flappings the vessel stood still in the meantime the wanderers had been chanting their song for help out in the blackness they beckoned to the ship and coaxed a voice came to them hello it said they puffed out their cheeks and began to shout hello hello hello wot do yeh want said the voice the two wanderers gazed at each other and sat suddenly down on the raft some pall came sweeping over the sky and quenched their stars but almost the tall man got up and brawled miscellaneous information he stamped his foot and frowning into the night swore threateningly the vessel seemed fearful of these moaning voices that called from a hidden cavern of the water and now one voice was filled with a menace a number of men with enormous limbs that threw vast shadows over the sea as the lanterns flickered held a debate and made gestures off in the darkness the tall man began to clamor like a mob the freckled man sat in astounded silence with his legs weak after a time one of the men of enormous limbs seized a rope that was tugging at the stem and drew a small boat from the shadows three giants clambered in and rowed cautiously toward the raft silver water flashed in the gloom as the oars dipped about fifty feet from the raft the boat stopped who er you asked a voice the tall man braced himself and explained he drew vivid pictures his twirling fingers illustrating like live brushes oh said the three giants the voyagers deserted the raft they looked back feeling in their hearts a mite of tenderness for the wet planks later they wriggled up the side of the vessel and climbed over the railing on deck they met a man he held a lantern to their faces got any chewin tewbacca he inquired no said the tall man we aint the man had a bronze face and solitary whiskers peculiar lines about his mouth were shaped into an eternal smile of derision his feet were bare and clung handily to crevices fearful trousers were supported by a piece of suspender that went up the wrong side of his chest and came down the right side of his back dividing him into triangles ezekiel p sanford captin schooner mary jones of nyack n y genelmen he said ah said the tall man delighted im sure there were a few moments of silence the giants were hovering in the gloom and staring suddenly astonishment exploded the captain wot th devil he shouted wot th devil yeh got on bathingsuits said the tall man chapter iv the schooner went on the two voyagers sat down and watched after a time they began to shiver the soft blackness of the summer night passed away and grey mists writhed over the sea soon lights of early dawn went changing across the sky and the twin beacons on the highlands grew dim and sparkling faintly as if a monster were dying the dawn penetrated the marrow of the two men in bathingdress the captain used to pause opposite them hitch one hand in his suspender and laugh well i be doghanged he frequently said the tall man grew furious he snarled in a mad undertone to his companion this rescue aint right if i had known he suddenly paused transfixed by the captains suspender its goin to break cried he in an ecstatic whisper his eyes grew large with excitement as he watched the captain laugh itll break in a minute sure but the commander of the schooner recovered and invited them to drink and eat they followed him along the deck and fell down a square black hole into the cabin it was a little den with walls of a vanished whiteness a lamp shed an orange light in a sort of recess two little beds were hiding a wooden table immovable as if the craft had been builded around it sat in the middle of the floor overhead the square hole was studded with a dozen stars a footworn ladder led to the heavens the captain produced ponderous crackers and some cold broiled ham then he vanished in the firmament like a fantastic comet the freckled man sat quite contentedly like a stout squaw in a blanket the tall man walked about the cabin and sniffed he was angered at the crudeness of the rescue and his shrinking clothes made him feel too large he contemplated his unhappy state suddenly he broke out i wont stand this i tell you heavens and earth look at the say what in the blazes did you want to get me in this thing for anyhow youre a fine old duffer you are look at that ham the freckled man grunted he seemed somewhat blissful he was seated upon a bench comfortably enwrapped in his bathingdress the tall man stormed about the cabin this is an outrage ill see the captain ill tell him what i think of he was interrupted by a pair of legs that appeared among the stars the captain came down the ladder he brought a coffee pot from the sky the tall man bristled forward he was going to denounce everything the captain was intent upon the coffee pot balancing it carefully and leaving his unguided feet to find the steps of the ladder but the wrath of the tall man faded he twirled his fingers in excitement and renewed his ecstatic whisperings to the freckled man its going to break look quick look itll break in a minute he was transfixed with interest forgetting his wrongs in staring at the perilous passage but the captain arrived on the floor with triumphant suspenders well said he after yeh have eat maybe yed like tsleep some if so yeh can sleep on them beds the tall man made no reply save in a strained undertone itll break in about a minute look ted look quick the freckled man glanced in a little bed on which were heaped boots and oilskins he made a courteous gesture my dear sir we could not think of depriving you of your beds no indeed just a couple of blankets if you have them and well sleep very comfortable on these benches the captain protested politely twisting his back and bobbing his head the suspenders tugged and creaked the tall man partially suppressed a cry and took a step forward the freckled man was sleepily insistent and shortly the captain gave over his deprecatory contortions he fetched a pink quilt with yellow dots on it to the freckled man and a black one with red roses on it to the tall man again he vanished in the firmament the tall man gazed until the last remnant of trousers disappeared from the sky then he wrapped himself up in his quilt and lay down the freckled man was puffing contentedly swathed like an infant the yellow polkadots rose and fell on the vast pink of his chest the wanderers slept in the quiet could be heard the groanings of timbers as the sea seemed to crunch them together the lapping of water along the vessels side sounded like gaspings a hundred spirits of the wind had got their wings entangled in the rigging and in soft voices were pleading to be loosened the freckled man was awakened by a foreign noise he opened his eyes and saw his companion standing by his couch his comrades face was wan with suffering his eyes glowed in the darkness he raised his arms spreading them out like a clergyman at a grave he groaned deep in his chest good lord yelled the freckled man starting up tom tom whats th matter the tall man spoke in a fearful voice to new york he said to new york in our bathingsuits the freckled man sank back the shadows of the cabin threw mysteries about the figure of the tall man arrayed like some ancient and potent astrologer in the black quilt with the red roses on it chapter v directly the tall man went and lay down and began to groan the freckled man felt the miseries of the world upon him he grew angry at the tall man awakening him they quarrelled well said the tall man finally were in a fix i know that said the other sharply they regarded the ceiling in silence what in the thunder are we going to do demanded the tall man after a time his companion was still silent say repeated he angrily what in the thunder are we going to do im sure i dont know said the freckled man in a dismal voice well think of something roared the other think of something you old fool you dont want to make any more idiots of yourself do you i aint made an idiot of myself well think know anybody in the city i know a fellow up in harlem said the freckled man you know a fellow up in harlem howled the tall man up in harlem how the dickens are we to say youre crazy we can take a cab cried the other waxing indignant the tall man grew suddenly calm do you know any one else he asked measuredly i know another fellow somewhere on park place somewhere on park place repeated the tall man in an unnatural manner somewhere on park place with an air of sublime resignation he turned his face to the wall the freckled man sat erect and frowned in the direction of his companion well now i suppose you are going to sulk you make me ill its the best we can do aint it hire a cab and go look that fellow up on park whats that you cant afford it what nonsense you are getting oh well maybe we can beg some clothes of the captain eh did i see im certainly i saw im yes it is improbable that a man who wears trousers like that can have clothes to lend no i wont wear oilskins and a souwester to athens of course not i dont know where it is do you i thought not with all your grumbling about other people you never know anything important yourself what broadway ill be hanged first we can get off at harlem man alive there are no cabs in harlem i dont think we can bribe a sailor to take us ashore and bring a cab to the dock for the very simple reason that we have nothing to bribe him with what no of course not see here tom sharp dont you swear at me like that i wont have it whats that i aint either i aint what i am not its no such thing i aint ive got more than you have anyway well you aint doing anything so very brilliant yourself just lying there and cussin at length the tall man feigned prodigiously to snore the freckled man thought with such vigor that he fell asleep after a time he dreamed that he was in a forest where bass drums grew on trees there came a strong wind that banged the fruit about like empty pods a frightful din was in his ears he awoke to find the captain of the schooner standing over him were at new york now said the captain raising his voice above the thumping and banging that was being done on deck an i spose you fellers wanta go ashore he chuckled in an exasperating manner jes sing out when yeh wanta go he added leering at the freckled man the tall man awoke came over and grasped the captain by the throat if you laugh again ill kill you he said the captain gurgled and waved his legs and arms in the first place the tall man continued you rescued us in a deucedly shabby manner it makes me ill to think of it ive a mind to mop you round just for that in the second place your vessel is bound for athens n y and theres no sense in it now will you or will you not turn this ship about and take us back where our clothes are or to philadelphia where we belong he furiously shook the captain then he eased his grip and awaited a reply i cant yelled the captain i cant this vessel dont belong to me ive got to well then interrupted the tall man can you lend us some clothes haint got none replied the captain promptly his face was red and his eyes were glaring well then said the tall man can you lend us some money haint got none replied the captain promptly something overcame him and he laughed thunderation roared the tall man he seized the captain who began to have wriggling contortions the tall man kneaded him as if he were biscuits you infernal scoundrel he bellowed this whole affair is some wretched plot and you are in it i am about to kill you the solitary whisker of the captain did acrobatic feats like a strange demon upon his chin his eyes stood perilously from his head the suspender wheezed and tugged like the tackle of a sail suddenly the tall man released his hold great expectancy sat upon his features its going to break he cried rubbing his hands but the captain howled and vanished in the sky the freckled man then came forward he appeared filled with sarcasm so said he so youve settled the matter the captain is the only man in the world who can help us and i daresay hell do anything he can now thats all right said the tall man if you dont like the way i run things you shouldnt have come on this trip at all they had another quarrel at the end of it they went on deck the captain stood at the stern addressing the bow with opprobrious language when he perceived the voyagers he began to fling his fists about in the air im goin to put yeh off he yelled the wanderers stared at each other hum said the tall man the freckled man looked at his companion hes going to put us off you see he said complacently the tall man began to walk about and move his shoulders id like to see you do it he said defiantly the captain tugged at a rope a boat came at his bidding id like to see you do it the tall man repeated continually an imperturbable man in rubber boots climbed down in the boat and seized the oars the captain motioned downward his whisker had a triumphant appearance the two wanderers looked at the boat i guess well have to get in murmured the freckled man the tall man was standing like a granite column i wont said he i wont i dont care what you do but i wont well but expostulated the other they held a furious debate in the meantime the captain was darting about making sinister gestures but the back of the tall man held him at bay the crew much depleted by the departure of the imperturbable man into the boat looked on from the bow youre a fool the freckled man concluded his argument so inquired the tall man highly exasperated so well if you think youre so bright well go in the boat and then youll see he climbed down into the craft and seated himself in an ominous manner at the stern youll see he said to his companion as the latter floundered heavily down youll see the man in rubber boots calmly rowed the boat toward the shore as they went the captain leaned over the railing and laughed the freckled man was seated very victoriously well wasnt this the right thing after all he inquired in a pleasant voice the tall man made no reply chapter vi as they neared the dock something seemed suddenly to occur to the freckled man great heavens he murmured he stared at the approaching shore my what a plight tommy he quavered do you think so spoke up the tall man why i really thought you liked it he laughed in a hard voice lord what a figure youll cut this laugh jarred the freckled mans soul he became mad thunderation turn the boat around he roared turn er round quick man alive we cant turn er round dye hear the tall man in the stern gazed at his companion with glowing eyes certainly not he said were going on you insisted upon it he began to prod his companion with words the freckled man stood up and waved his arms sit down said the tall man youll tip the boat over the other man began to shout sit down said the tall man again words bubbled from the freckled mans mouth there was a little torrent of sentences that almost choked him and he protested passionately with his hands but the boat went on to the shadow of the docks the tall man was intent upon balancing it as it rocked dangerously during his comrades oration sit down he continually repeated i wont raged the freckled man i wont do anything the boat wobbled with these words say he continued addressing the oarsman just turn this boat round will you where in the thunder are you taking us to anyhow the oarsman looked at the sky and thought finally he spoke im doin what the capn sed well what in th blazes do i care what the capn sed demanded the freckled man he took a violent step you just turn this round or the small craft reeled over one side water came flashing in the freckled man cried out in fear and gave a jump to the other side the tall man roared orders and the oarsman made efforts the boat acted for a moment like an animal on a slackened wire then it upset sit down said the tall man in a final roar as he was plunged into the water the oarsman dropped his oars to grapple with the gunwale he went down saying unknown words the freckled mans explanation or apology was strangled by the water two or three tugs let off whistles of astonishment and continued on their paths a man dozing on a dock aroused and began to caper the passengers on a ferryboat all ran to the near railing a miraculous person in a small boat was bobbing on the waves near the piers he sculled hastily toward the scene it was a swirl of waters in the midst of which the dark bottom of the boat appeared whalelike two heads suddenly came up said the freckled man chokingly thats it what is said the tall man thats the number of that feller on park place i just remembered youre the bloomingest the tall man said it wasnt my fault interrupted his companion if you hadnt he tried to gesticulate but one hand held to the keel of the boat and the other was supporting the form of the oarsman the latter had fought a battle with his immense rubber boots and had been conquered the rescuer in the other small boat came fiercely as his craft glided up he reached out and grasped the tall man by the collar and dragged him into the boat interrupting what was under the circumstances a very brilliant flow of rhetoric directed at the freckled man the oarsman of the wrecked craft was taken tenderly over the gunwale and laid in the bottom of the boat puffing and blowing the freckled man climbed in youll upset this one before we can get ashore the other voyager remarked as they turned toward the land they saw that the nearest dock was lined with people the freckled man gave a little moan but the staring eyes of the crowd were fixed on the limp form of the man in rubber boots a hundred hands reached down to help lift the body up on the dock some men grabbed it and began to beat it and roll it a policeman tossed the spectators about each individual in the heaving crowd sought to fasten his eyes on the bluetinted face of the man in the rubber boots they surged to and fro while the policeman beat them indiscriminately the wanderers came modestly up the dock and gazed shrinkingly at the throng they stood for a moment holding their breath to see the first finger of amazement levelled at them but the crowd bended and surged in absorbing anxiety to view the man in rubber boots whose face fascinated them the seawanderers were as though they were not there they stood without the jam and whispered hurriedly said the freckled man all right said the tall man under the pommeling hands the oarsman showed signs of life the voyagers watched him make a protesting kick at the leg of the crowd the while uttering angry groans hes better said the tall man softly lets make off together they stole noiselessly up the dock directly in front of it they found a row of six cabs the drivers on top were filled with a mighty curiosity they had driven hurriedly from the adjacent ferryhouse when they had seen the first running sign of an accident they were straining on their toes and gazing at the tossing backs of the men in the crowd the wanderers made a little detour and then went rapidly towards a cab they stopped in front of it and looked up driver called the tall man softly the man was intent driver breathed the freckled man they stood for a moment and gazed imploringly the cabman suddenly moved his feet by jimmy i bet hes a gonner he said in an ecstacy and he again relapsed into a statue the freckled man groaned and wrung his hands the tall man climbed into the cab come in here he said to his companion the freckled man climbed in and the tall man reached over and pulled the door shut then he put his head out the window driver he roared sternly park place and quick the driver looked down and met the eye of the tall man eh oh park place yessir he reluctantly gave his horse a clump on the back as the conveyance rattled off the wanderers huddled back among the dingy cushions and heaved great breaths of relief well its all over said the freckled man finally were about out of it and quicker than i expected much quicker it looked to me sometimes that we were doomed i am thankful to find it not so i am rejoiced and i hope and trust that you well i dont wish to perhaps it is not the proper time to that is i dont wish to intrude a moral at an inopportune moment but my dear dear fellow i think the time is ripe to point out to you that your obstinacy your selfishness your villainous temper and your various other faults can make it just as unpleasant for your ownself my dear boy as they frequently do for other people you can see what you brought us to and i most sincerely hope my dear dear fellow that i shall soon see those signs in you which shall lead me to believe that you have become a wiser man the end of the battle a sergeant a corporal and fourteen men of the twelfth regiment of the line had been sent out to occupy a house on the main highway they would be at least a half of a mile in advance of any other picket of their own people sergeant morton was deeply angry at being sent on this duty he said that he was overworked there were at least two sergeants he claimed furiously whose turn it should have been to go on this arduous mission he was treated unfairly he was abused by his superiors why did any damned fool ever join the army as for him he would get out of it as soon as possible he was sick of it the life of a dog all this he said to the corporal who listened attentively giving grunts of respectful assent on the way to this post two privates took occasion to drop to the rear and pilfer in the orchard of a deserted plantation when the sergeant discovered this absence he grew black with a rage which was an accumulation of all his irritations run you he howled bring them here ill show them a private ran swiftly to the rear the remainder of the squad began to shout nervously at the two delinquents whose figures they could see in the deep shade of the orchard hurriedly picking fruit from the ground and cramming it within their shirts next to their skins the beseeching cries of their comrades stirred the criminals more than did the barking of the sergeant they ran to rejoin the squad while holding their loaded bosoms and with their mouths open with aggrieved explanations jones faced the sergeant with a horrible cancer marked in bumps on his left side the disease of patterson showed quite around the front of his waist in many protuberances a nice pair said the sergeant with sudden frigidity youre the kind of soldiers a man wants to choose for a dangerous outpost duty aint you the two privates stood at attention still looking much aggrieved we only began jones huskily oh you only cried the sergeant yes you only i know all about that but if you think you are going to trifle with me a moment later the squad moved on towards its station behind the sergeants back jones and patterson were slyly passing apples and pears to their friends while the sergeant expounded eloquently to the corporal you see what kind of men are in the army now why when i joined the regiment it was a very different thing i can tell you then a sergeant had some authority and if a man disobeyed orders he had a very small chance of escaping something extremely serious but now good god if i report these men the captain will look over a lot of beastly orderly sheets and say haw eh well sergeant morton these men seem to have very good records very good records indeed i cant be too hard on them no not too hard continued the sergeant i tell you flagler the army is no place for a decent man flagler the corporal answered with a sincerity of appreciation which with him had become a science i think you are right sergeant he answered behind them the privates mumbled discreetly damn this sergeant of ours he thinks we are made of wood i dont see any reason for all this strictness when we are on active service it isnt like being at home in barracks there is no great harm in a couple of men dropping out to raid an orchard of the enemy when all the world knows that we havent had a decent meal in twenty days the reddened face of sergeant morton suddenly showed to the rear a little more marching and less talking he said when he came to the house he had been ordered to occupy the sergeant sniffed with disdain these people must have lived like cattle he said angrily to be sure the place was not alluring the ground floor had been used for the housing of cattle and it was dark and terrible a flight of steps led to the lofty first floor which was denuded but respectable the sergeants visage lightened when he saw the strong walls of stone and cement unless they turn guns on us they will never get us out of here he said cheerfully to the squad the men anxious to keep him in an amiable mood all hurriedly grinned and seemed very appreciative and pleased ill make this into a fortress he announced he sent jones and patterson the two orchard thieves out on sentryduty he worked the others then until he could think of no more things to tell them to do afterwards he went forth with a majorgenerals serious scowl and examined the ground in front of his position in returning he came upon a sentry jones munching an apple he sternly commanded him to throw it away the men spread their blankets on the floors of the bare rooms and putting their packs under their heads and lighting their pipes they lived an easy peace bees hummed in the garden and a scent of flowers came through the open window a great fanshaped bit of sunshine smote the face of one man and he indolently cursed as he moved his primitive bed to a shadier place another private explained to a comrade this is all nonsense anyhow no sense in occupying this post they but of course said the corporal when she told me herself that she cared more for me than she did for him i wasnt going to stand any of his talk the corporals listener was so sleepy that he could only grunt his sympathy there was a sudden little spatter of shooting a cry from jones rang out with no intermediate scrambling the sergeant leaped straight to his feet now he cried let us see what you are made of if he added bitterly you are made of anything a man yelled good god cant you see youre all tangled up in my cartridge belt another man yelled keep off my legs cant you walk on the floor to the windows there was a blind rush of slumberous men who brushed hair from their eyes even as they made ready their rifles jones and patterson came stumbling up the steps crying dreadful information already the enemys bullets were spitting and singing over the house the sergeant suddenly was stiff and cold with a sense of the importance of the thing wait until you see one he drawled loudly and calmly then shoot for some moments the enemys bullets swung swifter than lightning over the house without anybody being able to discover a target in this interval a man was shot in the throat he gurgled and then lay down on the floor the blood slowly waved down the brown skin of his neck while he looked meekly at his comrades there was a howl there they are there they come the rifles crackled a light smoke drifted idly through the rooms there was a strong odor as if from burnt paper and the powder of firecrackers the men were silent through the windows and about the house the bullets of an entirely invisible enemy moaned hummed spat burst and sang the men began to curse why cant we see them they muttered through their teeth the sergeant was still frigid he answered soothingly as if he were directly reprehensible for this behavior of the enemy wait a moment you will soon be able to see them there give it to them a little skirt of black figures had appeared in a field it was really like shooting at an upright needle from the full length of a ballroom but the mens spirits improved as soon as the enemy this mysterious enemy became a tangible thing and far off they had believed the foe to be shooting at them from the adjacent garden now said the sergeant ambitiously we can beat them off easily if you men are good enough a man called out in a tone of quick great interest see that fellow on horseback bill isnt he on horseback i thought he was on horseback there was a fusilade against another side of the house the sergeant dashed into the room which commanded the situation he found a dead soldier on the floor he rushed out howling when was knowles killed when was knowles killed when was knowles killed damn it when was knowles killed it was absolutely essential to find out the exact moment this man died a blackened private turned upon his sergeant and demanded how in hell do i know sergeant morton had a sense of anger so brief that in the next second he cried patterson he had even forgotten his vital interest in the time of knowles death yes said patterson his face set with some deeprooted quality of determination still he was a mere farm boy go in to knowles window and shoot at those people said the sergeant hoarsely afterwards he coughed some of the fumes of the fight had made way to his lungs patterson looked at the door into this other room he looked at it as if he suspected it was to be his deathchamber then he entered and stood across the body of knowles and fired vigorously into a group of plum trees they cant take this house declared the sergeant in a contemptuous and argumentative tone he was apparently replying to somebody the man who had been shot in the throat looked up at him eight men were firing from the windows the sergeant detected in a corner three wounded men talking together feebly dont you think there is anything to do he bawled go and get knowles cartridges and give them to somebody who can use them take simpsons too the man who had been shot in the throat looked at him of the three wounded men who had been talking one said my leg is all doubled up under me sergeant he spoke apologetically meantime the sergeant was reloading his rifle his foot slipped in the blood of the man who had been shot in the throat and the military boot made a greasy red streak on the floor why we can hold this place shouted the sergeant jubilantly who says we cant corporal flagler suddenly spun away from his window and fell in a heap sergeant murmured a man as he dropped to a seat on the floor out of danger i cant stand this i swear i cant i think we should run away morton with the kindly eyes of a good shepherd looked at the man you are afraid johnston you are afraid he said softly the man struggled to his feet cast upon the sergeant a gaze full of admiration reproach and despair and returned to his post a moment later he pitched forward and thereafter his body hung out of the window his arms straight and the fists clenched incidentally this corpse was pierced afterwards by chance three times by bullets of the enemy the sergeant laid his rifle against the stonework of the windowframe and shot with care until his magazine was empty behind him a man simply grazed on the elbow was wildly sobbing like a girl damn it shut up said morton without turning his head before him was a vista of a garden fields clumps of trees woods populated at the time with little fleeting figures he grew furious why didnt he send me orders he cried aloud the emphasis on the word he was impressive a mile back on the road a galloper of the hussars lay dead beside his dead horse the man who had been grazed on the elbow still set up his bleat mortons fury veered to this soldier cant you shut up cant you shut up cant you shut up fight thats the thing to do fight a bullet struck morton and he fell upon the man who had been shot in the throat there was a sickening moment then the sergeant rolled off to a position upon the bloody floor he turned himself with a last effort until he could look at the wounded who were able to look at him kim up the kickers he said thickly his arms weakened and he dropped on his face after an interval a young subaltern of the enemys infantry followed by his eager men burst into this reeking interior but just over the threshold he halted before the scene of blood and death he turned with a shrug to his sergeant god i should have estimated them at least one hundred strong upturned face what will we do now said the adjutant troubled and excited bury him said timothy lean the two officers looked down close to their toes where lay the body of their comrade the face was chalkblue gleaming eyes stared at the sky over the two upright figures was a windy sound of bullets and on the top of the hill leans prostrate company of spitzbergen infantry was firing measured volleys dont you think it would be better began the adjutant we might leave him until tomorrow no said lean i cant hold that post an hour longer ive got to fall back and weve got to bury old bill of course said the adjutant at once your men got intrenching tools lean shouted back to his little line and two men came slowly one with a pick one with a shovel they started in the direction of the rostina sharpshooters bullets cracked near their ears dig here said lean gruffly the men thus caused to lower their glances to the turf became hurried and frightened merely because they could not look to see whence the bullets came the dull beat of the pick striking the earth sounded amid the swift snap of close bullets presently the other private began to shovel i suppose said the adjutant slowly wed better search his clothes for things lean nodded together in curious abstraction they looked at the body then lean stirred his shoulders suddenly arousing himself yes he said wed better see what hes got he dropped to his knees and his hands approached the body of the dead officer but his hands wavered over the buttons of the tunic the first button was brickred with drying blood and he did not seem to dare touch it go on said the adjutant hoarsely lean stretched his wooden hand and his fingers fumbled the bloodstained buttons at last he rose with ghastly face he had gathered a watch a whistle a pipe a tobacco pouch a handkerchief a little case of cards and papers he looked at the adjutant there was a silence the adjutant was feeling that he had been a coward to make lean do all the grisly business well said lean thats all i think you have his sword and revolver yes said the adjutant his face working and then he burst out in a sudden strange fury at the two privates why dont you hurry up with that grave what are you doing anyhow hurry do you hear i never saw such stupid even as he cried out in his passion the two men were laboring for their lives ever overhead the bullets were spitting the grave was finished it was not a masterpiece a poor little shallow thing lean and the adjutant again looked at each other in a curious silent communication suddenly the adjutant croaked out a weird laugh it was a terrible laugh which had its origin in that part of the mind which is first moved by the singing of the nerves well he said humorously to lean i suppose we had best tumble him in yes said lean the two privates stood waiting bent over their implements i suppose said lean it would be better if we laid him in ourselves yes said the adjutant then apparently remembering that he had made lean search the body he stooped with great fortitude and took hold of the dead officers clothing lean joined him both were particular that their fingers should not feel the corpse they tugged away the corpse lifted heaved toppled flopped into the grave and the two officers straightening looked again at each other they were always looking at each other they sighed with relief the adjutant said i suppose we should we should say something do you know the service tim they dont read the service until the grave is filled in said lean pressing his lips to an academic expression dont they said the adjutant shocked that he had made the mistake oh well he cried suddenly let us let us say something while he can hear us all right said lean do you know the service i cant remember a line of it said the adjutant lean was extremely dubious i can repeat two lines but well do it said the adjutant go as far as you can thats better than nothing and the beasts have got our range exactly lean looked at his two men attention he barked the privates came to attention with a click looking much aggrieved the adjutant lowered his helmet to his knee lean bareheaded he stood over the grave the rostina sharpshooters fired briskly oh father our friend has sunk in the deep waters of death but his spirit has leaped toward thee as the bubble arises from the lips of the drowning perceive we beseech o father the little flying bubble and lean although husky and ashamed had suffered no hesitation up to this point but he stopped with a hopeless feeling and looked at the corpse the adjutant moved uneasily and from thy superb heights he began and then he too came to an end and from thy superb heights said lean the adjutant suddenly remembered a phrase in the back part of the spitzbergen burial service and he exploited it with the triumphant manner of a man who has recalled everything and can go on oh god have mercy oh god have mercy said lean mercy repeated the adjutant in quick failure mercy said lean and then he was moved by some violence of feeling for he turned suddenly upon his two men and tigerishly said throw the dirt in the fire of the rostina sharpshooters was accurate and continuous one of the aggrieved privates came forward with his shovel he lifted his first shovelload of earth and for a moment of inexplicable hesitation it was held poised above this corpse which from its chalkblue face looked keenly out from the grave then the soldier emptied his shovel on on the feet timothy lean felt as if tons had been swiftly lifted from off his forehead he had felt that perhaps the private might empty the shovel on on the face it had been emptied on the feet there was a great point gained there ha ha the first shovelful had been emptied on the feet how satisfactory the adjutant began to babble well of course a man weve messed with all these years impossible you cant you know leave your intimate friends rotting on the field go on for gods sake and shovel you the man with the shovel suddenly ducked grabbed his left arm with his right hand and looked at his officer for orders lean picked the shovel from the ground go to the rear he said to the wounded man he also addressed the other private you get under cover too ill finish this business the wounded man scrambled hard still for the top of the ridge without devoting any glances to the direction whence the bullets came and the other man followed at an equal pace but he was different in that he looked back anxiously three times this is merely the way often of the hit and unhit timothy lean filled the shovel hesitated and then in a movement which was like a gesture of abhorrence he flung the dirt into the grave and as it landed it made a sound plop lean suddenly stopped and mopped his brow a tired laborer perhaps we have been wrong said the adjutant his glance wavered stupidly it might have been better if we hadnt buried him just at this time of course if we advance tomorrow the body would have been damn you said lean shut your mouth he was not the senior officer he again filled the shovel and flung the earth always the earth made that sound plop for a space lean worked frantically like a man digging himself out of danger soon there was nothing to be seen but the chalkblue face lean filled the shovel good god he cried to the adjutant why didnt you turn him somehow when you put him in this then lean began to stutter the adjutant understood he was pale to the lips go on man he cried beseechingly almost in a shout lean swung back the shovel it went forward in a pendulum curve when the earth landed it made a sound plop an episode of war the lieutenants rubber blanket lay on the ground and upon it he had poured the companys supply of coffee corporals and other representatives of the grimy and hotthroated men who lined the breastwork had come for each squads portion the lieutenant was frowning and serious at this task of division his lips pursed as he drew with his sword various crevices in the heap until brown squares of coffee astoundingly equal in size appeared on the blanket he was on the verge of a great triumph in mathematics and the corporals were thronging forward each to reap a little square when suddenly the lieutenant cried out and looked quickly at a man near him as if he suspected it was a case of personal assault the others cried out also when they saw blood upon the lieutenants sleeve he had winced like a man stung swayed dangerously and then straightened the sound of his hoarse breathing was plainly audible he looked sadly mystically over the breastwork at the green face of a wood where now were many little puffs of white smoke during this moment the men about him gazed statuelike and silent astonished and awed by this catastrophe which happened when catastrophes were not expected when they had leisure to observe it as the lieutenant stared at the wood they too swung their heads so that for another instant all hands still silent contemplated the distant forest as if their minds were fixed upon the mystery of a bullets journey the officer had of course been compelled to take his sword into his left hand he did not hold it by the hilt he gripped it at the middle of the blade awkwardly turning his eyes from the hostile wood he looked at the sword as he held it there and seemed puzzled as to what to do with it where to put it in short this weapon had of a sudden become a strange thing to him he looked at it in a kind of stupefaction as if he had been endowed with a trident a sceptre or a spade finally he tried to sheath it to sheath a sword held by the left hand at the middle of the blade in a scabbard hung at the left hip is a feat worthy of a sawdust ring this wounded officer engaged in a desperate struggle with the sword and the wobbling scabbard and during the time of it he breathed like a wrestler but at this instant the men the spectators awoke from their stonelike poses and crowded forward sympathetically the orderlysergeant took the sword and tenderly placed it in the scabbard at the time he leaned nervously backward and did not allow even his finger to brush the body of the lieutenant a wound gives strange dignity to him who bears it well men shy from this new and terrible majesty it is as if the wounded mans hand is upon the curtain which hangs before the revelations of all existence the meaning of ants potentates wars cities sunshine snow a feather dropped from a birds wing and the power of it sheds radiance upon a bloody form and makes the other men understand sometimes that they are little his comrades look at him with large eyes thoughtfully moreover they fear vaguely that the weight of a finger upon him might send him headlong precipitate the tragedy hurl him at once into the dim grey unknown and so the orderlysergeant while sheathing the sword leaned nervously backward there were others who proffered assistance one timidly presented his shoulder and asked the lieutenant if he cared to lean upon it but the latter waved him away mournfully he wore the look of one who knows he is the victim of a terrible disease and understands his helplessness he again stared over the breastwork at the forest and then turning went slowly rearward he held his right wrist tenderly in his left hand as if the wounded arm was made of very brittle glass and the men in silence stared at the wood then at the departing lieutenant then at the wood then at the lieutenant as the wounded officer passed from the line of battle he was enabled to see many things which as a participant in the fight were unknown to him he saw a general on a black horse gazing over the lines of blue infantry at the green woods which veiled his problems an aide galloped furiously dragged his horse suddenly to a halt saluted and presented a paper it was for a wonder precisely like an historical painting to the rear of the general and his staff a group composed of a bugler two or three orderlies and the bearer of the corps standard all upon maniacal horses were working like slaves to hold their ground preserve their respectful interval while the shells boomed in the air about them and caused their chargers to make furious quivering leaps a battery a tumultuous and shining mass was swirling toward the right the wild thud of hoofs the cries of the riders shouting blame and praise menace and encouragement and last the roar of the wheels the slant of the glistening guns brought the lieutenant to an intent pause the battery swept in curves that stirred the heart it made halts as dramatic as the crash of a wave on the rocks and when it fled onward this aggregation of wheels levers motors had a beautiful unity as if it were a missile the sound of it was a warchorus that reached into the depths of mans emotion the lieutenant still holding his arm as if it were of glass stood watching this battery until all detail of it was lost save the figures of the riders which rose and fell and waved lashes over the black mass later he turned his eyes toward the battle where the shooting sometimes crackled like bushfires sometimes sputtered with exasperating irregularity and sometimes reverberated like the thunder he saw the smoke rolling upward and saw crowds of men who ran and cheered or stood and blazed away at the inscrutable distance he came upon some stragglers and they told him how to find the field hospital they described its exact location in fact these men no longer having part in the battle knew more of it than others they told the performance of every corps every division the opinion of every general the lieutenant carrying his wounded arm rearward looked upon them with wonder at the roadside a brigade was making coffee and buzzing with talk like a girls boardingschool several officers came out to him and inquired concerning things of which he knew nothing one seeing his arm began to scold why man thats no way to do you want to fix that thing he appropriated the lieutenant and the lieutenants wound he cut the sleeve and laid bare the arm every nerve of which softly fluttered under his touch he bound his handkerchief over the wound scolding away in the meantime his tone allowed one to think that he was in the habit of being wounded every day the lieutenant hung his head feeling in this presence that he did not know how to be correctly wounded the low white tents of the hospital were grouped around an old schoolhouse there was here a singular commotion in the foreground two ambulances interlocked wheels in the deep mud the drivers were tossing the blame of it back and forth gesticulating and berating while from the ambulances both crammed with wounded there came an occasional groan an interminable crowd of bandaged men were coming and going great numbers sat under the trees nursing heads or arms or legs there was a dispute of some kind raging on the steps of the schoolhouse sitting with his back against a tree a man with a face as grey as a new army blanket was serenely smoking a corncob pipe the lieutenant wished to rush forward and inform him that he was dying a busy surgeon was passing near the lieutenant goodmorning he said with a friendly smile then he caught sight of the lieutenants arm and his face at once changed well lets have a look at it he seemed possessed suddenly of a great contempt for the lieutenant this wound evidently placed the latter on a very low social plane the doctor cried out impatiently what muttonhead had tied it up that way anyhow the lieutenant answered oh a man when the wound was disclosed the doctor fingered it disdainfully humph he said you come along with me and ill tend to you his voice contained the same scorn as if he were saying you will have to go to jail the lieutenant had been very meek but now his face flushed and he looked into the doctors eyes i guess i wont have it amputated he said nonsense man nonsense nonsense cried the doctor come along now i wont amputate it come along dont be a baby let go of me said the lieutenant holding back wrathfully his glance fixed upon the door of the old schoolhouse as sinister to him as the portals of death and this is the story of how the lieutenant lost his arm when he reached home his sisters his mother his wife sobbed for a long time at the sight of the flat sleeve oh well he said standing shamefaced amid these tears i dont suppose it matters so much as all that an experiment in misery it was late at night and a fine rain was swirling softly down causing the pavements to glisten with hue of steel and blue and yellow in the rays of the innumerable lights a youth was trudging slowly without enthusiasm with his hands buried deep in his trousers pockets toward the downtown places where beds can be hired for coppers he was clothed in an aged and tattered suit and his derby was a marvel of dustcovered crown and torn rim he was going forth to eat as the wanderer may eat and sleep as the homeless sleep by the time he had reached city hall park he was so completely plastered with yells of bum and hobo and with various unholy epithets that small boys had applied to him at intervals that he was in a state of the most profound dejection the sifting rain saturated the old velvet collar of his overcoat and as the wet cloth pressed against his neck he felt that there no longer could be pleasure in life he looked about him searching for an outcast of highest degree that they too might share miseries but the lights threw a quivering glare over rows and circles of deserted benches that glistened damply showing patches of wet sod behind them it seemed that their usual freights had fled on this night to better things there were only squads of welldressed brooklyn people who swarmed towards the bridge the young man loitered about for a time and then went shuffling off down park row in the sudden descent in style of the dress of the crowd he felt relief and as if he were at last in his own country he began to see tatters that matched his tatters in chatham square there were aimless men strewn in front of saloons and lodginghouses standing sadly patiently reminding one vaguely of the attitudes of chickens in a storm he aligned himself with these men and turned slowly to occupy himself with the flowing life of the great street through the mists of the cold and storming night the cable cars went in silent procession great affairs shining with red and brass moving with formidable power calm and irresistible dangerful and gloomy breaking silence only by the loud fierce cry of the gong two rivers of people swarmed along the sidewalks spattered with black mud which made each shoe leave a scarlike impression overhead elevated trains with a shrill grinding of the wheels stopped at the station which upon its leglike pillars seemed to resemble some monstrous kind of crab squatting over the street the quick fat puffings of the engines could be heard down an alley there were somber curtains of purple and black on which street lamps dully glittered like embroidered flowers a saloon stood with a voracious air on a corner a sign leaning against the front of the doorpost announced free hot soup tonight the swing doors snapping to and fro like ravenous lips made gratified smacks as the saloon gorged itself with plump men eating with astounding and endless appetite smiling in some indescribable manner as the men came from all directions like sacrifices to a heathenish superstition caught by the delectable sign the young man allowed himself to be swallowed a bartender placed a schooner of dark and portentous beer on the bar its monumental form upreared until the froth atop was above the crown of the young mans brown derby soup over there gents said the bartender affably a little yellow man in rags and the youth grasped their schooners and went with speed toward a lunch counter where a man with oily but imposing whiskers ladled genially from a kettle until he had furnished his two mendicants with a soup that was steaming hot and in which there were little floating suggestions of chicken the young man sipping his broth felt the cordiality expressed by the warmth of the mixture and he beamed at the man with oily but imposing whiskers who was presiding like a priest behind an altar have some more gents he inquired of the two sorry figures before him the little yellow man accepted with a swift gesture but the youth shook his head and went out following a man whose wondrous seediness promised that he would have a knowledge of cheap lodginghouses on the sidewalk he accosted the seedy man say do you know a cheap place to sleep the other hesitated for a time gazing sideways finally he nodded in the direction of the street i sleep up there he said when ive got the price how much ten cents the young man shook his head dolefully thats too rich for me at that moment there approached the two a reeling man in strange garments his head was a fuddle of bushy hair and whiskers from which his eyes peered with a guilty slant in a close scrutiny it was possible to distinguish the cruel lines of a mouth which looked as if its lips had just closed with satisfaction over some tender and piteous morsel he appeared like an assassin steeped in crimes performed awkwardly but at this time his voice was tuned to the coaxing key of an affectionate puppy he looked at the men with wheedling eyes and began to sing a little melody for charity say gents cant yeh give a poor feller a couple of cents t git a bed i got five and i gits anudder two i gits me a bed now on th square gents cant yeh jest gimme two cents t git a bed now yeh know how a respecterble gentlemn feels when hes down on his luck an i the seedy man staring with imperturbable countenance at a train which clattered overhead interrupted in an expressionless voice ah go t h but the youth spoke to the prayerful assassin in tones of astonishment and inquiry say you must be crazy why dont yeh strike somebody that looks as if they had money the assassin tottering about on his uncertain legs and at intervals brushing imaginary obstacles from before his nose entered into a long explanation of the psychology of the situation it was so profound that it was unintelligible when he had exhausted the subject the young man said to him lets see th five cents the assassin wore an expression of drunken woe at this sentence filled with suspicion of him with a deeply pained air he began to fumble in his clothing his red hands trembling presently he announced in a voice of bitter grief as if he had been betrayed theres ony four four said the young man thoughtfully well look here im a stranger here an if yell steer me to your cheap joint ill find the other three the assassins countenance became instantly radiant with joy his whiskers quivered with the wealth of his alleged emotions he seized the young mans hand in a transport of delight and friendliness b gawd he cried if yell do that b gawd id say yeh was a damned good fellow i would an id remember yeh all m life i would b gawd an if i ever got a chance id return the compliment he spoke with drunken dignity b gawd id treat yeh white i would an id allus remember yeh the young man drew back looking at the assassin coldly oh thats all right he said you show me th joint thats all youve got t do the assassin gesticulating gratitude led the young man along a dark street finally he stopped before a little dusty door he raised his hand impressively lookahere he said and there was a thrill of deep and ancient wisdom upon his face ive brought yeh here an thats my part aint it if th place dont suit yeh yeh neednt git mad at me need yeh there wont be no bad feelin will there no said the young man the assassin waved his arm tragically and led the march up the steep stairway on the way the young man furnished the assassin with three pennies at the top a man with benevolent spectacles looked at them through a hole in a board he collected their money wrote some names on a register and speedily was leading the two men along a gloomshrouded corridor shortly after the beginning of this journey the young man felt his liver turn white for from the dark and secret places of the building there suddenly came to his nostrils strange and unspeakable odors that assailed him like malignant diseases with wings they seemed to be from human bodies closely packed in dens the exhalations from a hundred pairs of reeking lips the fumes from a thousand bygone debauches the expression of a thousand present miseries a man naked save for a little snuffcolored undershirt was parading sleepily along the corridor he rubbed his eyes and giving vent to a prodigious yawn demanded to be told the time halfpast one the man yawned again he opened a door and for a moment his form was outlined against a black opaque interior to this door came the three men and as it was again opened the unholy odors rushed out like fiends so that the young man was obliged to struggle as against an overpowering wind it was some time before the youths eyes were good in the intense gloom within but the man with benevolent spectacles led him skilfully pausing but a moment to deposit the limp assassin upon a cot he took the youth to a cot that lay tranquilly by the window and showing him a tall locker for clothes that stood near the head with the ominous air of a tombstone left him the youth sat on his cot and peered about him there was a gasjet in a distant part of the room that burned a small flickering orangehued flame it caused vast masses of tumbled shadows in all parts of the place save where immediately about it there was a little grey haze as the young mans eyes became used to the darkness he could see upon the cots that thickly littered the floor the forms of men sprawled out lying in deathlike silence or heaving and snoring with tremendous effort like stabbed fish the youth locked his derby and his shoes in the mummy case near him and then lay down with an old and familiar coat around his shoulders a blanket he handed gingerly drawing it over part of the coat the cot was covered with leather and as cold as melting snow the youth was obliged to shiver for some time on this affair which was like a slab presently however his chill gave him peace and during this period of leisure from it he turned his head to stare at his friend the assassin whom he could dimly discern where he lay sprawled on a cot in the abandon of a man filled with drink he was snoring with incredible vigor his wet hair and beard dimly glistened and his inflamed nose shone with subdued lustre like a red light in a fog within reach of the youths hand was one who lay with yellow breast and shoulders bare to the cold drafts one arm hung over the side of the cot and the fingers lay full length upon the wet cement floor of the room beneath the inky brows could be seen the eyes of the man exposed by the partly opened lids to the youth it seemed that he and this corpselike being were exchanging a prolonged stare and that the other threatened with his eyes he drew back watching his neighbor from the shadows of his blanket edge the man did not move once through the night but lay in this stillness as of death like a body stretched out expectant of the surgeons knife and all through the room could be seen the tawny hues of naked flesh limbs thrust into the darkness projecting beyond the cots upreared knees arms hanging long and thin over the cot edges for the most part they were statuesque carven dead with the curious lockers standing all about like tombstones there was a strange effect of a graveyard where bodies were merely flung yet occasionally could be seen limbs wildly tossing in fantastic nightmare gestures accompanied by guttural cries grunts oaths and there was one fellow off in a gloomy corner who in his dreams was oppressed by some frightful calamity for of a sudden he began to utter long wails that went almost like yells from a hound echoing wailfully and weird through this chill place of tombstones where men lay like the dead the sound in its high piercing beginnings that dwindled to final melancholy moans expressed a red and grim tragedy of the unfathomable possibilities of the mans dreams but to the youth these were not merely the shrieks of a visionpierced man they were an utterance of the meaning of the room and its occupants it was to him the protest of the wretch who feels the touch of the imperturbable granite wheels and who then cries with an impersonal eloquence with a strength not from him giving voice to the wail of a whole section a class a people this weaving into the young mans brain and mingling with his views of the vast and sombre shadows that like mighty black fingers curled around the naked bodies made the young man so that he did not sleep but lay carving the biographies for these men from his meagre experience at times the fellow in the corner howled in a writhing agony of his imaginations finally a long lancepoint of grey light shot through the dusty panes of the window without the young man could see roofs drearily white in the dawning the point of light yellowed and grew brighter until the golden rays of the morning sun came in bravely and strong they touched with radiant color the form of a small fat man who snored in stuttering fashion his round and shiny bald head glowed suddenly with the valor of a decoration he sat up blinked at the sun swore fretfully and pulled his blanket over the ornamental splendors of his head the youth contentedly watched this rout of the shadows before the bright spears of the sun and presently he slumbered when he awoke he heard the voice of the assassin raised in valiant curses putting up his head he perceived his comrade seated on the side of the cot engaged in scratching his neck with long fingernails that rasped like files hully jee dis is a new breed theyve got canopeners on their feet he continued in a violent tirade the young man hastily unlocked his closet and took out his shoes and hat as he sat on the side of the cot lacing his shoes he glanced about and saw that daylight had made the room comparatively commonplace and uninteresting the men whose faces seemed stolid serene or absent were engaged in dressing while a great crackle of bantering conversation arose a few were parading in unconcerned nakedness here and there were men of brawn whose skins shone clear and ruddy they took splendid poses standing massively like chiefs when they had dressed in their ungainly garments there was an extraordinary change they then showed bumps and deficiencies of all kinds there were others who exhibited many deformities shoulders were slanting humped pulled this way and pulled that way and notable among these latter men was the little fat man who had refused to allow his head to be glorified his pudgy form builded like a pear bustled to and fro while he swore in fishwife fashion it appeared that some article of his apparel had vanished the young man attired speedily and went to his friend the assassin at first the latter looked dazed at the sight of the youth this face seemed to be appealing to him through the cloud wastes of his memory he scratched his neck and reflected at last he grinned a broad smile gradually spreading until his countenance was a round illumination hello willie he cried cheerily hello said the young man are yeh ready t fly sure the assassin tied his shoe carefully with some twine and came ambling when he reached the street the young man experienced no sudden relief from unholy atmospheres he had forgotten all about them and had been breathing naturally and with no sensation of discomfort or distress he was thinking of these things as he walked along the street when he was suddenly startled by feeling the assassins hand trembling with excitement clutching his arm and when the assassin spoke his voice went into quavers from a supreme agitation ill be hully bloomin blowed if there wasnt a feller with a nightshirt on up there in that joint the youth was bewildered for a moment but presently he turned to smile indulgently at the assassins humor oh youre a d d liar he merely said whereupon the assassin began to gesture extravagantly and take oath by strange gods he frantically placed himself at the mercy of remarkable fates if his tale were not true yes he did i cross m heart thousan times he protested and at the moment his eyes were large with amazement his mouth wrinkled in unnatural glee yessir a nightshirt a hully white nightshirt you lie no sir i hope ter die bfore i kin git anudder ball if there wasnt a jay wid a hully bloomin white nightshirt his face was filled with the infinite wonder of it a hully white nightshirt he continually repeated the young man saw the dark entrance to a basement restaurant there was a sign which read no mystery about our hash and there were other agestained and worldbattered legends which told him that the place was within his means he stopped before it and spoke to the assassin i guess ill git somethin t eat at this the assassin for some reason appeared to be quite embarrassed he gazed at the seductive front of the eating place for a moment then he started slowly up the street well goodbye willie he said bravely for an instant the youth studied the departing figure then he called out hol on a minnet as they came together he spoke in a certain fierce way as if he feared that the other would think him to be charitable lookahere if yeh wanta git some breakfas ill lend yeh three cents t do it with but say lookahere youve gota git out an hustle i aint goin t support yeh or ill go broke bfore night i aint no millionaire i take me oath willie said the assassin earnestly th ony thing i really needs is a ball me troat feels like a fryinpan but as i cant get a ball why th next bes thing is breakfast an if yeh do that for me bgawd i say yeh was th whitest lad i ever see they spent a few moments in dexterous exchanges of phrases in which they each protested that the other was as the assassin had originally said a respecterble gentlemn and they concluded with mutual assurances that they were the souls of intelligence and virtue then they went into the restaurant there was a long counter dimly lighted from hidden sources two or three men in soiled white aprons rushed here and there the youth bought a bowl of coffee for two cents and a roll for one cent the assassin purchased the same the bowls were webbed with brown seams and the tin spoons wore an air of having emerged from the first pyramid upon them were black mosslike encrustations of age and they were bent and scarred from the attacks of longforgotten teeth but over their repast the wanderers waxed warm and mellow the assassin grew affable as the hot mixture went soothingly down his parched throat and the young man felt courage flow in his veins memories began to throng in on the assassin and he brought forth long tales intricate incoherent delivered with a chattering swiftness as from an old woman great job outn orange boss keep yeh hustlin though all time i was there three days and then i went an ask im t lend me a dollar gggo ter the devil he ses an i lose me job south no good damn niggers work for twentyfive an thirty cents a day run white man out good

wuthless skunk git t hell outa here an go die he ses youre a hell of a father i ses you are an i quit im as they were passing from the dim eating place they encountered an old man who was trying to steal forth with a tiny package of food but a tall man with an indomitable moustache stood dragon fashion barring the way of escape they heard the old man raise a plaintive protest ah you always want to know what i take out and you never see that i usually bring a package in here from my place of business as the wanderers trudged slowly along park row the assassin began to expand and grow blithe bgawd weve been livin like kings he said smacking appreciative lips look out or well have t pay fer it tnight said the youth with gloomy warning but the assassin refused to turn his gaze toward the future he went with a limping step into which he injected a suggestion of lamblike gambols his mouth was wreathed in a red grin in the city hall park the two wanderers sat down in the little circle of benches sanctified by traditions of their class they huddled in their old garments slumbrously conscious of the march of the hours which for them had no meaning the people of the street hurrying hither and thither made a blend of black figures changing yet friezelike they walked in their good clothes as upon important missions giving no gaze to the two wanderers seated upon the benches they expressed to the young man his infinite distance from all that he valued social position comfort the pleasures of living were unconquerable kingdoms he felt a sudden awe and in the background a multitude of buildings of pitiless hues and sternly high were to him emblematic of a nation forcing its regal head into the clouds throwing no downward glances in the sublimity of its aspirations ignoring the wretches who may flounder at its feet the roar of the city in his ear was to him the confusion of strange tongues babbling heedlessly it was the clink of coin the voice if the citys hopes which were to him no hopes he confessed himself an outcast and his eyes from under the lowered rim of his hat began to glance guiltily wearing the criminal expression that comes with certain convictions the duel that was not fought patsy tulligan was not as wise as seven owls but his courage could throw a shadow as long as the steeple of a cathedral there were men on cherry street who had whipped him five times but they all knew that patsy would be as ready for the sixth time as if nothing had happened once he and two friends had been away up on eighth avenue far out of their country and upon their return journey that evening they stopped frequently in saloons until they were as independent of their surroundings as eagles and cared much less about thirty days on blackwells on lower sixth avenue they paused in a saloon where there was a good deal of lampglare and polished wood to be seen from the outside and within the mellow light shone on much furbished brass and more polished wood it was a better saloon than they were in the habit of seeing but they did not mind it they sat down at one of the little tables that were in a row parallel to the bar and ordered beer they blinked stolidly at the decorations the bartender and the other customers when anything transpired they discussed it with dazzling frankness and what they said of it was as free as air to the other people in the place at midnight there were few people in the saloon patsy and his friends still sat drinking two welldressed men were at another table smoking cigars slowly and swinging back in their chairs they occupied themselves with themselves in the usual manner never betraying by a wink of an eyelid that they knew that other folk existed at another table directly behind patsy and his companions was a slim little cuban with miraculously small feet and hands and with a youthful touch of down upon his lip as he lifted his cigarette from time to time his little finger was bended in dainty fashion and there was a green flash when a huge emerald ring caught the light the bartender came often with his little brass tray occasionally patsy and his two friends quarrelled once this little cuban happened to make some slight noise and patsy turned his head to observe him then patsy made a careless and rather loud comment to his two friends he used a word which is no more than passing the time of day down in cherry street but to the cuban it was a daggerpoint there was a harsh scraping sound as a chair was pushed swiftly back the little cuban was upon his feet his eyes were shining with a rage that flashed there like sparks as he glared at patsy his olive face had turned a shade of grey from his anger withal his chest was thrust out in portentous dignity and his hand still grasping his wineglass was cool and steady the little finger still bended the great emerald gleaming upon it the others motionless stared at him sir he began ceremoniously he spoke gravely and in a slow way his tone coming in a marvel of selfpossessed cadences from between those lips which quivered with wrath you have insult me you are a dog a hound a cur i spit upon you i must have some of your blood patsy looked at him over his shoulder whats th matter wi che he demanded he did not quite understand the words of this little man who glared at him steadily but he knew that it was something about fighting he snarled with the readiness of his class and heaved his shoulders contemptuously ah whats eatin yeh take a walk you haint got nothin t do with me have yeh well den go sit on yerself and his companions leaned back valorously in their chairs and scrutinized this slim young fellow who was addressing patsy whats de little dago chewin about he wants t scrap what the cuban listened with apparent composure it was only when they laughed that his body cringed as if he was receiving lashes presently he put down his glass and walked over to their table he proceeded always with the most impressive deliberation sir he began again you have insult me i must have sssatisfacshone i must have your body upon the point of my sword in my country you would already be dead i must have sssatisfacshone patsy had looked at the cuban with a trifle of bewilderment but at last his face began to grow dark with belligerency his mouth curved in that wide sneer with which he would

his oration with one eloquent word nit the bartender nervously polished his bar with a towel and kept his eyes fastened upon the men occasionally he became transfixed with interest leaning forward with one hand upon the edge of the bar and the other holding the towel grabbed in a lump as if he had been turned into bronze when in the very act of polishing the cuban did not move when patsy came toward him and delivered his oration at its conclusion he turned his livid face toward where above him patsy was swaggering and heaving his shoulders in a consummate display of bravery and readiness the cuban in his clear tense tones spoke one word it was the bitter insult it seemed fairly to spin from his lips and crackle in the air like breaking glass every man save the little cuban made an electric movement patsy roared a black oath and thrust himself forward until he towered almost directly above the other man his fists were doubled into knots of bone and hard flesh the cuban had raised a steady finger if you touch me wis your hand i will keel you the two welldressed men had come swiftly uttering protesting cries they suddenly intervened in this second of time in which patsy had sprung forward and the cuban had uttered his threat the four men were now a tossing arguing violent group one welldressed man lecturing the cuban and the other holding off patsy who was now wild with rage loudly repeating the cubans threat and maneuvering and struggling to get at him for revenges sake the bartender feverishly scouring away with his towel and at times pacing to and fro with nervous and excited tread shouted out say for heavens sake dont fight in here if yeh wanta fight go out in the street and fight all yeh please but dont fight in here patsy knew one only thing and this he kept repeating well he wants t scrap i didnt begin dis he wants t scrap the welldressed man confronting him continually replied oh well now look here hes only a lad he dont know what hes doing hes

when one saw this great fact the interference and intolerable discussion brought the three of them forward battleful and fierce whats eatin you anyhow they demanded dis aint your business is it what

gentlemen or else i keel him when he touch me wis his hand the man who was fending off patsy comprehended these sentences that were screamed behind his back and he explained to patsy but he wants to fight you with swords with swords you know the cuban dodging around the peacemakers yelled in patsys face ah if i could get you before me wis my sword ah ah aaah patsy made a furious blow with a swift fist but the peacemakers bucked against his body suddenly like football players patsy was greatly puzzled he continued doggedly to try to get near enough to the cuban to punch him to these attempts the cuban replied savagely if you touch me wis your hand i will cut your heart in two piece at last patsy said well if hes so dead stuck on fightin wid swords ill fight im soitenly ill fight im all this palaver had evidently tired him and he now puffed out his lips with the air of a man who is willing to submit to any conditions if he can only bring on the row soon enough he swaggered ill fight

cuban his lithe body was quivering in an ecstasy of the muscles his face radiant with a savage joy he fastened his glance upon patsy his eyes gleaming with a gloating murderous light a most unspeakable animallike rage was in his expression ah ah he will fight me ah he bended unconsciously in the posture of a fencer he had all the quick springy movements of a skilful swordsman ah the brrrute the brrrute i will stick him like a pig the two peacemakers still grinning broadly were having a great time with patsy why you infernal idiot this man would slice you all up you better jump off the bridge if you want to commit suicide you wouldnt stand a ghost of a chance to live ten seconds patsy was as unshaken as granite well if he wants t fight wid swords hell get it ill giv im a go

down patsy delivered this intense oration with sweeping intensely emphatic gestures his hands stretched out eloquently his jaw thrust forward his eyes glaring ah cried the little cuban joyously ah you are in very pretty temper ah how i will cut your heart in two piece my dear dear friend his eyes too shone like carbuncles with a swift changing glitter always fastened upon patsys face the two peacemakers were perspiring and in despair one of them blurted out well ill be blamed if this aint the most ridiculous thing i ever saw the other said for ten dollars id be tempted to let these two infernal blockheads have their duel patsy was strutting to and fro and conferring grandly with his friends he took me for a muff he tought he was goin t bluff me out talkin bout swords hell get fooled he addressed the cuban youre a fine little dirty picter of a scrapper aint che ill chew yez up dats what i will there began then some rapid action the patience of welldressed men is not an eternal thing it began to look as if it would at last be a fight with six corners to it the faces of the men were shining red with anger they jostled each other defiantly and almost every one blazed out at three or four of the others the bartender had given up protesting he swore for a time and banged his glasses then he jumped the bar and ran out of the saloon cursing sullenly when he came back with a policeman patsy and the cuban were preparing to depart together patsy was delivering his last oration ill fight yer wid swords sure i will come ahead dago ill fight yeh anywheres wid anyting well have a large juicy scrap an dont yeh forgit dat im right wid yez i aint no muff i scrap with a man jest as soon as he ses scrap an if yeh wanta scrap im yer kitten understan dat the policeman said sharply come now whats all this he had a distinctly business air the little cuban stepped forward calmly it is none of your business the policeman flushed to his ears what one welldressed man touched the other on the sleeve heres the time to skip he whispered they halted a block away from the saloon and watched the policeman pull the cuban through the door there was a minute of scuffle on the sidewalk and into this deserted street at midnight fifty people appeared at once as if from the sky to watch it at last the three cherry hill men came from the saloon and swaggered with all their old valor toward the peacemakers ah said patsy to them he was so hot talkin about this duel business but i would agiven im a great scrap an dont yeh forgit it for patsy was not as wise as seven owls but his courage could throw a shadow as long as the steeple of a cathedral a desertion the yellow gaslight that came with an effect of difficulty through the duststained windows on either side of the door gave strange hues to the faces and forms of the three women who stood gabbling in the hallway of the tenement they made rapid gestures and in the background their enormous shadows mingled in terrific conflict aye she aint so good as he thinks she is ill bet he can watch over er an take care of er all he pleases but when she wants t fool im shell fool im an how does he know she aint foolin im now oh he thinks hes keepin er from goin t th bad he does oh yes he ses shes too purty t let run round alone too purty huh my sadie well he keeps a clost watch on er you bet ony las week she met my boy tim on th stairs an tim hadnt said two words to er bfore th ol man begin to holler dorter dorter come here come here at this moment a young girl entered from the street and it was evident from the injured expression suddenly assumed by the three gossipers that she had been the object of their discussion she passed them with a slight nod and they swung about into a row to stare after her on her way up the long flights the girl unfastened her veil one could then clearly see the beauty of her eyes but there was in them a certain furtiveness that came near to marring the effects it was a peculiar fixture of gaze brought from the street as of one who there saw a succession of passing dangers with menaces aligned at every corner on the top floor she pushed open a door and then paused on the threshold confronting an interior that appeared black and flat like a curtain perhaps some girlish idea of hobgoblins assailed her then for she called in a little breathless voice daddie there was no reply the fire in the cookingstove in the room crackled at spasmodic intervals one lid was misplaced and the girl could now see that this fact created a little flushed crescent upon the ceiling also a series of tiny windows in the stove caused patches of red upon the floor otherwise the room was heavily draped with shadows the girl called again daddie yet there was no reply oh daddie presently she laughed as one familiar with the humors of an old man oh i guess yer cussin mad about yer supper dad she said and she almost entered the room but suddenly faltered overcome by a feminine instinct to fly from this black interior peopled with imagined dangers again she called daddie her voice had an accent of appeal it was as if she knew she was foolish but yet felt obliged to insist upon being reassured oh daddie of a sudden a cry of relief a feminine announcement that the stars still hung burst from her for according to some mystic process the smoldering coals of the fire went aflame with sudden fierce brilliance splashing parts of the walls the floor the crude furniture with a hue of bloodred and in the light of this dramatic outburst of light the girl saw her father seated at a table with his back turned toward her she entered the room then with an aggrieved air her logic evidently concluding that somebody was to blame for her nervous fright oh yer ony sulkin bout yer supper i thought mebbe yed gone somewheres her father made no reply she went over to a shelf in the corner and taking a little lamp she lit it and put it where it would give her light as she took off her hat and jacket in front of the tiny mirror presently she began to bustle among the cooking utensils that were crowded into the sink and as she worked she rattled talk at her father apparently disdaining his mood id a come home earlier tnight dad ony that fly foreman he kep me in th shop til halfpast six what a fool he came t me yeh know an he ses nell i wanta give yeh some brotherly advice oh i know him an his brotherly advice i wanta give yeh some brotherly advice yer too purty nell he ses t be workin in this shop an paradin through the streets alone without somebody t

single possible time after a time she turned and addressed cheery words to the old man hurry up th fire daddie well have supper pretty soon but still her father was silent and his form in its sullen posture was motionless at this the girl seemed to see the need of the inauguration of a feminine war against a man out of temper she approached him breathing soft coaxing syllables daddie oh daddie o o oh daddie it was apparent from a subtle quality of valor in her tones that this manner of onslaught upon his moods had usually been successful but tonight it had no quick effect the words coming from her lips were like the refrain of an old ballad but the man remained stolid daddie my daddie oh daddie are yeh mad at me really truly mad at me she touched him lightly upon the arm should he have turned then he would have seen the fresh laughing face with dewsparkling eyes close to his own oh daddie my daddie pretty daddie she stole her arm about his neck and then slowly bended her face toward his it was the action of a queen who knows that she reigns notwithstanding irritations trials tempests but suddenly from this position she leaped backward with the mad energy of a frightened colt her face was in this instant turned to a grey featureless thing of horror a yell wild and hoarse as a brutecry burst from her daddie she flung herself to a place near the door where she remained crouching her eyes staring at the motionless figure spattered by the quivering flashes from the fire her arms extended and her frantic fingers at once besought and repelled there was in them an expression of eagerness to caress and an expression of the most intense loathing and the girls hair that had been a splendor was in these moments changed to a disordered mass that hung and swayed in witchlike fashion again a terrible cry burst from her it was more than the shriek of agony it was directed personal addressed to him in the chair the first word of a tragic conversation with the dead it seemed that when she had put her arm about its neck she had jostled the corpse in such a way that now she and it were face to face the attitude expressed an intention of arising from the table the eyes fixed upon hers were filled with an unspeakable hatred the cries of the girl aroused thunders in the tenement there was a loud slamming of doors and presently there was a roar of feet upon the boards of the stairway voices rang out sharply what is it whats th matter hes killin her slug im with anythin yeh kin lay hold of jack but over all this came the shrill shrewish tones of a woman ah th damned ol fool hes drivin er inteh th street thats what hes doin hes drivin er inteh th street a darkbrown dog a child was standing on a streetcorner he leaned with one shoulder against a high board fence and swayed the other to and fro the while kicking carelessly at the gravel sunshine beat upon the cobbles and a lazy summer wind raised yellow dust which trailed in clouds down the avenue clattering trucks moved with indistinctness through it the child stood dreamily gazing after a time a little darkbrown dog came trotting with an intent air down the sidewalk a short rope was dragging from his neck occasionally he trod upon the end of it and stumbled he stopped opposite the child and the two regarded each other the dog hesitated for a moment but presently he made some little advances with his tail the child put out his hand and called him in an apologetic manner the dog came close and the two had an interchange of friendly pattings and waggles the dog became more enthusiastic with each moment of the interview until with his gleeful caperings he threatened to overturn the child whereupon the child lifted his hand and struck the dog a blow upon the head this thing seemed to overpower and astonish the little darkbrown dog and wounded him to the heart he sank down in despair at the childs feet when the blow was repeated together with an admonition in childish sentences he turned over upon his back and held his paws in a peculiar manner at the same time with his ears and his eyes he offered a small prayer to the child he looked so comical on his back and holding his paws peculiarly that the child was greatly amused and gave him little taps repeatedly to keep him so but the little darkbrown dog took this chastisement in the most serious way and no doubt considered that he had committed some grave crime for he wriggled contritely and showed his repentance in every way that was in his power he pleaded with the child and petitioned him and offered more prayers at last the child grew weary of this amusement and turned toward home the dog was praying at the time he lay on his back and turned his eyes upon the retreating form presently he struggled to his feet and started after the child the latter wandered in a perfunctory way toward his home stopping at times to investigate various matters during one of these pauses he discovered the little darkbrown dog who was following him with the air of a footpad the child beat his pursuer with a small stick he had found the dog lay down and prayed until the child had finished and resumed his journey then he scrambled erect and took up the pursuit again on the way to his home the child turned many times and beat the dog proclaiming with childish gestures that he held him in contempt as an unimportant dog with no value save for a moment for being this quality of animal the dog apologized and eloquently expressed regret but he continued stealthily to follow the child his manner grew so very guilty that he slunk like an assassin when the child reached his doorstep the dog was industriously ambling a few yards in the rear he became so agitated with shame when he again confronted the child that he forgot the dragging rope he tripped upon it and fell forward the child sat down on the step and the two had another interview during it the dog greatly exerted himself to please the child he performed a few gambols with such abandon that the child suddenly saw him to be a valuable thing he made a swift avaricious charge and seized the rope he dragged his captive into a hall and up many long stairways in a dark tenement the dog made willing efforts but he could not hobble very skilfully up the stairs because he was very small and soft and at last the pace of the engrossed child grew so energetic that the dog became panicstricken in his mind he was being dragged toward a grim unknown his eyes grew wild with the terror of it he began to wiggle his head frantically and to brace his legs the child redoubled his exertions they had a battle on the stairs the child was victorious because he was completely absorbed in his purpose and because the dog was very small he dragged his acquirement to the door of his home and finally with triumph across the threshold no one was in the child sat down on the floor and made overtures to the dog these the dog instantly accepted he beamed with affection upon his new friend in a short time they were firm and abiding comrades when the childs family appeared they made a great row the dog was examined and commented upon and called names scorn was leveled at him from all eyes so that he became much embarrassed and drooped like a scorched plant but the child went sturdily to the center of the floor and at the top of his voice championed the dog it happened that he was roaring protestations with his arms clasped about the dogs neck when the father of the family came in from work the parent demanded to know what the blazes they were making the kid howl for it was explained in many words that the infernal kid wanted to introduce a disreputable dog into the family a family council was held on this depended the dogs fate but he in no way heeded being busily engaged in chewing the end of the childs dress the affair was quickly ended the father of the family it appears was in a particularly savage temper that evening and when he perceived that it would amaze and anger everybody if such a dog were allowed to remain he decided that it should be so the child crying softly took his friend off to a retired part of the room to hobnob with him while the father quelled a fierce rebellion of his wife so it came to pass that the dog was a member of the household he and the child were associated together at all times save when the child slept the child became a guardian and a friend if the large folk kicked the dog and threw things at him the child made loud and violent objections once when the child had run protesting loudly with tears raining down his face and his arms outstretched to protect his friend he had been struck in the head with a very large saucepan from the hand of his father enraged at some seeming lack of courtesy in the dog ever after the family were careful how they threw things at the dog moreover the latter grew very skilful in avoiding missiles and feet in a small room containing a stove a table a bureau and some chairs he would display strategic ability of a high order dodging feinting and scuttling about among the furniture he could force three or four people armed with brooms sticks and handfuls of coal to use all their ingenuity to get in a blow and even when they did it was seldom that they could do him a serious injury or leave any imprint but when the child was present these scenes did not occur it came to be recognized that if the dog was molested the child would burst into sobs and as the child when started was very riotous and practically unquenchable the dog had therein a safeguard however the child could not always be near at night when he was asleep his darkbrown friend would raise from some black corner a wild wailful cry a song of infinite loneliness and despair that would go shuddering and sobbing among the buildings of the block and cause people to swear at these times the singer would often be chased all over the kitchen and hit with a great variety of articles sometimes too the child himself used to beat the dog although it is not known that he ever had what truly could be called a just cause the dog always accepted these thrashings with an air of admitted guilt he was too much of a dog to try to look to be a martyr or to plot revenge he received the blows with deep humility and furthermore he forgave his friend the moment the child had finished and was ready to caress the childs hand with his little red tongue when misfortune came upon the child and his troubles overwhelmed him he would often crawl under the table and lay his small distressed head on the dogs back the dog was ever sympathetic it is not to be supposed that at such times he took occasion to refer to the unjust beatings his friend when provoked had administered to him he did not achieve any notable degree of intimacy with the other members of the family he had no confidence in them and the fear that he would express at their casual approach often exasperated them exceedingly they used to gain a certain satisfaction in underfeeding him but finally his friend the child grew to watch the matter with some care and when he forgot it the dog was often successful in secret for himself so the dog prospered he developed a large bark which came wondrously from such a small rug of a dog he ceased to howl persistently at night sometimes indeed in his sleep he would utter little yells as from pain but that occurred no doubt when in his dreams he encountered huge flaming dogs who threatened him direfully his devotion to the child grew until it was a sublime thing he wagged at his approach he sank down in despair at his departure he could detect the sound of the childs step among all the noises of the neighborhood it was like a calling voice to him the scene of their companionship was a kingdom governed by this terrible potentate the child but neither criticism nor rebellion ever lived for an instant in the heart of the one subject down in the mystic hidden fields of his little dogsoul bloomed flowers of love and fidelity and perfect faith the child was in the habit of going on many expeditions to observe strange things in the vicinity on these occasions his friend usually jogged aimfully along behind perhaps though he went ahead this necessitated his turning around every quarterminute to make sure the child was coming he was filled with a large idea of the importance of these journeys he would carry himself with such an air he was proud to be the retainer of so great a monarch one day however the father of the family got quite exceptionally drunk he came home and held carnival with the cooking utensils the furniture and his wife he was in the midst of this recreation when the child followed by the darkbrown dog entered the room they were returning from their voyages the childs practised eye instantly noted his fathers state he dived under the table where experience had taught him was a rather safe place the dog lacking skill in such matters was of course unaware of the true condition of affairs he looked with interested eyes at his friends sudden dive he interpreted it to mean joyous gambol he started to patter across the floor to join him he was the picture of a little darkbrown dog en route to a friend the head of the family saw him at this moment he gave a huge howl of joy and knocked the dog down with a heavy coffeepot the dog yelling in supreme astonishment and fear writhed to his feet and ran for cover the man kicked out with a ponderous foot it caused the dog to swerve as if caught in a tide a second blow of the coffeepot laid him upon the floor here the child uttering loud cries came valiantly forth like a knight the father of the family paid no attention to these calls of the child but advanced with glee upon the dog upon being knocked down twice in swift succession the latter apparently gave up all hope of escape he rolled over on his back and held his paws in a peculiar manner at the same time with his eyes and his ears he offered up a small prayer but the father was in a mood for having fun and it occurred to him that it would be a fine thing to throw the dog out of the window so he reached down and grabbing the animal by a leg lifted him squirming up he swung him two or three times hilariously about his head and then flung him with great accuracy through the window the soaring dog created a surprise in the block a woman watering plants in an opposite window gave an involuntary shout and dropped a flowerpot a man in another window leaned perilously out to watch the flight of the dog a woman who had been hanging out clothes in a yard began to caper wildly her mouth was filled with clothespins but her arms gave vent to a sort of exclamation in appearance she was like a gagged prisoner children ran whooping the darkbrown body crashed in a heap on the roof of a shed five stories below from thence it rolled to the pavement of an alleyway the child in the room far above burst into a long dirgelike cry and toddled hastily out of the room it took him a long time to reach the alley because his size compelled him to go downstairs backward one step at a time and holding with both hands to the step above when they came for him later they found him seated by the body of his darkbrown friend the pace of youth i stimson stood in a corner and glowered he was a fierce man and had indomitable whiskers albeit he was very small that young tarrier he whispered to himself he wants to quit makin eyes at lizzie this is too much of a good thing first thing you know hell get fired his brow creased in a frown he strode over to the huge open doors and looked at a sign stimsons mammoth merrygoround it read and the glory of it was great stimson stood and contemplated the sign it was an enormous affair the letters were as large as men the glow of it the grandeur of it was very apparent to stimson at the end of his contemplation he shook his head thoughtfully determinedly no no he muttered this is too much of a good thing first thing you know hell get fired a soft booming sound of surf mingled with the cries of bathers came from the beach there was a vista of sand and sky and sea that drew to a mystic point far away in the northward in the mighty angle a girl in a red dress was crawling slowly like some kind of a spider on the fabric of nature a few flags hung lazily above where the bathhouses were marshalled in compact squares upon the edge of the sea stood a ship with its shadowy sails painted dimly upon the sky and high overhead in the still sunshot air a great hawk swung and drifted slowly within the merrygoround there was a whirling circle of ornamental lions giraffes camels ponies goats glittering with varnish and metal that caught swift reflections from windows high above them with stiff wooden legs they swept on in a neverending race while a great orchestrion clamored in wild speed the summer sunlight sprinkled its gold upon the garnet canopies carried by the tireless racers and upon all the devices of decoration that made stimsons machine magnificent and famous a host of laughing children bestrode the animals bending forward like charging cavalrymen and shaking reins and whooping in glee at intervals they leaned out perilously to clutch at iron rings that were tendered to them by a long wooden arm at the intense moment before the swift grab for the rings one could see their little nervous bodies quiver with eagerness the laughter rang shrill and excited down in the long rows of benches crowds of people sat watching the game while occasionally a father might arise and go near to shout encouragement cautionary commands or applause at his flying offspring frequently mothers called out be careful georgie the orchestrion bellowed and thundered on its platform filling the ears with its long monotonous song over in a corner a man in a white apron and behind a counter roared above the tumult popcorn popcorn a young man stood upon a small raised platform erected in a manner of a pulpit and just without the line of the circling figures it was his duty to manipulate the wooden arm and affix the rings when all were gone into the hands of the triumphant children he held forth a basket into which they returned all save the coveted brass one which meant another ride free and made the holder very illustrious the young man stood all day upon his narrow platform affixing rings or holding forth the basket he was a sort of general squire in these lists of childhood he was very busy and yet stimson the astute had noticed that the young man frequently found time to twist about on his platform and smile at a girl who shyly sold tickets behind a silvered netting this indeed was the great reason of stimsons glowering the young man upon the raised platform had no manner of license to smile at the girl behind the silvered netting it was a most gigantic insolence stimson was amazed at it by jiminy he said to himself again that fellow is smiling at my daughter even in this tone of great wrath it could be discerned that stimson was filled with wonder that any youth should dare smile at the daughter in the presence of the august father often the darkeyed girl peered between the shining wires and upon being detected by the young man she usually turned her head quickly to prove to him that she was not interested at other times however her eyes seemed filled with a tender fear lest he should fall from that exceedingly dangerous platform as for the young man it was plain that these glances filled him with valor and he stood carelessly upon his perch as if he deemed it of no consequence that he might fall from it in all the complexities of his daily life and duties he found opportunity to gaze ardently at the vision behind the netting this silent courtship was conducted over the heads of the crowd who thronged about the bright machine the swift eloquent glances of the young man went noiselessly and unseen with their message there had finally become established between the two in this manner a subtle understanding and companionship they communicated accurately all that they felt the boy told his love his reverence his hope in the changes of the future the girl told him that she loved him and she did not love him that she did not know if she loved him sometimes a little sign saying cashier in gold letters and hanging upon the silvered netting got directly in range and interfered with the tender message the love affair had not continued without anger unhappiness despair the girl had once smiled brightly upon a youth who came to buy some tickets for his little sister and the young man upon the platform observing this smile had been filled with gloomy rage he stood like a dark statue of vengeance upon his pedestal and thrust out the basket to the children with a gesture that was full of scorn for their hollow happiness for their insecure and temporary joy for five hours he did not once look at the girl when she was looking at him he was going to crush her with his indifference he was going to demonstrate that he had never been serious however when he narrowly observed her in secret he discovered that she seemed more blythe than was usual with her when he found that his apparent indifference had not crushed her he suffered greatly she did not love him he concluded if she had loved him she would have been crushed for two days he lived a miserable existence upon his high perch he consoled himself by thinking of how unhappy he was and by swift furtive glances at the loved face at any rate he was in her presence and he could get a good view from his perch when there was no interference by the little sign cashier but suddenly swiftly these clouds vanished and under the imperial blue sky of the restored confidence they dwelt in peace a peace that was satisfaction a peace that like a babe put its trust in the treachery of the future this confidence endured until the next day when she for an unknown cause suddenly refused to look at him mechanically he continued his task his brain dazed a tortured victim of doubt fear suspicion with his eyes he supplicated her to telegraph an explanation she replied with a stony glance that froze his blood there was a great difference in their respective reasons for becoming angry his were always foolish but apparent plain as the moon hers were subtle feminine as incomprehensible as the stars as mysterious as the shadows at night they fell and soared and soared and fell in this manner until they knew that to live without each other would be a wandering in deserts they had grown so intent upon the uncertainties the variations the guessings of their affair that the world had become but a huge immaterial background in time of peace their smiles were soft and prayerful caresses confided to the air in time of war their youthful hearts capable of profound agony were wrung by the intricate emotions of doubt they were the victims of the dread angel of affectionate speculation that forces the brain endlessly on roads that lead nowhere at night the problem of whether she loved him confronted the young man like a spectre looming as high as a hill and telling him not to delude himself upon the following day this battle of the night displayed itself in the renewed fervor of his glances and in their increased number whenever he thought he could detect that she too was suffering he felt a thrill of joy but there came a time when the young man looked back upon these contortions with contempt he believed then that he had imagined his pain this came about when the redoubtable stimson marched forward to participate this has got to stop stimson had said to himself as he stood and watched them they had grown careless of the light world that clattered about them they were become so engrossed in their personal drama that the language of their eyes was almost as obvious as gestures and stimson through his keenness his wonderful infallible penetration suddenly came into possession of these obvious facts well of all the nerves he said regarding with a new interest the young man upon the perch he was a resolute man he never hesitated to grapple with a crisis he decided to overturn everything at once for although small he was very fierce and impetuous he resolved to crush this dreaming he strode over to the silvered netting say you want to quit your everlasting grinning at that idiot he said grimly the girl cast down her eyes and made a little heap of quarters into a stack she was unable to withstand the terrible scrutiny of her small and fierce father stimson turned from his daughter and went to a spot beneath the platform he fixed his eyes upon the young man and said ive been speakin to lizzie you better attend strictly to your own business or therell be a new man here next week it was as if he had blazed away with a shotgun the young man reeled upon his perch at last he in a measure regained his composure and managed to stammer a all right sir he knew that denials would be futile with the terrible stimson he agitatedly began to rattle the rings in the basket and pretend that he was obliged to count them or inspect them in some way he too was unable to face the great stimson for a moment stimson stood in fine satisfaction and gloated over the effect of his threat ive fixed them he said complacently and went out to smoke a cigar and revel in himself through his mind went the proud reflection that people who came in contact with his granite will usually ended in quick and abject submission ii one evening a week after stimson had indulged in the proud reflection that people who came in contact with his granite will usually ended in quick and abject submission a young feminine friend of the girl behind the silvered netting came to her there and asked her to walk on the beach after stimsons mammoth merrygoround was closed for the night the girl assented with a nod the young man upon the perch holding the rings saw this nod and judged its meaning into his mind came an idea of defeating the watchfulness of the redoubtable stimson when the merrygoround was closed and the two girls started for the beach he wandered off aimlessly in another direction but he kept them in view and as soon as he was assured that he had escaped the vigilance of stimson he followed them the electric lights on the beach made a broad band of tremoring light extending parallel to the sea and upon the wide walk there slowly paraded a great crowd intermingling intertwining sometimes colliding in the darkness stretched the vast purple expanse of the ocean and the deep indigo sky above was peopled with yellow stars occasionally out upon the water a whirling mass of froth suddenly flashed into view like a great ghostly robe appearing and then vanished leaving the sea in its darkness whence came those bass tones of the waters unknown emotion a wind cool reminiscent of the wave wastes made the women hold their wraps about their throats and caused the men to grip the rims of their straw hats it carried the noise of the band in the pavilion in gusts sometimes people unable to hear the music glanced up at the pavilion and were reassured upon beholding the distant leader still gesticulating and bobbing and the other members of the band with their lips glued to their instruments high in the sky soared an unassuming moon faintly silver for a time the young man was afraid to approach the two girls he followed them at a distance and called himself a coward at last however he saw them stop on the outer edge of the crowd and stand silently listening to the voices of the sea when he came to where they stood he was trembling in his agitation they had not seen him lizzie he began i the girl wheeled instantly and put her hand to her throat oh frank how you frightened me she said inevitably well you know i i he stuttered but the other girl was one of those beings who are born to attend at tragedies she had for love a reverence an admiration that was greater the more that she contemplated the fact that she knew nothing of it this couple with their emotions awed her and made her humbly wish that she might be destined to be of some service to them she was very homely when the young man faltered before them she in her sympathy actually overestimated the crisis and felt that he might fall dying at their feet shyly but with courage she marched to the rescue wont you come and walk on the beach with us she said the young man gave her a glance of deep gratitude which was not without the patronage which a man in his condition naturally feels for one who pities it the three walked on finally the being who was born to attend at this tragedy said that she wished to sit down and gaze at the sea alone they politely urged her to walk on with them but she was obstinate she wished to gaze at the sea alone the young man swore to himself that he would be her friend until he died and so the two young lovers went on without her they turned once to look at her jennies awful nice said the girl you bet she is replied the young man ardently they were silent for a little time at last the girl said you were angry at me yesterday no i wasnt yes you were too you wouldnt look at me once all day no i wasnt angry i was only putting on though she had of course known it this confession seemed to make her very indignant she flashed a resentful glance at him oh you were indeed she said with a great air for a few minutes she was so haughty with him that he loved her to madness and directly this poem which stuck at his lips came forth lamely in fragments when they walked back toward the other girl and saw the patience of her attitude their hearts swelled in a patronizing and secondary tenderness for her they were very happy if they had been miserable they would have charged this fairy scene of the night with a criminal heartlessness but as they were joyous they vaguely wondered how the purple sea the yellow stars the changing crowds under the electric lights could be so phlegmatic and stolid they walked home by the lakeside way and out upon the water those gay paper lanterns flashing fleeting and careering sang to them sang a chorus of red and violet and green and gold a song of mystic bands of the future one day when business paused during a dull sultry afternoon stimson went up town upon his return he found that the popcorn man from his stand over in a corner was keeping an eye upon the cashiers cage and that nobody at all was attending to the wooden arm and the iron rings he strode forward like a sergeant of grenadiers where in thunder is lizzie he demanded a cloud of rage in his eyes the popcorn man although associated long with stimson had never got over being dazed theyve theyve gone round to th th house he said with difficulty as if he had just been stunned whose house snapped stimson your your house i spose said the popcorn man stimson marched round to his home kingly denunciations surged already formulated to the tip of his tongue and he bided the moment when his anger could fall upon the heads of that pair of children he found his wife convulsive and in tears wheres lizzie and then she burst forth oh john john theyve run away i know they have they drove by here not three minutes ago they must have done it on purpose to bid me goodbye for lizzie waved her hand sadlike and then before i could get out to ask where they were going or what frank whipped up the horse stimson gave vent to a dreadful roar get my revolver get a hack get my revolver do you hear what the devil his voice became incoherent he had always ordered his wife about as if she were a battalion of infantry and despite her misery the training of years forced her to spring mechanically to obey but suddenly she turned to him with a shrill appeal oh john not the revolver confound it let go of me he roared again and shook her from him he ran hatless upon the street there were a multitude of hacks at the summer resort but it was ages to him before he could find one then he charged it like a bull uptown he yelled as he tumbled into the rear seat the hackman thought of severed arteries his galloping horse distanced a large number of citizens who had been running to find what caused such contortions by the little hatless man it chanced as the bouncing hack went along near the lake stimson gazed across the calm grey expanse and recognized a color in a bonnet and a pose of a head a buggy was traveling along a highway that led to sorington stimson bellowed there there there they are in that buggy the hackman became inspired with the full knowledge of the situation he struck a delirious blow with the whip his mouth expanded in a grin of excitement and joy it came to pass that this old vehicle with its drowsy horse and its dustyeyed and tranquil driver seemed suddenly to awaken to become animated and fleet the horse ceased to ruminate on his state his air of reflection vanished he became intent upon his aged legs and spread them in quaint and ridiculous devices for speed the driver his eyes shining sat critically in his seat he watched each motion of this rattling machine down before him he resembled an engineer he used the whip with judgment and deliberation as the engineer would have used coal or oil the horse clacked swiftly upon the macadam the wheels hummed the body of the vehicle wheezed and groaned stimson in the rear seat was erect in that impassive attitude that comes sometimes to the furious man when he is obliged to leave the battle to others frequently however the tempest in his breast came to his face and he howled go it go it youre gaining pound im thump the life out of im hit im hard you fool his hand grasped the rod that supported the carriage top and it was clenched so that the nails were faintly blue ahead that other carriage had been flying with speed as from realization of the menace in the rear it bowled away rapidly drawn by the eager spirit of a young and modern horse stimson could see the buggytop bobbing bobbing that little pane like an eye was a derision to him once he leaned forward and bawled angry sentences he began to feel impotent his whole expedition was a tottering of an old man upon a trail of birds a sense of age made him choke again with wrath that other vehicle that was youth with youths pace it was swiftflying with the hope of dreams he began to comprehend those two children ahead of him and he knew a sudden and strange awe because he understood the power of their young blood the power to fly strongly into the future and feel and hope again even at that time when his bones must be laid in the earth the dust rose easily from the hot road and stifled the nostrils of stimson the highway vanished far away in a point with a suggestion of intolerable length the other vehicle was becoming so small that stimson could no longer see the derisive eye at last the hackman drew rein to his horse and turned to look at stimson no use i guess he said stimson made a gesture of acquiescence rage despair as the hackman turned his dripping horse about stimson sank back with the astonishment and grief of a man who has been defied by the universe he had been in a great perspiration and now his bald head felt cool and uncomfortable he put up his hand with a sudden recollection that he had forgotten his hat at last he made a gesture it meant that at any rate he was not responsible a tent in agony a sullivan county tale four men once came to a wet place in the roadless forest to fish they pitched their tent fair upon the brow of a pineclothed ridge of riven rocks whence a bowlder could be made to crash through the brush and whirl past the trees to the lake below on fragrant hemlock boughs they slept the sleep of unsuccessful fishermen for upon the lake alternately the sun made them lazy and the rain made them wet finally they ate the last bit of bacon and smoked and burned the last fearful and wonderful hoecake immediately a little man volunteered to stay and hold the camp while the remaining three should go the sullivan county miles to a farmhouse for supplies they gazed at him dismally theres only one of you the devil make a twin they said in parting malediction and disappeared down the hill in the known direction of a distant cabin when it came night and the hemlocks began to sob they had not returned the little man sat close to his companion the campfire and encouraged it with logs he puffed fiercely at a heavy built brier and regarded a thousand shadows which were about to assault him suddenly he heard the approach of the unknown crackling the twigs and rustling the dead leaves the little man arose slowly to his feet his clothes refused to fit his back his pipe dropped from his mouth his knees smote each other hah he bellowed hoarsely in menace a growl replied and a bear paced into the light of the fire the little man supported himself upon a sapling and regarded his visitor the bear was evidently a veteran and a fighter for the black of his coat had become tawny with age there was confidence in his gait and arrogance in his small twinkling eye he rolled back his lips and disclosed his white teeth the fire magnified the red of his mouth the little man had never before confronted the terrible and he could not wrest it from his breast hah he roared the bear interpreted this as the challenge of a gladiator he approached warily as he came near the boots of fear were suddenly upon the little mans feet he cried out and then darted around the campfire ho said the bear to himself this thing wont fight it runs well suppose i catch it so upon his features there fixed the animal look of going somewhere he started intensely around the campfire the little man shrieked and ran furiously twice around they went the hand of heaven sometimes falls heavily upon the righteous the bear gained in desperation the little man flew into the tent the bear stopped and sniffed at the entrance he scented the scent of many men finally he ventured in the little man crouched in a distant corner the bear advanced creeping his blood burning his hair erect his jowls dripping the little man yelled and rustled clumsily under the flap at the end of the tent the bear snarled awfully and made a jump and a grab at his disappearing game the little man now without the tent felt a tremendous paw grab his coat tails he squirmed and wriggled out of his coat like a schoolboy in the hands of an avenger the bear bowled triumphantly and jerked the coat into the tent and took two bites a punch and a hug before he discovered his man was not in it then he grew not very angry for a bear on a spree is not a blackhaired pirate he is merely a hoodlum he lay down on his back took the coat on his four paws and began to play uproariously with it the most appalling bloodcurdling whoops and yells came to where the little man was crying in a treetop and froze his blood he moaned a little speech meant for a prayer and clung convulsively to the bending branches he gazed with tearful wistfulness at where his comrade the campfire was giving dying flickers and crackles finally there was a roar from the tent which eclipsed all roars a snarl which it seemed would shake the stolid silence of the mountain and cause it to shrug its granite shoulders the little man quaked and shrivelled to a grip and a pair of eyes in the glow of the embers he saw the white tent quiver and fall with a crash the bears merry play had disturbed the center pole and brought a chaos of canvas upon his head now the little man became the witness of a mighty scene the tent began to flounder it took flopping strides in the direction of the lake marvellous sounds came from within rips and tears and great groans and pants the little man went into giggling hysterics the entangled monster failed to extricate himself before he had walloped the tent frenziedly to the edge of the mountain so it came to pass that three men clambering up the hill with bundles and baskets saw their tent approaching it seemed to them like a whiterobed phantom pursued by hornets its moans riffled the hemlock twigs the three men dropped their bundles and scurried to one side their eyes gleaming with fear the canvas avalanche swept past them they leaned faint and dumb against trees and listened their blood stagnant below them it struck the base of a great pine tree where it writhed and struggled the three watched its convolutions a moment and then started terrifically for the top of the hill as they disappeared the bear cut loose with a mighty effort he cast one dishevelled and agonized look at the white thing and then started wildly for the inner recesses of the forest the three fearstricken individuals ran to the rebuilt fire the little man reposed by it calmly smoking they sprang at him and overwhelmed him with interrogations he contemplated darkness and took a long pompous puff theres only one of me and the devil made a twin he said four men in a cave likewise four queens and a sullivan county hermit the moon rested for a moment on the top of a tall pine on a hill the little man was standing in front of the campfire making orations to his companions we can tell a great tale when we get back to the city if we investigate this thing said he in conclusion they were won the little man was determined to explore a cave because its black mouth had gaped at him the four men took a lighted pineknot and clambered over boulders down a hill in a thicket on the mountainside lay a little tilted hole at its side they halted well said the little man they fought for last place and the little man was overwhelmed he tried to struggle from under by crying that if the fat pudgy man came after he would be corked but he finally administered a cursing over his shoulder and crawled into the hole his companions gingerly followed a passage the floor of damp clay and pebbles the walls slimy greenmossed and dripping sloped downward in the cave atmosphere the torches became studies in red blaze and black smoke ho cried the little man stifled and bedraggled lets go back his companions were not brave they were last the next one to the little man pushed him on so the little man said sulphurous words and cautiously continued his crawl things that hung seemed to be on the wet uneven ceiling ready to drop upon the mens bare necks under their hands the clammy floor seemed alive and writhing when the little man endeavored to stand erect the ceiling forced him down knobs and points came out and punched him his clothes were wet and mudcovered and his eyes nearly blinded by smoke tried to pierce the darkness always before his torch oh i say you fellows lets go back cried he at that moment he caught the gleam of trembling light in the blurred shadows before him ho he said heres another way out the passage turned abruptly the little man put one hand around the corner but it touched nothing he investigated and discovered that the little corridor took a sudden dip down a hill at the bottom shone a yellow light the little man wriggled painfully about and descended feet in advance the others followed his plan all picked their way with anxious care the traitorous rocks rolled from beneath the little mans feet and roared thunderously below him lesser stone loosened by the men above him hit him on the back he gained seemingly firm foothold and turning halfway about swore redly at his companions for dolts and careless fools the pudgy man sat puffing and perspiring high in the rear of the procession the fumes and smoke from four pineknots were in his blood cinders and sparks lay thick in his eyes and hair the pause of the little man angered him go on you fool he shouted poor painted man you are afraid ho said the little man come down here and go on yourself imbecile the pudgy man vibrated with passion he leaned downward idiot he was interrupted by one of his feet which flew out and crashed into the man in front of and below it is not well to quarrel upon a slippery incline when the unknown is below the fat man having lost the support of one pillarlike foot lurched forward his body smote the next man who hurtled into the next man then they all fell upon the cursing little man they slid in a body down over the slippery slimy floor of the passage the stone avenue must have wibblewobbled with the rush of this ball of tangled men and strangled cries the torches went out with the combined assault upon the little man the adventurers whirled to the unknown in darkness the little man felt that he was pitching to death but even in his convolutions he bit and scratched at his companions for he was satisfied that it was their fault the swirling mass went some twenty feet and lit upon a level dry place in a strong yellow light of candles it dissolved and became eyes the four men lay in a heap upon the floor of a grey chamber a small fire smoldered in the corner the smoke disappearing in a crack in another corner was a bed of faded hemlock boughs and two blankets cooking utensils and clothes lay about with boxes and a barrel of these things the four men took small cognisance the pudgy man did not curse the little man nor did the little man swear in the abstract eight widened eyes were fixed upon the center of the room of rocks a great gray stone cut squarely like an altar sat in the middle of the floor over it burned three candles in swaying tin cups hung from the ceiling before it with what seemed to be a small volume clasped in his yellow fingers stood a man he was an infinitely sallow person in the brownchecked shirt of the ploughs and cows the rest of his apparel was boots a long grey beard dangled from his chin he fixed glinting fiery eyes upon the heap of men and remained motionless fascinated their tongues cleaving their blood cold they arose to their feet the gleaming glance of the recluse swept slowly over the group until it found the face of the little man there it stayed and burned the little man shrivelled and crumpled as the dried leaf under the glass finally the recluse slowly deeply spoke it was a true voice from a cave cold solemn and damp its your ante he said what said the little man the hermit tilted his beard and laughed a laugh that was either the chatter of a banshee in a storm or the rattle of pebbles in a tin box his visitors flesh seemed ready to drop from their bones they huddled together and cast fearful eyes over their shoulders they whispered a vampire said one a ghoul said another a druid before the sacrifice murmured another the shade of an aztec witch doctor said the little man as they looked the inscrutable face underwent a change it became a livid background for his eyes which blazed at the little man like impassioned carbuncles his voice arose to a howl of ferocity its your ante with a pantherlike motion he drew a long thin knife and advanced stooping two cadaverous hounds came from nowhere and scowling and growling made desperate feints at the little mans legs his quaking companions pushed him forward tremblingly he put his hand to his pocket how much he said with a shivering look at the knife that glittered the carbuncles faded three dollars said the hermit in sepulchral tones which rang against the walls and among the passages awakening longdead spirits with voices the shaking little man took a roll of bills from a pocket and placed three ones upon the altarlike stone the recluse looked at the little volume with reverence in his eyes it was a pack of playing cards under the three swinging candles upon the altarlike stone the grey beard and the agonized little man played at poker the three other men crouched in a corner and stared with eyes that gleamed with terror before them sat the cadaverous hounds licking their red lips the candles burned low and began to flicker the fire in the corner expired finally the game came to a point where the little man laid down his hand and quavered i cant call you this time sir im dead broke what shrieked the recluse not call me villain dastard cur i have four queens miscreant his voice grew so mighty that it could not fit his throat he choked wrestling with his lungs for a moment then the power of his body was concentrated in a word go he pointed a quivering yellow finger at a wide crack in the rock the little man threw himself at it with a howl his erstwhile frozen companions felt their blood throb again with great bounds they plunged after the little man a minute of scrambling falling and pushing brought them to open air they climbed the distance to their camp in furious springs the sky in the east was a lurid yellow in the west the footprints of departing night lay on the pine trees in front of their replenished camp fire sat john willerkins the guide hello he shouted at their approach be you fellers ready to go deer huntin without replying they stopped and debated among themselves in whispers finally the pudgy man came forward john he inquired do you know anything peculiar about this cave below here yes said willerkins at once tom gardner what said the pudgy man tom gardner hows that well you see said willerkins slowly as he took dignified pulls at his pipe tom gardner was once a fambly man who lived in these here parts on a nice leetle farm he uster go away to the city orften and one time he got agamblin in one of them there dens he went ter the dickens right quick then at last he kum home one time and tol his folks he had up and sold the farm and all he had in the worl his leetle wife she died then tom he went crazy and soon after the narrative was interrupted by the little man who became possessed of devils i wouldnt give a cuss if he had left me nough money to get home on the doggoned greyhaired red pirate he shrilled in a seething sentence the pudgy man gazed at the little man calmly and sneeringly oh well he said we can tell a great tale when we get back to the city after having investigated this thing go to the devil replied the little man the mesmeric mountain a tale of sullivan county on the brow of a pineplumed hillock there sat a little man with his back against a tree a venerable pipe hung from his mouth and smokewreaths curled slowly skyward he was muttering to himself with his eyes fixed on an irregular black opening in the green wall of forest at the foot of the hill two vague wagon ruts led into the shadows the little man took his pipe in his hands and addressed the listening pines i wonder what the devil it leads to said he a grey fat rabbit came lazily from a thicket and sat in the opening softly stroking his stomach with his paw he looked at the little man in a thoughtful manner the little man threw a stone and the rabbit blinked and ran through an opening green shadowy portals seemed to close behind him the little man started hes gone down that roadway he said with ecstatic mystery to the pines he sat a long time and contemplated the door to the forest finally he arose and awakening his limbs started away but he stopped and looked back i cant imagine what it leads to muttered he he trudged over the brown mats of pine needles to where in a fringe of laurel a tent was pitched and merry flames caroused about some logs a pudgy man was fuming over a collection of tin dishes he came forward and waved a plate furiously in the little mans face ive washed the dishes for three days what do you think i am he ended a red oration with a roar damned if i do it any more the little man gazed dimeyed away ive been wonderin what it leads to what that road out yonder ive been wonderin what it leads to maybe some discovery or something said the little man the pudgy man laughed youre an idiot it leads to ol jim boyds over on the lumberland pike ho said the little man i dont believe that the pudgy man swore fool what does it lead to then i dont know just what but im sure it leads to something great or something it looks like it while the pudgy man was cursing two more men came from obscurity with fish dangling from birch twigs the pudgy man made an obviously herculean struggle and a meal was prepared as he was drinking his cup of coffee he suddenly spilled it and swore the little man was wandering off hes gone to look at that hole cried the pudgy man the little man went to the edge of the pineplumed hillock and sitting down began to make smoke and regard the door to the forest there was stillness for an hour compact clouds hung unstirred in the sky the pines stood motionless and pondering suddenly the little man slapped his knees and bit his tongue he stood up and determinedly filled his pipe rolling his eye over the bowl to the doorway keeping his eyes fixed he slid dangerously to the foot of the hillock and walked down the wagon ruts a moment later he passed from the noise of the sunshine to the gloom of the woods the green portals closed shutting out live things the little man trudged on alone tall tangled grass grew in the roadway and the trees bended obstructing branches the little man followed on over pineclothed ridges and down through watersoaked swales his shoes were cut by rocks of the mountains and he sank ankledeep in mud and moss of swamps a curve just ahead lured him miles finally as he wended the side of a ridge the road disappeared from beneath his feet he battled with hordes of ignorant bushes on his way to knolls and solitary trees which invited him once he came to a tall bearded pine he climbed it and perceived in the distance a peak he uttered an ejaculation and fell out he scrambled to his feet and said thats joness mountain i guess its about six miles from our camp as the crow flies he changed his course away from the mountain and attacked the bushes again he climbed over great logs goldenbrown in decay and was opposed by thickets of darkgreen laurel a brook slid through the ooze of a swamp cedars and hemlocks hung their spray to the edges of pools the little man began to stagger in his walk after a time he stopped and mopped his brow my legs are about to shrivel up and drop off he said still if i keep on in this direction i am safe to strike the lumberland pike before sundown he dived at a clump of tagalders and emerging confronted joness mountain the wanderer sat down in a clear space and fixed his eyes on the summit his mouth opened widely and his body swayed at times the little man and the peak stared in silence a lazy lake lay asleep near the foot of the mountain in its bed of watergrass some frogs leered at the sky and crooned the sun sank in red silence and the shadows of the pines grew formidable the expectant hush of evening as if some thing were going to sing a hymn fell upon the peak and the little man a leaping pickerel off on the water created a silver circle that was lost in black shadows the little man shook himself and started to his feet crying for the love of mike theres eyes in this mountain i feel em eyes he fell on his face when he looked again he immediately sprang erect and ran its comin the mountain was approaching the little man scurried sobbing through the thick growth he felt his brain turning to water he vanquished brambles with mighty bounds but after a time he came again to the foot of the mountain god he howled its been follerin me he grovelled casting his eyes upward made circles swirl in his blood im shackled i guess he moaned as he felt the heel of the mountain about to crush his head he sprang again to his feet he grasped a handful of small stones and hurled them damn you he shrieked loudly the pebbles rang against the face of the mountain the little man then made an attack he climbed with hands and feet wildly brambles forced him back and stones slid from beneath his feet the peak swayed and tottered and was ever about to smite with a granite arm the summit was a blaze of red wrath but the little man at last reached the top immediately he swaggered with valor to the edge of the cliff his hands were scornfully in his pockets he gazed at the western horizon edged sharply against a yellow sky ho he said theres boyds house and the lumberland pike the mountain under his feet was motionless the snake where the path wended across the ridge the bushes of huckleberry and sweet fern swarmed at it in two curling waves until it was a mere winding line traced through a tangle there was no interference by clouds and as the rays of the sun fell full upon the ridge they called into voice innumerable insects which chanted the heat of the summer day in steady throbbing unending chorus a man and a dog came from the laurel thickets of the valley where the white brook brawled with the rocks they followed the deep line of the path across the ridges the dog a large lemon and white setter walked tranquilly meditative at his masters heels suddenly from some unknown and yet near place in advance there came a dry shrill whistling rattle that smote motion instantly from the limbs of the man and the dog like the fingers of a sudden death this sound seemed to touch the man at the nape of the neck at the top of the spine and change him as swift as thought to a statue of listening horror surprise rage the dog too the same icy hand was laid upon him and he stood crouched and quivering his jaw dropping the froth of terror upon his lips the light of hatred in his eyes slowly the man moved his hands toward the bushes but his glance did not turn from the place made sinister by the warning rattle his fingers unguided sought for a stick of weight and strength presently they closed about one that seemed adequate and holding this weapon poised before him the man moved slowly forward glaring the dog with his nervous nostrils fairly fluttering moved warily one foot at a time after his master but when the man came upon the snake his body underwent a shock as if from a revelation as if after all he had been ambushed with a blanched face he sprang forward and his breath came in strained gasps his chest heaving as if he were in the performance of an extraordinary muscular trial his arm with the stick made a spasmodic defensive gesture the snake had apparently been crossing the path in some mystic travel when to his sense there came the knowledge of the coming of his foes the dull vibration perhaps informed him and he flung his body to face the danger he had no knowledge of paths he had no wit to tell him to slink noiselessly into the bushes he knew that his implacable enemies were approaching no doubt they were seeking him hunting him and so he cried his cry an incredibly swift jangle of tiny bells as burdened with pathos as the hammering upon quaint cymbals by the chinese at war for indeed it was usually his deathmusic beware beware beware the man and the snake confronted each other in the mans eyes were hatred and fear in the snakes eyes were hatred and fear these enemies maneuvered each preparing to kill it was to be a battle without mercy neither knew of mercy for such a situation in the man was all the wild strength of the terror of his ancestors of his race of his kind a deadly repulsion had been handed from man to man through long dim centuries this was another detail of a war that had begun evidently when first there were men and snakes individuals who do not participate in this strife incur the investigations of scientists once there was a man and a snake who were friends and at the end the man lay dead with the marks of the snakes caress just over his east indian heart in the formation of devices hideous and horrible nature reached her supreme point in the making of the snake so that priests who really paint hell well fill it with snakes instead of fire the curving forms these scintillant coloring create at once upon sight more relentless animosities than do shake barbaric tribes to be born a snake is to be thrust into a place aswarm with formidable foes to gain an appreciation of it view hell as pictured by priests who are really skilful as for this snake in the pathway there was a double curve some inches back of its head which merely by the potency of its lines made the man feel with tenfold eloquence the touch of the deathfingers at the nape of his neck the reptiles head was waving slowly from side to side and its hot eyes flashed like little murderlights always in the air was the dry shrill whistling of the rattles beware beware beware the man made a preliminary feint with his stick instantly the snakes heavy head and neck were bended back on the double curve and instantly the snakes body shot forward in a low strait hard spring the man jumped with a convulsive chatter and swung his stick the blind sweeping blow fell upon the snakes head and hurled him so that steelcolored plates were for a moment uppermost but he rallied swiftly agilely and again the head and neck bended back to the double curve and the steaming wideopen mouth made its desperate effort to reach its enemy this attack it could be seen was despairing but it was nevertheless impetuous gallant ferocious of the same quality as the charge of the lone chief when the walls of white faces close upon him in the mountains the stick swung unerringly again and the snake mutilated torn whirled himself into the last coil and now the man went sheer raving mad from the emotions of his forefathers and from his own he came to close quarters he gripped the stick with his two hands and made it speed like a flail the snake tumbling in the anguish of final despair fought bit flung itself upon this stick which was taking his life at the end the man clutched his stick and stood watching in silence the dog came slowly and with infinite caution stretched his nose forward sniffing the hair upon his neck and back moved and ruffled as if a sharp wind was blowing the last muscular quivers of the snake were causing the rattles to still sound their treble cry the shrill ringing war chant and hymn of the grave of the thing that faces foes at once countless implacable and superior well rover said the man turning to the dog with a grin of victory well carry mr snake home to show the girls his hands still trembled from the strain of the encounter but he pried with his stick under the body of the snake and hoisted the limp thing upon it he resumed his march along the path and the dog walked tranquilly meditative at his masters heels london impressions chapter i london at first consisted of a porter with the most charming manners in the world and a cabman with a supreme intelligence both observing my profound ignorance without contempt or humor of any kind observable in their manners it was in a great resounding vault of a place where there were many people who had come home and i was displeased because they knew the detail of the business whereas i was confronting the inscrutable this made them appear very stonyhearted to the sufferings of one of whose existence to be sure they were entirely unaware and i remember taking great pleasure in disliking them heartily for it i was in an agony of mind over my baggage or my luggage or my perhaps it is well to shy around this terrible international question but i remember that when i was a lad i was told that there was a whole nation that said luggage instead of baggage and my boyish mind was filled at the time with incredulity and scorn in the present case it was a thing that i understood to involve the most hideous confessions of imbecility on my part because i had evidently to go out to some obscure point and espy it and claim it and take trouble for it and i would rather have had my pockets filled with bread and cheese and had no baggage at all mind you this was not at all a homage that i was paying to london i was paying homage to a new game a man properly lazy does not like new experiences until they become old ones moreover i have been taught that a man any man who has a thousand times more points of information on a certain thing than i have will bully me because of it and pour his advantages upon my bowed head until i am drenched with his superiority it was in my education to concede some license of the kind in this case but the holy father of a porter and the saintly cabman occupied the middle distance imperturbably and did not come down from their hills to clout me with knowledge from this fact i experienced a criminal elation i lost view of the idea that if i had been browbeaten by porters and cabmen from one end of the united states to the other end i should warmly like it because in numbers they are superior to me and collectively they can have a great deal of fun out of a matter that would merely afford me the glee of the latent butcher this london composed of a porter and a cabman stood to me subtly as a benefactor i had scanned the drama and found that i did not believe that the mood of the men emanated unduly from the feature that there was probably more shillings to the square inch of me than there were shillings to the square inch of them nor yet was it any manner of palpable warmheartedness or other natural virtue but it was a perfect artificial virtue it was drill plain simple drill and now was i glad of their drilling and vividly approved of it because i saw that it was good for me whether it was good or bad for the porter and the cabman i could not know but that point mark you came within the pale of my respectable rumination i am sure that it would have been more correct for me to have alighted upon st pauls and described no emotion until i was overcome by the thames embankment and the houses of parliament but as a matter of fact i did not see them for some days and at this time they did not concern me at all i was born in london at a railroad station and my new vision encompassed a porter and a cabman they deeply absorbed me in new phenomena and i did not then care to see the thames embankment nor the houses of parliament i considered the porter and the cabman to be more important chapter ii the cab finally rolled out of the gaslit vault into a vast expanse of gloom this changed to the shadowy lines of a street that was like a passage in a monstrous cave the lamps winking here and there resembled the little gleams at the caps of the miners they were not very competent illuminations at best merely being little pale flares of gas that at their most heroic periods could only display one fact concerning this tunnel the fact of general direction but at any rate i should have liked to have observed the dejection of a searchlight if it had been called upon to attempt to bore through this atmosphere in it each man sat in his own little cylinder of vision so to speak it was not so small as a sentrybox nor so large as a circus tent but the walls were opaque and what was passing beyond the dimensions of his cylinder no man knew it was evident that the paving was very greasy but all the cabs that passed through my cylinder were going at a round trot while the wheels shod in rubber whirred merely like bicycles the hoofs of the animals themselves did not make that wild clatter which i knew so well new york in fact roars always like ten thousand devils we have ingenuous and simple ways of making a din in new york that cause the stranger to conclude that each citizen is obliged by statute to provide himself with a pair of cymbals and a drum if anything by chance can be turned into a noise it is promptly turned we are engaged in the development of a human creature with very large sturdy and doubly fortified ears it was not too late at night but this london moved with the decorum and caution of an undertaker there was a silence and yet there was no silence there was a low drone perhaps a humming contributed inevitably by closelygathered thousands and yet on second thoughts it was to me silence i had perched my ears for the note of london the sound made simply by the existence of five million people in one place i had imagined something deep vastly deep a bass from a mythical organ but found as far as i was concerned only a silence new york in numbers is a mighty city and all day and all night it cries its loud fierce aspiring cry a noise of men beating upon barrels a noise of men beating upon tin a terrific racket that assails the abject skies no one of us seemed to question this row as a certain consequence of three or four million people living together and scuffling for coin with more agility perhaps but otherwise in the usual way however after this easy silence of london which in numbers is a mightier city i began to feel that there was a seduction in this idea of necessity our noise in new york was not a consequence of our rapidity at all it was a consequence of our bad pavements any brigade of artillery in europe that would love to assemble its batteries and then go on a gallop over the land thundering and thundering would give up the idea of thunder at once if it could hear tim mulligan drive a beer wagon along one of the side streets of cobbled new york chapter iii finally a great thing came to pass the cab horse proceeding at a sharp trot found himself suddenly at the top of an incline where through the rain the pavement shone like an expanse of ice it looked to me as if there was going to be a tumble in an accident of such a kind a hansom becomes really a cannon in which a man finds that he has paid shillings for the privilege of serving as a projectile i was making a rapid calculation of the arc that i would describe in my flight when the horse met his crisis with a masterly device that i could not have imagined he tranquilly braced his four feet like a bundle of stakes and then with a gentle gaiety of demeanor he slid swiftly and gracefully to the bottom of the hill as if he had been a toboggan when the incline ended he caught his gait again with great dexterity and went pattering off through another tunnel i at once looked upon myself as being singularly blessed by this sight this horse had evidently originated this system of skating as a diversion or more probably as a precaution against the slippery pavement and he was of course the inventor and sole proprietor two terms that are not always in conjunction it surely was not to be supposed that there could be two skaters like him in the world he deserved to be known and publicly praised for this accomplishment it was worthy of many records and exhibitions but when the cab arrived at a place where some dipping streets met and the flaming front of a musichall temporarily widened my cylinder behold there were many cabs and as the moment of necessity came the horses were all skaters they were gliding in all directions it might have been a rink a great omnibus was hailed by a hand under an umbrella on the side walk and the dignified horses bidden to halt from their trot did not waste time in wild and unseemly spasms they too braced their legs and slid gravely to the end of their momentum it was not the feat but it was the word which had at this time the power to conjure memories of skating parties on moonlit lakes with laughter ringing over the ice and a great red bonfire on the shore among the hemlocks chapter iv a terrible thing in nature is the fall of a horse in his harness it is a tragedy despite their skill in skating there was that about the pavement on the rainy evening which filled me with expectations of horses going headlong finally it happened just in front there was a shout and a tangle in the darkness and presently a prostrate cab horse came within my cylinder the accident having been a complete success and altogether concluded a voice from the side walk said look out now be more careful cant you i remember a constituent of a congressman at washington who had tried in vain to bore this congressman with a wild project of some kind the congressman eluded him with skill and his rage and despair ultimately culminated in the supreme grievance that he could not even get near enough to the congressman to tell him to go to hades this cabman should have felt the same desire to strangle this man who spoke from the sidewalk he was plainly impotent he was deprived of the power of looking out there was nothing now for which to look out the man on the sidewalk had dragged a corpse from a pond and said to it be more careful cant you or youll drown my cabman pulled up and addressed a few words of reproach to the other three or four figures loomed into my cylinder and as they appeared spoke to the author or the victim of the calamity in varied terms of displeasure each of these reproaches was couched in terms that defined the situation as impending no blind man could have conceived that the precipitate phrase of the incident was absolutely closed look out now cawnt you and there was nothing in his mind which approached these sentiments near enough to tell them to go to hades however it needed only an ear to know presently that these expressions were formulae it was merely the obligatory dance which the indians had to perform before they went to war these men had come to help but as a regular and traditional preliminary they had first to display to this cabman their idea of his ignominy the different thing in the affair was the silence of the victim he retorted never a word this too to me seemed to be an obedience to a recognized form he was the visible criminal if there was a criminal and there was born of it a privilege for them they unfastened the proper straps and hauled back the cab they fetched a mat from some obscure place of succor and pushed it carefully under the prostrate thing from this panting quivering mass they suddenly and emphatically reconstructed a horse as each man turned to go his way he delivered some superior caution to the cabman while the latter buckled his harness chapter v there was to be noticed in this band of rescuers a young man in evening clothes and tophat now in america a young man in evening clothes and a tophat may be a terrible object he is not likely to do violence but he is likely to do impassivity and indifference to the point where they become worse than violence there are certain of the more idle phases of civilization to which america has not yet awakened and it is a matter of no moment if she remains unaware this matter of hats is one of them i recall a legend recited to me by an esteemed friend exsheriff of tin can nevada jim cortright one of the best gunfighters in town went on a journey to chicago and while there he procured a tophat he was quite sure how tin can would accept this innovation but he relied on the celerity with which he could get a sixshooter in action one sunday jim examined his guns with his usual care placed the tophat on the back of his head and sauntered coolly out into the streets of tin can now while jim was in chicago some progressive citizen had decided that tin can needed a bowling alley the carpenters went to work the next morning and an order for the balls and pins was telegraphed to denver in three days the whole population was concentrated at the new alley betting their outfits and their lives it has since been accounted very unfortunate that jim cortright had not learned of bowling alleys at his mothers knee or even later in the mines this portion of his mind was singularly belated he might have been an apache for all he knew of bowling alleys in his careless stroll through the town his hands not far from his belt and his eyes going sideways in order to see who would shoot first at the hat he came upon this long low shanty where tin can was betting itself hoarse over a game between a team from the ranks of excelsior hose company no and a team composed from the habitues of the red light saloon jim in blank ignorance of bowling phenomena wandered casually through a little door into what must always be termed the wrong end of a bowling alley of course he saw that the supreme moment had come they were not only shooting at the hat and at him but the lowdown cusses were using the most extraordinary and hellish ammunition still perfectly undaunted however jim retorted with his two colts and killed three of the best bowlers in tin can the exsheriff vouched for this story he himself had gone headlong through the door at the firing of the first shot with that simple courtesy which leads western men to donate the fighters plenty of room he said that afterwards the hat was the cause of a number of other fights and that finally a delegation of prominent citizens was obliged to wait upon cortright and ask him if he wouldnt take that thing away somewhere and bury it jim pointed out to them that it was his hat and that he would regard it as a cowardly concession if he submitted to their dictation in the matter of his headgear he added that he purposed to continue to wear his tophat on every occasion when he happened to feel that the wearing of a tophat was a joy and a solace to him the delegation sadly retired and announced to the town that jim cortright had openly defied them and had declared his purpose of forcing his tophat on the pained attention of tin can whenever he chose jim cortrights plug hat became a phrase with considerable meaning to it however the whole affair ended in a great passionate outburst of popular revolution spike foster was a friend of cortright and one day when the latter was indisposed spike came to him and borrowed the hat he had been drinking heavily at the red light and was in a supremely reckless mood with the terrible gear hanging jauntily over his eye and his two guns drawn he walked straight out into the middle of the square in front of the palace hotel and drew the attention of all tin can by a bloodcurdling imitation of the yowl of a mountain lion this was when the long suffering populace arose as one man the tophat had been flaunted once too often when spike fosters friends came to carry him away they found nearly a hundred and fifty men shooting busily at a mark and the mark was the hat my informant told me that he believed he owed his popularity in tin can and subsequently his election to the distinguished office of sheriff to the active and prominent part he had taken in the proceedings the enmity to the tophat expressed by the convincing anecdote exists in the american west at present i think in the perfection of its strength but disapproval is not now displayed by volleys from the citizens save in the most aggravating cases it is at present usually a matter of mere jibe and general contempt the east however despite a great deal of kicking and gouging is having the tophat stuffed slowly and carefully down its throat and there now exist many young men who consider that they could not successfully conduct their lives without this furniture to speak generally i should say that the headgear then supplies them with a kind of ferocity of indifference there is fire sword and pestilence in the way they heed only themselves philosophy should always know that indifference is a militant thing it batters down the walls of cities and murders the women and children amid flames and the purloining of altar vessels when it goes away it leaves smoking ruins where lie citizens bayoneted through the throat it is not a childrens pastime like mere highway robbery consequently in america we may be much afraid of these young men we dive down alleys so that we may not kowtow it is a fearsome thing taught thus a deep fear of the tophat in its effect upon youth i was not prepared for the move of this particular young man when the cabhorse fell in fact i grovelled in my corner that i might not see the cruel stateliness of his passing but in the meantime he had crossed the street and contributed the strength of his back and some advice as well as the formal address to the cabman on the importance of looking out immediately i felt that i was making a notable collection i had a new kind of porter a cylinder of vision horses that could skate and now i added a young man in a tophat who would tacitly admit that the beings around him were alive he was not walking a churchyard filled with inferior headstones he was walking the world where there were people many people but later i took him out of the collection i thought he had rebelled against the manner of a class but i soon discovered that the tophat was not the property of a class it was the property of rogues clerks theatrical agents damned seducers poor men nobles and others in fact it was the universal rigging it was the only hat all other forms might as well be named ham or chops or oysters i retracted my admiration of the young man because he may have been merely a rogue chapter vi there was a window whereat an enterprising man by dodging two placards and a calendar was entitled to view a young woman she was dejectedly writing in a large book she was ultimately induced to open the window a trifle what nyme please she said wearily i was surprised to hear this language from her i had expected to be addressed on a submarine topic i have seen shell fishes sadly writing in large books at the bottom of a gloomy acquarium who could not ask me what was my nyme at the end of the hall there was a grim portal marked lift i pressed an electric button and heard an answering tinkle in the heavens there was an upholstered settle near at hand and i discovered the reason a deerstalking peace drooped upon everything and in it a man could invoke the passing of a lazy pageant of twenty years of his life the dignity of a coffin being lowered into a grave surrounded the ultimate appearance of the lift the expert we in america call the elevatorboy stepped from the car took three paces forward faced to attention and saluted this elevator boy could not have been less than sixty years of age a great white beard streamed towards his belt i saw that the lift had been longer on its voyage than i had suspected later in our upward progress a natural event would have been an establishment of social relations two enemies imprisoned together during the still hours of a balloon journey would i believe suffer a mental amalgamation the overhang of a common fate a great principal fact can make an equality and a truce between any pair yet when i disembarked a final survey of the grey beard made me recall that i had failed even to ask the boy whether he had not taken probably three trips on this lift my windows overlooked simply a great sea of night in which were swimming little gas fishes chapter vii i have of late been led to reflect wistfully that many of the illustrators are very clever in an impatience which was donated by a certain economy of apparel i went to a window to look upon daylit london there were the buses parading the streets with the miens of elephants there were the police looking precisely as i had been informed by the prints there were the sandwichmen there was almost everything but the artists had not told me the sound of london now in new york the artists are able to portray sound because in new york a dray is not a dray at all it is a great potent noise hauled by two or more horses when a magazine containing an illustration of a new york street is sent to me i always know it beforehand i can hear it coming through the mails as i have said previously this which i must call sound of london was to me only a silence later in front of the hotel a cabman that i hailed said to me are you gowing far sir ive got a byby here and want to giver a bit of a blough this impressed me as being probably a quotation from an early egyptian poet but i learned soon enough that the word byby was the name of some kind or condition of horse the cabmans next remark was addressed to a boy who took a perilous dive between the bybys nose and a cab in front thats roight put your head in there and get it jammed a whackin good place for it i should think although the tone was low and circumspect i have never heard a better offhanded declamation every word was cut clear of disreputable alliances with its neighbors the whole thing was clean as a row of pewter mugs the influence of indignation upon the voice caused me to reflect that we might devise a mechanical means of inflaming some in that constellation of mummers which is the heritage of the anglosaxon race then i saw the drilling of vehicles by two policemen there were four torrents converging at a point and when four torrents converge at one point engineering experts buy tickets for another place but here again it was drill plain simple drill i must not falter in saying that i think the management of the traffic as the phrase goes to be distinctly illuminating and wonderful the police were not ruffled and exasperated they were as peaceful as two cows in a pasture i can remember once remarking that mankind with all its boasted modern progress had not yet been able to invent a turnstile that will commute in fractions i have now learned that rightsofway cannot operate simultaneously at one point rightofway like fighting women requires space even two rightsofway can make a scene which is only suited to the tastes of an ancient public this truth was very evidently recognized there was only one rightofway at a time the police did not look behind them to see if their orders were to be obeyed they knew they were to be obeyed these four torrents were drilling like four battalions the two bluecloth men maneuvered them in solemn abiding peace the silence of london i thought at first that it was the intellect of the individual but i looked at one constable closely and his face was as afire with intelligence as a flannel pincushion it was not the police and it was not the crowd it was the police and the crowd again it was drill chapter viii i have never been in the habit of reading signs i dont like to read signs i have never met a man that liked to read signs i once invented a creature who could play the piano with a hammer and i mentioned him to a professor in harvard university whose peculiarity was sanscrit he had the same interest in my invention that i have in a certain kind of mustard and yet this mustard has become a part of me or i have become a part of this mustard further i know more of an ink a brand of hams a kind of cigarette and a novelist than any man living i went by train to see a friend in the country and after passing through a patent mucilage some more hams a south african investment company a parisian millinery firm and a comic journal i alighted at a new and original kind of corset on my return journey the road almost continuously ran through soap i have accumulated superior information concerning these things because i am at their mercy if i want to know where i am i must find the definitive sign this accounts for my glib use of the word mucilage as well as the titles of other staples i suppose even the briton in mixing his life must sometimes consult the labels on buses and streets and stations even as the chemist consults the labels on his bottles and boxes a brave man would possibly affirm that this was suggested by the existence of the labels the reason that i did not learn more about hams and mucilage in new york seems to me to be partly due to the fact that the british advertiser is allowed to exercise an unbridled strategy in his attack with his new corset or whatever upon the defensive public he knows that the vulnerable point is the informatory sign which the citizen must of course use for his guidance and then with horse foot guns corsets hams mucilage investment companies and all he hurls himself at the point meanwhile i have discovered a way to make the sanscrit scholar heed my creature who plays the piano with a hammer the scotch express the entrance to euston station is of itself sufficiently imposing it is a high portico of brown stone old and grim in form a casual imitation no doubt of the front of the temple of nike apteros with a recollection of the egyptians proclaimed at the flanks the frieze where of old would prance an exuberant processional of gods is in this case bare of decoration but upon the epistyle is written in simple stern letters the word euston the legend reared high by the gloomy pelagic columns stares down a wide avenue in short this entrance to a railway station does not in any way resemble the entrance to a railway station it is more the front of some venerable bank but it has another dignity which is not born of form to a great degree it is to the english and to those who are in england the gate to scotland the little hansoms are continually speeding through the gate dashing between the legs of the solemn temple the fourwheelers their tops crowded with luggage roll in and out constantly and the footways beat under the trampling of the people of course there are the suburbs and a hundred towns along the line and liverpool the beginning of an important seapath to america and the great manufacturing cities of the north but if one stands at this gate in august particularly one must note the number of men with guncases the number of women who surely have tamoshanters and plaids concealed within their luggage ready for the moors there is during the latter part of that month a wholesale flight from london to scotland which recalls the july throngs leaving new york for the shore or the mountains the hansoms after passing through this impressive portal of the station bowl smoothly across a courtyard which is in the center of the terminal hotel an institution dear to most railways in europe the traveler lands amid a swarm of porters and then proceeds cheerfully to take the customary trouble for his luggage america provides a contrivance in a thousand situations where europe provides a man or perhaps a number of men and the work of our brass check is here done by porters directed by the traveler himself the men lack the memory of the check the check never forgets its identity moreover the european railways generously furnish the porters at the expense of the traveler nevertheless if these men have not the invincible business precision of the check and if they have to be tipped it can be asserted for those who care that in europe onehalf of the populace waits on the other half most diligently and well against the masonry of a platform under the vaulted arch of the trainhouse lay a long string of coaches they were painted white on the bulging part which led halfway down from the top and the bodies were a deep bottlegreen there was a group of porters placing luggage in the van and a great many others were busy with the affairs of passengers tossing smaller bits of luggage into the racks over the seats and bustling here and there on short quests the guard of the train a tall man who resembled one of the first napoleons veterans was caring for the distribution of passengers into the various bins there were no secondclass compartments they were all third and firstclass the train was at this time engineless but presently a railway flier painted a glowing vermilion slid modestly down and took its place at the head the guard walked along the platform and decisively closed each door he wore a dark blue uniform thoroughly decorated with silver braid in the guise of leaves the way of him gave to this business the importance of a ceremony meanwhile the fireman had climbed down from the cab and raised his hand ready to transfer a signal to the driver who stood looking at his watch in the interval there had something progressed in the large signal box that stands guard at euston this high house contains many levers standing in thick shining ranks it perfectly resembles an organ in some great church if it were not that these rows of numbered and indexed handles typify something more acutely human than does a keyboard it requires four men to play this organlike thing and the strains never cease night and day day and night these four men are walking to and fro from this lever to that lever and under their hands the great machine raises its endless hymn of a world at work the fall and rise of signals and the clicking swing of switches and so as the vermilion engine stood waiting and looking from the shadow of the curveroofed station a man in the signal house had played the notes that informed the engine of its freedom the driver saw the fall of those proper semaphores which gave him liberty to speak to his steel friend a certain combination in the economy of the london and northwestern railway a combination which had spread from the men who sweep out the carriages through innumerable minds to the general manager himself had resulted in the law that the vermilion engine with its long string of white and bottlegreen coaches was to start forthwith toward scotland presently the fireman standing with his face toward the rear let fall his hand all right he said the driver turned a wheel and as the fireman slipped back the train moved along the platform at the pace of a mouse to those in the tranquil carriages this starting was probably as easy as the sliding of ones hand over a greased surface but in the engine there was more to it the monster roared suddenly and loudly and sprang forward impetuously a wrongheaded or maddened drafthorse will plunge in its collar sometimes when going up a hill but this load of burdened carriages followed imperturbably at the gait of turtles they were not to be stirred from their way of dignified exit by the impatient engine the crowd of porters and transient people stood respectful they looked with the indefinite wonder of the railwaystation sightseer upon the faces at the windows of the passing coaches this train was off for scotland it had started from the home of one accent to the home of another accent it was going from manner to manner from habit to habit and in the minds of these london spectators there surely floated dim images of the traditional kilts the burring speech the grouse the canniness the oatmeal all the elements of a romantic scotland the train swung impressively around the signalhouse and headed up a brickwalled cut in starting this heavy string of coaches the engine breathed explosively it gasped and heaved and bellowed once for a moment the wheels spun on the rails and a convulsive tremor shook the great steel frame the train itself however moved through this deep cut in the body of london with coolness and precision and the employees of the railway knowing the trains mission tacitly presented arms at its passing to the travelers in the carriages the suburbs of london must have been one long monotony of carefully made walls of stone or brick but after the hill was climbed the train fled through pictures of red habitations of men on a green earth but the noise in the cab did not greatly change its measure even though the speed was now high the tremendous thumping to be heard in the cab was as alive with strained effort and as slow in beat as the breathing of a halfdrowned man at the side of the track for instance the sound doubtless would strike the ear in the familiar succession of incredibly rapid puffs but in the cab itself this landracer breathes very like its friend the marine engine everybody who has spent time on shipboard has forever in his head a reminiscence of the steady and methodical pounding of the engines and perhaps it is curious that this relative which can whirl over the land at such a pace breathes in the leisurely tones that a man heeds when he lies awake at night in his berth there had been no fog in london but here on the edge of the city a heavy wind was blowing and the driver leaned aside and yelled that it was a very bad day for traveling on an engine the enginecabs of england as of all europe are seldom made for the comfort of the men one finds very often this apparent disregard for the man who does the work this indifference to the man who occupies a position which for the exercise of temperance of courage of honesty has no equal at the altitude of prime ministers the american engineer is the gilded occupant of a salon in comparison with his brother in europe the man who was guiding this fivehundredton bolt aimed by the officials of the railway at scotland could not have been as comfortable as a shrill gibbering boatman of the orient the narrow and bare bench at his side of the cab was not directly intended for his use because it was so low that he would be prevented by it from looking out of the ships porthole which served him as a window the fireman on his side had other difficulties his legs would have had to straggle over some pipes at the only spot where there was a prospect and the builders had also strategically placed a large steel bolt of course it is plain that the companies consistently believe that the men will do their work better if they are kept standing the roof of the cab was not altogether a roof it was merely a projection of two feet of metal from the bulkhead which formed the front of the cab there were practically no sides to it and the large cinders from the soft coal whirled around in sheets from time to time the driver took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his blinking eyes london was now well to the rear the vermilion engine had been for some time flying like the wind this train averages between london and carlisle fortynine and ninetenth miles an hour it is a distance of miles there is one stop it occurs at crewe and endures five minutes in consequence the block signals flashed by seemingly at the end of the moment in which they were sighted there can be no question of the statement that the roadbeds of english railways are at present immeasurably superior to the american roadbeds of course there is a clear reason it is known to every traveler that peoples of the continent of europe have no right at all to own railways those lines of travel are too childish and trivial for expression a correct fate would deprive the continent of its railways and give them to somebody who knew about them the continental idea of a railway is to surround a mass of machinery with forty rings of ultramilitary law and then they believe they have one complete the americans and the english are the railway peoples that our roadbeds are poorer than the english roadbeds is because of the fact that we were suddenly obliged to build thousands upon thousands of miles of railway and the english were obliged to build slowly tens upon tens of miles a roadbed from new york to san francisco with stations bridges and crossings of the kind that the london and northwestern owns from london to glasgow would cost a sum large enough to support the german army for a term of years the whole way is constructed with the care that inspired the creators of some of our now obsolete forts along the atlantic coast an american engineer with his knowledge of the difficulties he had to encounter the wide rivers with variable banks the mountain chains perhaps the long spaces of absolute desert in fact all the perplexities of a vast and somewhat new country would not dare spend a respectable portion of his allowance on seventy feet of granite wall over a gully when he knew he could make an embankment with little cost by heaving up the dirt and stones from here and there but the english road is all made in the pattern by which the romans built their highways after england is dead savants will find narrow streaks of masonry leading from ruin to ruin of course this does not always seem convincingly admirable it sometimes resembles energy poured into a rathole there is a vale between expediency and the convenience of posterity a midground which enables men surely to benefit the hereafter people by valiantly advancing the present and the point is that if some laborers live in unhealthy tenements in cornwall one is likely to view with incomplete satisfaction the record of long and patient labor and thought displayed by an eightfoot drain for a nonexistent impossible rivulet in the north this sentence does not sound strictly fair but the meaning one wishes to convey is that if an english company spies in its dream the ghost of an ancient valley that later becomes a hill it would construct for it a magnificent steel trestle and consider that a duty had been performed in proper accordance with the companys conscience but after all is said of it the accidents and the miles of railway operated in england are not in proportion to the accidents and the miles of railway operated in the united states the reason can be divided into three parts older conditions superior caution the roadbed and of these the greatest is older conditions in this flight toward scotland one seldom encountered a grade crossing in nine cases of ten there was either a bridge or a tunnel the platforms of even the remote country stations were all of ponderous masonry in contrast to our constructions of planking there was always to be seen as we thundered toward a station of this kind a number of porters in uniform who requested the retreat of any one who had not the wit to give us plenty of room and then as the shrill warning of the whistle pierced even the uproar that was about us came the wild joy of the rush past a station it was something in the nature of a triumphal procession conducted at thrilling speed perhaps there was a curve of infinite grace a sudden hollow explosive effect made by the passing of a signalbox that was close to the track and then the deadly lunge to shave the edge of a long platform there were always a number of people standing afar with their eyes riveted upon this projectile and to be on the engine was to feel their interest and admiration in the terror and grandeur of this sweep a boy allowed to ride with the driver of the bandwagon as a circus parade winds through one of our village streets could not exceed for egotism the temper of a new man in the cab of a train like this one this valkyric journey on the back of the vermilion engine with the shouting of the wind the deep mighty panting of the steed the gray blur at the trackside the flowing quicksilver ribbon of the other rails the sudden clash as a switch intersects all the din and fury of this ride was of a splendor that caused one to look abroad at the quiet green landscape and believe that it was of a phlegm quiet beyond patience it should have been dark rainshot and windy thunder should have rolled across its sky it seemed somehow that if the driver should for a moment take his hands from his engine it might swerve from the track as a horse from the road once indeed as he stood wiping his fingers on a bit of waste there must have been something ludicrous in the way the solitary passenger regarded him without those finely firm hands on the bridle the engine might rear and bolt for the pleasant farms lying in the sunshine at either side this driver was worth contemplation he was simply a quiet middleaged man bearded and with the little wrinkles of habitual geniality and kindliness spreading from the eyes toward the temple who stood at his post always gazing out through his round window while from time to time his hands went from here to there over his levers he seldom changed either attitude or expression there surely is no enginedriver who does not feel the beauty of the business but the emotion lies deep and mainly inarticulate as it does in the mind of a man who has experienced a good and beautiful wife for many years this drivers face displayed nothing but the cool sanity of a man whose thought was buried intelligently in his business if there was any fierce drama in it there was no sign upon him he was so lost in dreams of speed and signals and steam that one speculated if the wonder of his tempestuous charge and its career over england touched him this impassive rider of a fiery thing it should be a wellknown fact that all over the world the enginedriver is the finest type of man that is grown he is the pick of the earth he is altogether more worthy than the soldier and better than the men who move on the sea in ships he is not paid too much nor do his glories weight his brow but for outright performance carried on constantly coolly and without elation by a temperate honest clearminded man he is the further point and so the lone human at his station in a cab guarding money lives and the honor of the road is a beautiful sight the whole thing is aesthetic the fireman presents the same charm but in a less degree in that he is bound to appear as an apprentice to the finished manhood of the driver in his eyes turned always in question and confidence toward his superior one finds this quality but his aspirations are so direct that one sees the same type in evolution there may be a popular idea that the firemans principal function is to hang his head out of the cab and sight interesting objects in the landscape as a matter of fact he is always at work the dragon is insatiate the fireman is continually swinging open the furnacedoor whereat a red shine flows out upon the floor of the cab and shoveling in immense mouthfuls of coal to a fire that is almost diabolic in its madness the feeding feeding feeding goes on until it appears as if it is the muscles of the firemans arms that are speeding the long train an engine running over sixtyfive miles an hour with tons to drag has an appetite in proportion to this task view of the clearshining english scenery is often interrupted between london and crew by long and short tunnels the first one was disconcerting suddenly one knew that the train was shooting toward a black mouth in the hills it swiftly yawned wider and then in a moment the engine dived into a place inhabitated by every demon of wind and noise the speed had not been checked and the uproar was so great that in effect one was simply standing at the center of a vast blackwalled sphere the tubular construction which ones reason proclaimed had no meaning at all it was a black sphere alive with shrieks but then on the surface of it there was to be seen a little needlepoint of light and this widened to a detail of unreal landscape it was the world the train was going to escape from this cauldron this abyss of howling darkness if a man looks through the brilliant water of a tropical pool he can sometimes see coloring the marvels at the bottom the blue that was on the sky and the green that was on the foliage of this detail and the picture shimmered in the heatrays of a new and remarkable sun it was when the train bolted out into the open air that one knew that it was his own earth once train met train in a tunnel upon the painting in the perfectly circular frame formed by the mouth there appeared a black square with sparks bursting from it this square expanded until it hid everything and a moment later came the crash of the passing it was enough to make a man lose his sense of balance it was a momentary inferno when the fireman opened the furnace door and was bathed in bloodred light as he fed the fires the effect of a tunnel varied when there was a curve in it one was merely whirling then heels over head apparently in the dark echoing bowels of the earth there was no needlepoint of light to which ones eyes clung as to a star from london to crew the stern arm of the semaphore never made the train pause even for an instant there was always a clear track it was great to see far in the distance a goods train whooping smokily for the north of england on one of the four tracks the overtaking of such a train was a thing of magnificent nothing for the longstrided engine and as the flying express passed its weaker brother one heard one or two feeble and immature puffs from the other engine saw the fireman wave his hand to his luckier fellow saw a string of foolish clanking flatcars their freights covered with tarpaulins and then the train was lost to the rear the driver twisted his wheel and worked some levers and the rhythmical chunking of the engine gradually ceased gliding at a speed that was still high the train curved to the left and swung down a sharp incline to move with an imperial dignity through the railway yard at rugby there was a maze of switches innumerable engines noisily pushing cars here and there crowds of workmen who turned to look a sinuous curve around the long trainshed whose high wall resounded with the rumble of the passing express and then almost immediately it seemed came the open country again rugby had been a dream which one could properly doubt at last the relaxed engine with the same majesty of ease swung into the highroofed station at crewe and stopped on a platform lined with porters and citizens there was instant bustle and in the interest of the moment no one seemed particularly to notice the tired vermilion engine being led away there is a fiveminute stop at crewe a tandem of engines slip up and buckled fast to the train for the journey to carlisle in the meantime all the regulation items of peace and comfort had happened on the train itself the diningcar was in the center of the train it was divided into two parts the one being a diningroom for firstclass passengers and the other a diningroom for the thirdclass passengers they were separated by the kitchens and the larder the engine with all its rioting and roaring had dragged to crewe a car in which numbers of passengers were lunching in a tranquility that was almost domestic on an average menu of a chop and potatoes a salad cheese and a bottle of beer betimes they watched through the windows the great chimneymarked towns of northern england they were waited upon by a young man of london who was supported by a lad who resembled an american bellboy the rather elaborate menu and service of the pullman diningcar is not known in england or on the continent warmed roast beef is the exact symbol of a european dinner when one is traveling on a railway this express is named both by the public and the company the corridor train because a coach with a corridor is an unusual thing in england and so the title has a distinctive meaning of course in america where there is no car which has not what we call an aisle it would define nothing the corridors are all at one side of the car doors open thence to little compartments made to seat four or perhaps six persons the firstclass carriages are very comfortable indeed being heavily upholstered in dark hardwearing stuffs with a bulging rest for the head the thirdclass accommodations on this train are almost as comfortable as the firstclass and attract a kind of people that are not usually seen traveling thirdclass in europe many people sacrifice their habit in the matter of this train to the fine conditions of the lower fare one of the feats of the train is an electric button in each compartment commonly an electric button is placed high on the side of the carriage as an alarm signal and it is unlawful to push it unless one is in serious need of assistance from the guard but these bells also rang in the diningcar and were supposed to open negotiations for tea or whatever a new function has been projected on an ancient custom no genius has yet appeared to separate these two meanings each bell rings an alarm and a bid for tea or whatever it is perfect in theory then that if one rings for tea the guard comes to interrupt the murder and that if one is being murdered the attendant appears with tea at any rate the guard was forever being called from his reports and his comfortable seat in the forward end of the luggagevan by thrilling alarms he often prowled the length of the train with hardihood and determination merely to meet a request for a sandwich the train entered carlisle at the beginning of twilight this is the border town and an engine of the caledonian railway manned by two men of broad speech came to take the place of the tandem the engine of these men of the north was much smaller than the others but her cab was much larger and would be a fair shelter on a stormy night they had also built seats with hooks by which they hang them to the rail and thus are still enabled to see through the round windows without dislocating their necks all the human parts of the cab were covered with oilcloth the wind that swirled from the dim twilight horizon made the warm glow from the furnace to be a grateful thing as the train shot out of carlisle a glance backward could learn of the faint yellow blocks of light from the carriages marked on the dimmed ground the signals were now lamps and shone palely against the sky the express was entering night as if night were scotland there was a long toil to the summit of the hills and then began the booming ride down the slope there were many curves sometimes could be seen two or three signal lights at one time twisting off in some new direction minus the lights and some yards of glistening rails scotland was only a blend of black and weird shapes forests which one could hardly imagine as weltering in the dewy placidity of evening sank to the rear as if the gods had bade them the dark loom of a house quickly dissolved before the eyes a station with its lamps became a broad yellow band that to a deficient sense was only a few yards in length below in a deep valley a silver glare on the waters of a river made equal time with the train signals appeared grew and vanished in the wind and the mystery of the night it was like sailing in an enchanted gloom the vague profiles of hills ran like snakes across the somber sky a strange shape boldly and formidably confronted the train and then melted to a long dash of track as clean as swordblades the vicinity of glasgow is unmistakable the flames of pauseless industries are here and there marked on the distance vast factories stand close to the track and reaching chimneys emit roseate flames at last one may see upon a wall the strong reflection from furnaces and against it the impish and inky figures of workingmen a long prisonlike row of tenements not at all resembling london but in one way resembling new york appeared to the left and then sank out of sight like a phantom at last the driver stopped the brave effort of his engine the miles were come to the edge the average speed of fortynine and onethird miles each hour had been made and it remained only to glide with the hauteur of a great express through the yard and into the station at glasgow a wide and splendid collection of signal lamps flowed toward the engine with delicacy and care the train clanked over some switches passes the signals and then there shone a great blaze of arclamps defining the wide sweep of the station roof smoothly proudly with all that vast dignity which had surrounded its exit from london the express moved along its platform it was the entrance into a gorgeous drawingroom of a man that was sure of everything the porters and the people crowded forward in their minds there may have floated dim images of the traditional musichalls the bobbies the buses the arrys and arriets the swells of london the end
