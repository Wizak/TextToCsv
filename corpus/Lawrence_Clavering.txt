picture hangs at my lodgings here at avignon a stones throw from the porte de la ligne and within the shadow of notre dame des doms though its intended housingplace was the great gallery of blackladies but it never did hang there nor ever will nor do i care that it should no not the scrape of a fiddle i have heard men circumstanced like myself tell how as they fell into years more and more their thoughts flew homewards like so many carrierpigeons each with its message of longing but blackladies though it was the only home i ever knew in england did not of right belong to me and the period during which i was master there was so populous with troubles so chequered with the impertinent follies of an inexperienced youth raised of a sudden above his station that even now after all these years i look back on it with a burning shame and if one day perchance as i walk in the alleys here beyond the city walls the wind in the branches will whisper to me of the house and the brown hills about it it is only because i was in england while i lived there and if again as i happen to stand upon the banks of the rhone i see unexpectedly reflected in the broken mirror of its waters the terraces the gardens the long row of windows and am touched for the moment to a foolish melancholy by the native aspect of its gables why it is only because i look out here across a country of tourelles however i come back to my lodging and there is my picture on the wall an accountant as it were ever casting up the good fortune and the mishaps of my life and ever striking a sure balance in my favour i take the description of it from a letter which mr george vertue wrote to a friend of mine in london and that friend despatched to me for since the picture is a portrait of myself it may be that an account of it from anothers hand will be the more readily credited mr vertue saw it some years since at a dealers in paris whither being at that time hard pressed for money i had sent it but was lucky enough not to discover a purchaser i have come across a very curious picture he wrote of which i would gladly know more and i trust that you may help me to the knowledge for more than once you have spoken to me of mr lawrence clavering who fought for the chevalier de st george at preston and was out too in the fortyfive the picture is the bust of a young gentleman painted by anthony herbert and with all the laborious minuteness which was distinctive of his earlier methods indeed in the delicacy with which the lace of the cravat is figured the painter has i think exceeded himself and even exceeded vandermijn whom at this period he seems to have taken for his model the coat too which is of a rosepink in colour is painted with the same elaboration the very threads of the velvet being visible the richness of the work gives a very artful effect when you come to look at the face which chiefly provokes my curiosity in colour it is a dead white except for the lips which are purple as though the blood stagnated there the eyes are glassy and bright with something of horror or fear staring out of them the features knotted out of all comeliness the mouth half opened and curled in the very sickness of pain the whole expression in a word that of a man in the extremity of suffering a souls torture superimposed upon an agony of the body and all this painted with such circumstantial exactness as implies not merely great leisure in the artist but also a singular pleasure and gusto in his subject after a few more remarks of a like sort he continues i made it my business to inquire of mr herbert the history of the picture but he would tell me no more than this that it was the portrait of mr lawrence clavering painted in that gentlemans youth and that if i would have fuller knowledge on the matter i must get it from mr clavering himself and mrs herbert a very gentle woman now growing old but i should say of considerable beauty in her prime warmly seconded him in his reticence therefore i address myself to you to act as an intermediary between mr clavering and myself the information i did not think it fitting at that time to deliver but both mr herbert and his wife are dead these three years past and so i write out the history of my picture setting down as my memory serves the incidents which attach to it in the due order of their sequence for if the picture is a strange one it has i think a history to match chapter ii i take a walk and hear a sermon in the company of lord bolingbroke that history i take to have begun on the th day of march at paris in the year i was sitting in my room at the jesuit college in the rue st antoine with the de imitatione at one elbow and marco polos travels at the other and alas i fear that i gave more attention to the adventurer than i did to the theologian but in truth neither author occupied the chief place in my thoughts for the spring sparkled in the air its music was noisy among the budding trees and something of its music too seemed to be singing in my blood from my window i looked down across the rooftops to the le st louis and i could see a strip of the seine flashing in the sunlight like a riband of steel it was on the current of the river that my thoughts floated yet they travelled faster than the current seeing that while i still looked they had reached the bar where the river clashes with the sea i had the tumble of its waters in my ears when the door was opened and one of the lay coadjutors entered with a message that the rector wished to speak with me i followed him down the stairs not without a guilty apprehension as to the nature of the interview in store for me and found the rector pacing backwards and forwards across one end of the hall with his hands folded behind his back as i made my reverence he stopped and eyed me for a moment thoughtfully twelve months since said he you received from the duke of ormond in england the offer of a cornetcy in the horse guards yes father i replied taken aback by his unexpected commencement and i replied hastily i refused it you refused it he repeated very deliberately and then suddenly bending his eyebrows and without reluctance i felt my face flush as he asked the question father i stammered i refused it and so came to a stop he nodded his head once or twice but pressed me no further upon the point instead you know at whose instance the commission was offered to you he asked i have no certain knowledge i replied with considerable relief but i can think of but one person in the world with the power and inclination to do me that service ah broke in the rector sharply you count it a service then he would count it a service i answered with a clumsy effort to retrieve the mistake for my part father i refused it precisely said he he would count it a service he was doing you there are no fine feathers in our army and there is no leisure to parade them were there any yes lord bolingbroke would count it a service he was doing you now although the relationship between lord bolingbroke and myself was the merest thread my father having married a niece of lady joanna st john i was well enough acquainted with his diligence to know that the sneer was unjust and i was preparing to make some rejoinder in a proper spirit of humility when the rector continued it is of lord bolingbroke that i wish to speak to you he is in paris in paris father i exclaimed incredulously in paris he came last night and asks permission of me this morning that you should wait on him father i cried you will give that permission he shook his head over my eagerness and resumed his walk very well he said at length and he gave me lord bolingbrokes address you can go now he added i waited no longer than sufficed to utter a brief word of thanks and hurried towards the door my son i turned back towards the rector with a doleful thought that he would revoke his permission but as i approached him reluctantly enough i saw something of a smile brighten upon his rigorous face my son he said without a trace of his former severity you have taken no vows as yet and will not for eight months to come think and think humbly during those months our order thank god is not so poor in service that we need to reckon obstinacy as devotion i stood abashed and shamefaced at his words father i said i have chosen but it is for us to ratify the choice he answered with a cast back to his former sternness or to annul it as unworthy with that he dismissed me but this time being somewhat stung by his warning i retired with a more decorous step once in the street however i made up for the delay for in truth i was at some trouble to account for my kinsmans sudden arrival in france for although walpole had publicly declared his intention of bringing both bolingbroke and the earl of oxford to trial for their work in compassing the peace of utrecht it was common rumour that bolingbroke and his colleague awaited the impeachment in all confidence as to its issue this hasty departure however bore to my thinking all the appearance of a desperate flight and i hurried to his lodging in no small anxiety of spirit my lord bolingbroke makes but a slight figure in this story of my picture compared with that he made upon the wider field of a nations chronicle and it is very well for me that this is so for indeed i never understood him although i held him in a great liking and esteem and considered him to have confronted more adversity and mischance than commonly falls to any one i never understood him he was compacted of so many contradictions and in all of them was so seemingly sincere that a plain man like lawrence clavering was completely at a loss to discover the inward truth of him but as he was a riddle to my speculations so was he a cherished object to my affections for even during those last years of queen annes rule when his life was at its busiest and his fortunes at their climax he still found time to show kindness to one whose insignificance was only rivalled by his poverty he was harry st john to me as to his equals and my betters and in spite of the difference of our years and when i found myself in company with dr swift and mr congreve and mr prior and the little crookback poet whose windsor castle had brought him into a sudden reputation he was ever at pains to distinguish me in his conversation so that i might suffer no shame from my inferiority doubtless it was to the natural courtesy of the man rather than to any special inclination that his behaviour was due but i was none the less grateful to him on that account he had just finished dinner and was still at the table over his wine when his footman introduced me into his apartment ah said he i expected you would come and he drew a chair to the table and filled a second glass it is not the welcome you have had from me at bucklersbury but philosophers and he made a polite flourish of the hand to include me in the phrase will ever be content with a makeshift for my part he continued i do not know but what the makeshift is the better a few trustworthy friends a few honest books and leisure wherein to savour their merits it is what i have chiefly longed for these last five years and he threw up his arms with a long breath of relief as though he had been unexpectedly lightened of some burdensome load i had heard him talk often enough in this way before and was disinclined to set great value upon his contentment what brought you in this scurry to paris i asked they meant to pursue me to the scaffold he returned i had sure information of that no testimony would have helped me or thwarted them it was my blood they needed marlborough told me so my blood and oxfords and he flashed out into a sudden passion theres the point alone i would have faced them these whimsical tories are the frailest of reeds the whigs the most factious and vindictive opponents still i would have faced them had i stood alone but to make common cause with oxford no i abhor him to that degree i cannot it were worse than death however lets talk no more of it and he recovered himself with an effort and sat for a little silent fingering his glass oxford he exclaimed again with a bitter laugh of contempt soft words and never a thing done to live till tomorrow was the ultimate of policy to him and jealous too the bubble of his own jealousy had he cared to act or had he been dismissed but a few weeks earlier i tell you lawrence the tories would now be cemented to such a solidity of power that he stopped abruptly and leaned over to me for whom are you he asked the hanoverian or the and he paused for the briefest space the chevalier de st george i am for king james the third i replied promptly oh says he and rising from his chair he took a turn across the room i rather fancied he resumed with a queer smile that discretion was amongst the lessons taught at the jesuit colleges we are taught besides i answered to distinguish between the occasion for discretion and the occasion for plain speaking then said he i fear me lawrence the teaching is faulty if i am to judge from the instance you have given me i had some talk with my lord stair this morning and the talk was of the friendliest lord stair i cried rising in some confusion for i knew the chevalier to possess no more redoubtable opponent than the english ambassador yes replied bolingbroke and i leave paris for the dauphin mark that lawrence not for lorraine though i have been invited thither but in truth i have had my surfeit of politics even while he spoke however a servingman was ushered into the room with a letter to deliver i was bidden my lord to give it into your hands he explained very well replied lord bolingbroke something hastily and i noticed that he dropped his hand over the superscription of the letter i will send the answer and he added correcting himself if one be needed the servant bowed and went out of the room i began to laugh and bolingbroke turned an inquiring glance at me there is some jest it is of your making my lord i fancy those few honest books will not be opened yet awhile he flushed a little i dont understand he said that is because you cover so closely the handwriting of your letter that you have not as yet perceived from whom it comes that is very true he replied immediately and he glanced at the cover of it the hand is strange to me perchance you recognize it and he frankly held it out to me no i replied but i recognized the servant who brought it marshall berwick has sent him more than once with messages to the rector of my college oh said he with a start of surprise marshall berwick the chevaliers minister he opened the letter with a fine show of indifference i think i mentioned to you that i had already been invited by the chevalier to bar doubtless this is to second the invitation he read it through carelessly and tore it up yes but i travel south not east lawrence i go to dauphine not lorraine and as if to dismiss the subject he diverted his speech from the chevalier to myself and so lawrence he said it is to be the soutane and not the redcoat the rosary and not the sword it seemed to me that there was a hint of wonder and disappointment in his voice but maybe i was overready at that time to detect a slight and i answered quickly i have to thank you for the cornetcy the offer was apiece with the rest of your kindness but i was constrained to refuse it and what constrained you your devotion to the priesthood he glanced at me shrewdly as he spoke and i knew that my face was hot beneath his gaze then he laughed the laugh was kindly enough but it bantered me and if my face was hot before now it was aflame you come of an obstinate stock lawrence he continued but i was misled to believe that you had missed the inheritance it was out of my power to accept the cornetcy i returned even had i wished it for i am a papist you would not have found yourself alone he said with a laugh the duke of ormond prefers papists for his officers he showed me a list not so long ago of twentyseven colonels whom he had a mind to break and strangely enough they were all protestants with never a fault besides to their names moreover i went on i was too poor and there i think i hit the true and chief reason though i would not acknowledge it as such even to myself but you have an uncle in cumberland said bolingbroke he is a whig and a protestant i replied he can hardly hold me in that esteem which would give me warrant to approach him my kinsman nodded his head as though he approved the argument and sat for a little silent over his wine while my fancies went straying over imagined battlefields it is strange how a man will glorify this business of cutting throats the more particularly if he be of a sedentary life most like it is for that very reason i have seen something of a wars realities since then i have seen men turned to beasts by hunger and thirst and the lust of carnage i have seen the dead stripped and naked upon the hillside of clifton moor white like a flock of sheep but at the time of which i write i thought only of a battlefield as of a place where life throbbed at its fullest to a sound of resonant trumpets and victorious shouts and the smoke of cannon hid the trampled victims even from my imaginings come said lord bolingbroke breaking in upon my reflections of a sudden if your afternoon is not disposed of i would gladly take a turn with you i have it in my mind to show you a picture i agreed willingly enough to the proposal and together we went down into the street this will be our way he said and we walked to the monastery of the chartreux then he stopped perhaps you know the picture no i replied this is the first time that ever i came hither he took me forthwith to the wonderful frescoes of le soeur and walking quickly along them stopped at length before the most horrid and ghastly picture that ever i set my eyes on it was the picture of a dead man who spoke at his burial and painted with such cunning suggestion and power that gazing at it i felt a veritable fear invade me it was not merely that his face expressed all the horror the impotent rage the pain of his damnation but there was also conveyed by the subtlest skill a certain consciousness in the sufferer that he received no more than his merits it was as though you looked at a hypocrite who knew that his hypocrisy was discovered well what think you of it asked my companion it does credit to the painters craftsmanship and his voice startled me for in my contemplation of the picture i had clean forgotten his presence the painting was indeed so vivid that it had raised up alert and active within my breast a thought which i had up till now though not without effort kept resolutely aloof from me but yet more to his imagination i replied perfunctorily and moved away lord bolingbroke followed me and we quitted the monastery and walked for some way in silence i had no mind for talk and doubtless showed my disinclination for my companion though now and again he would glance at me with an air of curiosity refrained from questions to speak the truth i was fulfilled nay i overbrimmed with shame the picture lived before my eyes receding in front of me through the streets of paris it seemed to complete and illustrate the rebuke which the rector had addressed to me that morning it pointed a scornful commentary at my musings on the glory of arms for the figure in the picture cried hypocrite and cried the word at me and so insistently did the recollection of it besiege me that i came near to thinking it no finished painting limned upon the wall and fixed so until such time as the colours should fade but rather a living scene i began almost to expect that the figures would change their order and disposition that the dead man speaking would swerve from his attitude and as he spoke and spoke hypocrite would reach out a bony and menacing finger towards me so far had my fancies carried me when my kinsman touched me on the arm it is as you say lawrence he said as though there had been no interval of silence since my last words it is the imagination not the craftsmanship which fixes the attention it is the idea of a dead man speaking no matter what he speaks there was a certain significance in his tone which i did not comprehend i stopped in the street you were anxious to show me the picture i said yes he replied why does it tell you nothing concerning yourself i was positively startled by the question it seemed incredible that he could have foreseen the effect which it would produce on me what do you mean i exclaimed he gave an easy laugh and pointed across my shoulder there is a church said he and moult and moult people entering it let us go in too i looked at him in increased surprise for i had not believed him very prone to religious exercises however he crossed the road with me at his heels and went up the steps in the throng the church was dim and because i came into it out of the april sunshine it struck upon my senses as dank besides the voices of the choir beat upwards through an air blue and heavy with incense the tapers burning on the altar at the far end of the nave over against us shone blurred and vague as though down some misty tunnel and from the painted windows on the right the sunshine streamed in slanting rods of light varicoloured disparting the mist at the first i had an impious thought due partly may be to my unfamiliarity with the bustle of the streets and partly no doubt to the companionship of my kinsman who ever brought with him as it were a breath of that wide world wherein he lived and schemed that i was returning to a narrow hemisphere wherein men had no manner of business but after a little a carmelite monk began to preach and the fire of his discourse as it rose and fell now harsh with passion now musical with tenderness roused me to a consciousness of the holy ground on which i stood i bent forward not so much listening as watching those who listened i noted how the sermon gained upon them how their faces grew expectant even lord bolingbroke lost his indifference he moved a step or two nearer to the preacher his attitude lost the lazy grace he was wont to affect he stood satisfied and i knew that there was no man on earth so critical in his judgment of an orator i was assured then of the sway which the monk asserted over his congregation and the assurance pierced to my very soul for i knew the cause of his power one had not to listen long to realise that the man was sincere this was no pleasurable discourse waved delicately like a scented handkerchief to tease the senses of his auditors sincerity burnt like a clear flame kindling his words and compelled belief of the matter of his sermon i took no note once or twice the eve of st bartholomew came thundering at my ears but for the most part it seemed that he cried hypocrite at me until i feared that the congregation would rise in their seats in that dim church and a mob of white faces gibber and mow the accusation i stood fascinated unable to move until at last bolingbroke came back to me and taking my arm led me out of church you study late of nights he asked looking into my face the preacher wrought on me he has eloquence he agreed but it was a dead man speaking i stopped in the street and stared at him yes he continued he warns he exhorts like the figure in the picture there but the man himself what of him lawrence he is the mere instrument of his eloquence its servant not its master he is the priest dead to the world in which he has his being a shadow with a voice a dead man speaking nay i broke in the words were born at his heart he was sincere and therefore he lives the dead man speaking is the hypocrite i cried the words in a very passion of selfreproach and without thought of the man i addressed them to well well said he indulgently he has at all events a live advocate i did not gather you were so devoted to the vocation and he laughed a little to belie the words and so we parted company it was in no complacent mood as you may guess that i returned to the college and indeed i loitered some while before the gates or ever i could make up my mind to enter them the picture weighed upon my conscience and seemed like to effect my lord bolingbrokes evident purpose though by means of a very different argument it was not the priest but myself the hypocrite who was the dead man speaking and thus strangely enough as i had reason to think it afterwards i came to imagine the picture with myself as its central figure i would see it at nights as i lay awake in my bed painted with fire upon the dark spaces of the room and the face that bore the shame of hypocrisy discovered and with that shame the agony of punishment was mine or again a word of reproof the mere sight of my marco polo was sufficient to bring it into view and for the rest of that day it would bear me company hanging before my eyes when i sat down to my books and moving in front of me when i walked as it had moved in front of me through the streets of paris on that first and only occasion of my seeing it for though many a time i passed and repassed the monastery of the chartreux i never sought admittance i saw the picture no more than once but indeed i was in no danger of forgetting it and within the compass of a few months events befell me which fixed it for ever in my memory i have but to shut my eyes and i see it after this long interspace of years definite in every detail i have but to open them and sitting at this table at which i write i behold actually painted the second picture into which my imagination then transformed the first the picture of myself as the dead man speaking chapter iii my kinsman and i ride different ways two days later being deputed upon some errand the import of which i have forgotten i chanced topass by the barrier of the rue de grenelle and a travellingcarriage drew up at my side my eyes were bent upon the ground so that i took no heed of it until i heard my name cried i looked up and there was my lord bolingbroke at the window you see lawrence he said i leave paris as i promised stair and i travel into dauphin but by a roundabout road i answered eagerly it is possible that you might take st germains on the way for it had reached my ears that queen mary of modena was desirous to try her persuasions upon him no he returned with a shake of the head i have my poor friends in england to consider i should provide a fine excuse for illusing them if i made common cause with the chevalier they have served me it is my turn to serve them and i shall be better employed that way than in weaving fairystories with queen abdicate but whats the trouble he continued with a change of tone you walked as though the world had withered at your feet nay i answered with a laugh there is no trouble i was merely wondering and i hesitated at what he asked curiously at the rule which bids me sleep with my chamberwindow closed i returned with a laugh and indeed it was a question you had reason to put during this hot spring when from behind your stifling panes you looked out at night across paris lying cool and spacious beneath a purple sky but the truth is that all these regulations which were instituted to discipline the novice to a habit of obedience were beginning to work me into a ferment of irritability and through the months that followed april may and june the irritability increased in me to a spirit of rebellion at times i felt a mad desire to rise in my seat and hurl defiance and with that defiance my books at my tutors heads the desire surged up within my veins became active in every limb and i had to set my teeth until my jaws ached to repress it at times sick and dispirited i counted up the years to come i passed them through my thoughts even as i passed the beads of my rosary beneath my thumb and even as the beads of my rosary they were monotonously alike one to the other doubtless too the recollection of the picture i had seen at the monastery of the chartreux helped to intensify my unrest for it abode vividly in my memory and the menace i drew from it grew more and more urgent as the days slipped on i should note however that a certain change took place in the manner in which it presented itself i could still see i could still hear the figure speaking but it did not so much cry hypocrite as thunder out in the very lines of the carmelite preacher the eve of st bartholomew the eve of st bartholomew of course as the rector had declared i was under no vows or obligation to persist in my novitiate but i felt the very knowledge that i was free to be in some way a chain about my ankle constraining me i took a cast back to the period of my boyhood when enrolment amongst the priests of the jesuit order had been the aim of a fervid ambition when the thought of that body twenty thousand in number spread throughout the earth in japan in the indies in peru and working one and all in a consonant vigilance for the glory of their order had stirred me with its sublimity and i sought with what effort and despair to recreate those earlier visions for to count them fanciful seemed treachery to turn deliberately aside from them was evident instability so much i have deemed it necessary to set down concerning my perplexities at this time since they throw i think a light upon the events which i am to relate for i was shortly afterwards to depart from this safe corner and wander astray just as i wandered when i lost myself in the labyrinth of blackladies and the explanation i take to be this for it is merely in explanation and not at all in extenuation that i put this forward i had clean broken from the one principle by which however clumsily i had hitherto guided my life and had as yet grappled to no other with sufficient steadiness of faith to make it useful as a substitute it was on the saturday of the first week of july that i left the jesuit college i was standing at my window about two of the afternoon and looking down at the river and the bridge which crossed it i had a clear view of the bridge from end to end betwixt the gables of a house and i noticed that it was empty save for one man who jogged across on horseback or rather so it seemed at the height from which i looked for when i saw the horse close at hand a short while afterwards i found reason to believe that the man had galloped i stood watching him idly until he crossed out on to the quay and i remember that the refectory bell rang just as he turned the corner and passed out of my sight towards the end of dinner a message was brought to me that the rector desired to see me in his study as soon as we were risen from table this time however it was in no hesitancy or trepidation that i waited on him but rather with a springing heart for let him but dismiss me from the college and here was an end to all the torture of my questionings an unworthy thought you will say and indeed none knew that more surely than myself on the contrary however the rector received me with a benevolent eye i have strange news for you my son said he with a glance towards a stranger who stood apart in the window and the stranger stepped forward hurriedly as though he would have the telling of the news himself he was a man of middle height and very closeknit though of no great bulk dark in complexion and possessed as far as i could judge of an honest countenance mr clavering he began with a certain deference and after these months of brother and my son the manner of his address struck upon my ears with a very pleasant sound i was steward to your uncle sir john rookley at blackladies in cumberland was said i until monday was sennight says he then what may be your business with me i asked sharply for there was throughout england such a division of allegiance as set even the members of a family on opposite sides the while they maintained to the world an appearance of concord so that many a dismissed servant carried away with him secret knowledge wherewith to make his profit i was therefore pretty sharp with the steward and quickly repeated the question then what may you have to ask of me that you will be pleased to continue me in the office he returned humbly i stood cluttered out of my senses looking from the servant to the rector and from the rector again to the servant with i know not what wild fancies choking at my throat it is true said the rector your uncle died of an apoplexy a fortnight back but he has a son i gasped out sir john quarrelled with mr jervas two days before he died answered the steward blackladies comes to you mr clavering and i have travelled from cumberland to acquaint you of the fact it was true my heart so throbbed and beat that i could not utter a word i could not so much as think no not even of my uncle or my cousin it is true that i had seldom seen the one and never the other i was conscious only of an enlarging world but my eyes chanced at the moment to meet the rectors his gaze was fixed intently upon my face and with a sudden feeling of shame i dropped my eyes to the ground my son he said drawing me a little on one side and speaking with all kindliness as though in answer to my unspoken apology it may be well that you can do better service as the master of blackladies you will have the power and the means to help effectually and such help we need in england and as i still continued silent if you become a priest by the laws of your country you lose that power and surely the church will share in the loss and are you fitted for a priest he looked at me keenly i spoke my doubts to you some while back and i do not think they went much astray i did not answer him nor did he wait for an answer but took me by the arm and led me back to the steward my cousin quarrelled with his father then what has become of him i asked still in an indecision i do not know sir most like he is in france in france i cried with a start for the answer flashed a suspicion into my mind which prove it true and it was out of my power to accept the inheritance in france and the substance of the quarrel it is not for me sir to meddle in the right or wrong of it he began nor did i ask you to i cut him short i ask you for the bare fact he looked at me for a second like one calculating his chances mr jervas sided with the jacobites and the words struck my hopes dead my world dwindled and straitened as swiftly as it had enlarged then i can hardly supplant him i said slowly for i side with that party too the stewards eyes gleamed very brightly of a sudden ah said i you too have the cause at heart so much sir that i make bold to forget my station and to urge you to accept the bequest there is no supplanting in the case for if you refuse blackladies it will not fall to mr jervas he drew from his pocket a roll of paper fastened with a great seal and held it out to me i broke the seal and opened it it contained a letter from sir johns attorney at appleby and a copy of the will which set out very clearly that i was to possess the house and lands of blackladies with all farms properties and rents attached thereto upon the one condition that i should not knowingly divert so much as the value of a farthing into the pockets of mr jervas rookley so far i had read when i looked up at the steward in a sudden perplexity i do not understand why sir john should disinherit his son who is at all events a protestant because he is a jacobite in favour of myself who am no less a jacobite and one of the true faith besides the steward made a little uneasy movement of impatience i was not so deep in my masters confidence that i can answer that i held out the will to him though my fingers clung to it i cannot i said take up the inheritance it was not however the steward but the rector who took the paper from me he read it through with great deliberation and then you did not finish he said and pointed his finger to the last clause i saw no use in reading more father i replied but i took the will again and glanced at the clause it was to this effect that if i failed to observe the one condition or did not enter into possession from whatsoever cause the estate should become the property of the crown i cannot help it i said to swell the treasury of the hanoverian by however so little is the last thing i would wish to do but i cannot help it mr jervas rookley suffers in that he is what i pride myself on being i cannot benefit by his sufferings and i folded up the will there is another way sir suggested the steward diffidently another way i asked which would save the estate and save mr jervas too from this injustice explain i cried explain for indeed it grieved me beyond measure that i should pass these revenues to one whom i could not but consider an usurper i do but propose it sir because i see you scruple to he began nay man i exclaimed starting forward i need no apologies show me this way of yours why sir the will says the crown it names no names if you infringe the condition or refuse the estate blackladies goes to the crown but and he smiled cunningly it is not likely that king james did he come to the throne would accept of a bequest which comes to him because the rightful owner served his cause so well i nodded my head that is true king james would restore it i said to the rightful owner said he so be it then i cried i will hold blackladies in trust for jervas rookley and then i stopped but meanwhile mr jervas rookley must shift for himself i added bethinking me of the condition the steward smiled again if you knew him sir you would not fear for him on that account and he continued you will return with me to england yes but not now i exclaimed for all at once a new resolve had taken shape within my mind there was no word in the will about my politics sir john was acquainted with them when he made the will i was free to use blackladies as i chose wait you here in paris i cried to the steward and came of a sudden to an awkward pause you brought money with you i asked i have an order upon mr waters the banker he replied good i said my spirits rising with my voice get it cashed now at once and bring the money back to me but be quick be quick for i have business in lorraine in lorraine exclaimed the steward and his face flashed to an excitement equal with my own in lorraine i repeated and at barleduc he waited for no further explanation but made his reverence to the rector a low bow to me and departed on his errand i began to pace impatiently about the room already looking for his return even as i heard him pass beneath the window was i not right my son asked the rector you walk you speak like a man refreshed and yet and yet he came over to me and laid a hand upon my shoulder while a great gravity overspread his face and somehow at the touch of his hand at the mere sight of his face my overweening confidence burst like a bubble for looking through my eyes he seemed to search my soul and in his eyes i seemed to see as in a mirror the naked truth of all the folly that he noted there these are the last words he went on which i shall speak to the pupil and i would have you bear them as the crest and motto of your life i would have you beware of a feverish zeal to each man i do solemnly believe there comes one hour of greatness and only one it is not the hour of supreme happiness or of a soaring fortune as worldlings choose to think but the hour when god tries him upon his touchstone and for that hour each man must watch if he would not fail indeed it brings the test which proves nay makes him man and in gods image too or leaves him lower than the brutes for he has failed therefore watch no man knoweth the hour of gods coming therefore watch but how shall he watch and his voice to my hearing had in it some element of prophecy how shall he watch who swings ever from elation to despair and knows no restingplace between them he spoke very quietly and so left me alone i do not know that i am inclined now to set great store upon the words they seem almost to present some such theory as children and men overoccupied with booklearning are wont to fondle but after he had left me alone i sat with his discourse overlaying me like an appalling shadow the sunlight in the court without lost its brightness the very room darkened within i saw my whole life before me a procession of innumerable hours hooded and cloaked they passed me with silent feet i sought to distinguish between them i chose at random from amongst them this i cried in a veritable fear this is the hour and even as i spoke one that had passed threw back the hood and turned on me a sorrowing face so would the hour come and so unready should i be to challenge it my fear swelled to a panic it bore me company all that day as i made my purchases in the streets as i took leave of my companions as i passed out of the porte st antoine it was with me too in the quiet evening long after the spires of paris had vanished behind me when i was riding with my steward at my back across that open country of windmills and poplar trees on the highroad to lorraine chapter iv and meet i cross to england and have a strange adventure on the way for the steward rode with me though i barely remarked his presence until we had ridden some ten miles then however i called him to my side i bade you wait at paris for my return i said and i reined in my horse he followed my example but with so evident a disappointment that i forgave him his disobedience on the instant you left no word sir as to the date of your return or where i should look for you he explained readily enough besides i added with a laugh i ride to barleduc is it not so and i allowed him to continue with me bethinking me at the same time that i might inform myself the sooner concerning blackladies and the politics of the county upon these points he gave me information which inclined me in his favour the northern counties as far south as derbyshire were so much tinder it needed but a spark to set them ablaze from one coast to the other i was ready to listen to as much talk of that kind as he could pour into my ears and indeed he did not stint me of it so that liking his story i began in a short while to like the man who told it and to hold myself lucky that i was possessed of a steward whose wishes so jumped with his service he had been born on the estate he told me some thirty years since and had been reared there though thanks to the kindness of his late master my uncle he had received a better schooling than his father before him he spoke indeed very correctly for a servant but with a broadish accent and a clipping of his thes as the natives of that district are used to do but for my part i never got the tang of it and so make no effort to reproduce it here he was called leonard ashlock in his company i journeyed then the fiftyeight leagues to barleduc where i seemed all at once to have come into my own country without the trouble of crossing over seas for as i rode through the narrow streets it was the english tongue that i heard spoken on every side though more often with a scotch or an irish accent but the one whom i came to seek i did not find the chevalier they told me had gone to commercy so to commercy we travelled eastwards after him for another eight leagues or so and arrived there towards the close of the afternoon on the next day we rode straight to the toison dor the chief inn of the town and while i was dismounting in the courtyard i noticed a carriage which was ranged all dirtied and muddy against an angle of the wall i stepped over and examined it there was a crest upon the panels i turned to the ostler when did the carriage come this morning and monsieur he is within i think i ran up the steps into the house and fell plump against a girl who was carrying some glasses and a jug upon a tray she gave a little scream the tray struck me on the chest there was jingle of broken glass and a jugful of claret was streaming down my breeches and soaking about my knees monsieur is in i asked stupid she said with a stamp of the foot monsieur is in i asked again booby says she and caught me a swinging box on the ears i beg your pardon said i and i ran up the stairs a footman stood beside the door on the landing and i knew the man ah said i he is here the footman advanced a step towards me my lord is busy he will see me i have the strictest orders sir i pushed past the fellow and hammered at the door it was thrown open from the inside and lord bolingbroke stood anxiously in the door good morning said i airily it is a roundabout journey this of yours to dauphin and while he stared and frowned at me i stepped past him into the room in the window opposite there stood a man with his back towards me a man of a slender and graceful figure plainly dressed in a suit of black velvet he turned hastily as i stumbled across the threshold and in a twinkling i knew what i had done there was no mistaking the long melancholic features the gentle aspect of longsuffering his race was figured in the mould of his lineaments and the sad history of his race was written in his eyes i dropped upon my knees your majesty i stammered out and again your majesty he took a step eagerly towards me i felt the claret trickling down my legs you bring pressing news he exclaimed and then he checked himself and his voice dropped to despondency but it will be bad news not a doubt of that tis always bad news that comes in such hurry and he turned to bolingbroke with the saddest laugh bad news my lord ill warrant nay your majesty i answered i bring no news at all and i glanced helplessly at bolingbroke who having closed the door now stood on one side midway between king james and myself how i envied him his easy bearing and envying him thus i became the more confused it is a kinsman of mine he said in some perplexity mr lawrence clavering and a devoted servant of your majesty a kinsman of yours said the king affably that makes him doubly welcome and then the most ridiculous thing occurred though i perceived nothing of its humour at the time for of a sudden the king gave a start he is wounded my lord he cries he shall have my surgeon to attend to him tell edgar he is below bid him hurry and he came a little nearer towards me as though with his own hands he would help me to rise you were hurt on your journey hither how long how long must blood be the price of loyalty to me and mine the poignant sadness of his voice redoubled my confusion quick cried the king the poor lad will swoon and indeed i was very near to swooning but it was from sheer humiliation i glanced about me wishing the floor would open but it was the door that opened and lord bolingbroke opened it i jumped to my feet to stop him your majesty i exclaimed it is no wound i would to my soul that it were no wound said the king drawing back and bending his brows at me in a frown what is it then lawrence asked bolingbroke as he closed the door i looked down at my white buckskin breeches with the red patches spreading over them it is said i a jugful of claret no one spoke for a little and i noticed the kings face grew yet sterner and more cold he was in fact like so many men of a reserved disposition very sensitive to the least hint of ridicule upon all occasions and particularly so when he had been betrayed into the expression of any feeling your majesty i faltered out ruefully the rector of the jesuit college in paris warned me before i set out of the dangers which spring from overmuch zeal and this is the second proof of his wisdom that i have had today for now i have offended your majesty by stumbling impertinently into your presence and before the maid boxed my ears in the passage for upsetting her claret the speech was lucky enough to win my pardon for bolingbroke began to laugh and in a moment or two the kings face relaxed and he joined in with him but we have yet to know said he the reason of your haste i explained how that having come into an inheritance i had ridden off to barleduc to put it at his disposal and from barleduc to commercy and how on the sight of lord bolingbrokes carriage in the courtyard i had rushed into his presence without a thought that he might be closeted with the king i noticed that at the mention of blackladies the king and bolingbroke exchanged a glance but neither interrupted me in my explanation you give me at all events a proof of your devotion to your kinsman said the king and i am fain to take that as a guarantee that you are no less devoted to myself nay interposed lord bolingbroke your majesty credits me with what belongs to yourself for i doubt if lawrence would have shown such eagerness for my company had he found me in the dauphin instead of in lorraine the king nodded abstractedly and sat him down at the table which was littered over with papers and finally seized upon a couple of letters which he read through comparing them one with the other you can give me then information concerning cumberland he said changing to a tone sharp and precise and he proceeded to put to me a question or two concerning the numbers of his adherents and the strength of their adhesion your majesty i replied my news is all hearsay for this inheritance has come to me unexpected and unsought the last year i have lived in paris he drummed with his fingers upon the table like one disappointed you know nothing then of the county i have never so much as set foot in it i was born in shropshire then your majesty lord bolingbroke interrupted neither is he known there there is an advantage in that which counterbalances his lack of information the king raised his eyes to my face and looked at me doubtfully with a pinching of the lips he is young for the business he said and one may perhaps think he smiled as he added the word precipitate my hopes which had risen with a bound at the hint that some special service might be required of me sank like a pebble in a pool i cudgelled my brains for some excuse my recollections for some achievement however slight which might outweigh my indiscretion but i had not a single deed to my name and what excuse could acquit me of a hotheaded thoughtlessness i remained perforce silent and abashed and it was in every way fortunate that i did for my lord bolingbroke tactfully put forward the one argument that could serve my turn said he quite simply his grandfather fell at naseby his father in the siege of deny and with those two lives twice were the fortunes of the family lost the king rose from his table and came over to me he laid a hand upon my shoulder and so your father died for mine he said and there was something new something more personal in the kindliness of his accent as though my fathers death raised me from a unit in the aggregate of his servants into the station of a friend and your grandfather for my grandfather your majesty sees that it is a privilege which i inherit i replied from the tail of my eye i saw my kinsman smiling appreciation of the reply lawrence has the makings of a courtier your majesty said he with a laugh nay i interrupted hotly this is honest truth let the king prove me it was the king who laughed now and he patted my shoulder with a quite paternal air though in truth he was not so many years older than myself well he said why not he is a hawk of the right nest why not and he turned him again to bolingbroke as you say he is not known in cumberland and there is besides a very natural reason for his presence in the county he stood looking me over for a second and then went back abruptly to his papers on the table but i would you could give me reliable news as to those parts news i can give your majesty i answered though whether it is reliable or not i cannot take it upon oath to say but the man who passed it to me was the steward of blackladies and he spoke in that spirit wherein i would have all men speak and i told him all that ashlock had recounted to me oh said the king when i had ended and he made the suggestion eagerly to bolingbroke perhaps it were best then that i should land upon the coast of cumberland in england what say you i saw bolingbrokes eyebrows lift ever so slightly i thought he answered with the merest touch of irony in his tone that your majesty had determined some half an hour since to land at montrose i know said the king with something of petulance but these later advices may prove our best guide but are they true said bolingbroke spreading out his hands they tally with the report of mr rookley said the king i started at the mention of the name and the king remarked the movement he looked towards me then again at the letter in his hand which was written in a round and clumsy character i caught sight of a word in that letter and i remembered it afterwards because it chanced to be misspelt oh said he mr jervas rookley signs himself of blackladies i fancied that the name was familiar to me when first you uttered it i repeated all that ashlock had related to me concerning the man and how i was to hold his estate in trust for him until the king came to his throne we will see to it said he that mr clavering shall not be the loser i felt the blood rush into my face it was with no thought of that kind that i spoke i declared earnestly i pray your majesty to believe me but lord bolingbroke broke in upon my protestations this steward is with you at commercy then if it please your majesty i would advise that we see the man here and question him closely face to face for mr jervas rookley and he filled the gap of words with a shrug of significance you distrust him asked the king yet it appears his loyalty has cost him an estate it is that perplexes me for i know these country gentlemen and his voice sharpened to the bitterest sneer at night over their cups they are all for king james then they consult their pillows and in the sober morning they are all for king george oh i know them a sore head makes a world of difference in their politics the words seemed to me hot and quick with all the memories of his defeated labours during those last six years of queen annes reign and i fancied the king himself was inclined to discount their value on that account yet he urged these letters speak in no uncertain terms they speak only of a disposition towards your majesty rejoined his minister it is a very tender delicate and unsatisfactory thing a disposition what we would have is their resolve are they resolved to drive on with vigour if matters tend to a revolution will they support the revolution with advantage if it spins out to a war it is on these points your majesty needs to be informed and it is on these points they keep so discreet a silence we ask them for their plan as marshall berwick asked them time out of mind and we get the same answer that he received how many troops will his most christian majesty land how many stands of arms how many thousand crowns not one word of a definite design not one word of a precise statement of their resources he walked about the room as he spoke with every mark of discouragement in his gestures and expression while the king listened to him in an uneasy impatience as though he was rather irritated than impressed by bolingbrokes doubts very well said the king tapping his foot on the floor we will examine mr claverings steward and he bade me go and fetch ashlock into the room but search as i might nowhere could i find a trace of him he had stayed no more than five minutes in the house the people of the inn informed me i hurried to the stables thinking perchance to find him there i questioned the ostlers the drawers even the wench who had boxed my ears no one had knowledge of his whereabouts and since it would be an idle business to go hunting for him through the unfamiliar streets of commercy i left a sharp word that he should come up the moment he returned and so got me back chapfallen to lord bolingbrokes apartment the kings secretary mr edgar was now in the room gathering together the papers which overspread the table it is no great matter said the king when i explained how that i had failed in my search for i doubt me that i could have heard him out besides mr clavering i have had some talk concerning you with your kinsman here and since your inheritance and your journey hither fit so aptly with our needs it were a pity to miss the occasion your majesty i cried and i felt my heart swell and leap within me and my head spin with exultation here was the very thing of which i had dreamed hopelessly so often during those weary months at paris letting my fancies dally with it as with some bright and charming fairy tale and lo it had come true it had come true the words made a silent music at my heart and animated all my blood it had come true and then of a sudden there shot through me chilling me to the centre the rectors warning and the forebodings that had flowed from it did this mission which the king assigned to me harbinger the hour of trial should i fail when it came i set my teeth and clenched the nails into the palms of my hands my whole body cried no no but underneath i seemed to hear a voice very low very persistent speaking with full knowledge and it said yes yes then this will be your charge continued the king recalling me to myself you will journey with all speed to london and bear with you a letter in my hand to the duke of ormond at richmond and he paused upon the words it must pass from your hand into the dukes you will then go north to your estate and collect knowledge for our use as to what help we may expect from cumberland and so far as you can gather from the counties adjoining lord bolingbroke will inform you more of the particulars your errand of course you will keep secret locked up from all from our supporters no less than from our opponents it would be of detriment to us if they came to think that we distrusted them nor do we it is their judgment not their loyalty about which we wish to be assured we think therefore that it would be prudent in you to make no parade of your convictions hear both sides like one that holds the balance evenly for if you take one side openly you will hear from our friends just what we hear so far away as barleduc and so god speed you and he held out his hand to me and i kissed it then mr edgar opened the door and the king walked to it he was already across the threshold when he stopped and turned back pulling a silver medal from his fob this said he is the facsimile of that medal which the duchess of gordon presented to the faculty of advocates in edinburgh seven years back and he gave it into my hand it may serve to keep me in your heart and memories moreover a day may come when it will be necessary for you to convince our friends in the north on whose side you stand and this will help you to the end for there is no other copy i knelt down and kissed the medal reverently on the one side was struck the head of king james very true and lifelike with the words cujus est on the other a picture of the british islands with this motto inscribed beneath it reddite it is a text i said and indistinctly enough for that simple word reddite so charged was it with a sad and pitiful significance brought the tears welling to my throat it is a text i would have every man in england preach from you will act on it said the king and i flattered myself with the thought that i noted something of a veritable tenderness in his accent you will act on it that is better and so he went out of the room lord bolingbroke closed the door flung himself into a chair and yawned prodigiously lawrence he said i am very thirsty a bottle of rhenish wine was standing on a sideboard at one end of the room he went over and opened it and filled two glasses let us drink said he and handed one to me let us drink to ourselves and he raised the glass to his lips nay i cried to the king first very well to the king first if you will and to ourselves next what matters the toast so long as we drink it and he drained his glass to the bottom i followed his example now to ourselves said he and he filled them again it is a good fashion he continued in a musing tone that of drinking to the king for so one drinks double and never a word can be said against it i noticed however that he drank triple and quadruple before he had come to an end then he looked at my breeches and laughed and so the wench boxed your ears he said and becoming quite serious he took me by the arm lawrence lets drink to her i should reel in my saddle if i did said i drawing back then dont sit in it he replied lets drink to her several times and then well go to bed i trust to go to bed a good twenty miles from commercy he shook his head at me lawrence it is plain that you are new to the service of kings you have a letter for me said i to the duke of ormond and he looked at me in surprise you mean to start tonight yes very well and he sat himself down to the table transformed in a second to a cool man of business the letter is in the chevaliers hand he drew it from his pocket as he spoke and there are many ships in the channel you had best charter a boat at dunkirk the smaller the better and set sail at nightfall so that you may strike the downs before sunrise thereupon he proceeded to instruct me as to the precise details concerning which i was to inform myself in cumberland such as the number of troops they could put into the field and how competent they were to face welldrilled and disciplined squadrons their weapons the least assistance from france they would hazard the rising upon and suchlike matters then he rose and prepared to accompany me downstairs i was still holding the medal in my hand and now and again fingering it as a man will what he holds most precious and lawrence he said i would hide the medal even from yourself if that be possible you may find it a very dangerous gift before you have done he spoke with so solemn a warning as even then did something to sober my enthusiasm it was a wise word that the chevalier spoke when he bade you beware how you sided openly with the jacks oh said i as the thought struck me it was you then that prompted that advice and for my sake not altogether but in the main for my sake lawrence said he leaning across the table with his eyes fixed upon my face and his voice lowered to a whisper i misdoubt me but this is a fools business were embarked upon you heard the chevalier he has no fixed design and he brought his hand down upon the table with a dunch one day he will land at montrose the next in devonshire the next in cumberland and god knows but the most likely place of all is the tower steps no i cried ill not believe that he has you to help him now bolingbroke smiled but shook his head he has six other ministers besides myself with fanny oglethorpe and olive trant at the head and all of them have more power than i he will concert a plan with me and the hour after give a contrary order behind my back it was the same when berwick had the disposing of his affairs no lawrence i would have you be prudent very prudent he came down the stairs with me and stood in the courtyard repeating ever the same advice the while i mounted my horse of my steward i still could see no sign and leaving another direction that he should follow with all speed i rode off towards the village of isoncour where ashlock caught me up some two hours after i came there i rated him pretty soundly being much contraried by the melancholy forebodings of lord bolingbroke ashlock made his excuses however very submissively saying that he had dined at an ordinary in the town and thereafter being much fatigued with the hurry of our travelling had fallen fast asleep and i bethinking me that in spite of his gloomy forecast lord bolingbroke would none the less serve the king with unremitting vigour began to take heart again and so pardoned leonard ashlock we came then to dunkirk in the space of four days and i was much put to it how i should get safely over into england with the kings letter for the english warships were ever on the watch for the kings emissaries and one of them a sloop was riding not so far out in full view of dunkirk in this difficulty ashlock was of the greatest service to me discovering qualities which i should never have suspicioned in him for espying a little pinnace drawn up on the beach he said the two of us could sail that across sir no doubt said i if one of us could steer a course and the other handle the sails i can do the first sir by myself and the second with your help he replied i went down the sands to the boat and discovering to whom it belonged from a bystander sought the owner out and forthwith bought it at his own price for thus we need confide our business to no one but waiting quietly till nightfall we might slip past the big ship under cover of the dark and this we did launching the boat and bending the sails by the light of a lantern which we kept as nearly as we could ever turned towards the land the moon was in its fourth quarter and not yet risen when we started so that the night though not so black as we could wish was still dark enough for our purpose we had besides the lights from the portholes of the warship to guide us which gleamed pure and bright across the water like a triple row of candles upon an altar we ran cautiously therefore for some distance to the west close under the shadow of the coast and then fetching a wide compass about the ship set our course straight for england it was a light boat we were in rigged with a lugsail and a jib and we slipped along under a fine reaching wind that heeled us over till the thwart was but an inch from the froth of the water if only the wind hold said ashlock with a glance at the sail and there was a lively ring of exultation in his voice and indeed it was an inspiriting business this flight of ours across the channel or at all events this part of it i lay forward in the bows with a great coat atop of me and my face upturned to the spacious skies which were strewn with a golddust of stars and jewelled with the planets the wind blew out of the night sharp and clean the waves bubbled and tinkled against the planks as the prow split them into a white fire and we sped across that broad floor of the sea as if licensed to an illimitable course now and again the lights of a ship would rise to the right or left glimmer for a little like an ocean willothewisp and vanish now and again we would drive past a little fleet of fishingsmacks lying to for the night with never so much as a candle alight amongst them all and only the stars as it were entangled amongst their bare poles and rigging and after a little the moon rose i thought of my crib in the rue st antoine and the months of confinement there as of something intolerable the wide freedom of the sea became an image of the life i was entering upon i felt the brine like a leaven in my blood and then of a sudden the sail flapped above me like the wing of a great bat the strenuous motion of the pinnace ceased and we were floating idly upon an even keel i looked towards ashlock he sat motionless in the stern with the tiller in his hand and the moonlight white upon his face then he took a turn about the tiller with a rope glanced along the boat with his body bent as though he was looking forward beneath the sail and came lightly stepping across the benches towards the bows i lay still and watched him in a lazy contentment midway betwixt bow and stern he stopped and busied himself with tightening a stay then again he crouched down and looked forwards but this time it seemed to me that he was not looking out beyond the bowsprit but rather into the bows to the spot where i lay huddled under my coat in the shadow of the thwart i could see his face quite plainly and it appeared to me to have changed in some way to have narrowed it may have been a fancy it may have been the moonlight upon his face but his eyes seemed to glisten at me from out a countenance suddenly made trivial by cunning after a second he crept forward again and i noticed how lightly how very lightly he stepped would he stop at the mast i asked myself was his business the tightening of a sheet even as he had tightened the stay he stooped beneath the sail and still crept forward running his hand along the top of the gunwale as he came and it broke upon me as something new that he and i were alone in midchannel cabined within the planks of a little boat he the servant but whose servant i not so much the master as the masters substitute and tripperup i felt for my sword but i remembered that i had loosed it from my belt when we had put to sea from the spot where i lay i could see the scabbard shining by the tiller at all events ashlock had not brought it with him i watched him without a movement as he approached but underneath the coat every nerve and muscle in my body was braced to the tightness of a cord he bent over me holding his breath it seemed his hands came forward hovering above my chest but they held no weapon his face sank out of the moonlight dropped beneath the gunwale lower and lower down upon mine meanwhile i watched him looking straight into his eyes his face was but a few inches from mine when he drew back with a little quivering cry it was indeed more of a startled indrawing of the breath than a cry and crouched on his hams by my side still i did not move and again his face came forward over mine very slowly very cautiously and down to where i lay in the dark with my eyes open watching his i could endure the suspense no longer what is it ashlock i asked quietly and in asking the question that moment made a very great mistake the importance whereof i did not discover until long afterwards ashlock sprang back as though i had struck him in the face i raised myself on one elbow and thrust the other outside the covering i could not tell sir whether you waked or slept he said and i thought his voice trembled a little i was awake ashlock what is it the wind has shifted sir and now he answered confidently enough and blows dead in our teeth we must needs tack if we are to reach the coast by daybreak well i cannot do it sir without your help it needs two to tack if you sail with a lugsail and that i found to be true for the sail being what is called a squaresail with a gaff along the top of it each time the pinnace went about it was necessary to lower it and hoist it again on the other side of the mast the which it fell to me to do while ashlock guided the tiller so that i knew there was good reason for his waking me however i had little time for speculation upon the matter one way or another since we sailed into a mist shortly afterwards and were on the stretch both eyes and ears lest we should be run down by some vessel or ever we could see it i was much exercised too what with the stars being hid and our constant going about whether ashlock would be able to keep the boat in a course towards england i need not however have troubled my head upon that score for it was as though he had some sixth sense which found its occasion upon the sea and when the day broke and the mist rolled down and massed itself upon the water we were within five miles of the white cliffs with dover castle upon our starboard bow the mist i should say was at that time about chin high for standing up in the boat we looked across a grey driving floor above which the smaller vessels only showed their masts shall i run her into the harbour asked ashlock and he turned the boats head towards land no i cried vehemently for now that we were come within sight of england the letter that i carried began to burn in my pocket and i felt the surest conviction that if we disembarked at dover we should be surrounded catechised and finally searched upon the ground of a telltale face which face would assuredly be mine no i said let us take advantage of the mist and creep along the coast till we find some inlet where we can beach the boat this we did and running now with a freer sail we came in little more than an hour to a cove some four or five miles to the northeast of dover the cliffs breaking off very sharp at each side with a line of thin rocks jutting out at the south corner and the walls of the cove steep all round and thickly wooded as low as we could see towards this cove we pointed intending to run in there and abandon the boat but when we were within half a mile of land the sun blazed out in the sky and the fog shredded like so much gauze burnt up in a fire it was a fortunate thing for us that we had come no nearer to the shore for there low down on the beach and but a yard or two from the waters edge on a tiny strip of level ground were four little cottages with the british ensign afloat ashlock rapped out an oath and thrust the tiller across to its further limit meaning to go about and run back out of sight of the cove the sail sir he cried in great excitement oh damn it sir the sail i sprang to the mast loosed the sheets lowered the sail and of course must needs in my hurry get the spar entangled amongst the stays a foot above the thwart ashlock rose in a passion and leaving the tiller to shift for itself came leaping towards me there there sir he sneered leave it to me and losing at once his air of deference he was for wresting rather than taking the spar out of my hands did ever man see he exclaimed o lord did ever man see such a foolmaster and such a clever servant said i finishing the sentence for him but the words were hardly out of my mouth when i let go of the spar he staggered back holding the one end of it in his hands the other caught me a crack in the joint at the knees and the next moment i was sprawling on my back at the bottom of the boat i heard ashlock mutter lord send us less pride and a haporth of common sense the while he busied himself with getting the sail into position and then he turned to me youll find sir the preventive men will make little difference between master and servant when they discover the pretty letter you are carrying the preventive men i cried scrambling to my feet ay sir the preventive men said he with a glance at the beach now ashlock was standing with his back to me bowsprit whereas i faced him and looking across his shoulder i saw a sheer face of white cliff topped with a thatch of grass glide as it were behind him i turned me about the boat was swinging round with the tide now that it had neither sail nor a hand at the rudder to direct it before it had been pointing for the beach midway in the cove now it was heading for the rocks at the south corner of the bay and each moment it moved faster as i could judge from the increasing noise of the ripple at the bows i jumped across the benches to the rudder hoist the sail i said in a low quick command ashlock looked from me to the rocks the tide is running round the corner like a millrace said he doubtfully and he made a movement as though he would take my place hoist the sail said i and he obeyed and again prepared to come astern no stay where you are i ordered sharply he looked at me sharply shrugged his shoulders and sat him down by the mast i brought the boats head up until the wind against which we had been tacking was directly astern of us and the tiller kicked in my hand as we drove through the water we were now within the line of rocks and i saw ashlock give a start as he noticed the point i was making you must round the corner of the reef sir he cried we have no time for that the tide runs in shore theres a gap in the reef well make for the gap the gap was in fact in a beeline with the tip of the bowsprit i had wind and tide to quicken my speed and i felt the boat leap and pulse beneath me like a live thing ashlock looked at me in surprise and then gave a little pleased laugh as though my action chimed in with his nature doubtless the plan was foolhardy enough but the day was clear and we were within full sight of the cottages upon the beach more our boat was the only boat in this secluded bay i thought indeed only of the latter point and not at all of the narrowness of the passage and maybe it was that very oblivion which kept my hand steady so engrossed was i in truth in my one idea that i could not forbear from glancing backwards now and then in a mortal dread lest i should see the sun flash upon the disc of a perspective glass or mark a boat splash out through the surf into the sea upon one such occasion i heard ashlock rise to his feet with a muttered god save us and a second later we grazed past a tooth of chalky rock some half a foot below the surface sit down i cried sharply for the fellow obscured my vision he dropped into his seat i bent forward peering out beneath the sail we were within twenty yards of the gap in the reef and the water converging on it from right and left foamless and oily like a rapid in the severn the boat gave a great spring and then slid with a swift easy motion like a sledge i heard the waves burst over the rocks and patter back upon the sea i felt the spray whipping my forehead and then the cliffs fell away from my eyes and closed up behind my back ashlock lowered the sail and dropped the kedge from the bows we were floating in still water just round the point and close in to shore under the shadow of an overhanging cliff now ashlock said i you can come astern he came reluctantly and in his coming began to babble an apology for the disrespect he had shown me i cut him short at the outset of it i am not concerned with your insolence i said it is too small a thing i am willing to believe moreover that you were hurried into it through devotion to a higher master than myself i have forgotten it but how came you to think that i carried a letter your hand sir he replied readily was ever at your pocket on the road if we galloped on the sea if we passed a ship it was truth that he said every word of it and it caused me no small humiliation for here was i entrusted with a mission of some consequence and i had betrayed a portion of my business at the outset there is another thing i continued sharply how comes it that you cumberlandborn and cumberlandbred have so much knowledge of the sea i looked at him steadily as i spoke and i saw his face change but not to any expression of suspicion or alarm rather it softened in a manner that surprised me a look tender and almost dreamy came into his eyes a regretful smile flickered on his lips it was as though the soul and spirit of a poet peeped out at you from a busy practical countenance i should have been a sailor he said in a low musing voice all my life i have longed for that one thing the very wind in the branches for me does no more than copy the moan of the surf but my parents would not have it so and i live inland restless unsatisfied like a man kept out of his own he checked himself hastily and continued in a flurry for no reason which i could comprehend still i made such use as i could of the opportunities that presented at whitehaven and at workington i learnt the handling of a boat but i interrupted him this is not the first time you have sailed from dunkirk to england no sir he answered and his face hardened at my questioning it was as though a lid had been slammed down upon an open box i have crossed more than once with young mr rookley that will do i said and he drew a breath of relief the explanation i assured myself was feasible enough but but i could not get from before my eyes the vision of him creeping stealthily from the tiller to the bows as he lay sleeping just where i had lain for all that day we remained hidden within the cliffs i saw him continually stoop beneath the sail i saw his face sink out of the moonlight down and down to mine and his hands hover above my breast and with that a light flashed in on me he knew of the letter i was carrying he knew of the pocket i carried it in i sat staring at him dumfounded was this the link was he playing me false if i had only closed my eyes i cried and in my perturbation i cried the words aloud ashlock woke up with a start what is it sir he asked in a whisper the preventive men and the eagerness of his voice gave the lie to my suspicion yes i reasoned he had shown an anxiety equal with my own to escape from their clutches was showing it now and his anxiety was due to this very knowledge that i had the letter in my possession i relapsed into perplexity and in a little my fears took another and engrossing shape doubtless it was ashlocks startled whisper set my thoughts particularly that way and from minute to minute i lay expecting the preventive men to row round the point and discover us there was no possible escape for us if they did the more i searched and searched the cliffs the more clearly i saw how impossible they were to scale it would i think have made the strain and tension of this waiting more tolerable had i been able to reach some point whence i could command a view of the bay though it would have served no other end but that too was denied to me i lay the livelong day the impatient hangeron of chance no sound came to me but the ceaseless lapping of the waves beneath me the ceaseless screaming of the gulls above my head in a single monotonous note sharp and clean like the noise that a large pebble makes hopping over ice to add to my discomfort we had no water in the boat nothing indeed but a few hard biscuits which served to choke us and the sun was pitiless all day in a shadowless sky the very colour of the sky seemed to have faded so that it curved over our heads rather grey than blue hot and hard a cap of steel however the day wore to sunset in the end and the preventive men had not come we set sail as soon as it was dark and coasting along landed shortly after two in the morning at a spot in the downs a few miles from deal thence after setting our pinnace adrift we made what haste we could to london ah me that ride through the night to london i remember it as if i had ridden along that road yesterday it was so long since i had been in england i remember the homely little inn at which we roused a grumbling landlord and hired our horses his very grumbles were music to my ears i laughed at them i remember with such enjoyment that we had much ado to persuade him to part with the horses at all and it was because of his grumbles that i paid him double what he asked i remember too the hedgerows aglimmer with wildroses as with so many pale stars to ride ever between hedgerows it seemed the ultimate of happiness and the larks in the early morning never since have i heard larks sing so sweetly as they sang that morning over the kentish meadows we passed a little whitewashed church i remember with its mossy gravestones nestling in deep grass about its walls well well this is avignon and my old bones i take it will sleep just as easily under avignon soil chapter v blackladies i wasted no long time in london you may be sure but leaving ashlock at the hercules pillars in piccadilly went down with my letter to richmond on my return i supplied myself with a wardrobe better suited to my present state and set out for the north the mansion of blackladies lies off borrowdale upon the flank of green comb i got my first view of it from the top of coldbarrow fell for on coming to grasmere ashlock had informed me of a bridlepath leading by harrop tarn and watendlath which would greatly shorten the journey and since my impatience had grown hotter with every mile we had traversed i despatched my baggage by the roundabout highroad through keswick and myself took horse in company with ashlock it was noonday when we came to the ridge of the fell and the valley lay beneath us shimmering in a blue haze very lonely and very quiet now and again the thin sharp cry of a peewit came to our ears now and again our voices waked a sleepy echo a little hamlet of white cottages stonethwaite they called it was clustered within view and towards the centre of borrowdale but so small was it and so still that it seemed not so much a living village as a group of huts upon some remote island which a captain putting in by chance for water may discover long since built by castaways long since perished look sir cried ashlock pointing downwards with his whip that is your house of blackladies it lay in the hollow at my feet fronting langstrath and endwise to me so that i only saw the face of it obliquely and got no very clear idea of that beyond that it was pierced with an infinity of windows for a score of mimic suns were ablaze in the panes it was a long house with many irregular gables built in three stories of grey stone though this i could hardly make sure of at the time for the purple bloom of a wisteria draped the walls close and clambered about the roof what attracted my eyes however far more than the house was the garden of which i had the plainest view since it was built up from the slope at the east end of blackladies and not so much on account of its beauty as because of the laborious care which had been bestowed upon it it was laid out in the artificial fashion of half a century ago with terraces and stone staircases and the lawns cut into quincunces and etoiles and i know not what geometrical figures the boxtrees too were fashioned into the likeness of animals here and there were statues i could see the spray of a fountain sparkling in the sun and on the level below the first terrace a great white grotto and an embroidered parterre like a fine ladys petticoat nature sprawls naked hereabouts only at this one point had it been trimmed and dressed and that with so quaint an extravagance as to make me conjecture whether i had not been suddenly translated within sight of some fairy pleasaunce of the arabian nights i sat in my saddle gazing at the house silently and bethinking me of what service it might prove in the enterprise on which i was embarked it is a handsome property sir said ashlock from just behind my elbow and he spoke in a tone of anxious inquiry as though he would fain discover what effect the glimpse of it had wrought in me with a handsome rentroll to match i asked no less eagerly as i looked downwards a shadow fell sharply along the neck of my horse i turned and saw ashlocks face stretched forward and peering into mine with startled eyes a very handsome rentroll sir he replied so handsome that a plain man finds it difficult to understand how the heir could sacrifice it for any cause he dropped the words very slowly one after the other i understood the fellows suspicion and i swung my horse round with a jerk so as to look him squarely between the eyes he drew himself straight on the instant and it seemed to me that his hand tightened insolently upon his whip ashlock i exclaimed before we go down to blackladies i will say a word to you in paris you showed me a way by which i could hold this estate fairly and honourably it was at your own wish sir that i spoke he interrupted hurriedly and because i saw that you meant to refuse it yes yes i went on but i thanked you then for the readiness of your wits and there was an end of your concern in the matter i hold blackladies in trust for this cousin of mine mr jervas rookley i have said so and i need no mentor at my elbow to remind me of a pledge i gave to myself least of all will i permit my servant and in my heat i threw an ungenerous scorn into the term to take that office on himself if he does his first word sends him packing the man bent his head so that i could no longer see his face and replied with all the confidence gone from his voice and manner i came to paris with no thought but of serving you as faithfully as i endeavoured to serve sir john before you but it was your reluctance that put the thought of mr jervas into my head and once it was there it stayed and grew for i loved mr jervas sir it was mr jervas i served in my heart and not sir john the fellow spoke with such evident contrition and a devotion so seemingly sincere that i felt reproved for the severity i had used and i began to admire what sort of man my cousin must be who could leave so clear an image of himself in the hearts of his dependents i was for saying something of the sort when a movement which ashlock made arrested me it was an insignificant movement just the reaching out of his hand to the snaffle of his bridle but it woke all my distrust of him for i noted the quick play of his long sinuous fingers and i recalled his stealthy advance from the tiller of the pinnace to the bows and the hovering of his hands above my chest get down from your horse i cried suddenly he looked in surprise at me as well he might i repeated the order he obeyed it are you catholic or protestant i asked ashlocks surprise increased catholic sir he answered good now understand this of the journey to barleduc of the passage from dunkirk you must never speak you must never think so much hangs on your silence and mine as you can have no notion of you came to paris and from paris i returned with you that is all you know of the rest whisper so much as a hint to the deafest yokel in the valley and it will go very ill with you i promise he answered but i need more than a promise i need an oath you are catholic you say so theres better chance of your keeping it down on your knees here and swear to me that not a word whatever you know whatever you believe shall escape your lips ashlock started back looking about him as though he would find some diversion or excuse but the blue sunlit sky was above us the brown fells about us and never a living soul beside us two come said i insisting swear it swear it by the cross swear it by the holy virgin i swear he began holding up his hand nay i broke in upon him on your knees on your knees again he looked about him and then to my face but i kept my eyes stubbornly upon him i would have him swear that oath and i gathered all my strength into the resolution that i might compel him for i felt in some strange way that we were pitted in a contest for the mastery of blackladies and i was minded to settle that contest before i set foot across its door i looked upon this oath that he would swear before me on his knees chiefly as an emblem of his submission i might be to him a vicarious master still his master i would be not having that confidence in him that i could allow him to harbour doubts upon the score of a sudden his horse gave a startled plunge and broke away from him it ran past me and leaning over as it passed i caught it by the bridle and so held it come said i there will be many days on which i can see the sunset from coldbarrow fell there was no escape for ashlock except by a direct refusal and that he did not venture so with a very ill grace he plumped down on his knees upon the heather and grumbled out his oath now said i we will ride down to blackladies and i descended the track mightily pleased with myself at the high way in which i had carried it but my elation was shortlived for so engaged was i in pluming myself that i took little care of how my horse set his feet and in a short while he slips on a stone shies of one side and i i was lying with all the breath knocked out of my body on the grass i picked myself up on to my knees i saw ashlock sitting on his horse in front of me and he held my horse by the bridle i remained on my knees for a moment recovering my breath and my wits then of a sudden i realised that here was i kneeling before ashlock as but a minute since he had knelt before me and here was ashlock sitting his horse and holding mine by the bridle precisely as i had sat and held his in a word we had just changed places by the purest accident no doubt but i had set such great store upon bringing about that earlier position and relationship that this complete reversal of it within the space of a few moments filled me with the keenest humiliation and mingled with that humiliation was a certain fear that ran through my veins chilling my blood i felt that the man mocked at me i looked into his face expecting to discover on it a supercilious smile but there was no trace of such a thing you are hurt sir he asked gravely and dismounted no said i rising to my feet ashlock moved a few steps from me and stooped down parting the grass with his hands what is it i asked setting a foot in the stirrup something sir that you dropped when you fell it is too big for a coin he was standing with his back to me turning that something over in his palms i clapped my hand into my fob it is mine yes i cried and i ran towards him give it to me at once and i made as though i would take it from him you asked me what it was said ashlock and he placed in my hands the medal the king had given me i looked it over carefully noticing certain scratches upon the kings face and seeking to rub them out i saw ashlock looking at me shrewdly i know said i in a fluster but it has memories for me and i would not lose it and with that we got again to our horses and so down to the blackladies the rest of that day i spent in examining the many corridors and galleries of the house and in particular the garden which had greatly whetted my curiosity it had been laid out ashlock informed me by sir john rookleys father and with a taste so fantastic as would have gladdened sir william temple himself there were three terraces linked to each other by three stone staircases one at each of the two ends and the third in the centre and at the top of each of these last flights were heavy iron gates from the bottom of these steps the parterre spread out and beyond the parterre was a space of meadowland fringed by a grove of trees which they called the wilderness the strangest device of all however was a sort of labyrinth beyond the trees at the extreme end of the garden the labyrinth in fact was a number of little gardens each with a tiny plot of grass and flowers planted about it like so many rows of buttons these gardens were shut in by hedges of quickset ten feet or more in height and led from one to the other by such a perplexing diversity of paths that once you had entered deep among them it was as much as you could do to find your way out of them again even ashlock who guided me amongst them ended by losing his way so nearly alike was one to the other and i not stopping to consider that where he failed i a stranger was little likely to succeed must needs separate from him and go asearching on my own account with this very natural result that i got more and more enmeshed in the labyrinth and was parted from ashlock into the bargain ashlock i shouted and again and again with never a reply for the space of half an hour or more at last by the merest chance i happened upon the right path and so came out upon that meadowlike space they called the wilderness ashlock i called again and again there was no answer had he got himself free i wondered and gone quietly about his business leaving me there i walked up the steps in an ill enough humour at the slight and passed through the parlour into the hall it was of a great size and height with long painted windows from the ceiling to the ground its roof indeed was the roof of the house and somehow it struck upon me as very empty and desolate ashlock i cried and i heard my voice reverberating and dying away down the corridors then came the sound of a man running from the inner part of the house ashlock i repeated and a servant appeared he was a tall spare man past the middle age i should say and was called jonnage aron i sent him to look for the steward but it was evening before he found him i thought sir that you had hit upon the path before i did ashlock explained but you heard me shouting no sir said he i found the way out a few minutes after you had parted from me and thought that i was following you i bade him show me to his office and give me some account of the estate which he did laying considerable stress upon the wadmines from which some part of the revenue was derived sir johns attorney said i when he had finished lives at keswick it will be well that i should see him tomorrow it is but nine miles from here to keswick he assented and the road is good then send a servant early in the morning to fetch him here ashlock shot a quick glance at me we will go over these matters again i continued with his help the three of us together ashlock bent his head down upon the papers very well he said and seemed diligently to peruse them indeed he held one in his hand so long that i believed he must be learning it by heart very well he repeated in a tone of much thought but during the night i changed my mind reasoning in this way i recognised clearly enough that the advice which king james had given me i mean that i should not disclose myself as a jacobite was due to the promptings of lord bolingbroke and those promptings in their turn took their origin from a regard for my safety rather than for the kings interest i was therefore inclined to look upon the recommendation as a piece of advice to be followed or not as occasion pointed rather than as a command on the whole i believed that it would be best considering the ends i had in view to express myself moderately as favouring the stuart claims moderately i say because i could not avow myself an emissary of king james without stating the special business on which i had come and that i was forbidden to do at the same time i had to carry that business to an issue and with as little delay as might be now it was evident to me that i should get little knowledge of the jacobite resources and less of their genuine thoughts if i were to sit down at blackladies in this nook of borrowdale i must go abroad to do that and if i was to excite no suspicion i must have a simple and definite excuse the attorney at keswick would for the outset at all events serve my turn very well so the next morning i countermanded the order i had given to ashlock and rode in past castle crag and rosthwaite to keswick and this i did on many a succeeding day to the great perturbation of the little attorney who had never been so honoured before by the courtesy of his clients also i made it my business to attend the otterhunts coursing matches fairs and wrestlingbouts of which there were many here and there about the countryside so that in a short while i became acquainted with the principal gentry and got some insight moreover into the dispositions of the ruder country folk now amongst the gentry with whom i fell in was my lord derwentwater and his lady who were then living in their great house upon lords island of that lake and from them i received great courtesy when they came to know of my religion and yet more after that i had made avowal of my politics so that often i was rowed across and dined with them upon one such occasion some three weeks after i had come to blackladies that is to say about midway through august lord derwentwater showed to me a portrait of his wife newly painted and but that day brought to the house i was much struck by the delicacy of the craftsmanship and stooped to examine the signature you will not know the name said lord derwentwater the man is young and as yet of no repute anthony herbert anthony herbert i repeated no i have never heard the name though were he better known i should doubtless be as ignorant for this long while i have lived in france it is very careful work said i looking closely at the picture indeed it errs through excess of care replied he for ones attention is fixed thereby upon the details separately one need have no fear of that said i with a bow to lady derwentwater when such details are so faithfully represented the pair smiled at one another and she laid her hand upon her husbands arm in the prettiest way imaginable the man is staying at keswick lord derwentwater continued that is how i chanced on him he came hither in the spring for the sake of the landscapes oh said i at keswick is he indeed and i spoke with something of a start for a new idea had been brought to me from his words for having come clean to the end of my business with the attorney i had been casting about during the last few days for some fresh cloak and pretext to cover my diurnal journeys from blackladies and here it seemed to me was as good a solution of the difficulty as a man could wish it may be that i set too much stress on the need for such a pretext it may be that i could have ridden hither and thither about the country without any one turning aside to busy himself about my errand but in the first place i was the youngest scholar of conspiracy certainly in experience if not quite in years and i was on that account inclined to exaggerate the value of a mysterious secrecy i took my responsibilities au plus grand srieux shrouding them from gaze with an elaborate care when no one suspected so much as their existence moreover it was the habit of the people in those parts to stay much within their native boundaries they rarely went afield indeed i have heard a dalesman of howray by keswick confidently assert that at seatoller a little village not two miles from blackladies the sun never shone between the months of september and march owing to the height of the circumjacent mountains in a word those fells which these countrymen saw close before their eyes each morning that they rose enclosed their country what lay beyond was foreign land wherein they had no manner of concern and this same habit of mind was repeated in their betters though in a less rude degree therefore i thought it did behove me to practise some dissimulation lest either my friends or my enemies should get the wind of my business so again i said the painter stays at keswick and where does he lodge in the high street said lady derwentwater and she named the house but mr clavering added the husband with a laugh the painter has a wife very young and not illlooking and he is very jealous i would warn you to pay no such compliments to her as you have paid to lady derwentwater and he clapped me on the back and so we went in to dinner he was silent through the first courses and his wife rallied him on his reserve i was thinking said he and he roused himself suddenly i was thinking and then he stopped with a whimsical glance at me but perhaps i am forestalled lady derwentwater clapped her hands and gave a little laugh of delight i know she said and turned to me my husband is the most inveterate matchmaker in the kingdom mr clavering he is like any old maid that sits by the window planning matrimony for every couple that passes in the streets i should like to dress him up in a gown of linseywoolsey and lappets of bonelace thats unfair he returned for there is this difference between the old maid and me she is a matchmaker by theory i through experience he spoke lightly as befitted him in the presence of an acquaintance but his eyes were upon his wifes face and her eyes met his she reddened ever so little and looked at her plate then she sent a shyish glance towards me another to her husband and all her heart was pulsing in that and so again to her plate with a ripple of happy laughter i seemed to be trespassing upon the intimacy of a couple but half an hour married and there were children asleep in their cots upstairs a pang of genuine envy shot through me the which lady derwentwater remarked though she misunderstood it for james she said turning reproachfully to her husband there is mr clavering absolutely disconcerted and no wonder darby and joan may be well enough by themselves but with a guest they are the most impertinent people in the world true said he and if mr clavering patronises herbert he will have enough of darby and joan to sicken him for his lifetime though it is a darby and joan in the april rather than the autumn of their years he added with a smile nay i interrupted to tell the truth i was thinking of the big empty galleries of blackladies there he exclaimed triumphantly mr clavering justifies my matchmaking out of his own mouth he justifies me we must marry him now to whom and once or twice he patted the table with the flat of his hand in a weighty deliberation his wife broke into a ringing laugh james you are incorrigible says she there is miss burthwaite says he impossible says i i have met her she says nothing but o la and well there and shakes her curls and giggles her vocabulary is limited he allowed but theres the widow at portinscales she swears i objected only when shes coursing he corrected but no matter theres nay said i interrupting his list this is no time i take it for a man to think of marrying for who knows but what the country may be ablaze from sea to sea before we are three months older with that a sudden silence fell upon as all and i sat inwardly cursing myself for the heedlessness which had prompted so inopportune a saying looking back upon that evening now it seems to me as though all the disaster with which that year of was heavy and near its time for her for him ay and for me too projected its shadow over our heads i looked into their faces grown at once grave and predestinate the shadow was there a cloud upon their brows a veil across the brightness of their eyes and then very solemnly my lord derwentwater rose from his chair and lifted up his glass the light from candle and lamp flashed upon the goblet turning the wine to a ruby fire the king he said simply without passion without heat but the simplicity had in it something august we also rose to our feet the king he said again his eyes fixed and steady upon the dark panels over against him as though there he read the picture of his destiny and so he drained his glass pledging his life and his home in that wine he drank making it sacramental we followed his example and so sat ourselves down again but as you may think there was little talk of any kind between us after that lord derwentwater made no effort at all that way but remained engrossed in silence with all his thoughts turned inwards once or twice his wife sought to break through the spell with some trivial word about the countryside but ever her eyes turned with concern towards her husbands face and ever the words flickered out upon her lips and for my part being sensible that my indiscretion had brought about this melancholy cloud i seconded her but ill at last and just as i was intending to rise up and take my leave lord derwentwater starts forward in his chair i have it he cried triumphantly bringing his fist smack upon the table well asked his wife leaning forward i have it he repeated turning to me what i asked anxiously theres dorothy curwen of applegarth said he laying a finger on my arm and at that we all fell to laughing like children as though the unexpected rejoinder had been the wittiest sally in the world it would be very appropriate too he continued with a laugh for it was rumoured that mr jervas rookley was paying his attentions in that quarter at one time and the girl deserves a better fate jervas rookley said i curiously you knew him of course what sort of a man was he for a moment there was a pause the honestest man in the world replied lord derwentwater to look at but there it ends his honesty mr clavering is all on the outside of him like the virtues of a cinnamon tree he should have been a sailor it was ever his wish and maybe the hindrance to its fulfilment warped him how that evening lives again in my memories indeed enough happened not so long after its event to keep it for ever green within my thoughts i recalled lord derwentwaters solemn toasting of the king when no later than the next february he went with the kings name upon his tongue to the block on tower hill i recalled his wifes loving glance and happy laugh with what pity when dressed as a fishwife she crept to temple bar and bribed the guardians of that gate to drop into her apron his head fixed there on the spikes and more that evening was a fingerpost to me pointing the road but alas a fingerpost that i passed unheeding and only remembered after that i had gone astray into a slough for that device of a picture was fixed firmly in my mind and i acted in the consequence of the thought i rode home to blackladies that night and passed at once into the great hall a fire of logs was burning on the hearth for even in august i felt at times the nights fall chilly there and the glow of the flames played upon the portraits of the rookleys dancing them into frowns and smiles and glances as though the faces lived father and son master and heir they were ranged orderly about the walls in a double row the father above the heir who in his turn figured painted anew as the master i turned to the lackey a roughish fellow named luke blacket who had admitted me is mr ashlock still up he is in the office sir i think he answered in some doubt or hesitation i will go and see i will go myself and i crossed the hall a man was sitting at the table with his wig off and his head was bald his back was towards me and he did not hear me enter so engrossed was he about his papers his pen scratched and scratched as if all time was against him it was doubtless a fancy but it seemed to me to run ever quicker and quicker as i stood in the doorway behind me the house was very dark and silent only this pen was scratching across the paper nimble like a live thing i stepped forward i heard a startled cry and jonnage aron stood facing me with his mouth dropping and a look of terror in his eyes i waited for him to speak comprehending neither his fear nor his business in my factors office at last in a jerky trembling voice resting one hand upon the table to steady him he asked wherein he could serve me it was mr ashlock i needed i replied he is not here sir faltered aron looking about him like a trapped beast i can see that for myself where is he i dont know sir and his confusion increased in bed maybe shall i send him to you he made a hasty movement as though he would escape from further questioning no said i stay where you are and i stepped forward to the table i took up the last paper he had been writing the ink was still wet upon it and i saw that it was a letter to one of my tenants in johnny wood concerning some improvements of which i had spoken to ashlock you do the work i pay my steward for i said and how comes that about very seldom sir he babbled out once or twice only when mr ashlock has been busy it is not well done and he made as though he would take the paper from my hands for i am no clerk but he told me the letter was not of the first importance i looked at the sharp precise characters of the letter ill tell you what is not well done aron i cried in some heat and that is your excuse the handwriting here tells of practice and i see that you thrust your pen behind your ear arons yellow face flushed a dull red he gave a start and plucked the pen from behind his ear and the impulsive movement ludicrously betrayed his sense of detection ah said i with a sneer you had best ask mr ashlock in the future to provide you with the excuse at the same time that he provides you with the work i bent over the table to examine the other papers which were littered upon it i had just time to remark that they were all in arons handwriting when a sharp click sounded through the silent house not loud but very clear like the cocking of a trigger the door was open i stepped into the passage and peered along it aron moved uneasily in the room at my side and his movement brought him betwixt me and the lamp so that a shadow fell across my face and on the passage wall i realized that i had been standing visible and distinct in a panel of light that was thrown from the open doorway aron moved again out of the light i took a couple of paces into the dark and again stretched forward peering in front of me i could see well nigh the length of the house the corridor in which i stood ran straight to the hall on the far side of the hall opposite to me there opened a wide gallery which was closed at the end by a parlour and this parlour lay at the east end of the house and gave on to the topmost terrace of the garden the door of the parlour stood open so that i saw right through it to the moonlight shining white upon the windowpanes but i saw more than this i saw the window opening it was the catch of the window which i had heard and a man with his hat pulled down upon his brows and a heavy cloak about him stealing in i was the more astonished at the sight because ashlock had informed me that there was no outlet from the garden at all and that i had considered to be true since on one side a cliff rose sheer above it while on the other side and at the end it was enclosed with a sunk fence of stone the intruder closed the window and came atiptoe down the passage i drew close against the wall and held my breath he passed by me insensible of my presence and walked into the room and as he came into the light i saw that he was holding the ends of his peruke in his mouth i did not however on that account fail to recognise that the newcomer was my steward i followed very softly close upon his heels ashlock he began and would have said more but aron held up a finger to his lips and grimaced at him i closed the door behind me with a bang and leaned against its panels the steward swung round abruptly and what stress of business keeps mr ashlock so late from his bed i asked and added pleasantly by the way which of you is mr ashlock seldom have i seen a man so completely taken aback as my steward was then and i was in the mind to profit by his confusion and which of you is mr i continued and came all at once to a dead stop for the strangest suspicion flashed into my mind i rode over to the farmer of johnny wood explained the steward and arons brows went up into his forehead as well they might thinking that a word with him would expedite the business it was a pity then i returned that you kept aron up so late writing a letter on that very subject i picked up the paper from the table and placed it in his hands his face puckered for a second and then smoothed again he read it through from beginning to end with the completest nonchalance it will do very well he said easily to aron and then turned to me with a smile the letter of course is a usual formality surely an unnecessary one i insisted men of business he returned suavely will hold it the reverse i presume sir that you have some urgent need of me i recovered myself with a laugh not urgent i replied but since you are here i took up the lamp from the table and went into the passage the steward followed me and after him though at some distance aron stumbled in the dark so we came into the hall i held up the lamp above my head at one point in the lower row of pictures there was a gap the oak panels made as it were a black hollow amongst the bright colours of the figures and the hollow was just beneath the portrait of sir john i pointed an arm to it it is the one vacant space left in the hall ashlock glanced sharply at me mr jervas rookleys picture should have hung there he replied in a rising tone which claimed the prerogative of that space still for mr jervas rookley but it did not i replied the space is vacant and since it is the fashion of the house that the masters portrait should hang in the hall why i will take my predecessors for my example ashlock took a quick step forward as though pushed by some instinct to get between me and the wall and turned upon me such a look of perplexity and distrust that for a moment i was wellnigh dissuaded from the project i heard a step behind me it was jonnage aron drawing nearer i turned and gave the lamp to him to hold bidding him stand further off and i said with a careless laugh though i fixed my eyes significantly upon ashlock my successor has full licence from me to displace it when his time comes to inherit but for the present my picture will hang there ashlock looked me steadily in the eyes the distrust faded out of his face but the perplexity remained and deepened your picture sir he asked in a wondering tone as though he would be asking what in the devils name i needed with a picture at all yes mr ashlock said i with a swaggering air which i doubt not was vilely overdone my picture and why not if you please it must needs be painted first he said that is very true i replied i had even thought of that myself and so apt an occasion has presented itself that it would be folly to disregard it for a painter has but lately come to keswick my lord derwentwater spoke of him to me and indeed showed me some signal evidence of his skill lord derwentwater exclaimed ashlock in a curious change of tone the perplexity in its turn began to die off his face and it was succeeded by an eager curiosity it seemed as though the name gave to him a glimmering of comprehension though what it was that he comprehended i could not tell yes lord derwentwater told me of the man i repeated anxious to colour my pretext with all the plausibility of which it was capable mr anthony herbert mr anthony herbert questioned ashlock slowly it is the painters name said i and he seemed to be as it were savouring it in his mind you will not have heard it before mr herbert has painted a portrait of lady derwentwater and i turned away and got me to my room with aron to light the way i left ashlock standing in the hall and as i mounted the lower steps of the staircase i heard him murmur to himself in a tone of reflection mr anthony herbert and he shook his head and moved away now some half an hour afterwards as i was lying in bed a thought occurred to me i got me to the door and opened it the house was still as a pool i took my candle in my hand and crept to the stairhead the moonlight pouring through the tall windows lay in great silver stripes upon the floor i stood for a little and listened once or twice a board of the staircase cracked once or twice an ember spurted into flame and chattered on the hearth but that was all i stole downstairs not without a queer shame that i should be creeping about my own house at the bottom i lighted my candle and shading it with my hand crossed swiftly to the vacant space among the portraits i held the light close against the panels yes there were the splintered holes where the nails had been driven in i lowered the candle till it was level with the lowest rim of the pictureframes on either side of the space yes there was a dimming of the oak like breath upon a windowpane where the edge of a picture had rubbed and rested against it i rose upright blew the candle out and stood in the dark thinking mr jervas rookleys portrait should have hung there he had said it had hung there not a doubt of it was it destroyed i wondered was it in some lumberroom hidden away and i remembered a room in the upper part of the house which i had found locked and was told the key was lost why had the picture been removed was it so that i might not recognize it well it did not matter so long as i never stumbled across it i groped my way up the staircase repeating to myself one sentence from the will i must not knowingly support mr jervas rookley i did not know i said to myself i might suspect i might believe but i had no proof i did not know i clutched the phrase to my very heart i could keep my trust the estate need not enrich the hanoverian jervas rookley should come to his own if god willed it in his own time for i did not know my steward was my steward no more what if he was ever out of sight when a visitor reined in his horse at the door he might be busy in his office what if another wrote his letters there was work enough for the steward and who should blame him for that he lightened his labours so long as his work was done i did not know yet how the man must hate me i thought as i recalled that hour on the ridge of coldbarrow fell chapter vi mr herbert it was eleven of the forenoon when i stopped at mr herberts door and the long incline of the street was empty at the bottom of the hill beyond the little bridge there was a shimmer of green trees and beyond the trees a flashing corner of the lake through a gap in the houses on my left i caught a glimpse of the woods of brandelaw and the brown slope of catbells rising from the midst of them a shadowless august morning bent over the country cradling it to sleep with all its drowsy murmurings so that contentment was like a perfume in the air and it was with a contentment untroubled by any presage that i tied up my horse and knocked at the door mr herberts lodging was on the first floor and as i mounted the stairs the noise of an altercation came to me from behind the closed door the woman who led me up shrugged her shoulders and stopped one of the april showers i thought recalling lord derwentwaters words will you go up she asked doubtfully yes said i for i take it that if i deferred the visit till tomorrow tomorrow might be own brother of today she knocked at the door twice and got no answer i heard a mans voice exclaim acrimoniously it was the worst mistake man ever made and a woman cry in a passion or woman either deary me i wish i were dead and deary me i wish it too said my attendant and impatiently she turned the handle and opened the door a man sprang forwards he was young i noticed of a delicate face with a dark bilious complexion mr anthony herbert i suppose i said taking off my hat and i stepped into the room the next moment i regretted nothing so much as that i had not taken the landladys advice for a woman sat at the table with her face couched upon her arms crying your business asked mr herbert abruptly getting between myself and the table i turned my back to the room and looked out of the window making as though i had not seen his wife lord derwentwater showed me yesterday a picture of his wife painted by you i said and i unfolded the purport of my visit slowly in the midst of my speech i heard the rustle of a dress and a door cautiously open and shut a second or two later i turned back into the room it was empty the artist accepted the commission and i arranged with him that he should set to work next day i am afraid he said awkwardly as he bowed me from the room that you caught me at an inopportune moment did i i returned playing surprise ah yes you are not dressed for he was wearing a dressinggown but it is my fault in that i came too early and he closed the door thank you the words were breathed in a whisper from the landing above that on which i stood i looked up the staircase was illlighted and panelled with a dark mahogany so that i saw nothing but the outline of a head bent over the balustrade and even as i looked that outline was withdrawn not at all i replied to the empty air the door behind me was thrown open what is it mr clavering asked herbert and he glanced suspiciously up the stairs i on the contrary stared down them it is i answered that your staircase is cursedly dark true says he and steps to my side one cannot see an inch further than is needful and he looked down them too one cannot even see so far says i and i peered upwards one might break ones neck if one were careless he continued in a musing tone oh i did not stretch it out enough for that i replied thinking of something totally different herbert looked at me with a puzzled expression it occurs to me mr clavering he resumed that if it would please you better i could fetch my easel over to blackladies there is no manner of occasion for that i replied hastily and i got me into the street with as little difficulty as if there had been a window to every step of the stairs thus then i had my excuse i rode back to blackladies that afternoon and bade luke blacket carry such clothes as i required to mr herberts lodging very well sir he said but did not go for just as it was getting dusk i saw from the library window ashlock for so i still called him even or perhaps more particularly to myself ride down the drive with the package upon his saddlebow i was as much surprised now at this voluntary exposure of himself as i had been previously at his sedulous concealments but i bethought me in time that it would be dark long before ashlock reached the village of keswick and as to his doings well i deemed it wisest to busy myself as little as possible on that head for i was never certain from one minute to the next but what i might stumble upon some proof which i could not disregard consequently neither then nor when he returned did i utter a single word but on the next morning i followed my clothes to mr herberts lodging sat to him for an hour or so and then went about my business and this i did day after day visiting the gentry about and attending the fairs and markets until i had acquired as complete a knowledge of what the district intended as would have satisfied my lord bolingbroke in person that there were a great many not merely of the gentry but of the smallest statesmen and even peasants who favoured king james i was rejoiced to perceive but against this disposition i had to set a deplorable lack of arms and all munitions of war here and there indeed one came across a gentleman like mr richard salkeld of whitehall in cumberland who had carefully collected and stored away any weapon that he could lay his hands on and i remember that in patterdale one mr john burtham a man very advanced in years led me with tottering steps down to his cellar and showed me with the greatest glee a pile of antique musketoons and a couple of barrels of gunpowder which his grandfather had hidden there for the service of king charles i but had discovered no use for after marstoon moor for the most part however such as took the field i saw would take it with no more effectual armament than scythes and sickles and beatenout ploughshares and indeed i am not sure but what i would rather have so armed myself than with the musketoons and gunpowder of mr burtham one necessary condition however or rather i should say one necessary preliminary of a rising all with whom i had speech required and in a unanimous voice i mean that his most christian majesty should land twenty thousand troops in england and with them money for their subsistence on the other hand i knew that the french king howbeit disposed to the utmost friendliness was yet anxious before he violated the peace of utrecht to ascertain which way the wind blew in england and whether it was a steady breeze or no more than a flickering gust it was about this time too that news was brought to me of the duke of ormonds flight to paris and i did not need the letter of lord bolingbroke which conveyed the news to assure me how great a discouragement that flight must be to our friends in france this then was the posture of affairs france waited upon the jacobites in england and they in their turn waited upon france there is but one hope said lord derwentwater when we were discussing the uncertainty wherein we lived there is but one hope of precipitating the matter to an issue and that hope lies in the activity of the english government the commons have suspended the act of habeas corpus until next january in the case of all persons suspected of conspiracy papists and nonjurors are banished from the cities of westminster and london and for ten miles round the laws against them are to be put into the strictest execution i do not know but what the rigour of these proceedings may goad the jacobites to an extremity but therein lies the one hope and how goes it with darby and joan he broke off in a laugh i saw the portrait but yesterday and it will do no discredit to the young master of blackladies but the young master of blackladies turned his face awkwardly to the window and felt the blood rush to his cheeks but never a word of answer to his lips for alas what before had been the pretext and excuse was now become the real object of my journeyings i had garnered my information and the picture was still apainting and little more than halfway to completion i cannot even after this long interval of years think of that period without a lurking sense of shame though i paid for the wrong yes to the uttermost farthing and thank god in all humility that it was given me to repair it for this indeed is true the wrong went not beyond the possibility of reparation it was on the third occasion of my coming to the artists apartment that i first met mrs herbert face to face she entered the room by chance as it seemed in the search for some embroidery mr herbert for a wonder was in a great goodhumour that morning and presented me to her this is mr clavering of blackladies he said with a wave of the hand and so went on with his work i rose from my chair and bowed to her but with a quick impulsive movement she came forward and held out her hand to me reddening i must think with some remembrance of the occasion whereon i had first seen her and then tony she cried reproachfully with a glance about the room indeed it had something of a slatternly appearance which seemed to me to accord very ill with the woman who dwelled in it the poor remains of breakfast a dish of clammy fish a crumbled oatmeal cake and a plate of butter soft and oily were spread upon a stained tablecloth but the stains were only upon one side and i chose to think it was there the man had sat well says he looking up in a flash of irritation what is it what is it and then following the direction of her gaze we can afford nothing better he snapped out that is no reason she replied why it should drag here till midday and she rang a little bell upon a sidetable he shrugged his shoulders and returned to his picture she stood looking at him for a second as though she expected him to speak but he did not then mr clavering she said turning to me with a flush of anger upon her face i must needs undertake my husbands duty and make you his apologies herbert started up from his seat throwing the brush which he held petulantly on to the floor nay i answered in some distress for this apology was the last thing i expected or desired madam there is no manner of need that such consideration should be shown me mr herbert honours me sufficiently by painting my portrait that is very courteous of you she answered with a little bow and i expected nothing less but and she drew herself up again and faced her husband it is not fitting we should receive our patrons with so little regard madam i blurted out in the greatest confusion i beseech you it would cause me the greatest distress to think that i had proved a trouble betwixt your husband and yourself it was not the discreetest phrase i could have chosen but it served its turn for it brought them both to a stop and in a little mrs herbert left us alone thereupon i put my hand in my pocket and drew out the medal of which i have spoken mr herbert i said i have an ornament here which i would fain have you add to the portrait and i held it out to him very well said he taking it if you will leave it here i will paint it in at my leisure but said i it would not be wise to let it lie open to the gaze of any chancecomer he turned it over in his hands and glanced at it for myself said he i do not meddle in politics one way or the other i will keep it locked see and he placed it in a little iron box and locking it put the key in his pocket on the next day that i came the room was all tidied and newly swept though the improvement brought no more peace than did its previous disorder for this time mr herbert could find nothing that he wanted even his brushes and colours had been tidied out of sight so that he was forced to call in his wife to help him in the search for them and seeing her thus engaged somehow fell ungratefully to rating her the which she listened to with a patience which i could not but greatly admire and after all it was she who discovered the brushes then very quietly she said i will be no party to a quarrel before mr clavering it might perchance savour of illbreeding and so she departed with the pleasantest smile leaving herbert in a speechless exasperation for my part i wished intensely that she had not dragged my name into the business herbert turned from the door to me and from me again to the door his mouth opened and shut he spread out his hands in despair as though the whole world was a riddle to be given up then he looked at the brushes in his hand she hid them he cried damme but she hid them i felt inclined to rise from my chair and determine my visits there and then i changed my mind however bethinking me that the couple were poor and that if i acted on the inclination i should be punishing not merely the husband but the wife as well to drive the notion finally from my head i needed nothing more than that by accident i should chance upon mrs herbert on the stairs for she spoke to that very point as i wished her good day it will be goodbye you mean mr clavering she answered with something of a sigh for the loss which would befall them since the defection of a client thus prematurely could not but damage his reputation in those parts it will be goodbye if you wish it i returned with a laugh but not otherwise mrs herbert gave a start and looked across my shoulder i turned sharply and saw mr herbert himself standing in the doorway above me he must have heard the words i knew but he stood quite still his face passionless as stone and for that reason maybe i did not at the time consider the construction he would be likely to put on them speaking for myself i continued i shall not easily part from mr herbert until the picture is finished and in my safe keeping so i spake with a polite bow to the painter little thinking in how strange and hazardous a fashion i was destined to fulfil my words it must not however be thought that the pair were ever aseething in this pot of quarrels the sun shone betwixt the thunderclaps and with no dubious rays at times for instance mrs herbert would bring a book of plays into the room and read them aloud whilst her husband worked and i i alas watched the changes of her face once i remember she read in this way mr congreves love for love with a decent slurring of some passages and a romantical declaiming of others at which mr herbert would break into languishments and sighs and mr lawrence clavering would feel himself the most awkward intruder in the world it was in the midst of this particular reading that anthony herbert was called downstairs upon some business and she and i were left for a little to our devices mrs herbert continued to read with her eyes glued upon the pages but gradually i could not but notice that a certain constraint and awkwardness crept into her voice at last she stumbled over a passage and stopped i rose from my chair and sensible that a like awkwardness was stealing over me went and gazed at the picture i made the mistake however of praising it and of praising it perhaps with some extravagance for the encomium naturally enough being couched in that vein brought the artists wife across the room to consider of it too in truth says she looking from the portrait to myself he has caught your features mr clavering even to the eyes and the curve of the chin yes i replied it needs no connoisseur to foretell how much mr herbert will achieve she did not answer but kept looking at me curiously and i continued in an unaccountable flurry sir godfrey kneller ages one hears of no one who can fitly claim his place the honour of it should fall to mr herbert nay must fall to him i think and it is no barren honour he has an estate at witton lord derwentwater tells me he sits as justice of the peace there and he is even now painting his tenth monarch it is no barren honour i spoke with all the earnestness i could command but of a sudden from the corner of my eye i saw her lips part in a queer smile i felt my voice shake and covered the shaking with a feeble laugh so an obscure country gentleman i continued has reason to count himself lucky in getting his picture done by mr herbert before the sovereigns of europe engross his art and at that for sheer want of assistance i faltered to a stop the silence crept about us insidious laden with danger and every second that passed made it yet more dangerous to speak the woman at my side stood motionless as a statue i did not dare to glance at her i stared at the portrait and saw nothing of it it was as though my face had faded from the canvas in a mist i was conscious only of the tall figure at my side i tried to speak but no thoughts came to me nothing but a tumult of unconsidered words words which i had never spoken before and of which even now i did not apprehend the meaning they whirled up within me and beat against my teeth for passage i locked my mouth to keep them in and then i began to be afraid i began to tremble too lest the woman should move at last i conned over a sentence in my mind and repeated it and repeated it silently until i was sure that i could utter it without a trip it must be a noble thing to be the wife of so great an artist and as i spoke the words i was able to move away she gave a little quiet laugh and answered with besides the prospect of being wife to a justice of the peace at witton for speaking that word i almost felt that i hated her oh why wont you help i cried in a veritable despair stretching out my arms to her she turned on me suddenly with her face aflame and a cry half uttered on her lips what would have been the upshot i cannot tell but the door opened or ever she could articulate a word and mr herbert returned to put an end to our talk for a week after that i mounted the stairs with uncertain steps each footfall accusing me for that i came however during that week i saw her no more and was beginning to acquire some confidence in my powers of selfmastery indeed i went further and became even vaingloriously anxious that i might chance upon her in order to put those powers to the test the opportunity came and this is what i made of it there had been some dispute that morning over a trivial domestic matter and mr herbert sat glooming before his easel when his wife entered the room with a certain air of defiance and took her customary seat she held a book in her hand bound in old leather with gold lettering upon the back so that i was able to read the title it was sir thomas malorys book of the morte darthur and in a very deliberate voice she read out of the story of lancelot and guinevere and much emphasis she laid on the temperate gentleness of king arthur and his unreadiness to believe in any misdoings either of his wife or his companions but her words fell vainly upon deaf ears for herbert took no heed of any word she read or any accent of her voice the which she came to see and losing all her defiant dignity in a little shut the book with a bang and ran out of the room for my part i had listened to the story in the greatest disorder of spirit and was very glad to be quit of it and of mr herbert too for that day at all events in spite of the supremacy of his genius but the staircase as i have said was very dark and particularly so at one corner where it turned sharply two flights below the doorway and made an angle in the wall now as i passed this angle something moved in it i stopped wondering what it was and then a voice came to me in a whisper lancelot instinctively i drew back and threw out my hands they touched they held another pair of hands for the fraction of a second no said i with an attempt at a laugh hollow as the clatter of an empty mug the name does not fit me for at all events lancelot could fight and i have not learnt even so much skill as that unconsciously i raised my voice as i spoke and a second after the door creaked gently above us she drew back into the corner all atremble like a chided dog and the movement touched me with a pity that made my heart sicken the angle i knew could not be seen from the stairhead i slipped purposely on a step and swore a little not overquietly what is it asked mr herbert an illlighted staircase is the devil said i and i grumbled my way to the streetdoor but i heard mr herberts door shut before i left the house whither i went after leaving the house i was in that perturbation of mind i cannot tell it was my habit to stable my horse at the lamb and flag opposite and subsequently i was told that i entered the courtyard and wandered out of it again like one blind a fire burned in my blood and the aspect of the world was fiery to my vision i went whither my footsteps guided me and all places they led me to were alike afterwards it came upon me like the memory of a dream that i had stood for some while with the sheen of water beneath my eyes and the lapping of water in my ears and that hereafter i had climbed for long hours up a wearisome green slope and indeed my insteps and knees ached for days to come so it may be that i went down to derwentwater and thence toiled up some part of skiddaw but of all this i knew nothing at the time i only knew that i came again to the possession of my wits in keswick street about ten oclock of the night very hungry and very tired i entered the inn and bade the landlord get me some supper before i started homewards and this he did laying a table for me in the best parlour of the house a long room on the first floor with windowseats from which one commanded the street the landlord prepared the table for me at the inner end of the apartment and set the lamp there so that as the light was but dim and i rested myself in the window until such time as supper should be brought i was wellnigh in the actual dark now while i was seated there a man came down the street towards me i should not i think have noticed him at all but for the caution of his movements for he kept very close to the houses and stepped lightly upon his toes and when for all his care his spurs clinked or his foot rolled on a loose stone he paused and looked behind and about him so he walked until he came in front of mr herberts house then he stopped and it came upon me that there was something familiar in his appearance i drew back into the curtains he gazed up and down the street and then to the windows of the lamb and flag a heavy tramp sounded on the cobbles some yards away very loud and unexpected so that it startled me little less than it did the man i watched i drew yet farther into the curtains he slunk into a cavity between two of the houses and that action of his flashed of a sudden a plan into my mind i remembered that dark angle on the staircase the footfalls grew louder a dalesman passed along the centre of the roadway his steps died away up the hill my man crept from his hidingplace and whistled softly under mr herberts windows the blind was pushed aside from the window an inch or so and i saw a head against the light pressed upon the windowpane then the window creaked and opened the head was thrust out and a few words were interchanged but in so low a tone that i could catch nothing of their purport then the window was shut and the man advanced to the door one thing was clear to me from these proceedings that whosoever he might be and i had little doubts upon that score this was by no means his first visit to mr anthony herbert i set that piece of knowledge aside however for the present there was a further point which concerned me more particularly just then was the streetdoor on the latch or must mr herbert descend to give his visitor entrance the visitor turned the handle opened the door and closed it again behind him i waited until i saw his shadow on the blind he had taken off his hat and his cloak and his profile was figured upon it in a silhouette i ran down the stairs and across the street without so much as picking up my hat i opened mr herberts door and crept up the staircase until i came to the angle which i had reason to know so well there i hid myself and waited in the dark and how dark it was and how intolerably still very rarely a burst of laughter or a voice louder than the usual would filter up to me from the back part of the house but from the studio above nothing not the tread of a foot not the whisper of a voice not the shuffle of a chair what were they debating in such secrecy i asked myself and then perhaps i had been mistaken after all i clung to the possibility though i had little faith in it at all events this night i should make sure one way or another i should make sure after the weariest span the door was opened i could not see it because of the turn of the staircase i stood in fact just under the door but i could see on the wall facing me at the point where the stairs turned a bright disk of light suddenly appear such as a lamp will throw the visitor would pass by that disk he would intercept the rays of the lamp those rays would burn upon his face i leaned forward holding my breath the steps above me cracked as a man descended them i heard a short good night but it was mr herbert who spoke and then the door was closed again and the disk vanished from the wall i could have cursed aloud so bent was i upon discovering this visitor but the footsteps descended towards me in the dark and i drew myself back into my corner as they passed me i felt a sudden flap of wind across my face as though the man was moving his hands in the air to guide him and i reckoned that the hand was waved within an inch of my nose a few seconds later and the streetdoor opened the sound brought home to me all the folly of my mistake if i had only waited outside in that alley say where he himself had crept i should have seen him i should have known him now i must needs wait where i stood until he was clean out of reach i counted a hundred a hundred and fifty two hundred and then in my turn i slipped down the stairs and out of the house the night was not overclear and i could perceive no one in the street i strained my ears until they ached and it seemed to me that i heard a light tiptoe tread very faint diminishing up the hill i ran in its direction with as little noise as i might but i heard my spurs clinkclinking even as his had done only ten times louder i stooped and loosed them from my feet then i ran on again it seemed to me that the footsteps grew louder i turned the corner at the head of the street in front of me there was a blur of light the blur defined itself into four moving points of flame as i approached and or ever i was aware of it i had plumped full into my lord derwentwater who was walking homewards behind his torchbearers to the lake come my man said he what manners are these the manners of a man in a desperate hurry says i and so good night to you my lord and i moved on one side lawrence clavering he cried out and caught me by the arm the very man i would be speaking with but tomorrow my lord tomorrow nay tonight you come so pat upon my wish that i must needs believe god sent you and the deep gravity of his tone was the very counterpart of his words i stopped undecided and listened but i could no longer hear the faintest echo of those stealthy footsteps then there is something new afoot said i something new indeed says he though i take it it concerns no one but you and he bade his footmen go forward a minute ago a man passed me on this road his cloak was drawn about his face his hat thrust down upon his ears but the light of my torches flickered into his eyes and i knew the man it was doubtless my steward i blurted out he was in keswick today your steward he asked in wonderment your steward no i should not pester you with news about your steward it was young jervas rookley well said i what of him my lord i have nothing to fear from jervas rookley you think that i know it i answered a trifle unsteadily at all events there is solid reason why i should have no grounds for fear for i bethought me that i had loyally kept faith with him lord derwentwater stood for a moment silent walk a step with me he said and holding my arm he continued i would not meddle in your private concerns mr clavering but i know jervas rookley and it will be a very ill day for you when you hear his step across the threshold of blackladies i felt a chill slip into my veins for if he spoke truth and his words fitted so aptly with my suspicions that i could not disbelieve them why that day was long become irrevocable however i sought to laugh the matter off a very ill day indeed for on that day i lose blackladies to the crown the danger will come from jervas rookley himself then it will be man to man we were now come within a few paces of the footmen so that the flare of their torches lighted up our faces fitfully my companion stopped i have known men lawrence he said who went down to their graves in the winter of their years children all the more lovable for that maybe for an instant his grip tightened about my arm but none the less children and i have known others who were greybeards in their teens he paused and looked at me doubtfully as though he would say more you will be wary of this man he can have little friendliness for you and it will be no common motive that can bring him back to these parts you will be wary of him lawrence so much i readily promised and again he stood shifting from one foot to the other balanced uneasily betwixt speech and silence but all he said was again you will be wary of him lawrence and so with a grasp of the hand moved off i watched him going and as the torches dwindled to candleflames and from candleflames to sparks a great desire grew in me to run after him and disclose all that i knew of jervas rookley the desire grew almost to a passion had i spoken then doubtless he would have spoken then and so much would have been saved me but i had given my word to hold this estate in trust and ignorance or the assumption of ignorance was the condition of my keeping it the torches vanished in the darkness i walked back to the inn and mounted my horse as i rode out of the courtyard i saw far away down the street and close to the lakes edge four stars as it were burning there was still time i turned my horse but i had given my word and i spurred him to a gallop up the castle hill and rode down borrowdale to blackladies chapter vii a dispute and its consequences but as i rode this warning i had received swelled in importance it became magnified to a menace and my desire to speak changed into an overmastering regret that i had not spoken i had kept my word loyally to well to ashlock since so i still must term him even in my thoughts nay was still keeping it the while he played false with me that he trusted me to keep it i was assured by the memory of his words and looks on that night when he had talked of my picture in the hall why then should he play false there was but one man who might be able to enlighten me upon the point lord derwentwater and to that one man my lips were closed i was moreover disturbed too by the knowledge that i had planned to travel to grasmere on the following day and be absent there until the night thus leaving rookley a free hand it was late when i turned out of borrowdale but i noticed that there was a light still burning in the stewards office i rode into the courtyard of the stables and leaving my horse there walked to the front of the house one or two of the attic windows still showed bright and the ground floor was dimly lit but somehow the house smote on me as strangely desolate and dark luke blacket was waiting to let me in and whether it was that my strained fancies tricked me into discovering a mute hostility upon his face but it broke in upon me with a full significance that all the servants down to the lowest scullion must be in the secret and were leagued against me i saw myself entering a trap and so piercing a sense of loneliness invaded me that i plumbed to the very bottom of despondency i stood in the doorway gazing across the valley the hills stood sentinel leaguering me about the voices of innumerable freshets sounded chilly in my ears as though their laughter had something of a heedless cruelty my whole nature cried out for a companion and with so urgent a demand that i bethought me of the light shining in the stewards office it would be aron without a doubt sitting late over the books i went down the passage and opened the door aron rose hastily to his feet and began some apology mr ashlock he said requested me but i cut him short weary for one honest word of truth that will do aron i have no wish to disturb you and i threw myself on to a couch which was ranged against the wall i am very tired said i and lay with my eyes closed arons pen stopped scratching he sat for a second without moving then he came over to the couch and or ever i was aware of it began pulling off my boots i opened my eyes and started up in his old worn face there was a look of friendliness which at that moment cheered me inexpressibly nay said i you are too old a servant aron to offer help of that kind and i too young a master to accept it let it be he straightened his back and the friendliness increased upon his face he glanced quickly about the room and stepped softly to my side master lawrence he began in much the tone a nurse may use to a child and then sir i mean i beg your pardon in a trice he was the formal precise servant again nay said i i know not but what i like the first title the better it was a liberty said he with his face grown rigid and the privilege of an old servant i replied but that is just the point you are not my servant except in name and i turned my head petulantly away the next moment his mouth was at my ear master lawrence he said in a voice which was very low master lawrence were i you i would not ride again to keswick i started up aron flushed so that the bald top of his head grew red hopped back to his table bit his pen and set to writing at an indescribable rate as though he was sensible he had said too much i leaned upon my elbow and looked at him so i had a friend in the household after all i hugged the thought close to me had he any precise knowledge which prompted the advice i wondered but i could not ask him and for this reason amongst others i was too grateful for this proof of his goodwill to provoke him to a further indiscretion but as i looked at him i recalled something which i had noticed whilst riding about the estate i suppose it was his scribbling at the papers put it into my head but once it had come there i thought vaguely that it might be of relevance aron i said this plumbago it is a valuable product he looked at me startled yes said he the mine is opened once in five years yes and on that side of the mountain which faces borrowdale yes and with each assent his uneasiness increased but theres a ravine runs back by the flank of the mountain and on the mountainside there i saw a small lateral shaft it is closed now and has been for long he interrupted eagerly but it was open once i persisted the place is secret who opened it it was opened during sir john rookleys life he answered evading the question no doubt but by whom he shuffled his feet beneath the table i repeated the question by whom by mr jervas he answered reluctantly with sir johns knowledge and consent aron glanced at me with an almost piteous expression sir john knew of it but before it was opened or afterwards the answer was slow in coming but it came at last afterwards then i take it i resumed that mr jervas rookley robbed his father i spoke in a loud tone and aron started from his seat his eyes drawn towards the door i rose from the sofa and opened it there was no one in the passage but i left the door open when i turned back again i saw that aron was looking at me in some perplexity as if he wondered whether i knew but his father forgave him he said gently very true said i fixing my eyes steadily upon him and besides it is hardly fair to rake up the misdeeds of a man who is so very far away i spoke the words very slowly one by one arons mouth dropped a paper which he had been holding in his hand fluttered to the floor the perplexity in his eyes changed into a blank bewilderment and from bewilderment to fear you know sir he whispered nodding his head once or twice in a way that was grotesque then you know i know this aron i interrupted hastily i hold the estate of blackladies upon this condition that i do not knowingly part with a farthing of its revenue to mr jervas rookley you know that you know that if i fail to fulfil that condition the estate goes to the crown aron nodded but this you do not know i continued when ashlock came to me in paris and told me that mr jervas was disinherited because he was a jacobite i refused to supplant him being a jacobite myself it was my steward who persuaded me and by this argument that when king james came to his throne the will might easily be set aside i accepted blackladies upon those terms as a trust for mr jervas but to keep that trust i must fulfil the conditions of the will i must not knowingly do aught for mr rookley the condition should be easy for i have never been presented to mr jervas i have not so much as seen a portrait of him and at this aron started a little he might be living in my house as one of my servants i might even suspect which was he but i should have no proof i should not know aron gazed at me with wondering eyes you hold blackladies in trust for mr jervas he asked and i gathered from the tone of the question that my steward had thought fit to keep that knowledge to himself and hope to do so until it can be restored to him but i urged i am in no great favour with the whigs in these parts and if they could prove i knowingly supported mr jervas they would not i fancy miss the occasion my attorney for instance is a whig and the attorney of whigs and they tell me strangely enough that mr jervas rookley has been seen in keswick aron however seemed to be thinking of something totally apart he said again and with the same wonderment you hold blackladies in trust for mr jervas that is so said i but it need not keep us out of bed and i walked into the passage aron lifted up the lamp and very politely led the way to my door there he stopped and came into the room with me sir said he setting down the lamp you will pardon me one more question it is another privilege of the old servant i answered with a yawn you were poor when mr ashlock came to you in paris penniless said i and i began kicking off my boots lazily then god knows he cried i would you were sir john rookleys son and with that he plumped down on his knees and drew off my boots and this time i suffered him to do it i had not done with him however even for that night for an hour or so later when i was asleep in bed some one shook me by the shoulder i looked with blinking eyes at the flame of a candle held an inch from my nose behind the candle was aron with a coat buttoned up to his chin as though he had thrown it over his nightgear aron i said plaintively the question will keep till tomorrow it is no question sir and tomorrow i shall be in newlands he said gravely i know nothing only were i you i would not ride again to keswick well i shall not ride there tomorrow at all events i said since tomorrow i leave for grasmere but on the morrow i did ride thither after all for i woke up the next morning with one thought fixed in my mind as though it had taken definite shape there the while i lay asleep i must discover rookleys business with anthony herbert the matter was too urgent for delay my resolve to sit no more for my portrait my journey to grasmere i set on one side and while i was yet at breakfast i ordered a horse to be saddled the fellow hurried off upon the errand and i seemed to detect not merely in his bearing but in the bearing of all who had attended me that morning a new deference and alertness in their service and i wondered whether aron had shared with them his recent knowledge of my purpose as i rode down the drive i chanced to look back to the house and i saw aron on the steps shaking his head dolefully but i kept on my way mr herbert received me with the air of a man that seeks to master an excitement he worked fitfully with fitful intervals of talk and i remarked a deepseated fire in his eyes and a tremulous wavering of the lips his manner kept me watchful but never a hint did he drop of any design between my steward and himself on the contrary his conversation was all in praise of his wife and the great store and reliance he set on her i listened to it for some while deeming it not altogether extravagant but after a little i began again to fall back upon my old question what end could my steward serve by playing me false and again in what respect could herbert help him in the midst of these speculations an incident occurred which struck them clean out of my mind i was attracted first of all by something which herbert was saying it is out of the fashion he said with a sneer for a man to care for his wife and ludicrous to own to it but it is one of the few privileges of an artist however poor he be that he need take no stock of fashions and for my part mr clavering i love my wife i replied carelessly enough that the profession was very creditable to him for in truth i had seen him behave towards her with so cruel an inconsistency of temper that i was disinclined to rate his protestations very high and so greatly mr clavering he went on so greatly do i love her that and here he threw down his pencils and took a step or two until he reached the window that if aught happened amiss to her i do not think i should live long after it if she deceived me i do not think that i should care to live i do not think i should even hold it worth while to exact a retribution from the man who helped in the deceit and i saw his wife in the open doorway she must have caught every word i saw a flush as of anger overspread her face and the flush give place to pallor mr ashlock my steward was with you last night mr herbert was it upon this subject that you talked herbert flung round upon his heel you take a tone i do not understand he said after a pause you may have a right to pry into the conversations of your servants mr clavering but i am not one of them and of a sudden he caught sight of his wife in the doorway you here he asked with a start it is only fair she answered that i should be present when you discuss my frailties with your patrons but it seems and her voice hardened audibly you do me the kindness to discuss them with your patrons servants too she stood before him superb in pride every line of her body seemed to demand an answer it is because i love you he answered feebly and at that her quietude gave way she flung up her arms above her head because you love me she cried was ever woman so insulted and on so mean a plea and she sank down at the table in a passion of tears herbert stepped over to her and laid a hand upon her shoulder she shook his hand off and rising of a sudden confronted me with a blazing face and you she cried bitterly you could listen to such talk ay like your servant and she swept out of the room before either her husband or myself could find a word to say indeed though i had not thought of the matter in that light before i considered her accusation of the justest and the sound of her sobbing remained in my ears tingling me to pity of the woman and a sore indignation against the husband it was for myself i should have felt that indignation i knew well but i am relating what occurred and well maybe i paid for the offence heavily enough mr herbert said i rising with as much calmness as i could command i will not trouble you to continue the work but the portrait he exclaimed almost in alarm it is my best work and he stood a little aloof gazing at it the portrait i cried in a fury at his insensibility the portrait may go hang on the walls of blackladies he asked with a quick sneer oh said i slowly you gossiped to some purpose with my steward it appears he stood confused and silent i went into the room where it was my habit to change my dress and left him but when i came out i found him standing in the passage with a lighted candle in his hand though it was broad noonday doubtless i looked my surprise at him an illlighted staircase mr clavering is the devil he remarked and with a sardonic deference he preceded me to the street it will rain i think he said looking op at the sky the air is very heavy said i he stretched out the candlestick to the full length of his arm and the flame barely wavered yes no doubt it will rain he repeated i noticed that one or two people who were passing up the street stopped as well they might and stared at us i bent forward and blew out the candle you will pardon me i said it has served its purpose said he and he kicked the door to behind me i mounted and walked my horse slowly homewards about two miles from the town i dismounted and tethering my horse to a tree paced about the lake shores resolved to unpick his sentences word by word until i had disentangled from amongst them some reference which would give me an inkling into the stewards designs he had told herbert of that talk we had had together in the hall concerning the hanging of the picture of so much i was assured and so much i still found myself abstractedly repeating an hour later for alas in spite of my resolve my thoughts had flown along a very different path i had a vision of the woman and her alternations from pride to tears ever fixed before my eyes it was myself who had caused them one moment i accused myself for not undertaking her defence the next for that i had ever entered her lodging and whatever outcry i made sprang from the single conviction that i was responsible to her for the distress which she had shown just for that moment there seemed but two people upon gods earth myself and a woman wronged by me mr clavering the name was uttered behind me with an involuntary cry and i knew the voice i turned me about and there was mrs herbert standing in a gap of the trees she was dressed as i had seen her an hour ago with the addition of a hood thrown loosely over her head what can i do i cried i can think of nothing it is my fault all this god knows i am sensible of the remorse i feel it at the very core of my heart but that does not help me to the remedy what can i do it is not your fault she replied gently this would have happened sooner or later jealousy is never at a loss to invent an opportunity no it is not your fault but it is i cried you know it you know that the excuse you make for me is no more than a kindly sophistry it is my fault what can i do she gave me no answer indeed it almost seemed as though there was something of impatience in her attitude i moved a few steps away and sat down upon a boulder by the waters edge with my head between my hands there is but one thing that i can do i said and i heard her move a step or two nearer but it is so small so poor a thing and at that i think she stopped i shall not go back again to mr herberts lodging neither shall i the words dulled and stupefied me like a blow i sat staring out across the lake and i noticed a ripple that broke and broke in a tiny wave ever at the same spot some thirty yards from the shore i fell to counting the waves i remember and lost my reckoning and began afresh and in a while i commenced to laugh though it did not sound like laughter neither shall i she repeated and struck the laugh dead i started from my seat she stood patiently before me with folded hands and to argue against that patience seemed the merest waste of words before however i could make the effort her spirit changed passion leapt out of her like a flame i hate him she cried beating her hands one upon the other oh to be made a common talk for his acquaintances the humiliation of it servants too he will debate of me with them for them to mock at no i answered vehemently you do not know that it was i that spoke of my steward and i knew nothing i did but guess idly heedlessly it was not he it was i who spoke of ashlock but there was no sign of assent in her demeanour it was i spoke of him i repeated and before you ah god it is my doing this from the beginning to the end think she went on taking no more notice of my interruption they are making merry over me in your servants hall think lancelot she tried to check the name but it was carried beyond her lips on the stream of her passion a great silence fell upon us both i saw the colour come and go fitfully upon her face and her bosom rise and fall with her fitful breath then she covered her face with her hands and sank down upon the boulder yes i thought it was my fault they had quarrelled before but never for such a reason and that reason i had provided i had gone there of my own free will to serve my own objects but somehow as i looked at her seated by my side the thought of the slatternly room she had been compelled to live in shot into my mind i remembered how unfitted to her i had thought it on my first going thither of a sudden while i was thus watching her she lifted her eyes to mine what babbling incoherencies i spoke i do not know i do not think she caught more than their drift if they are known at all it is because they stand ranged against my name in the judgment book i became like one drunk his senses reeling his words the froth of his vilest passions i think that i cried be it so then since the harm is done let the name be lancelot but i know that she rode before me on my horse to the gates of blackladies that we dismounted there and walked up to the house and that i found the halldoor open and the house to all seeming deserted now this day was the rd of august chapter viii the afternoon of the rd of august i led her into the little parlour which gives on to the terraces at the south end of the house the wall upon one side was broken by a great open fireplace faced with bricks and all too big for the room into which a man could walk and wherein he could sit too were he so disposed upon a chilly night and smoke his pipe with a crony over against him for there were cushioned seats on either side of the hearth and a curtain hung to keep your head from the bricks the room seemed very silent as we entered it and the silence deepened she crossed over to this fireplace and stood with a foot raised towards the hearth though there was no fire to warm it by i tossed my hat and whip on to the table with more noise than was necessary and made a step as if to join her she drew back instinctively i stopped as though the step had been a liberty and neither of us had a word to say once she untied the ribands of her hood for she must be doing something but the moment she was aware of what it was she did she tied them again with hasty uncertain fingers and then reddened and paled of a sudden becoming it seemed to me sensible of the hastiness of her action i sent my eyes wandering to every corner of the room so that they should not rest upon her face but none the less after a little our glances crossed and with one movement we averted our heads after that one of us had to speak you will be hungry i said lamely you have eaten nothing since the morning and i walked to a little sideboard on which a bell was standing no no she cried but i had struck the bell or ever the words were past her lips oh what have you done she said with a shiver one of your servants will come and then she checked herself and added with her fingers plucking at her gown in a pitiful helpless way well what does it matter they had the story before it happened this will but confirm and seal it i went out into the hall to stop whosoever should be answering the summons but no one came to answer it i crossed the hall and opened the door which led to the kitchens as a rule the noise of womens voices was incessant in that quarter of the house but today not a sound not so much as the clatter of a dishcover i went back to the hall and listened the house was as still as on that night when i crept down the stairs and discovered the marks of a pictureframe upon the wall was the house empty i wondered and shouted to solve the doubt my voice went echoing and diminishing along corridor and gallery but that was all i moved down the passage to the office half thinking that i might find aron there but remembered that he would be away and so returned reluctantly thereupon i mounted the stairs and walked from room to room and maybe lingered overlong in each i was not indeed concerned with their silence and vacancy so much as with the knowledge that each step brought me actually a step nearer to the parlourdoor but i came to the end of my search and there was nothing for it but to descend again the halldoor however stood open and i saw my horse at the bottom of the steps tethered by the rein to a knob of the stone balustrade i walked down the steps loosed it and led it round to the stables there was a boy or two in the stableyard and i remember putting to them a number of aimless questions which i was at great pains to think of but did not listen to the answers until their fidgeting made me sensible of the cowardice of my delay and drove me back to the house then i remembered why i had left the parlour and going to the pantry i got together some food upon a tray and brought it with a decanter of burgundy into the parlour mrs herbert was standing where i had last seen her i set out the table saying my servants seem all to have taken holiday and more for something to do you may be sure than from any sense of hunger she sat herself at the table and began to play with the food i had brought but one plate and set a chair for but one person and neither of us noticed that the truth is there was a shadow in the room the shadow cast by sin and we watched it as children in a fitful firelight will watch a strange shadow on the wall neither drawing near to it nor fleeing from it but crouched watching it once she said i have brought nothing with me and after a little some thought seemed to strike her for she lifted her head suddenly and said there is no one in the house but you and i no one i said that is strange she said absently strange the word was an arrow of light piercing through the mist of my senses strange it was indeed strange aron had warned me not to ride to keswick that was strange too for the first time i set this desertion of my servants together in my mind with my suspicions of ashlocks treachery i started to my feet invaded by a sudden fear but i saw mrs herbert at the table running her fingers along the hem of my fine tablecloth and her throat working as though she was swallowing her tears i knew by some instinct of what she was thinking she was thinking of her poor furniture in her lodging at keswick it was hers you see won by her husbands toil and maybe she had a passing thought too of sir godfrey knellers estate at witton earned too by a painters art and such a pity for her such a loathing of myself flooded my mind as drove out all thought of mr ashlocks machinations i recalled how i had deemed that slatternly apartment unfit for her it needed that we two should be here with the shadow about us for me to realize how contemptible was the thought again she said no one is in the house except yourself and me and in the same thoughtful tone then she rose from her chair with the air of one that has come upon an outlet when all outlets seemed barred it was kind of you she said to show me your house i would gladly have seen the gardens too but the day is clouding and it will rain i think ere long she dropped me a formal curtsey as she spoke i did not want the urgent appeal of her eyes to take her meaning my heart rose to it with a spring i will have a carriage made ready for you i replied and i turned me to the window yes i am afraid that it will rain thank you she said and i like the blundering fool i was must needs in my great joy add it is no long journey into keswick after all keswick says she with a start and drops her eyes i had not thought of that i had not thought where i should go to i stood before her dumb i knew yes i knew that the only place for her was that little apartment in keswick grant her but the sight of it and the sight of her husband in it for he loved her and well it needed no magician to forecast the result but there was one person in the world who could not use that argument myself however she helped me out i cannot go back she said without he knows it would not be just no it is not possible and at that the tears came at last the sound of her weeping pierced me like a sword he shall know then i cried he shall know i myself will ride to keswick and tell him you will she asked suddenly lifting her head maybe too i may find means to bring him back if that might be she whispered in a fervour of hope her whole face lightening and a timorous smile dawning through her tears but no and the hope died out of her face payment will have to be made for this youll see payment will be made she spoke in a low tone of such perfect certainty that it seemed to me it was not so much the woman who spoke but that providence chose her voice that moment for its mouthpiece heaven send the payment fall to me i said she glanced at me quickly oh she said in a complete change of voice what will you tell him why the truth i answered that i found you by the lake and brought you here no she exclaimed i will not have you say that it must be the truth that i came to you she drew a note from her pocket as she spoke and tossed it on to the table i picked it up wondering what she meant it was a line scribbled in a hand which was familiar to me and there was a word curiously misspelled wateing for waiting somewhere i had seen that word misspelled precisely in that way before and surely in this handwriting too then the truth flashed upon me it was in the inn at commercy and the handwriting was jervas rookleys the line was this i shall be wateing for you by the lake on the road to blackladies but jervas rookley knew that i was journeying to grasmere that i was not returning to blackladies until night the letter was a snare then to draw mrs herbert from the house if so all the more need for haste i opened the door and stepped into the hall but the hall was no longer empty the halldoor was still open i had left it open and a man stood in the centre of the hall it was anthony herbert his back was towards me and from his manner i gathered that he was considering which of the passages giving upon the hall he should choose it was for no more than a second that he stood thus but that second gave me time enough to do the stupidest thing that ever a man out of his wits conceived and yet in a way it was natural for i slammed the door to behind my back and stood barring it with my hand upon the knob mr herbert twisted round upon his heel caught he cried spitting the word at me i realized the folly of my action and let go of the handle i was this instant setting out to find you the words sounded false to me though i knew them to be true and my voice took a trembling indecision from the foreknowledge that he would disbelieve them no doubt said he otherwise you would not be guarding the door he spoke with a great effort to be calm but his eyes were aflame his limbs quivered with his wrath and now and again his voice lost its steadiness and ran up and down in a fitful scale i thought to find you in the garden he continued in the garden i asked but doubtless you point me out the way and he took a step towards me with the movement his cloak slipped from his left shoulder and i noticed that he was carrying a sword and a pistol in his belt my hand went back to the handle the few words i have to say to you said i had better be spoken here but it would be best of all he returned to defer them altogether i have some business with you it is true but that business comes second and i think we shall need no words for its discussion he took yet another step your business with me mr herbert may come when it will said i but these words cannot be deferred they are few however few they are still too many he broke in out of my way you must hear them before you pass this door i gripped the handle tighter ill not listen to you he cried you overrate my credulity mr clavering out of the way i will not this is my house but it shelters my wife it was she sent me to fetch you i gathered all my strength into the utterance of the words that i might enforce their truth upon him but they only served to whet his fury and confirm him in disbelief thats a lie he shouted and in a flash his sword was out of the scabbard and the point of it pricking my breast if she sent you to fetch me why do you guard the door stand aside but since i had made that mistake i must go through with it i will not i answered doggedly and i set a hand upon each side of the doorway there is more to tell i will not will not says he grimly gives the wall to must and he leaned a little very gently on the sword i did not move but behind me the handle of the door rattled i tried to seize it but the door was pulled open from within i staggered back into the room herbert sprang through the opening after me and stood drawing in his breath his eyes fixed upon his wife she recoiled towards the hearth it is the bare truth i told you i exclaimed passionately oh believe that when i caught sight of you i had taken the first step in pursuit of you and it was mrs herbert who set me on the task oh believe that too it was no doing of mine it was she sent me for myself i gave little thought to you i own it it was she declared she could not return without you knew i but obeyed her for a moment it seemed to me that his anger lulled i watched his eyes they were fixed upon his wife and i saw the conviction in them fade to doubt the doubt waver and melt into was it forgiveness i do not know for mrs herbert shifted her position his eyes wandered from her face and fell upon the table the note which she had shown me was lying open beneath his gaze he stooped his head towards it i made a movement to hinder him he remarked the movement and on the instant snatched the paper up you persuade me to read it said he which accordingly he did as he read an idea occurred to me for let him believe i wrote that note and he would be the more likely to attribute the blame where it was due and exhaust his anger in the same quarter so that when he asked rapping the note with his knuckles this is your hand i kept silence he repeated the question and i positively relished the growing menace of his voice and still kept silence but he gave me credit for more subtlety than i possessed oh i understand he burst out you were going to fetch me no doubt this letter bears you out so well and my wife sent you to fetch me a cunning afterthought when the first excuse had missed its mark a very likely story to be sure but enough to hoodwink a dullwitted fool of a husband eh reconcile husband and wife and mr lawrence clavering may laugh in his sleeve damn him it is the truth i exclaimed in despair believe it believe it the truth he retorted with bitterest sneer the truth and you are speaking it god i believe truth itself would become a lie if you had the uttering of it believe you why every trickster keeps his excuses ready on his tongue against the time hes caught i would not believe you kneeling before the judgmentseat he poured his abuse upon me with an indescribable fury and in a voice gusty with passion but you shall answer for it he continued when you will i answered quietly he was still carrying his sword in his hand and he suddenly thrust it out at arms length before him and turned it to and fro with his wrist so that the light flashed on it and streaked up the blade to the hilt then i will now he replied now now and at each word he flashed the sword and with each word his voice rose exultingly in your garden now he moved towards the window his wife stepped forward with a cry and laid a hand upon his arm he stopped and looked at her with eyes that told her nothing it must have been a full minute i should think that he stood thus he had as yet spoken no word to her and he spoke no word now i saw her head decline her whole frame relapse and droop and she slipped on to her knees herbert shook her hand from his arm kicked open the window and crossed the terrace i went into the hall to fetch my sword as i crossed the threshold of the room i heard the iron gates clang at the top of the terrace steps as though he had flung them to behind him while i picked up my sword i heard the sound repeated but more faintly from the second terrace and as i entered the room again and drew the sword from its scabbard i heard it yet a third time through the open window i could see him descending the steps of the third terrace but between myself and the window the wife was kneeling on the floor said she you will not harm him and she clasped her hands in her entreaty say you will not the payment must not fall to him i almost laughed so strange and needless did the entreaty sound madam i said this is the pommel of the sword and this the point one holds the sword too by the pommel i believe in fact i know so much but there my knowledge ends she spoke a little more but i gave scant heed to what she said for a sentence which she had spoken somewhile since drummed in my ears to the exclusion of her present speech and the import of it shone in my mind like a clear light payment will have to be made for this she had said over her shoulder i saw mr herbert move further and further from the house it was about six oclock of the afternoon and very windless and still a great strip of cloud hung from green comb to high knott gloomed across the garden thick as wool and bulging like a sail so that even the scarlet flowers of the parterre took from it a tint of grey and underneath this cloud from end to end from side to side the garden seemed to me to be waiting waiting consciously in a sinister quietude for this payment to be made the fantastic figures into which the boxtrees were shaped bears leopards and i know not what strange mammoths appeared patient and alert in the fixity of a sure expectation while the oaks and larches in the wilderness beyond seemed purposely to restrain the flutter of their leaves i felt the garden beckon me by its immobility and call me by its silence mr herbert had stripped his cloak from his shoulders and dropped it upon the third flight of steps so that he now moved a brown figure here showing plain against the grotto or the grass there confounded with the flowers he held his sword in his hand at that distance and in that dull light it looked no more dangerous than a strip of lead and ever and again he would cut at a bush as he passed no harm can come to him i said seeking to disengage myself for the wife still clung to me in her misplaced fear i could not harm him if i would for they do not teach one swordsmanship at the jesuit colleges the words rose to my lips by chance and by chance were spoken but i know that the moment after i heard them i staggered forward with a groan and stood leaning my forehead against the framework of the window mrs herbert rose to her feet i was looking down the terraces across the parterres to the brown figure moving away but i did not see that it was as though a black curtain had swung down between the garden and myself what i saw was a very different scene a little twilight room far away in paris and a stern face that warned me i heard a voice telling me of a supreme hour wherein god would put me to his touchstone an hour for which i must stand sentinel well the hour had passed me and i had not challenged it and i might have foreseen its coming had i watched i lifted my head the garden again floated into view anthony herbert was marching through the long grass of the wilderness with never a look backwards in a moment he reached the fringe of trees the trees were sparse at the border and i knew that he would not stop there but would rather advance until he arrived at some little dingle closely wooded about from view of the house in and out amongst the boles of the trees i saw him wind then for a second he disappeared and came to sight again upon a little patch of unshadowed grass i remember that the sun gleamed of a sudden through an interstice of the cloud as he stepped into the open the patch of grass shone like an emerald and the dull strip of lead in his hand turned gold and a larch upon the far rim where the trees grew dense taking some stray breath of wind rippled and shook the sunlight from its leaves in some unaccountable way my spirits rose at the sight i still was sensible of that saying payment must be made for this but it took a colour from the sunlight it became rather payment can be made for this i slipped out of the window mrs herbert started forward to detain me a duel she exclaimed in a tone as though the idea became yet more inconceivable to her oh no not a duel no not a duel i replied across my shoulder only the pretence of one and while my head was thus turned a pistolshot rang from the wilderness it sounded like the crack of a whip and i might have counted it no more than that but i saw a wisp of blue smoke float upwards above a shrubbery and hang curling this way and that in the sunlight god save us i cried but he carried a pistol and i made as though i would run across the terrace towards him but or ever i could move i felt a hand tighten and tighten upon my arm i tried to shake it off you do not understand i exclaimed he carried a pistol it was a pistol that we heard maybe he was looking to the priming maybe he is wounded i must go to him and i seized mrs herberts hand at the wrist and sought to drag it away from my sleeve i felt her fingers only grip more closely i dropped her wrist and began to unclasp them one by one it is you who do not understand she said and he is not wounded she spoke in a dry passionless voice which daunted me more than the words she uttered i turned and looked at her in perplexity her face was like paper even her lips were white and her eyes shone from it sunken and black i was reminded of them afterwards by the sight of a black tarn set in a moor of snow which i was destined to look upon one sad november afternoon in this same year they seemed to have grown bigger the better to express the horror which she felt he is not wounded be sure be very sure of that she continued nodding her head at me in a queer matteroffact way which joined with the contrast of her face had something to my thinking awsomely grotesque what do you mean i gasped and in a momentary weakness staggered back against the framework of the window i felt her clasp strengthen upon my arm drawing me within the parlour he carried a pistol yes but why should he look to the priming since you were to fight with swords she whispered shaking my arm with a little impatient movement did you not see his walk grew slow his head drooped drooped he was tired you see so tired and she uttered a low mirthless laugh while her eyes burned into me it was a sound which i thank god i have never heard but the once it was as though a preternatural horror claimed a preternatural expression it was not worth while she resumed ah no i cried as her meaning broke in upon me ill not believe that ill not believe it and once or twice i thrust out with my hands as if that way i could keep belief aloof but you do she returned and the whisper of her voice took on a certain eagerness it seemed that she must have a partner in her thought you do believe it look am i pale then i am your mirror do i tremble it is an ague caught from you you do believe it we know you and i guilt binds us in knowledge we heard this morning he told us he warned us if his wife proved false he would not count it worth his while to punish the betrayer but he has he has punished us so perfectly that he himself would pity us were he alive to do it would god we both were dead and again she laughed and letting drop my arm she moved away into the room i had no doubt her words were true and from the bottom of my heart i echoed her vain prayer i remembered the conviction with which he had spoken all the more assured for the very quietude of his voice yes those trees motionless under a leaden sky in a leaden silence were the watchers about his bed i braced myself to descend but as my first step crunched the gravel of the terrace mrs herbert was again as my side no she cried not yet not without me and i dare not go nay madam i replied do you stay here there is no need for you to come but there is there is she insisted looking at me wildly like one distraught step by step we must go together and so it will be always you will see you and i are fettered each to each by sin and theres no breaking the locks she shook her hands piteously nay i said i will go alone i dare not be left alone she replied for what if he passed you while you searched for him and she gave a shuddering cry and recoiled into the room what if he came striding from the thicket across the grass to where i waited here no no wait wait until its dark i will go down with you but now in the daylight his eyes will be open i dare not she stood with her hands clasped before her toppling towards madness i dared not leave her there was no choice for me between the dead man and the living woman there was no choice i returned to the room you will wait she asked until it is dark she moved into the alcove of the fireplace and crouched down upon the seat with her back against the wall nearest to the garden i remained by the window looking down the garden with the valley on my right i saw the strip of cloud unfold across the valley and lower upon the hilltops like a solid roof the hillsides darkened the bed of the valley grew black it seemed to me with the shadow of the wings of death here a tree shivered from another there the birds of a sudden chattered noisily i turned and gazed across to eagle crag the dale of langstrath sloped upwards facing me between the mountains and as i gazed i saw the rain drive down from the stake pass to the mouth in a great slanting column it deployed along the hillsides the mountains became unsubstantial behind it it swept across the valley lashing the house bending the trees in the garden and his eyes will be open said mrs herbert behind my shoulder i started round her white face was like a wax mask in the gloom of the chamber but as i turned she moved back again to the fireplace it is cold she said with a shiver i set fire to the wood upon the hearth and as the logs crackled and blazed she bent forward and spread out her hands to the flame i dropped into the seat opposite to her and so we sat for a long while in silence once it seemed to me that i heard the hoofs of a horse upon the gravel of the drive galloping up to the house and in a little galloping away from it but what with the beating of the rain and the turmoil of the wind i could not make sure nor indeed did i feel any concern to know once mrs herbert raised her head to me and said as if answering some objection which i had urged it was because he loved me that he told the steward that was his way god made him so and her voice as she spoke was very soft her face too softened as i could see from the glow of the fire and i knew that her husband in his death was drawing her more surely towards him than he had ever done in life he was very good to me she said to herself it was i that plagued him he was very good to me and i i love him it was as though she had forgotten he was dead and more than one remark of the kind she made while the room darkened behind as and the night fell upon the world without and the raindrops hissed down the chimney into the fire i dared not rouse her though the forgetfulness struck me as horrible but once i know i shifted restively upon my seat and she looked at me suddenly as though she had forgotten that i was there as though indeed she did not know me but in a little recognition gleamed in her eyes and they hardened slowly to hatred however she said nothing but turned her face again to the fire and so stared into it with eyes like pebbles after a while the wind lulled the raindrops hissed less often down the chimney and finally ceased altogether a line of moonlight shot into the room and lay upon the carpet like a silver rod the room became mistily luminous and then pitilessly bright meanwhile no one seemed as yet to be astir within the house i rose unsteadily from my seat she followed my example yes let us go she said and we went out on to the terrace chapter ix the night of the rd in the garden as we descended the terracesteps the horror of this task on which we were set broke in upon me in its full significance above our heads it is true the moon sailed through a clear sky upon the trees in the wilderness the raindrops glistened with a sprightly brilliancy like the silver lamps of fairies but beneath us on the floor of the garden a white mist smoked and writhed and somewhere somewhere under that mist lay the dead body slain by me we met the mist at the line where the parterre borders on the wilderness and walked through it kneedeep until the trees grew dense at that point however we separated and moved forwards thenceforth with an interval between us that we might the sooner end our search and so doing we quickly lost sight of one another i made directly so far as i could guess for the bushes above which i had seen the smoke of the pistol float but being come near to the spot what with the delusive light and the many shrubs crowding thereabouts i could by no means determine which was the particular one i sought moreover since i walked as i say kneedeep in mist it was a very easy and possible thing for me to pass within an inch of the body and be never a jot the wiser unless my foot chanced to knock on it i walked therefore very slowly and in a great agony and desolation of remorse it seemed to me that his wraith was a presence in the garden and the garden its most fitting habitation for now that i had left the open and was circled about with the boskage i moved through a world shadowy and fantastic the shadows of the branches laced the floor of mist in a grotesque pattern and amongst them my shadow moved and moved alone swelling and dwindling as i turned this way and that in the moonlight and now and again invisible beneath the mist a creeping plant would twine of a sudden about my ankle and i would stop with a cry halfchecked upon my lips fancying for a moment that it was the dead mans fingers clutching me moreover as i brushed against the boughs the raindrops would patter from the leaves with the most melancholy sound that ever a man heard to me i know they sounded like the pattering feet of little children i remember that when the thought first struck me i groaned aloud in the anguish of my spirit the pattering of little childrens feet and here was the young husband dead through me as surely as though my hand had pulled the trigger and the young wife as surely widowed and when i rose and continued my search that sound pursued me it was as though the children ran after me with many steps to my one stride i was like the dutch piper they tell of in storybooks who led the little children in a long train from hamlin town only those children laughed and sang and played as they went merriment in their voices rosy expectation in their looks but those who followed me that night followed in the saddest silence the only noise they made was the pattering of their feet unborn children mutely accusing me for that they would never see the day indeed i drank my fill of punishment that night how long it was that i wandered thus i do not know but all at once a cry rang out through the quiet it came from some distance upon my right and was the cry of a woman i hurried in that direction as quickly as the long wet grass allowed and in a little i came to an open space mrs herbert was kneeling in the centre with her arms in front of her buried in the mist i ran towards her but she did not perceive me until i was within a few yards of her no she cried suddenly and she lifted up her arms and held them towards me to keep me off not you not you and with that she dipped her arms again into the mist and began to croon over to herself a little tender lullaby such as mothers will sing about a cradle i noticed that she moved her hands and i fancied that i understood the significance of the movements for now they seemed to caress a face now to repose upon a breast madam i said gently i know that my help must be the most unwelcome thing to you in all the world yet i must offer it and you must accept it there is no other way and i bent down towards the ground no she cried and with all her strength she thrust my arms aside repulsing me the moonlight shone in her eyes and they glared at me wild with hatred no she leaned forwards over the spot protecting it your touch would stain and with a sudden movement she caught hold of a hand of mine and peered at it as though she thought to see blood there no you must not but i must i interrupted her for her wits seemed all distraught and i could endure this evidence of her suffering no longer i must i repeated and in my turn i dipped my hands into the curling mist she gave a shrill scream as though i had laid violent hands on her sprang to her feet and made in a stumbling run beneath the trees towards the house i kneeled down where she had kneeled and plunged my hands in the mist as she had done what they touched was a fallen treetrunk i started to my feet and ran back to the house there was no one in the parlour i hurried into the hall there was no one there i ran down the road at the gates i saw ahead of me in the darkness the flutter of a dress i raced after it i heard a cry which the sound of my running provoked and mrs herbert began to run from me i called to her but she only quickened her pace and accordingly i relaxed mine in a little her run became a walk and so keeping behind her i followed her to the outskirts of keswick and then returned to blackladies the house however was now lighted up and the door closed i knocked and one of the servants opened it to me i did not speak to him but ran through the hall to the garden and resumed the search i continued it until the sky in the east grew white and after that when the sun had risen and the birds were singing the mist cleared from the ground and at last in the clear daylight i came again to the shrubs whither i had marched at the outset and i saw something which made the hope spring again in my breast the grass for some yards was trampled and crushed as though from a struggle i picked up a shred of lace it might have been torn in a struggle from a ruffle or cravat i dropped upon my knees and searched in the grass in a little i came upon a pistol it was the pistol which i had noticed in mr herberts lodging and moreover it was discharged it was he then who had fired but but it was plain he had not fired it at himself in a feverish haste i crawled on my knees within this trampled circle if he had been attacked who attacked him i needed a clue to answer me that question and i found the clue after a long while it is true but nevertheless i found it it was no more than a metal button but i had seen the like upon the uniforms of king georges officers i held it in my hands turning it over and over for to my thinking the mines of golconda held no jewel half so precious it was a sign to me that anthony herbert was not dead the one pistol which had been discharged was his own he had been captured and capture seemed to me so small a thing in the revulsion of my feelings of the reason for his capture i did not conjecture at all i stood with an intense feeling of gratefulness softening at my heart and dimming my eyes then i remembered that there was one whose right to share my knowledge and my gratitude i had already too long deferred i started with all speed for the house the garden laughed in the sunshine as i ran and the flowers took on a richer beauty and sprinkled the air with a sweeter perfume but as i neared the open space i saw through an opening of the trees aron run from the parlour and down the steps in a great haste i shouted to him and he lifted his head and seemed to look for the spot whence the shout came but he did not in any measure slacken his pace i shouted again and he caught sight of me and waved his hands i ran on and again he waved his hands but with a more violent gesture i met him halfway across the open space of meadow quick sir said he panting in a great disorder back back to the trees and he caught me by the flap of the coat i tugged the coat away for gods sake master lawrence stop but i was already running past him the which he saw and putting out a foot tripped me up without ceremony i sprawled full length on the grass how dare you i spluttered out in a rage i would do as much again sir and more were there the same need quick sir to the trees and he stooped to help me to my feet then its too late he whispered and pressing me down by the shoulder dropped at my side look master lawrence look and he nodded towards the house i saw the flash of a redcoat in the little parlour then another and another the room filled with soldiers keep your head low sir god send they do not look this way if only we had reached the trees and he stretched himself flat in the grass and began to wriggle and crawl towards the shelter they come for me i whispered imitating his example yes he returned i must needs think so why i saw them marching up the drive and mr he paused over the name mr ashlock was with them ashlock i exclaimed with a start for in the press of trouble which these last twelve hours had brought i had clean forgotten the man hush replied aron oh why keep up the lie i answered savagely call him jervas rookley and have done with it he came with king georges soldiers did he aron or ashlock i take it i should call you when next mr jervas rookley makes up his accounts for me he shall make them up with his own hand i promise you that the old man shook his head very sadly i fear me he agreed that mr jervas is for something in all this for more than you know i replied and indeed for more than i know too as yet of a sudden i remembered that evening when i had seen jervas rookley enter through the parlour window there is a secret way into the garden i said and then a new thought flashed in upon me it was doubtless by that way the soldiers came no sir said ashlock they came by the highroad else i should not have seen them true said i those soldiers did but they are not all the soldiers in cumberland and this secret way you know it i know it he answered but we must reach the thicket first i looked backwards across my shoulder the soldiers were spreading over the terrace i turned my face and strained every muscle to help me forward each moment i expected to hear the clink of a sabre against a spur and a voice cry halt or to see a shadow fall from behind my shoulder across the grass in front i must not be taken i said to myself yet knew full well that i might i must not be taken it was not so much the thought of my own peril that plagued me but rather the desire to inform mrs herbert that her husband was not dead it pressed upon me like a sheer necessity i must escape ashlock at my side uttered a groan i can go no further master lawrence he said and lay prone in an extremity of exhaustion his face purple and the veins pulsing upon it were i ten years younger but i cannot for answer i twined my arm about his body and dragged him forward every muscle in his body was aquiver the sweat poured from his forehead and his chest heaved upon my arm as though it would crack and all the while the screen of grass was close about our eyes and the sun burning upon our backs and heads at last a shadow fell between the sun and us i stopped with a groan and let my forehead fall forward on the ground in a trice i saw myself captured tried executed and meanwhile mrs herbert would sit aweeping in keswick for a husband who was not dead thank god said ashlock it is the shadow of the first tree i raised my head just checking the cry of joy which sprang to my lips a little to the left of us a great leafy branch stretched out towards us we crawled forward again past a treetrunk then another then another and in a minute i was standing up behind a shrub and ashlock was lying at my feet his breath coming in hoarse gasps from between his parched lips his eyes closed and his whole body limp and broken i peered round the shrub the soldiers were scattered over the parterre and then of a sudden i saw something which doubled my fears for right across the meadow a furrow was drawn in a wavering line as though by the clumsiest scytheman and it led straight to this bush in a very short while the soldiers must see it i sprang to ashlock it was no less than a necessity that ashlock should escape from that garden without incurring a suspicion i needed a friend in the house for one thing for another i needed a messenger who could safely show himself in keswick accordingly i raised ashlock to his feet and supported him through the thicket until we came to the labyrinth the secret entrance to the garden lay in the last square of the labyrinth at the corner against the hillside and had been constructed by jervas rookley during the lifetime of his father it consisted of no more than a number of iron pegs driven into the interstices of the stone wall and hidden beneath a drapery of ivy i descended first and ashlock followed me closely so that if by any chance he slipped i might be able to lend him a hand as soon as we were safely at the bottom i said now ashlock your way lies down the valley mine up the hillside you will get back into the house unnoticed make sure of that and today you will ride into keswick and take this message from me to mrs herbert i tore a page from the notebook which i carried in my pocket and hurriedly scribbled on it he is not dead and added thereto my initials now goodbye be instant with the message i doubt me but it is the last order you will ever take from me and so i turned from him and began running up the hillside ashlock called out to me sir he cried i know not where i can have news of you it will be well that i should know you can have news of me i replied at my lord derwentwaters but be careful how you come there lest you imperil him and of a sudden he snatched up my hand and kissed it master lawrence he said in a broken voice of apology my father served sir john rookleys father therefore i interrupted you must serve sir john rookleys son it is very right and i patted him gently on the shoulder it is just for that reason a man serves his king it is the house one serves not the man who heads it but i would you were sir john rookleys son the tenderness with which he spoke cut me like a knife nay said i if there were a choice to be made you would not be right in choosing me i had barely ended the sentence before a cry rang out from the garden it came however faintly to our ears quick i said they have come upon our tracks in the grass quick that note must reach keswick today and your hand must deliver it with that we parted i mounted the hillside until i came to a large boulder and threw myself on the ground beneath its shelter in a fever of impatience i watched ashlock descend along the wall and yet the moment he had turned the corner and was clean out of my sight i wished him back again i was in truth sunk to such a depth of shame and selfcontempt as made this old servants goodwill an extraordinary consolation for now that i had had time to grow used to the knowledge that anthony herbert was not dead i began to see more clearly the wickedness of my preceding conduct it was then with a very lonely feeling that i climbed to the ridge of green comb beneath me i could see blackladies and its garden much as on that morning when i first rode thither over coldbarrow fell but i saw it with very different eyes then proud of my entrusted mission i had looked upon it as an instrument of loyalty a prop however fragile of the cause i served and my father had served before me now it was to me a monument of failure here i had failed through and through i had proved false to mr herbert i had been juggled like the merest fool in my service to the king i had but to turn and over against me i could see the very spot where i had forced jervas rookley to make his vow of concealment upon his knees and a little lower down the winding path where i had come to my knees and jervas rookley had sat his horse over me well i had kept faith with him at all events and how had he kept faith with me the redcoats sprinkled in the garden below gave me the answer yes i had kept faith with him it seemed to me a wonderful and astonishing thing so deep was my humiliation but it was true i had kept faith with him and i hugged the thought to my very breast in the wreck of my hopes and pride it stood erect as you may see a single column standing amidst a pile of ruins and perhaps i thought since that one column stands if he could but bring perseverance to the work a man might in time rebuild the whole to effect anything of this sort however i must needs first of all escape and to that end i kept all the day along the hilltops and at the fall of the dark came down bleaberry fell to the great wood that fringes derwentwater over against rampsholme island about a mile to the east of the wood was a fishermans cottage with which i was sufficiently familiar since the fisherman had ferried me over often enough to lords island and many another visitor to my lord derwentwater besides who came in a great hurry when the night was fallen dark to this cottage i crept and tapping at the windowpane presently the man came out and joined me he asked no questions being well practised in the habit of secrecy but put me across to the steps and so pushed off again without a word i thought it best not to openly knock at the door but crept round to a room wherein i knew lord derwentwater was used to sit of an evening to my inexpressible relief i saw that the windows were lighted i knocked on the pane the sash was thrown up who is it asked lord derwentwater i set my band on the sill and climbed into the room chapter x a talk with lord derwentwater i escape lawrence he exclaimed starting back at the sight of me and with a cry lady derwentwater came forward and took my hand in truth i must have cut a sufficiently pitiable figure for my dress was all fouled from head to foot and my face i have no doubt the complement of my dress the soldiers are after me i gasped out ah jervas rookley cried lord derwentwater with a bang of his fist upon the table the while his wife got me some brandy from a sideboard but i warned you lawrence i warned you when i caught sight of him in keswick i know i answered but you did not warn me he was a traitor all this while jervas rookley has been my steward at blackladies your steward exclaimed lord derwentwater and you did not know nay i replied it was not so much that but i would not know i pledged my word to him with that i drank off the brandy oh if you had only told me this he cried i could not i answered i had but conjectures and they were not enough to warrant me there was but one fact in all the business which was clearly known to me i had pledged my word to him nay said lady derwentwater and she laid a pitying hand upon my shoulder he was right since he had given his word and i why i groaned aloud and let my face fall forward on my arms ah poor boy she exclaimed all this day he has been out upon the hills and here we stand plaguing him with questions when we should be ransacking the pantry we deserve to be whipped she cautiously slipped out of the room but it was not any bodily want that troubled me so much as the unmerited kindliness of her tone and gesture it wrought on me indeed with such a melting compulsion that had she remained within the room i verily believe i should have blurted out that other story with a withold your pity until it is deserved lord derwentwater locked the door behind his wife and began to walk about the room lawrence said he i am in some way to blame for this but i did not know the fellow was masquerading at blackladies as your steward he was disinherited you know but do you know why because he was a jacobite i replied because he was a spy cried lord derwentwater a spy do you understand paid by the government to worm himself into the jacobite councils i know for his father told me and told me on his deathbed sir john was a whig you know but an honest one and a gentleman and the shock the knowledge caused him caused his death a spy i exclaimed and i might have known i might have known it at commercy at commercy said he with a start i might have known it in midchannel it was the letter his hands were searching for and noticing lord derwentwaters perplexity i related to him the whole story of rookleys coming to paris the promise i made to him there the journey to lorraine you had speech with the king he exclaimed and jervas rookley knew you carried a letter in the kings hand to the duke of ormond and jervas rookley knew ay for he tried to steal it and a great silence fell upon us both we looked into each others eyes i know i held my breath with a swift stealthy movement more significant to me than even the silence was he unlocked the door again and peered into the passage we were speaking overloud lawrence he said in a hushed whisper he was on the point of locking the door again when lady derwentwater returned bearing a loaded tray it is a bad case you are in said lord derwentwater you had best fall to it must not be known you were here tonight i would gladly hide you nay said i i have brought you near enough to danger as it is he waved the remark aside there is no sense in such talk between friends but lords island is no safe place for you i am suspected you are known for my friend here will they come first to search for you but tomorrow interrupted his wife not tonight it were best he leave tonight replied lord derwentwater ah no james she returned it would be illusage in any case to dismiss so easily a friend so hard put to it and the worst usage in the world towards mr clavering for look what the boy most needs is a bed and what if he were taken in it that would be worse usage still anna we cannot risk his life for the sake of our manners i seconded him in his advice for though i was dropping with fatigue and lady derwentwaters words called up i know not what sweet visions of lavender sheets i knew that at any moment the sheriffs messenger might come rapping at the doors lady derwentwater accordingly said no more but betook herself to filling my glass and heaping up my plate with an air of such maternal tenderness as pierced me to the heart if she only knew i thought if she only knew what manner of man she tended on and again i was very near to blurting out my story there is one thing said i which i do not understand for if rookley meant my ruin why should he wait so long to accomplish it he had the means to hand the day that i set foot in england lord derwentwater stopped suddenly in his walk you received my letter yesterday a letter said i no what time of the day was it sent in the afternoon i remembered that i had seemed to hear the hoofs of a horse upon the drive when i was in the parlour lord derwentwater slipped out of the room in a little he came back with a scared face the letter was handed to your steward he said the man i sent was a new servant else he would have known who the steward was but what was in the letter it was a message from harry st john enclosed in a letter which came to me it said the french king was dying and no help was to be expected from the regent who would follow him it said the rising was to be deferred then i understand i exclaimed starting to my feet i had promised rookley to restore the estate when the king came to his own so long as there was a chance of that he would let me go free but when that chance failed he might buy back blackladies by selling me ay said derwentwater that is jervas rookley from top to toe he would have one foot marking time with king george and the other stepping forward with king james and again he paced musingly about the room whilst i betook myself to my supper at last i know he said and then turning to me i was thinking whither i should send you there is old ralph curwen you will be safe with him at applegarth it seemed to me that i had heard the name before but on what occasion i could not at the moment remember he lives in ennerdale continued he an honest jack but he is old and since his son died has known little company beyond his books you will be safe with him ay but will he be safe with me i objected no doubt of that he has taken no part in these quarrels of ours for many a day and they will not look for you in ennerdale he sat down and wrote a letter i will send you thither he said with a servant i can trust and as soon as may be well get you out of england and he rose he crossed over to a table and unlocking a drawer took out a little diary let me see he said today is st bartholomews day it may be that i can send you across to france why what ails you it is nothing i replied hastily it was indeed the mere mention of the date which made me sway like a man falling and grasp at the table today was st bartholomews day then yesterday was the eve the eve of st bartholomew my thoughts went back to the preacher i had heard in paris and to the picture of the dead man speaking who had seemed in my imagination to thunder out at me the eve of st bartholomew lord derwentwater went from the room to give his orders and ten minutes later i was being rowed across the lake towards silver hill and watching two heads at the lighted window diminish into specks there was but the one man in the boat besides myself lord derwentwaters servant tash accordingly on disembarking in a little wood on the west shores of derwentwater we drew the boat on to dry ground and striking up the hillside walked southwards along the slopes of catbells and maiden moor but for my part i took little note of our direction my head nodded on my shoulders my feet stumbled behind my guides in a mechanic progression had he led me back into keswick town i should have followed him i walked in a daze of weariness sensible of but two things in the world one that the fresh smell of the grass and parsleyfern was every way as sweet as lavender to lie in the other that i must still walk on since there was something to be done that i and i alone could do in the morning we moved yet higher up the slopes and so walking ever southwards past dale head tarn and honister came to a lofty ridge between grey knotts and brandreth about nine oclock of the morning there my guide called a halt and pulling my hat over my eyes i plumped down on the grass and slept without more ado chapter xi applegarth when i fell asleep the sun was just climbing above the shoulder of skiddaw when i waked again it was down very close above the isle of man so that i could see the surf flash in a line of gold as it broke against the rocks tash had brought with him some cheese and a loaf of bread and being hard set with my long fast i spent no great while over grace but fell to and moistened the food with the sweetest water that ever i drank fetching it from a little stream which bubbled by through the grass a few yards away tash pointed me out a valley which cleft the mountains westwards a little to our left and made a right angle with the ridge on which we lay at the end of the valley i saw the corner of a lake the valley he told me was called gillerthwaite and the lake ennerdale water mr curwens house was built upon the banks of the water but was invisible to us since it lay in a kind of bay to the north behind some projecting cliffs of a reddish stone but we will wait here till nightfall he said and nothing loth i turned over on my back and fell to resolving so well as i could the perplexities in which i was coiled i now saw very clearly that rookleys plot had not as i had imagined been aimed against myself but rather against anthony herbert and my new knowledge that my worthy cousin was a government spy gave me some light to conjecture of a cause for i reflected that herbert had come suddenly to keswick at the very time when rebellion was abrewing in these parts that he had made lord derwentwaters acquaintance and had painted his ladys portrait that upon my coming to blackladies lord derwentwater had put me into relations with the man and that i too had commissioned a portrait of him now lord derwentwater was suspected of favouring the stuart claims and certainly rookley knew that i not merely favoured them but was working to further them it would be then a natural suspicion for rookley to draw that we were all three implicated in the same business and that herbert was merely using his skill as a concealment of his genuine purpose moreover i thought of a sudden there was that medal in mr herberts apartment true i had seen him lock it up but he must bring it out again to copy it and he was not of that orderliness which would ensure his replacing it what if rookley had seen the medal in herberts lodging joined to his suspicions that one certain fact would change those suspicions to convictions rookley would believe and would have reason to believe that herbert was a jacobite agent granted that presumption and rookleys conduct became clear he was marking time with king george and stepping forward with king james he would lay herbert by the heels in the one interest and leave me untouched in the other so long as it was doubtful which way the wind was setting i found an additional reason to credit this hypothesis in this that it was plainly rookleys intention to bring about herberts arrest secretly or at all events without my knowledge i had thought to find you in the garden herbert had said the words came back to me in a flash i sprang to my feet in some excitement tash in a flurry asked me what it was i saw but i moved away without answering him certain that i had a hold upon the key of the plot fearful lest i should lose it i had thought to find you in the garden and the soldiers were in the garden moreover there was but one man who could have led mr herbert to believe that he would find us in the garden jervas rookley and jervas rookley had every reason in the world to feel assured that neither mrs herbert nor myself would be discovered there i had no longer a shadow of doubt anthony herbert had been beguiled to blackladies that his arrest might be brought about with secrecy only jervas rookley had made one mistake he had presumed in his victim the same cunning and concealment of which he was master himself mr herbert had defeated the secrecy of the plan by his outburst in his lodging but for that outburst the arrest would have been effected with all the secrecy which rookley desired from that point in my speculations i went forward to a resolve i knew herbert to be in no way concerned with our plans and hopes indeed i doubted whether he cared a straw which king occupied the throne so long as he could continue in the exercise of his art but on the other hand there was the medal in his possession and i distrusted the impartiality of justice in a matter where passions were so inflamed my resolve then was no more than this that if by any means a man could i would secure mr herberts enlargement if only as an act of reparation and if it cost me my life but to tell the truth my life at this moment had not the least savour of sweetness and to let it go seemed the easiest thing in the world the question however which weighed on me was how i should accomplish his enlargement for i did not know and had no means of knowing whither he had been taken they might have carried him to london there to be examined suppose that was true and i went down into the valley and gave myself up why i had not sufficient trust in the authorities to be certain that herbert would get the benefit of my evidence i could prove that the medal belonged to me but should i be allowed to tender that proof on herberts behalf i might lie in prison the while he was brought to his trial no before i gave myself up i must know whither anthony herbert had been taken and as far as i could tell there was but one man who could give me the information could i force it from jervas rookley i asked myself and even in the asking laughed for here was the darkness coming up out of the sea and wrapping the mountains about and here was i hiding in the midst of them a hunted outlaw tash called to me that it was time for us to set out and we started down the hillside into gillerthwaite he leading as before i as before following him but no longer in the daze and stupor of yesternight rather on the contrary i walked with eyes needlessly alert and with feet overtimorous and careful for if i got no other profit from my reflections i had drawn from them this one conviction and i was sensible of it as of a sheer necessity i must be ready i thought since i knew so little i must be ready to seize any occasion of mr herberts enlargement at the instant of its discovery so that as we scrambled down the slope with the mist gathering around us i came to fear a slip with an extraordinary apprehension where the grass steepened i straightway imagined a fatal precipice and when a stone slid beneath my heel i felt all the blood drain from my heart and leave me shaking in a panic the night in consequence had completely fallen by the time we came to a ponytrack in the bed of the valley i remember that i asked carelessly whither it led from ennerdale and tash told me that it passed into the valley called newlands which runs parallel with derwentwater and is only separated from the lake by that line of hills along which we had walked during the night then said i carelessly it is a path by which one may travel to keswick ay he replied and for the moment i thought no more of the matter before we had come to the head of ennerdale water the moon was up and shining fitfully through a wrack of clouds the valley however was clear of mist so that i was able to distinguish the house of applegarth while i was as yet at some distance from its doors it was a long plain building which promised comfort within by its very lack of ornamentation without built in a single story and painted a white colour but it seemed to me even in that uncertain light to bear the marks of neglect and decay there was a little garden in front of the house separated from the lakeshores by an unkempt hedge and planted only with a few fuchsia bushes the walls of the house were here and there discoloured and once or twice as i passed up the gardenpath i stepped upon a broken tile a womanservant opened the door and i asked for mr curwen she looked me over for a second and what may be your business with mr curwen that i can hardly tell you said i with a laugh ah but you must said she she was a woman of some bulk and she stood with her arms akimbo filling the doorway is it his last few guineas you might be wanting she asked with a slow sarcasm why goodwife i answered impatiently do you look for gentlemen of the road in ennerdale goodwife she said with a toss of the head goodwife to a ninnyhammer and she looked me over again indeed i doubt not but we cut sufficiently disreputable figures not i and youll just tell me your business there are others besides gentlemen of the road who put their fingers into pockets which dont belong to them hold your noise mary tyson said tash behind my shoulder do you know me oh said she with a start its william tash from thatll do he broke in no need to speak names show the gentleman to mr curwen mary tyson stood aside from the door i stepped into the hall youll find him in the room she said with a curt nod towards a door facing me i crossed to it and rapped on the panels but got no answer whatsoever it is true i could hear a voice within but the voice seemed to be declaiming a speech i rapped again oh the dainty knuckles cried mary and pushing roughly past me she banged upon the door with a great fist like a ham and threw it open without further ceremony the voice ceased from its declamation i entered the room it was very dark being panelled all about with bookcases and the ceiling very low a single lamp glimmered on a table in the centre of the carpet an old gentleman rose from before a great folio spread out upon the table what is it mary he asked in a tone of gentle annoyance you interrupt me a visitor he says replied mary though the hostility of her eyes and a great heave of her shoulders filled up the gap a visitor said the old gentleman his voice changing on the instant to an eager politeness a visitor is always welcome at applegarth at whatever hour he comes i heard not so much a sigh as a snort behind me and the door was slammed the old gentleman advanced a few steps towards me and then came to a sudden stop i was neither hurt nor surprised at his evident disappointment and perplexity for marys behaviour had shown me pretty clearly what sort of a picture i made it is not a visitor mr curwen said i but a fugitive and i handed to him lord derwentwaters letter indeed said he all his suavity rekindling a fugitive and he spoke as though to be a fugitive was a very fine and enviable thing you will take a chair mr clavering i added of blackladies he inquired of blackladies said i you are very welcome mr clavering said he and he broke open the seal and read the letter through with many interruptions of shield us and to be sure and with many a glance over his spectacles at me he was a tall man though his shoulders stooped as if he spent many an evening over his folio and i should say of sixty years and more he wore his own white hair which was very long and fine making a silver frame to as beautiful a face except one as it has ever been my lot to see the features it may be were overdelicately chiselled the cheeks too bloodless the eyes too large if you looked for a man of dominating activity it was the face of a dreamer no doubt but there would be nothing ignoble in the dreams you are yet more welcome mr clavering said he as he folded up the letter shelter indeed you shall have and such comfort as we can add thereto for so long as you will be pleased to stay with us nay said he checking me i know what you would say but we are solitary people here and the debt will be with us that can hardly be said i since i bring danger to you by my presence some while ago he replied i would not have denied it though i should have welcomed you no less but since my fortunes have declined and i have grown into years i have taken little part in politics and keep much within my doors they will not come here i think to look for you it is a consolation for my poverty said he with the simplest dignity that i can therefore offer you a safer harbourage but indeed it is with you that the times have gone hard we are not so solitary but that now and again a scrap of news will float to us and we have heard of you you were much at one time in paris and his voice of a sudden took on a pleasant eagerness yes i replied though i saw little of the town ah said he with a nod of the head to gain and lose blackladies in so short a space it is a hard case mr clavering in the hurry and stress of these last two days i had given no thought to what the loss blackladies meant but the meaning rushed in upon me winged with his words ay i answered and my voice trembled as i spoke so that the old man came over to me and laid a hand upon my shoulder for it is the king who loses it and through my folly for i might have known i felt his hand patting me with a helpless consolation so we all say after the event it is a hard thing to bear but philosophy will help us you must study philosophy while you are here mr clavering i have books and he glanced round the room and then came to an abrupt pause i have books he repeated in a lame fashion which you may find profit in studying and as he spoke the music of a song quivered up from the next room like a bird on the wing i understood that we which had much perplexed me in his talk i remembered where and when i had heard of applegarth before you may talk if you will of cuzzoni and faustina and the rest of the italian women who have filled heideggers pockets doubtless they made more noise but not one of them ill be sworn had a tenth of the sweetness and purity of the voice which sang this song give to a lark a human soul and then maybe you will hear it for it was more than a voice that sang it was as though the wings of a soul beat and throbbed in the singers throat i lack words to describe the effect it wrought on me all the shame i had been sensible of during the long hours since that pistol rang out in the garden of blackladies came back to me massed within the compass of a second and on that shame more and ever more i know that i buried my face in my hands to hide the anguish of my spirit from mr curwen and sitting there with my fingers pressed upon my eyes i listened the words came clearly to my ears through the doorway behind my chair the voice carried my thoughts back to paris was the crystal wherein i saw pitilessly plain all the dreams i had fashioned of what i would do had i but liberty and the power to do it then carried me again to england and showed me the miserable contrast between those airy dreams and the solid truth i saw myself now riding to lorraine now lingering in mr herberts apartment and the words of that song pointed my remorse how bitterly even now after this interval of thirtyfive years the humiliation and pain i endured return to me with so poignant a force that i can hardly bring myself to write of them i could not indeed at all but for this faded yellow sheet of paper which i take up in my hands it was given to me upon an occasion notable within my memory and the words of this very song are inscribed upon it blurred and wellnigh indecipherable but i do not need the writing to help me to remember them the song was called the honest lover and i set it down here since here it was that i first heard it the honest lover would any doubting maid discover whats he that is a worthy lover his is no fine fantastic breath but lowly mien and steadfast faith for he that so would move her by simple art and humble heart why hes the honest lover his is a heart that never played the lightolove to wife or maid but reverenced all womankind before he found one to his mind for he that so would move her by simple art and humble heart why hes the honest lover and if he quake to meet her eyes stammer and blush wheneer he tries his worshipd lady to address be sure shell love him none the less for he that so would move her by simple art and humble heart why hes the honest lover footnote the song is written by harold child esq to whom the author is indebted for it this was the song to which i listened as i sat the dishonest outlaw in the dark library of applegarth it is my daughter dorothy said mr curwen with a smile in talking of our youngest martyr i had forgotten her and he took a step towards the door but at his first movement the youngest martyr heaven save the mark had risen from his chair with a foolish abruptness nay mr curwen he cried in disorder and then he stopped for the truth is he shrank in very shame from standing face to face with the singer of that song but and i seized the first excuse i have this long while been wandering on the fells and am in no way fitted for the company of ladies your servant even would have no truck with me and i think you too were taken aback i looked down at my garments as i spoke my servant he began and he looked towards the other door through which i had entered with a timorous air as though he would fain see whether or no she was listening on the far side of it mary tyson he said lowering his voice is a strange and unaccountable person a good servant but and very wisely he tapped his forehead for myself he continued his voice softening with a great wistfulness it was something very different from the stains of your journey that gave me pause lord derwentwater may have told you that i had once a son he was much of your height and figure and the room is dim and old men are fanciful i bowed my head for whenever he made mention of his misfortunes he spoke with so brave and simple a dignity that any word of sympathy became the merest impertinence for a moment he stood looking down at me and revolving some question in his mind yes said he and more to himself than to me i will speak to her and give her the order why should i not he walked slowly halfway to the bell and stopped yes he repeated i will speak to her and with a word of excuse to me and a certain bracing of the shoulders he went out of the room i had no doubt that it was with mary tyson that he wished to speak i remained halfhoping halfafraid that the chords of the spinet would wake to the touch again and the voice again ring out sprinkling its melody through the room like so much perfume from a philtre but there was no recurrence of the music i walked idly to the table and my eyes fell upon that great tome in which mr curwen had been so absorbed at the moment of my interruption in wonderment i bent more closely over it i had expected to see some laborious monument of philosophy gemmed with unintelligible terms unintelligible terms there were in truth but not of the philosophers kind they were curious old terms of chivalry i remembered how mr curwen had hesitated over the mention of his books and i took the lamp from the table and glanced about the bookshelves the books were all of apiece with that great folio on the table romaunts and histories of crusades and suchlike matters i wondered whether don quixote de la mancha had found a place amongst them and with an impertinent smile i began to glance along the letterings in search of it but very soon i stopped and stood staring at a couple of volumes which faced me and bore upon their backs the title of the morte darthur i set the lamp again upon the table the old man was right i thought sadly there was in that room philosophy which it would indeed profit me to study mr curwen returned rubbing his long delicate hands one against the other in a flush of triumph i have given orders he said and with a gentle accent of conscious pride he repeated the phrase i have given orders mr clavering you will sleep in my boys room and since you are as i say very like to him in size but his voice trembled and he turned away and lifted the lamp from the table i will show you the room he said i followed him into the hall up the staircase and down a long passage to the very end of the house a door stood open mr curwen led me through it the room was warmly furnished and hung with curtains of a dark green while a newlylit fire was crackling in the hearth a couple of candles were burning on the mantelpiece and mary tyson was arranging the bed she took no notice of me whatever as i entered being busy with the bed as i thought you can go mary said mr curwen with a timid friendliness plainly intended to appease mary sniffed for an answer and as she turned to go i saw that she had been crying she was harrys nurse poor woman explained mr curwen you must forgive her mr clavering and then he died at malplaquet he crossed over to the bed and stood looking down at it silently in a very fixed attitude then he took up from it a white silk stocking i approached him and saw that a suit of white satin was neatly folded upon the white counterpane it is a fortunate thing he said with a smile all the more sad for its effort at cheerfulness that you and he are alike and he drew the stocking slowly through his fingers he died at malplaquet and marlborough the marlborough of malplaquet spoke to him as he died his voice broke on the words and laying the stocking down he turned towards a japan toilette with a even a father has no right to ask for more than that but harrys shoebuckles were laid upon the chintzcoverlid and he took them in his hands one after the other repeating he died at malplaquet i have given you this room he said for a reason see these two windows point down the valley and are set high above the ground but this and he crossed over to a smaller window set in the wall near the fireplace this looks on to the hillside and since the ground rises against the house a man may drop from it and come to no harm to the left are the stables or what serves us for stables we lock no doors at applegarth mr clavering fearing no robbers you will find a horse in the stables should there be need for you to flee it was some while after mr curwen had left me before i could make up my mind to don these clothes i might be like to what harry curwen was in size and figure but there the likeness ended and the sharpest contrast in the world set in i unfolded the suit and spread it out upon the bed the coat was of white velvet the waistcoat and breeches of white satin and all richly laced with an embroidery of silver a fragrant scent of lavender which breathed from the dress coupled with its freshness as of a suit worn but once or twice and so laid aside lent an added sadness to the thought of young harry curwen i imagined him stripping off these fine clothes in a fumbling excitement one night in this very room kicking from his feet those lacquered shoes these with their soles and redheels upturned now to the fire for the guest who was so like him i imagined him pulling on his boots and riding off from applegarth with i know not what martial visions in his eyes and hardly a glance maybe for the old man and the sister standing in the light of the porch to join his troop and perish on the plains of flanders well he had died at malplaquet and the great marlborough not the huckstering timeserver whom we knew the marlborough of malplaquet had spoken to him as he lay adying and no father had a right to look for more than that i picked up the stockings and drew them through my fingers as the father had done at that however i bethought me that the father and his daughter were awaiting me downstairs and so dressed in a hurry and combing out my peruke to such neatness as i could i got me down into the hall supper was already laid out in the diningroom and mr curwen waiting in a little i heard a light step upon the stair and the rustle of a dress instinctively i turned my face towards the windowcurtains my back to the door i heard the door open but i did not hear it shut again mr clavering said the old man i was forced to turn his daughter stood in the doorway her lips parted her eyes startled mr clavering my daughter dorothy i bowed to her she drew in her breath then advanced to me frankly and held out her hand my father told me you were like she said but since your back was turned i almost thought i saw him i took the hand by the fingertips he was very dear to you very miss curwen said i gravely i would with all my heart that you had seen him and that i had died in his place at malplaquet her face clouded for an instant and she drew her hand quickly away taking my speech no doubt for nothing more than an awkward and illtimed compliment but compliment it was not being indeed the truth and summary of my recent thoughts quickened into speech against my will she was of a slender figure with a rosebud face delicate as her fathers her hair was drawn simply back from a broad white forehead and in colour was nutbrown gleaming where it took the light as though powdered with golddust she was dressed in the simplest gown of white set off here and there with a warm ribbon but i took little note of her dress beyond remarking that no other could so well become her from the pure oval of her face her eyes big and grey looked out at me each like a quiet pool with a lanthorn lighted somewhere in its depths and she seemed to me her voice incarnate she was unlike to her father in the proportion of her height for she was not tall and like to him again in a certain wilfulness which the set of her lips betokened and again unlike in the masterful firmness of her rounded chin so that she could put off and on with the quickest change of humours the gravity of a woman and the sunny petulance of a child it is our homely fashion said mr curwen to wait upon ourselves and we sat down to the table it was a fashion however which the guest much to his discomfort was not that night allowed to follow for father and daughter alike joined to show him courtesy the daughter would have waited on me even as lady derwentwater had done and began like her to fill my glass but this time i could not permit it madam i cried hoarsely you must not your kindness hurts me hurts you she asked and from her tone i knew it was she who was hurt you do not know if you did your kindness would turn to the bitterest contempt i spoke without thought and barely with knowledge of what i said but in a passion of selfreproach mr clavering she replied very gently you are overwrought and i do not wonder else would you know that it must honour any woman to serve any man who has so served his king i dropped my head into my hands my very soul rose against this praise if i had served my king i exclaimed in a despairing remorse i should have been in france this many a week back france repeated mr curwen suddenly looking up you take the delay too much to heart for it need be nothing more than a delay and a brief one besides he spoke with some significance in his tone lord derwentwater mentioned in his letter that he would discover a means to set you across in france but perhaps and his voice became almost sly perhaps we may find a more expeditious way he checked himself abruptly like one that has said too much and shot a timid glance towards his daughter i noticed that her face grew a trifle grave but she did not explain or comment on his words and mr curwen diverted his talk to indifferent topics i fear me that i must have proved the dullest auditor for i gave little heed to what he said my thoughts being occupied in a quite other fashion for since his daughter sat over against me at the table since each time that i lifted my eyes they must needs encounter hers since each time that she spoke the mere sound of her voice was as a stern rebuke i fell from depth to depth of shame and humiliation i was sheltering there under the same roof with her to all seeming an honourable refugee in very truth an impostor and bound moreover to continue in his imposition the very clothes which i was wearing forced the truth upon me i had indeed but one thought wherewith to comfort me and though the comfort was of the coldest i yet clung to it as my only solace the thought was this that i had already determined at whatsoever cost to me whether of liberty or life to repair so far as a man could the consequence of my misdoing it was not that i took any credit from the resolve i was not thank god so far fallen as that but what comforted me was that i had come to the resolve up there on the hillside between brandreth and grey knotts before i had descended into ennerdale before i had set foot within applegarth before in a word i had heard dorothy curwen sing or looked into her eyes i did not explain to myself the comfort which the thought gave me i was merely sensible of it it was before i said to myself and over and over again i gladly repeated the thought however a word which mr curwen spoke finally aroused my attention for he made mention of the garden of blackladies i suppose that i must by some movement have shown my distaste for the subject and you do not admire it he said it is very quaint and ingenious no doubt i replied but the ingenuity seems misplaced there miss curwen nodded it is like a fine french ribbon on a homespun gown said she i remembered on the instant something which lord derwentwater had said to me concerning dorothy curwen you know blackladies i inquired and perhaps with some anxiety very well said she with a smile of amusement so i thought said i yes she continued my father was very familiar with sir john rookley and her eyes rested quietly upon mine a hard man people said mr clavering interrupted mr curwen but a just man and to my liking if he was hard god knows he had enough in jervas to make him so i glanced at the daughter she was regarding the beams which roofed the room with supreme unconsciousness but the very moment that i looked at her she dropped her eyes to the level of mine you lack something mr clavering said she with great politeness indeed said my host rising from his chair in the excess of his hospitality indeed sir no i beg of you i replied in confusion and dorothy curwen laughed a strange man was jervas rookley continued mr curwen and there could be no doubt whatever about the sincerity of his unconsciousness he came warped from his cradle but you will have heard of him i doubt not more than we know though at one time he honoured us not infrequently with his company but that was before i knew of his transgression in the matter of the wadmines oh said i i thought that that was not generally known nor is it replied mr curwen i had the story from sir johns lips he was a very just man and since jervas came to visit me frequently he thought that i ought to know again my eyes went to the daughters face but this time she was already looking at me i am sure mr clavering that you need something said she very anxiously indeed no i replied in confusion and she smiled with the pleasantest air of contentment in the world mr curwen did not on this occasion rise to satisfy my imaginary needs but remained absorbed in thought i suppose he said dreamily that jervas rookley was a fairys changeling i started at the words they were not spoken in jest i looked at him he was seriously revolving the question in his mind what do you think he asked of me his daughter bent forwards across the table with something of appeal in her eyes the theory said i would most easily explain him and the appeal in her eyes changed to gratitude this was not the only strange remark he made to me that night for he accompanied me up to my bedroom and closed the door carefully behind him by this time you should have been in france he asked lowering his voice yes said i doubtfully for since his most christian majesty was at deaths door and all thought of a rising abandoned for the moment there was no longer any call for me to hurry to lorraine with the information i had gathered while on the other hand there was the greatest need that i should remain in england since once out of england i was powerless even to attempt anything towards anthony herberts liberation i spoke at supper he continued in a yet more secret voice of a more expeditious way than lord derwentwaters he glanced around him and came nearer to me it was no idle boast he said with a little chuckle but i have a ship and he nodded in a sort of childish guilefulness i have a ship he went tiptoeing to the door as though already he had stayed too long snugs the word he whispered with a finger on his lip and in the sweetest tone of encouragement again i have a ship and so he went gently from the room and descended the stairs his manner no less than his words somewhat bewildered me i thought it in truth a very unlikely thing that he should possess a ship seeing that he had made no concealment of his poverty and that if indeed he did his ship would be a very unlikely thing for a man to put to sea in but in this i made a great mistake since his ship not merely existed but had a very considerable share in the issue from those misfortunes which were so soon to befall us at the time however i was not greatly troubled with the matter one way or the other for while mr curwen had been speaking i had been standing at the open window the slope of the hillside was in front of me a corner of the stableroof was just visible to my left but most clearly of all i saw as in a vision the picture of a woman seated in a lonely lodging at keswick with a crumpled paper spread before her whereon was scribbled one single line he is not dead i shall not be particular to account for the reason why that vision should now of a sudden stand fixed within my sight though i could give a very definite opinion concerning it i will only state that it was there so vivid and distinct that i could read the paper she so sadly fingered and reading it the one line written thereon called on me for a supplement and explanation i opened the door and hurried quietly along the passage i heard mr curwens step in the hall below and holding my candle in my hand leaned over the balusters mr curwen i said in a breathless whisper you told me of a horse which stood ready in your stables should my safety call for it yes said he looking up at me there is the greatest need in the world that i should make use of your kindness this night it is a need that imperils my safety but my honour is concerned or rather that poor remnant of my honour which i have left to me when i fled from blackladies there remained something to be done and to be done by me and it remains undone some small part of the omission i may haply repair tonight he answered me as i knew he would with the strangeness gone from his manner and replaced with a kindly gravity he was the truest of gentlemen with all a gentlemans simple code of faith mr clavering he said so long as you are my guest i am the trustee of your safety but there are things of greater value than a mans safety of which you have mentioned one i shall look to seeing you in the morning he asked no questions that word honour was enough for him it stamped my purpose in his eyes with a holy seal he came up the stairs towards me and shook me by the hand and so passed on to his own chamber chapter xii i return to keswick i went back to my own room changed my dress and carrying my boots in one hand and my candle in the other went softly down the stairs by the clock in the hall i could see that it was five minutes after ten oclock i drew on my boots in the porch saddled the horse by the candlelight led it past the house along a strip of grass and when i thought the sound of its hoofs would be no longer heard i mounted and rode up the pathway the sky was cloudy but the valleys clear of mist i could have wished for no better night for my purpose except in one respect i mean that now and again a silver brilliancy would be diffused through the air making the night vaguely luminous and looking up i would see a patch of cloud very thin and very bright and behind that cloud i knew the moon was sailing i chose that road of which tash had spoken towards the head of gillerthwaite the track turned northwards over a pass they call the scarf gap and thence westwards again past buttermere lake to buttermere village at the point where the hill descends steeply from the lake i dismounted i could see the scattered village beneath me it slept without a sound nor was there a light to be seen in any window but none the less i dreaded to ride through it its very quietude frightened me i feared the lively echoes which the beat of my horses shoes would send ringing about the silent cottages i descended therefore on foot leading my horse cautiously by the bridle and in a little i came to a gateway upon the right which gave on to a field i crossed the field and several others which adjoined it and finally came out again upon the track beyond the village where it climbs upwards to buttermere hause from the farther side of the hause i had a clear road of six miles down newlands valley to portinscale and i spurred my horse to a gallop once or twice the clouds rifted and the moon shone out full so that i rode in a tremor of alarm twisting every shadow that fell across my path from rock or tree into the shadow of a sentinel but the clouds closed up again and canopied me in a gracious obscurity as i drew near to keswick i tied up my horse in a thicket of trees half a mile from the town and slunk from house to house in the shadow never before or since have i known such fear as i knew that night in keswick so urgent had the necessity that i must keep free become with me during these last hours since i had climbed from brandreth down to applegarth if the wind drove the leaves of the trees fluttering up the roadway i cowered against the wall and trembled if a dog barked from a farmhouse in the distance i stood with my heart fainting in my breast listening listening for the rhythmic tread of soldiers and when i saw on the opposite side of the street some yards above me a light glimmering in a window i stopped altogether in two minds whether or no to turn back i looked irresolutely up and down the street it was so dark so still only that one steady light burned in a window the melancholy voice of a watchman a couple of streets away chanted out halfpast twelve and a dull cloudy morning the phrase was repeated and repeated in a dwindling tone i waited until it had died away and afterwards but the light burned wakeful persistent a little heart of fire in a body of darkness i felt that i dared not pass it some one watched beside that lamp with eyes fixed on the yellow path it traced across the road my fears fed upon themselves and swelled into a panic i turned and took a step or two down the hill and it was precisely that movement which brought me to my senses and revealed to me the cowardice of the action for if i dared not pass that lamp still less dared i return to applegarth with the nights work undone i retraced my steps very slowly until i came opposite to the window and then so great was the revulsion of my feeling that i reeled back against the wall my heart jerking my whole strength gone from me for there at the window beside the lamp her face buried in her hands was the woman i had come to seek i might have known i thought for who else should be watching at this lone hour in keswick if not this woman i might have guessed from the position of the house in the street it was a beacon which i had seen this glimmering lamp and i had taken it for no more than a wreckers light i looked about me the street was deserted from end to end i crossed it and picking up a pebble flung it lightly at the window the pebble cracked against the pane how loudly to my impatient ears mrs herbert raised her head from her hands i sent a second pebble to follow the first she opened the sash but so noisily i thought who is it she asked hush said i she leaned forward over the side of the window and peered into the darkness you she whispered in a tone of wonderment and again with a shiver of repulsion you let me in said i she made a movement as if to close the window you close the window on your hopes i said let me in you bring news of of anthony she asked with a catch in her voice the smallest budget said i but a promise of more and as she undecided still leaned on the sill if i am captured here tonight there will be no news at all captured she began and breaking off hurriedly came down the stairs and opened the door i followed her up into the room and drew the curtains across the window she stood by the table in the full light of the lamp her eyelids red her eyes lustreless her face worn the very gloss seemed to have faded off her hair how you have suffered i said and again faltered the words how you have suffered and you she asked with a glance towards me and nodded her head as though answering the question i said that payment would be made she remarked simply it is beginning my servant brought a note to you yes was it true i did not believe that it was true she spoke in a dull voice he came yesterday night after the soldiers had been here the soldiers i cried lifting my voice the sound of it warned me i realized that i was standing between the lamp and the window and that if any one should pass down the street it was my figure which would be seen i crossed over to get behind the chair do you sit there said i pointing to her former seat she obeyed me like a child so the soldiers came here twice when the first time that evening i was not here we were in the garden of blackladies they searched the house and took his papers away his papers said i i looked over to that box in which the medal had been locked the lid was shut i crossed to it and tried it the lid lifted the lock was broken and the medal gone the second time they came said mrs herbert was the afternoon of the next day that would be a few hours after i had escaped they searched the house again yes for you for me i exclaimed and her eyes flashed out at me for whom else should they come to search here in my lodging my eyes fell from her face but did they question you i continued what did they ask for perchance i may find help in that but mrs herbert had relapsed into her dull insensibility they questioned me without end she answered wearily but i forget the questions it was all concerning you not a word about anthony and i forget oh but think i exclaimed and i heard the watchman crying the hour in the distance i stopped listening the cry grew louder the man was coming down the street this window alone was lighted up and once already the soldiers had been here to search for me i heard the watchmans footsteps grow separate and distinct i heard the rattle of his lantern as it swung in his hand and beneath the window he stopped i counted the seconds in a little i found myself choking and realized that in the greatness of my anxiety i was holding my breath then the man moved but it seemed to me not down the road but nearer to the wall of the house a new fear burst in on me you left the door below unlocked i whispered to mrs herbert she nodded a reply what if he opened that door and came stumbling up the stairs what if he found the door not merely unlocked but open and roused the house to be sure he would have no warrant in his pocket but for her sake for the sake of that tiny chance i clung to with so despairing a grip that perhaps perhaps i might restore to her her husband no rumour must go out that i or any man had been there this night i crept to the door of the room and laid my hand upon the handle what i should do i did not think i was trying to remember whether i had closed the door behind me and all my faculties were engrossed in the effort i was still busy upon that profitless task when i heard with what relief the watchmans footsteps sound again upon the stones his voice again take up its melancholy cry quick said i turning again to mrs herbert madam help me in this matter if you can think the officer put to you questions concerning me oh she cried waking from her lethargy i cannot help you you must save yourself as best you may i do not remember what they said it was of you they spoke and not at all of anthony it is just for your husbands sake i said that i implore you to remember and she looked at me blankly god i exclaimed taking the thought you believe that i journeyed hither to you in your loneliness at this hour to plague you with questions for my safetys sake and i paused staring at her well she replied in an even voice is the belief so strange there was no sarcasm in the question and hardly any curiosity it was the mere natural utterance of a natural thought my eyes i know fell from her face to the floor madam i replied slowly when i set out tonight i thought that the cup of my humiliation was already full you prove to me that my thought was wrong it remained for you very fitly to fill it to the brim and again i lifted my eyes to her i had no purposes of my own to serve in riding hither i know the charge against myself to its last letter it is the charge against your husband brings me here neither do i know whither he has been taken yet these two things i must know and i came to you on the chance that you might help me i saw her face change as she listened she leaned forward on her elbows her chin propped upon her hands her eyes losing their indifference a spark of hope kindled in the depths of them and when i had ended she remained silent for a little as though fearing to quench that spark by the utterance of any words at last she asked in almost a timid voice but why why would you know and she bent still further forward with parted lips breathless for the answer why i answered forgive me i should have told you that before but like a fool i put the questions first they are foremost in my thoughts you see being the means and as yet unsolved the end is so clear to me that i forgot it in looking for the road which leads to it i believe that mr herbert has been seized on the ground that he shares my treason let us call it for so our judges will of that charge i know him innocent and maybe can prove him so and if i can be sure of this i will but how can you she interrupted if i know the charge if i know whither he has been taken the place of his trial then it may be that i can serve him but until i know i am like one striking at random in the dark suppose i go to meet the sheriff and give myself up not knowing these things i shall be laid by the heels and no good done they may have taken him to london he may be in prison for months meanwhile i should be tried and they would not need mr herberts evidence to secure a verdict against me you would give yourself up she asked but i must know the place i must know the charge it would avail your husband little without that knowledge they would keep me in prison cozening me with excuses however urgently i might plead for him it is enough that a man should be suspected of favouring king james to such they dispense convictions they make no pother about justice but said she it would mean your life have you not said yourself that payment must be made yes but by us she said stretching out a hand eagerly not by you alone madam said i you will have your share in it for you will have to wait to wait here with such patience as you can command ignorant of the issue until the issue is reached god knows but i think you have the harder part of it we stood for a little looking into each others eyes sealing our compact now i continued think was any word said which we could shape into a clue was any name mentioned was your husbands name linked with mine oh think and quickly she sat with her face covered by her hands while i stood anxiously before her i do not remember she said drawing her hands apart and shaking them in a helpless gesture it all happened so long ago it happened only yesterday i urged i know i know she said with the utmost weariness all that light of hope had died from her eyes as quickly as it had brightened them but i measure by a calendar of pain it is so long ago i do not remember i do not even remember how i returned here there was no hint plainly to be gained from her and i had stayed too long as it was i took up my hat you will stay here i asked i do not say that you will hear from me soon but i must needs know where you are i will stay here she replied she almost stretched out her hand and drew it in again goodbye i went to the door she followed me with the lamp and held it over the balusters of the landing nay said i there is no need for that the staircase said she is very dark as i came out from the houses at the bottom of the hill i heard again the watchmans voice behind me bawling out the hour it was halfpast one and a cloudy morning it may be but the clouds were lighter in the north as i remarked with some anxiety i was still riding along newlands valley when the morning began to break as i reached the summit of buttermere hause i looked backwards over my shoulder the sky in the northeast was a fiery glow saffron orange and red were mingled there and right across the medley of colours lay black angry strips of cloud the blaze of a fire it seemed to me seen through prison bars it was daylight when i passed by buttermere sunlight as i rode down gillerthwaite the sweet stillness of the morning renewed my blood the bracken bloomed upon the hillsides here a rusty brown there in the shadow a blackish purple and then again gold where the sunlight kissed it below me by the waters side i could see the blue tiles of applegarth and as i looked about me the fever of my thoughts died they took a new and unfamiliar quietude from the stable quietude of the hills i felt as if something of their patience something of their strength was entering into me my memories went back again to the superiors study in the college at paris and in my heart of hearts i knew that the superior was wrong the mountains have their message i think for whoso will lend an ear to them and that morning they seemed to speak to me with an unanimous voice i can repair i thought this wrong it was then more to me than a thought it seemed indeed an assured and simple truth assured and simple like those peaks in the clear air and like them pointing skywards and the superiors theory no more substantial than a cloud which may gather upon the peaks and hide them for a little from the eyes i rode down therefore in a calmer spirit than i had known for some long time the difficulties which beset my path did not for the moment trouble me that my journey that night had in no way lightened them i did not consider i felt that the occasion of which i was in search would of a surety come only i must be ready to grasp it i had passed no one on the road i had seen indeed no sign of life at all beyond the sudden rush of a flock of sheep as though in an unaccountable panic up the hillside of the pillar mountain while i was as yet in the narrow path of gillerthwaite i had reason therefore to think that i had escaped all notice and leading the horse back to the stable with the same precautions i had used on setting out i let myself in at the door and got quietly to bed chapter xiii dorothy curwen i was at the breakfasttable you may be sure that morning no later than my host and his daughter mr curwen greeted me with an evident relief but neither then nor afterwards did he ever refer to the journey i had taken during the night on the contrary his talk was all of paris and france plying me with many questions concerning the french generals the duc de vendme marchal villars the duc de noailles and the rest which i was at some loss to answer often and often would he return to that subject with something of a boyish zest and enthusiasm he had never been in france he informed me yet would tell me many stories concerning the court and the magnificence of versailles and the great huntingparties at meudon when monsieur was alive with so much detail that but for a certain extravagance as of one whose curiosity through much feeding upon itself has grown fantastic i could not but have believed that he had himself been present at their enactment and then he would light his pipe and look across this quiet ennerdale water to the rugged slopes beyond with a sigh and so get him back to his romances he was no less curious concerning lorraine and the little court at barleduc and when i told him that i had myself had speech with the king his enthusiasm rose to excitement oh he cried starting up you have seen him you have heard his voice speaking to you as you hear mine now and all at once i acquired a new honour in his eyes mr clavering you have something to compensate you for your outlawry yes i replied he spoke to me and with the sweetest kindliness and the king was hopeful was positive in his hopes very that is right he continued walking about the room and smiling to himself that is right so a strong man should be and so weak men are said i rather sadly for i recalled all that lord bolingbroke had told me mr clavering said the old gentleman suddenly pausing in his walk you are the last man who should say that you have lost all that a man holds dear and are you not hopeful i bowed my head to the rebuke it was indeed welltimed and just though for a very different reason than that which had inspired mr curwen to utter it i was so said i humbly so lately as this morning nay and i rose to my feet i am so still besides i continued reverting to the king he has lord bolingbroke to help him and i set great store on that bolingbroke cried mr curwen and seldom have i seen a mans face change so suddenly a flame of anger kindled in his eyes and blazed across his face shrivelling all the gentleness which made its home there bolingbroke he cried wildly a knave a debauched villainous knave god help the man be he king or serf that takes his counsel look you mr clavering a very dishonest treacherous knave and he wagged his head at me i was astonished at the outburst since the jacobites were wont to look with some deference towards lord bolingbroke he is my kinsman i said meekly and a very good friend to me and while mr curwen was still humming and hawing in some confusion his daughter came into the room and gazing at his troubled face with some anxiety put an end to the talk this was by no means however the last i was to hear of the matter and in truth lord bolingbroke through merely arousing mr curwens indignation was to prove a much better friend to me than ever i had looked for for when we were again alone together i regret the words i spoke to you he said a little stiffly and with considerable effort in the apology i did not know lord bolingbroke was your kinsman and then in a rush of sincerity but far more than the words i regret your relationship with the man i began to make such defence of my kinsman as i could pointing to his industry and declaring how his services had always been thwarted by his colleagues while he was in power and what of the catalans he asked now i knew very little about the catalans well what of the catalans i asked doubtfully why this he returned we instigated them to war we made them our allies against philip of spain by the promise of restoring them their ancient liberties they fought with us spilled their blood on the strength of that promise and then lord bolingbroke patches up his peace of utrecht and not a word in it from end to end about their liberties they continue the war alone and he finds nothing better to do than to sneer at their obstinacy they still continue and he is ready to send an english fleet to help in their destruction his voice increased in vehemence with every word he spoke so that i feared each moment another outburst against my kinsman it may be that he feared it too for he checked himself with some abruptness and it was his daughter who revived the subject later on during that same day it was after dinner i had taken a book with me and climbed up to the orchard behind the house but little i read in the book the sun had set behind the hills but the brightness of that morning lingered on my thoughts i was as mr curwen had said hopeful though with no great reason and being besides weary with the fatigue i had undergone fell into a restful state between sleep and waking with halfclosed eyes i saw dorothy curwen come from the back of the house and talk for a little with mary tyson then she mounted towards the orchard i watched her marked the lightness of her step the supple carriage of her figure the delicate poise of her head and then rose from the grass and went forward to meet her mr clavering she began very decidedly and paused in some difficulty then she stamped her foot with a little imperious movement you talk too much of france and paris and the great world to my father you will not do so any more she spoke with the prettiest air of command imaginable the while she looked up at me and it was the air i smiled at not the command no she said i mean it you will not do so any more and she coloured a little and spoke with a yet stronger emphasis madam said i with a bow since you wish it i do wish it mr clavering she interrupted me i did not think i began no says she you are young and imprudent i have noticed that already and with great stateliness and dignity she walked for ten yards down the hillside then she began to hum a tune and laughed as though mightily pleased with herself and her stately walk changed to a dance a few yards further on she sat down in the bracken with her back towards me and began plucking at the grasses i remained where she had left me quite content to watch from that distance the coils of hair nestling about her head and to hearken to the rippling music of her song but after a little she turned her head with a glance across her shoulder towards me and so back again very quickly i went down to her the lecture is not ended said i gravely she gave a start and looked at me as though my presence there was the last thing she expected or indeed wished for then in an instant her whole manner changed i will tell you the truth of it she said something you will perhaps have guessed already the rest you would discover did not i tell you i sat down by her side and she continued choosing her words my father is not altogether strong and these stories do no good then she stopped it is more difficult to tell you than i thought there is no need said i that you should say another word thank you said she very gratefully and for a little we were silent has he spoken to you of a ship she asked slowly and i started ah he thinks it is a secret from us but we know for he sold the land not so long ago wherewith to buy it he is the noblest man in the world she continued hurriedly the thought of any one suffering touches him to the quick the thought of oppression kindles him to anger and he will do his part and more than his part in relieving the one and fighting against the other so that unless mary and i did what we could he would not possess today so much as a farthing i understand said i marys welcome to me yesterday she looked at me with a smile yes said she but your looks warranted her the ship was to be fitted out to help the catalans it lies at whitehaven now he was there but a few days ago he spoke of it to me said i with some hint that he might put me across to france but you will not go she said turning to me quickly any day the country may rise and every arm will be needed i mean every young arm i shook my head the french king is dying maybe is dead and without his help will the country rise besides so long as i stay here i endanger you i spoke reluctantly enough for though i had no intention whatever to seek a refuge in france i felt that if once mr curwen definitely promised to send me thither i could not remain at applegarth at however small a risk to him and his i must needs accept the offer and betake me again to the hillside in which case there was little probability that i should be able to effect anything towards anthony herberts enlargement before i was captured myself there is no danger to us she said for some while since we persuaded my father to take no active share in the plans there will be no danger and she stopped for a second if you will put out your candle when next you leave it in the stables my candle i stammered taken aback by her words i left it burning last night said she i beg your pardon there is very great reason that you should she said with a laugh for i must needs hurry on my clothes and put it out as i said you are very imprudent mr clavering and with that she tripped down to the house leaving me not so much concerned with what she had hinted about her father as with my own immediate need to secure the knowledge i was after quickly and avert by my departure the smallest risk from applegarth i was on that account the more relieved when late upon the third night afterwards tash knocked at the door and brought me a letter from lord derwentwater i opened it eagerly and read it through it told me much which is common knowledge now as that the earl of mar had summoned his friends in scotland to meet him at aboyne on the th upon the pretext of a great huntingparty that the mughouse riots in london were daily increasing in number and violence but that with the french king so near to his dissolution and the precautions of the english government in bringing over dutch troops and thronging the channel with its ships lord bolingbroke was all for delay but god knows he added whether delay is any possible and i fear for the event we have many of the nobles on our side but the body of our countrymen it will be like a game of chess in which one side plays without pawns we have bishops and knights and castles but no pawns there was more of the same kind and i glanced through it hurriedly until i came to that of which i was more particularly in search the sheriff came with his posse to lords island in the morning so that it was well you left during the night he is still after you i passed his messenger yesterday near braithwaite so it behoves you to be wary i do not think however he has winded you as yet and as soon as i can discover an occasion i will have you sent over the water but being myself under the cloud of their suspicions i have to step very deliberately your cousin jervas rookley lives openly under his own name at blackladies and receives visits from the whig attorney and since he can only be staying there with the sufferance of the government you may be certain what i told you is true by the way mr anthony herbert the painter disappeared on the same day or thereabouts that you did it is rumoured that he has been arrested but nothing certain is known but if the rumour is true i greatly fear that he owes his arrest to his acquaintanceship with you and myself i suspect mr rookleys finger in the pie since he was playing false with the government concerning you he would most likely be anxious to give them an earnest of loyalty in some other matter but i do not know so far i read and clapped the letter down with a bang for here was the fellow to my own suspicion i sat down and finished the letter there was but another line to it i got my information about rookley from an oldish man who came secretly here from blackladies he seemed in some doubt as to which of yourself or your cousin he should call master but he was very insistent that i should let you know of his coming i had indeed some difficulty in comprehending him for now he wished me to style him aron to you and now ashlock altogether i thought it wiser to give him no news as to your whereabouts this however is certain from what he said to me there is a watch set about blackladies on the chance that you might return this last sentence troubled me exceedingly for it had been growing in my mind that there was but one person who could tell me fully what i needed to know and that person mr jervas rookley and a vague purpose was gradually taking shape within me that i would once more make use of mr curwens stables and riding one night round by newlands valley and keswick seek to take mr rookley by surprise and wrest the truth from him that project the letter seemed to strike dead accordingly i took the occasion to write to lord derwentwater and implored him if by any means he could to inform himself more particularly of anthony herberts arrest and whither he had been taken for upon these two points said i hangs not my safety but my souls salvation and so hurried tash off before the poor man was halfway through his supper and waited impatiently for an answer now during this period of waiting since each time that i found myself alone with mr curwen his talk would wander back inquisitively to the french court discovering there a lustre which no doubt it had and a chivalry which it no less certainly lacked i began of a set purpose to avoid him and avoiding him was thrown the more into the company of miss dorothy moreover the frankness with which she had hinted to me the weakness of her father brought about a closer intimacy between us as of friend and friend rather than as of hostess and guest it was as though mary tyson and she were continually building up out of their love a fence around the father and she had joined me in the work many a time when i was on the hillside behind the house i would be startled by the sight of a horse and the flash of a redcoat upon the horses back only to find my heart drumming yet the faster when i perceived that it was miss dorothy curwen in her red cramoisie ridinghabit maybe i would be standing no great distance from the house and she would see me and come up the grass while i went down towards her her hair straying about her ears and forehead in the sweetest disorder and her cheeks windwhipped to the rosiest pink on the wet days which were by no means infrequent she would sit at her spinet and sing such old songs as that i had listened to on the first night of my coming if the evenings were fine we would sometimes row out upon ennerdale water in a crazy battered boat so that i was more often baling out the leakage in a tin pannikin than pulling at the oars and on afternoons when the sunlight fell through the leaves like great spots of a gold rain we would climb up to the orchard and i would spread an old cloak for her upon the grass and we would sit amongst the crabbed trunks of trees but at all times in the dusk when she sang and the rain whipped the panes at night when we rowed across the moonlit lake as across a silver mirror in the hush of a world asleep at all times a feverish impatience would seize on me for an answer to my letter and a shadow would darken across our talk so that thereafter i sat mum and glooming and heard little that was said to me it was not indeed the shadow of the gallows but rather of the fear lest while i lingered here at applegarth chance might thwart me of the gallows for the girls presence was to me as a perpetual accusation upon one such occasion when we were together in the orchard she looked at me once or twice curiously for one so imprudent said she a trifle petulantly you are extraordinary solemn there are creatures said i with a weariful shake of the head who are by nature solemn true says she placidly but even they hoot at night and she looked across the valley with extreme unconsciousness but i noticed that her mouth dimpled at the corners as if she was very pleased i know said i remorsefully that i make the dullest of companions she nodded her head in cordial agreement perhaps you cannot help it says she with great sympathy the truth is i exclaimed sharply i have overmuch to make me solemn no doubt and the sympathy deepened in her voice and i am sure every one must pity you there was a king once who never smiled again i am sure every one pitied him too he only lost a son i replied foolishly meaning thereby that honour was a thing of more worth and you an estate says she it is indeed very true and she clasped her hands and shook her head madam i returned with some dignity you put words into my mouth that i had no thought of using it was not of a mere estate that i was speaking no says she reflectively could it be a heart then dear dear this is very tragical no i said very quickly and on the instant fell to stammering no no the word gains little force from repetition in fact i have heard that two noes make a yes madam said i stiffly getting to my feet you persist in misunderstanding me and i moved a step or two apart from her i do not know she said demurely that you use any great effort to prevent the mistake that i felt to be true i wondered for a moment whether she had not a right to know and i turned back to her she was sitting with her head cocked on one side and glancing whimsically towards me from the tail of her eye the glance became on the instant the blankest of uninterested looks i plumped down again on the grass that evening i began when i left the candle burning in the stables i rode into keswick there was something i should have done before i came hither and i stumbled over the words she took me up immediately with a haughty indifference and her chin very high in the air nay i have no desire to pry into your secrets not the least in the world oh said i i fancied you were curious curious she exclaimed with a flash of her eyes curious indeed and why should i be curious about your concerns if you please and she spoke the word again with a laugh of scorn curious said i the word gains no force from repetition dorothy curwen gasped with indignation a very witty and polite rejoinder upon my word she said slowly and began to repeat that remark too but broke off at the second word for a little we were silent then she plucked a reed of grass and bit it pensively no she said indifferently since my father has lived quietly at applegarth i have lost my interest in politics it was no question of politics at all i exclaimed and oh she exclaimed swinging round to me with all her indifference gone no i went on but reluctantly for i was no longer sure that i ought to tell her and quibbled accordingly there was some one in keswick for whom i had news which would not wait news of your escape she interposed with a certain constraint in her voice partly that i replied and continued and from whom i most heartily desired news she sat for a moment with her face averted and very still and what is she like she asked of a sudden the question startled me so that i jumped and stared at her openmouthed but by the time i had fashioned an answer she had no longer any need for it for no no she exclaimed i have no wish to hear and she fell unaccountably to talking of jervas rookley at first in something of a flurry and afterwards in a tone as though she found great comfort in the thought of him he is not so black as he is painted was the burden of her speech and she played many variations on the tune now i had in my pocket a certain letter from lord derwentwater which was a clear disproof of her words and to speak the truth her manner stung me for whatever part of my misfortunes i did not owe to myself that i owed to mr jervas rookley and i never could bring myself to believe that story of the wadmines she said never ah poor man what will he be doing now it is a thought which often troubles me mr clavering doubtless he is somewhere tossed upon the sea it is a very noble life a sailors there is no nobler is there and she asked the question as if she had no doubt whatever but that i should agree with her i know nothing of that i replied in some heat but as for the wadmines i know that story to be true for i have seen the shaft she shook her head at me with an air of disappointment it seemed she thought i was slandering the man after slipping into his shoes i whipped the letter out of my pocket and thrust it before her there madam there i exclaimed the thought of mr rookley need no longer trouble you i am glad indeed to have the opportunity of disposing of your trouble it will be the one moments satisfaction the man has given me he is nowhere tossed upon the sea in that noblest of all lives as you will be able to perceive for yourself if you will glance through this letter but on the contrary sitting quietly in an armchair in whatever room at blackladies pleases him best i am not so short of sight she observed sedately that i need the paper to be rubbed against my nose she took it and read it through once and a second time i told her the story of my dealings with mr rookley from the moment of his coming to me at the jesuit college in paris to the morning when i fled from blackladies and so much of his dealings with me as i was familiar with it was in fact much the same story that i had told to my lord and lady derwentwater and contained little mention of mr herbert except the fact that he was painting my portrait and no mention whatsoever of mr herberts wife for i found that the whole account of my proceedings since i had come to england fell very naturally into two halves each of which to all seeming was in itself complete she heard me out to the end and then in low penitent voice for which it seemed to me there was no occasion i knew nothing of this she said or i would never so much as have uttered mr rookleys name i could not know you will bear me out in this i could not know and she turned to me with the sweetest appeal in her grey eyes and a hand timidly outstretched indeed said i earnestly i will you could not know and i can well believe mr jervas rookleys conduct was very different to you with that i took her hand and again took it gingerly by the fingertips thereupon she snatched it away and got quickly to her feet and for whom she began and stopped while she very deliberately fastened a button of her glove which was already buttoned for whom what said i it is no matter she said carelessly and then for whom was the picture intended and as though she was halfashamed of the question she ran lightly down the hillside without waiting for an answer for no one i cried out after her it was intended to hang in the great hall of blackladies but she descended into the house and i i passed through the orchard and up the hillside behind it and over the crest of the fell until ridge upon ridge opened out beneath the overarching sky and the valleys between them became so many furrows drawn by a giants plough and coming into that great space and solitude where no tree waved no living thing moved no human sound was heard i dropped upon the ground pressing a throbbing face down among the cool bracken and twining my fingers about the roots of ferns it was the blackest hour that had ever till then befallen me mercifully i could not know that it was but a foretaste of others yet blacker which were to follow something very new and strange was stirring within me i loved her the truth was out that afternoon i think it was her questioning which taught it me for it brought mrs herbert into my thoughts and so i learned this truth by the bitterest of all comparisons i saw the two faces side by side and then the one vanished and the other remained here i thought was my life just beginning to take some soul of meaning here was its usual drab aflush with that rosy light as of all the sunrises and all the sunsets which had ever brightened across the world and i must give it up and through my own fault there was the hardest part of the business through my own fault the knowledge stung and ached at my heart intolerably there was nothing heroical in the reparation which i purposed here was no laying down of ones life at the feet of ones mistress with a blithe heart and even a gratitude for the occasion such as i had read of in mr curwens romances and how easy that seemed to me at this moment it was the mere necessary payment for a sordid act of shame it was drawing towards night when i rose to my feet and came down the mountainside to applegarth and as the outcome of my torturing reflections one conviction fixed very clearly in my mind before had gained an added impulsion i must needs hasten on this reparation it was not i am certain the fear that delay in the fulfilment would weaken my purpose which any longer spurred me but of those two faces which had made my comparison one as i say had vanished from my thoughts the other now occupied them altogether and it seemed to me that if by any chance i missed the opportunity of atonement i should be doing the owner of that face an irreparable wrong miss dorothy curwen came late from her room to supper and the moment she entered the parlour where mr curwen and i were waiting it appeared that something had gone amiss with her and that we were in consequence to suffer her face was pale and tired her eyes hostile and asperity was figured in the tight curve of her lips from the crown of her head to the toetips she was panoplied in aggression so that the very ribands seemed to bristle on her dress it was plain too that she did but wait her opportunity mr curwen provided it by a question as to her looks and a suggestion that her health was disordered no wonder says she and not a doubt of it she snatched the occasion with both hands as it were and said i think more than she intended i am much troubled by an owl that keeps me from my proper sleep an owl asked mr curwen with an innocent sympathy an owl i asked in a sudden heat her eyes met mine very cold and blank owl she answered spelling the word deliberately i could not think what had caused this sudden change in her but my dear said mr curwen in perplexity are you certain you have made no mistake oh no sir there will be no mistake says i indignantly or ever she could open her lips but indeed i do not know whether in any case she would have opened them or not for her face was like a mask but i did not know there was an owl at applegarth says he he is a newcomer says i but you may take my word for it there is an owl at applegarth a tedious solemn owl miss dorothy nodded her head quietly at each epithet and her action much increased my anger then you have heard it mr clavering says mr curwen and indeed i have i cried in a greater heat than ever for i noticed a certain contentment begin to steal over the girls face at each fresh evidence of my rage indeed i have under the eaves at my bedroom window but my dear mr clavering expostulated mr curwen what sort of an owl is it a very uncommon owl said i oh dear no not at all said miss curwen stonily with a lift of her eyebrows well we will have him out tomorrow says the father no sir tonight says i this very night dorothy gave a start and looked at me with a trace of anxiety yes i repeated significantly wagging my head in a fury tonight no later oh but i like owls cried she of a sudden that can hardly be i insisted looking hard at her since they keep you awake o nights at that she coloured and dropped her eyes from my face perhaps i exaggerated she said weakly and sat smoothing the tablecloth on each side of her with her fingers she glanced up at me i was still looking at her she glanced from me to her father he was waiting for her answer utterly at a loss but i like owls she said again in a queer little highpitched plaintive voice and somehow i began to laugh and in a moment she was laughing too you make too much of the trouble said she we will have him out tomorrow said mr curwen and again she laughed but with something of mischief so that though for that night there the matter dropped i suspected she had devised some plan by which i was to suffer a penalty for her present discomfiture and that suspicion i found to be true no later than the next morning for while we were yet at breakfast mr curwen returned to the subject and was for sending out mary tyson to fetch in one of the shepherds in order to oust the bird yes indeed cries dorothy with a delighted little clap of the hands and a quick meaning glance at mary tyson the shepherds were all on the hillside not one of them was within reach said mary with suspicious promptitude but we have a ladder said dorothy speaking at me and her eyes sparkling and dancing i made as though i had not heard the suggestion then i will myself hunt him out said mr curwen with a ready eagerness to make proof of his activity father that cannot be says she it would put us to shame rather i will take it in hand and again she looked at me there was no escape it is a duty which naturally falls to me said i not with the best grace in the world nay said she we cannot admit of duties in our guests it must be a pleasure to you before we allow you to undertake it then it will be a pleasure i agreed lamely we will endeavour to make it one she replied with a malicious nod of the head i tried you may be sure to defer this chase for an owl which i knew did not exist and hoped by talking very volubly upon other topics to drive the thought of it from their minds and to that end lingered over my breakfast even after the rest had for some while finished but the moment we did rise from the table there is no time like present hinted dorothy plainly and mr curwen warmly seconding her for he began to show something of excitement like a child when some new distraction is offered to it i fetched the ladder from an outhouse and reared it against the wall of applegarth at a spot she pointed out close to my window accordingly i mounted the while mr curwen and his daughter remained at the foot he quite elated she very sedate and serious but no sooner had i reached the topmost rungs than dorothy discovers the nest a good twenty feet away and i must needs descend like the merest fool shift the ladder and mount again and when once more i was at the top she discovers it at a third place and so on through the morning i know not how many times i ran up and down that accursed ladder but my knees ached until i thought they would break once or twice i stopped as if i would have no more of it whereupon she covered me with the tenderest apologies and regrets but it is a farce said i laughing in spite of myself of course you are very tired said she reproachfully it is a shame that i should put you to so much trouble and she pops her foot upon the lowest rung of the ladder so there was no other course but up i must go again until at last she was satisfied and i beaten with fatigue it is a strange thing said mr curwen scratching his forehead that we cannot discover it i fancy mr clavering was right says she with a bubble of delight and it is a very uncommon owl and i was allowed to carry the ladder back to the outhouse chapter xiv i drop the cloak the lesson however was lost on me or rather to speak by the book had the very reverse effect to that it aimed at for my solemnity was increased thereby i reflected that dorothy would never have played this trick upon an enemy or even upon an unconsidered acquaintance but only upon one whom she thought of as a friend and there was the trouble i held her in that reverence that it irked me intolerably to masquerade to her though the masquerading was to my present advantage in her esteem i had of course no thought that ever i could win her since i saw myself hourly either doomed to the gallows or if i failed of that to a more disgraceful existence but i was fain that she should know me through and through for no better than i was and so i wore her friendship as a stolen cloak now a thief if the cloak galls him may restore it that i could not do without telling her the whole story and the story i could not tell since it was not i alone whose honour was concerned in it but a woman with me or the thief may drop the cloak by the roadside without a word and get him into the night over that alternative i pondered a long dreary while but while i was yet tossed amidst these perplexities news came to hand which quite turned the current of my thoughts it was the th day of september and mr curwen i remember had left applegarth early that morning on horseback and though it was now past nightfall had not yet returned the which was causing both his daughter and myself no small uneasiness at the very time when tash rapped upon the door he brought me a letter i mind me that i stood in the hall staring in front of me holding the open letter in my hand it seemed that i saw the lock fall from a door and the door opening on an unimagined dawn what is it cried dorothy and for a second she laid a gentle hand upon my arm it is i exclaimed drawing in a breath it is that the earl of mar the duke god bless him for now one may give him his proper title has raised king jamess standard at kirkmichael in braemar dorothy gave a cry of delight and i joined in with it for if the duke did but descend into england if england did but rise to welcome him why there would be the briefest imprisonment for those lying under charge whether true or false of conspiring for king james through the open doorway sounded the tramp of a horse my father said dorothy i crammed the letter into my pocket without a glance at its conclusion and ran down the pathway to the gate as i opened the gate mr curwen rode up to it i am glad to have this chance of speaking to you alone said he as he dismounted i have been today to whitehaven my ship the swallow is fitting out i have given orders that the work should be hurried and the crew shipped with the least delay the swallow will sail the first moment possible and lie off ravenglass until you come it is an arduous journey from here to ravenglass but safe a farmservant came up and led away the horse the swallow should be at ravenglass in six weeks from today he continued but sir said i in a whisper though i felt an impulse to cry the news out there will be no need i trust for the swallow there is the grandest news to tell you and i informed him of the contents of my letter mr curwen said never a word to me but dropped upon his knees in the pathway god save the king he cried in a quavering voice and the fervour of it startled me his hands were clasped and lifted up before him and by the starlight i saw that there were tears upon his cheek then he stood up again and mopped his face with his handkerchief leaning against the palings of the garden fence mr clavering i could add with a full heart now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace but that there is work even for an arm as old and feeble as mine at that he stopped and asked in a very different tone of trepidation does mary tyson know miss dorothy does ah of course of course he said with resignation it is all one and he walked slowly up the path at the door he turned to me and set a hand on my shoulder there is work mr clavering for the feeblest arm he asked wistfully now all my instincts urged me to say yes but on the other hand i remembered certain orders which had been given to me in a very decided voice so that i stood silent with a sorrowful shake of the head mr curwen passed through the door maybe you are right said he disconsolately and then but the question is worth proving this bracing his shoulders and making a cut in the air with an imaginary sabre however mary tyson bustled forward to help him off with his greatcoat and scolded all the boldness out of him in the space of a minute drawing such a picture of the anxiety into which his early outgoing and late homecoming had thrown the household as melted him to humility it was to do me a service said i interposing myself and the more shame to you says she bluntly white hairs must wait on young legs and off she flung to the kitchen it was not until the following morning that dorothy made allusion to his absence i went on business to whitehaven he replied with a prodigious wink at me which twisted the whole side of his face his daughter could not but have observed it though the business might have waited and he added hurriedly however i bring a message for you my dear for i chanced to meet old mr aislabie in the street and he sent his love to miss cherrycheeks cherrycheeks cried she indignantly cherrycheeks how dare he is it a bumpkin a fat country milkmaid he takes me for my dear said mr curwen with the gentlest spice of raillery you certainly deserve the charming title now she said no more concerning the journey to whitehaven being much occupied with her indignation once or twice i heard her mutter cherrycheeks to herself but with a tone as though her tongue was too delicate for the gross epithet and as if to disprove its suitability she sailed in to dinner that day with her hair all piled and builded on the top of her head under a little cap of lace and a great hoop petticoat of silk and the funniest little shoes of green and gold brocade with wonderful big paste buckles and the highest heels that ever i saw nor was that the whole of her protest for though as a rule she was of a healthy sensible appetite now she would only toy with her meat protesting that she could not eat a bit i have no doubt says i but what you are troubled with the vapours and got a haughty glance of contempt for my pains and after dinner what does she do but sit in great state in the drawingroom with her little feet daintily crossed upon a velvet cushion fanning herself languidly and talking of french gowns as the latest newsletter represented them and the staleness of matrimony and suchlike fashionable matters but no doubt says she with a shrug of the shoulders and a pretty voice of insolence mr clavering will marry she paused for a second and what will the wife be like i was taken aback by the question and from looking on her face i looked to the ground or rather to the velvet cushion by which i happened to be sitting it was for that reason that not knowing clearly what i should say i answered absently she must have a foot i suppose so she replied and why not two yes i continued slowly she must certainly have a foot and maybe a head with eyes and a mouth to it says she or does not your modesty ask so much i wonder you can walk on them at all said i the heels were popped on the instant demurely under the hoop petticoat owl she said in a very soft low reflective voice addressing the word in a sort of general way to the four walls of the room miss cherrycheeks said i in as near the same tone as i could manage she rose immediately the very figure of stateliness and dignity swam out of the room without so much as a word or a nod and i must suppose went hungry to bed for we saw no more of her that night for the next few days as may be guessed we lived in a great excitement and stress of expectation at applegarth mr curwen would get him to his horse early of the morning now rather encouraged thereto than dissuaded and ride hither and thither about the country side the while his daughter and i bided impatiently for his return i cannot say however that the information which he gleaned was a comfort to compensate us for the impatience of our waiting from scotland indeed the news was good we heard that the earl of mar was gathering his forces at the markettown of moulin and that the sixty men who proclaimed king james at kirkmichael were now swelled to a thousand but of england or rather of those parts of it which lay about us it was ever the same disheartening story that he carried back a story of messengers buzzing backwards and forwards betwixt a poor handful of landlords and for the rest of men going quietly about their daily work once or twice indeed he returned uplifted with a rumour that the towns of lancashire were only waiting for the scottish army to march into england before they mounted the white cockade on another occasion he satisfied us with a fairytale that the insurgents had but to appear before the walls and newcastle would forthwith open its gates and at such times the old panels of the parlour would ring with laughter as doubtless they had rung in the old days after atherton moor and i would sit with a heart unworthily lightened by a thought that i might escape the payment which was due but for the most part i had ever in my mind lord derwentwaters word about the pawns and those yet earlier forebodings of my kinsman bolingbroke it seemed to me indeed that in this very rising of the earl of mars i had a proof of the accuracy of his forecasts for he had sent word that the rebellion would be deferred and here were the orders reversed behind his back moreover we heard that the french king had died upon september st and that i counted the most disheartening of calamities in this way then a week went by on the evening of the eighth day being the th september i was leaning my elbows on the gate of the little garden when i heard a heavy step behind me on the gravel i turned and there was mary tyson it seemed to me that she was barring the path goodevening mary said i as pleasantly as possible i am wishing for the day said she when i can say the same to you mr clavering and why said i in astonishment it is no doing of mine that mr curwen rides loose about the countryside it is not of the father i am thinking she interrupted and i felt as though she had struck me what do you mean i asked shortly i know she said this is no way for a rough old servingbody to speak to the likes of you but see sir and her voice took on a curiously gentle and pleading tone i remember when she couldnt clinch her fist round one of my fingers its milk of mine too that has fed her and its honey to my heart to think she owes some of her sunshine to it ive seen her here at applegarth grow from baby to child and from child to woman yes woman woman she repeated perhaps you forget that no indeed said i perplexed as to what she would be at it was the first thought i had of her then the more blame to you she cried and speech rushed out of her in a passion what is it that youre seeking of her you thats hunted with a price on your head what is it what is it and she stretched out her great arms on either side of her as though to make a barrier against myself ah if i were sure it would bring no harm on her you should have the soldiers on your heels tomorrow many and manys the time ive been tempted to it when ive spied you in the orchard or on the lake i have been sore tempted to it sore tempted what is it you want of her its the brothers clothes you are wearing but is it the brothers heart beneath them good god woman i cried dumfounded by her words she stood in the dusk before me her grotesque figure dignified out of all knowledge by the greatness of her love for dorothy the very audacity of her words was a convincing evidence of that and at the sight of her the anger died out of my heart if she accused me unjustly why it was to protect dorothy and that made amends for all nay i could almost thank her for the accusation and i answered very humbly i am like to get little good in my life but may i get less when that is done if ever i had a thought which could disparage her and how will i be sure of that asked mary tyson because i love her said i an older man would have made and a more experienced woman would have preferred perhaps a different answer but i suppose she gauged it by the depth of her own affection it struck root in a responsive soil ay and how could you help it she cried with a little note of triumph in her voice but the voice in an instant deadened with anxiety you will have told her not a syllable says i i am as you say a man with a price on his head i may be mated with an axe but it is the only mate that i can come by she drew a deep breath of relief and hearing it i laughed but with no merriment at my heart she took a step forward on the instant well and i am sorry said she for you are not so illlooking a lad in the brothers clothes it was a whimsical reason but given in a voice of some tenderness not so illlooking she repeated and at that her alarm reawakened but theres a danger in that she cries miss dorothy has lived here alone with but a rare visitor once or twice in the twelvemonths maybe you speak to her in the same voice you use to me nay i interposed and this time my laugh rang sound enough miss curwen treats me with friendliness a jesting friendliness which is the very preclusion of love she bent forward a little peering at me well it may be said she though i would never trust a boys judgment on anything let alone a woman dorothys voice called her from the house she looked over her shoulder and went on lowering her tone look said she at these boulders here and she pointed to the darkening hillside they are landmarks to our shepherds in the mist but when the snow lies deep in winter they will cross them and never know until they come to something else that tells them its so with us we cross from this friendliness into love thinking there are landmarks to guide us but the landmarks may be hid and we do not know until something else tells us we have crossed and with some and she nodded back towards the house there will be no retracing of the steps suppose you left your image with her a treasure she will think it it will prove a curse you say you care for her i saw what she was coming to and nodded in assent there is the one way to show it not to her no not to her that is the hardest thing i know but the truest proof that you will be content for your loves sake to let her think ill of you dorothys voice sounded yet louder she came out into the porch mary tyson hurried towards her and receiving some order disappeared into the house dorothy came slowly down the path towards me you were very busy with mary tyson said she she was talking to me of the landmarks said i but one cannot see them said she looking towards the hillside i stood silent by her side it was not that mary tysons words had so greatly impressed me i believed indeed that she spoke out of an overmastering jealousy for the girls welfare but i asked myself since she had said so much knowing so little of me what would she have said had she known the truth the temptation to set the sheriff on my path would long ago i was certain have become an accomplished act nor could i have blamed her i was brought back to my old thought that i was wearing this girls friendship as a thief may wear a stolen cloak there is something i ought to tell you said i suddenly and came to a no less sudden stop the moment that the sound of the words told me whither i was going but at this time i continued in the lamest of conclusions i have no right to tell it you and so babbled a word or two more she gave a little quiet laugh and instead of answering me began to hum over to herself that melody of the honest lover in the midst of a bar she broke off i heard her breath come and go quickly she turned and ran into the house that night at all events i acted upon an impulse of which i have never doubted the rectitude since i could not restore to her the stolen cloak i took that other course and dropped it by the wayside i wrote a brief note of thanks to mr curwen and when the house was quiet i crept from my room along the passage and dropping out of that window which my host had shown me on the night of my coming to applegarth betook me under the starshine across the fells chapter xv i revisit blackladies that night i lay in the bracken on the hillside looking down into ennerdale far below i could see one light burning in an upper window at the eastern side of applegarth it burned in dorothys chamber and its yellow homeliness tugged at my heart as i lay there the lonesome darkness about me the shrill cry of the wind in my ears the light burned very late that night the clouds were gradually drawn like a curtain beneath the stars and still it burned and it was the blurring of the rain which at the last hid it from my sight for the next three days i hid amongst the hills betwixt borrowdale and applegarth i was now fallen upon the last days of september and the weather very shrewd with black drenching storms of rain which would sweep up the valleys with extraordinary suddenness impenetrable as a screen blotting out the world the wind too blew from the north bitter and cold moaning up and down the faces of cliffs whistling through the grasses with a sound inimitably desolate and twisting to a very whirlpool in the gaps between the mountainpeaks to make my case the harder i had come away in that haste and oblivion of all but the necessity of my departure that i had made little provision in my dress to defend me against the lashing of the wind and rain i had picked up a hat and a long cloak it is true but for the rest i wore no stouter covering than that suit of white which mary tyson had laid out for me so reluctantly it was an unfit garb for my present life and one that was to prove a considerable danger to me but it was the cold discomfort of it which vexed me now i had occasion enough to reflect on the folly of my precipitation as i lay crouched in some draughty cave of boulders watching the livelong day the clouds lower and lift the battalions of the rain trample across the fells and seeking to warm myself with the thought of that army in scotland marching to the english borders at nightfall i would creep down into borrowdale procure food from one of my old tenants who was welldisposed to me and so get me back again to some jutting corner whence i could look down gillerthwaite to applegarth but i looked in vain for the lights of the house on the night of my departure i saw them but never afterwards even when the air was of the clearest so that i knew not what to think and was almost persuaded to return to the house that i might ascertain the cause of their disappearance so for four days and nights whilst an old thought shaped to a resolve for in the pocket of my coat i had carried away not merely the button i had discovered in the garden at blackladies that never left my person but the letter tash had brought to me from lord derwentwater i had been interrupted in the reading of it by mr curwens return and so crammed it into my pocket with some part of it unread however i gave very careful heed to it now my own affairs it ran on have come to so desperate a pass that i dare not poke my nose into the matter of herberts disappearance i live indeed myself in hourly expectation of arrest your servant came again to me from blackladies the other day and told me a watch was no longer kept upon the house and since i had no knowledge that england was stirring in support of the rebellion i determined to hazard an interview with my cousin and so late on the fifth night climbed into the garden of blackladies and let myself into the house as i had once seen jervas rookley do i stood for a little in the parlour feeling the darkness throb heavily about me with all the memories of that fatal night which had compassed my undoing then i crossed towards the hall but my cloak flapping and dragging noisily at a chair as i passed i loosed it from my shoulders and left it there no lamp was burning in the hall and since the curtains were drawn close over the lower windows only the faintest of twilights penetrating through the upper panes made a doubtful glimmering beneath the roof so that one seemed to be standing in a deep well the diningroom lay to my right on the further side of the hall i made towards it and of a sudden came sharply to a halt my heart fairly quivering within me for it seemed to me that the figure of a man had suddenly sprung out of the darkness and was advancing to me but so close that the next step would bring our heads knocking against each other and he had made no sound as i stopped the figure stopped for a moment i stood watching it holding my breath then i clapped my hand to my sword and the next moment i could have laughed at my alarm for the figure copied my gesture it was moreover dressed in clothes of a white colour from top to toe and it was for that reason i saw its movements so distinctly but i was likewise dressed in white the one difference in fact between us which i noted was a certain black sheen in which it stood framed i reached out a hand it slid upon the polished surface of a great mirror the diningroom i knew opened at the side of this mirror and i groped cautiously for the handle of the door but before i found it my hand knocked against the key with equal caution i opened the door to the width of an inch or so a steady light shone upon the side of the wall and through the opening there came the sound of a man snoring i put my head into the room and there to my inexpressible relief was jervas rookley he was dressed in a suit of black satin stretched to his full length upon a chair in front of a blazing fire his head thrown back his periwig on the floor his cravat loosened his shoes unbuckled off his feet i closed the door behind me then opened it again and pocketed the key against which my hand had struck the truth is that now that i was come into the mans presence which i had before considered the most difficult part of the business i now on the contrary saw very clearly that it was the easiest i had not merely to come into his presence i had to win out of it afterwards and moreover i had somehow or other to twist from him the information about mr herberts whereabouts for which i had adventured the visit i stepped on tiptoe across the carpet and seated myself in a chair facing him at the corner of the fireplace then i sought to arrange and order the questions i should put to him but in truth i found the task wellnigh beyond my powers it was all very well to tell myself that i was here on behalf of my remnant honour to secure the enlargement of mr herbert but the man was face to face with me the firelight played upon his honest face and outstretched limbs and i felt hatred spring up in me and kindle through my veins like fire up till now so engrossed had i been by the turmoil of my own more personal troubles i had given little serious thought to jervas rookley i had taken his treachery almost callously as an accepted thing and the depths of my indignation had only been stirred against myself now however every piece of trickery he had used on me crowded in upon my recollections i might cry out within myself anthony herbert anthony herbert anthony herbert was none the less pushed to the backward of my mind that honest face was upturned to the light and my thoughts swarmed about it i scanned it most carefully it was more than common flushed and swollen for which i was at no loss to account since a bottle of french brandy stood on a little table at his elbow three parts empty and a carafe of water three parts full i reached over for the bottle and rinsing out his glass helped myself bethinking me that after my exposure of the three last days its invigoration might prove of use to me but as i sat there and drank the brandy and watched jervas rookleys face my fingers ever strayed to the hilt of my sword i moved the weapon gently backwards and forwards so as to satisfy my ears with the pleasant jingle of the hanger i half drew the blade from the sheath and rubbed my thumb along the edge until the blood came and then i sat looking at the blood and from the blood to jervas rookley until at last an overmastering desire grew hot about my heart it was no longer the edge or the point of the sword which i desired to employ i wanted to smash in that broad honest face with the big pommel and i feared the moment of his awakening lest i should yield to the temptation fortunately his first movement was one that diverted my thoughts for as he opened his eyes he stretched out his hands to the brandy bottle it was near to my elbow however on the mantelpiece and i refilled my own glass it was i think the sound of the liquor tinkling into the glass more than the words i spoke to him which made rookley open his eyes he blinked at me for a moment you said he but blankly with the stupor of his sleep still heavy upon him yes said i drinking the brandy he followed the glass to my lips and woke to the possession of some part of his senses i had expected you before says he and sits clicking his tongue against the roof of his mouth and swallowing as though his throat was parched so i believe i returned you had even gone so far as to prepare for me a fitting welcome he was by this time wide awake he picked up his peruke clapped it on his head and stood up in his stocking feet your servants sir says he with inimitable assurance will always honour their master with a fitting welcome so long as i am steward on whatever misfortunes he may have declined i meant said i a welcome not so much fitting my mastership as that honesty of yours mr rookley which my lord derwentwater tells me is all on the outside i bent forward keeping my eyes upon his face but not a muscle jerked in it ah said he in an indifferent voice did lord derwentwater tell you that well i had never a great respect for his discernment and he stood looking into the fire then he glanced at me and uttered a quiet little laugh so you knew said he easily i had it in my mind but i could not be certain i have known it i cried exasperated out of all control by his cool audacity and with a wave of the hand he interrupted me you will excuse me he said politely and then there is no longer any reason why i should stand is there and he resumed his seat and slipped his feet into his shoes now said he if you will pass the bottle no i roared in a fury well well he returned since there seems some doubt which of us is host and which guest i will not press the request you were saying that you have known it since one evening when you showed me a private entrance into blackladies i cried and bending forward to press upon him the knowledge that he had thereby foiled himself i added in some triumph i have great reason to thank you for that mr jervas rookley he leaned forward too so that our heads were close together and for more than that said he believe me dear mr clavering that is by no means all you have to thank me for and he very affectionately patted my knee and that is very true says i as i drew my knee away for i have to thank you for the fourth part of a bottle of brandy but i cannot just bring to mind any other occasion of gratitude oh gratitude says he with a reproachful shake of the hand fie mr clavering between gentleman and cousins the word stinks it positively stinks whatever little service i have done for you calls for no such bigsounding name his voice his looks his gestures were such as a man notes only in a friend and a friend that is perplexed by some unaccountable suspicion but you spoke of honesty he continued throwing a knee across the other and spreading out his hands it is very true i played a trick on you in coming to paris as your servant but it is a trick which my betters had used before me your duke of ormond got him into france with the help of a lackeys livery and your redoubtable mar at that name i started it is indeed so he said earnestly the earl of mar i have it on the best authority worked his passage as a collier into scotland it was not however that i was concerned at all as to how the earl of mar had escaped unremarked from london but it suddenly occurred to me as an explanation of rookleys friendly demeanour that the insurrection might be sweeping southwards on a higher tide of success than i had been disposed to credit if that was the case mr jervas rookley would of a certainty be anxious still to keep friends with me so you see mr clavering he went on i have all the precedents that a man could need to justify me well said i it is not the trick itself which troubles me so much as your design in executing it design says he taking me up in a tone of wonderment you are very suspicious mr clavering but i do not wonder at it knowing in what school you were brought up and rising from his chair he took a pipe from the mantelshelf and commenced to fill it with tobacco the suspicion however is unjust he bent down and plucked a splinter of burning wood out of the fire you do not smoke i believe but most like you do now and at all events you will have grown used to the smell i started forward and stared at him he lighted his pipe with great deliberation yes said he nodding his head at me the suspicion is unjust he tossed the splinter into the fire and sat down again and how is little dorothy curwen he asked with a lazy contemptuous smile i sprang out of my seat stung by the contempt rather than the surprise his words were like to arouse in me and this i think he perceived for he laughed to himself whereupon i felt my face flush and that too he noted and laughed again then you knew i exclaimed recovering myself you knew where i was sheltered a gentleman riding down gillerthwaite at three oclock of the morning is a sufficiently rare a sight to attract attention i believe that luckily the shepherd who saw you only gossiped to a tenant of blackladies i remembered the flock of sheep which i had seen scared up the hillside across the valley but it was on my return from keswick that i had been remarked no later than a day after rookley had striven to encompass my arrest the news said i very slowly came to you in a roundabout fashion and took i suppose some time in the coming i infer therefore that it came to your ears after the earl of mar had risen in scotland i was leaning upon the mantelpiece looking down into his face on which the fire shone with a full light and just for a moment his face changed the slightest thing in the world but enough to assure me that my conjecture was right there are inferences my good cousin he said sharply which it is not overprudent for a man so delicately circumstanced as yourself to draw there was a note of disappointment in his tone as though he would fain have hoodwinked me still into the belief that he stood my friend and it suddenly occurred to me that there was a new danger in this knowledge of his a danger which threatened not so much me as the people who had sheltered me i resumed accordingly in a more amicable tone it was not however of my whereabouts that i came hither to speak to you but of the whereabouts of mr herbert mr herbert says he playing surprise what should i know of mr herbert now if i was to ask you the whereabouts of mrs herbert there would be some sense in the question eh and he chuckled cunningly and poked a forefinger into my ribs i struck the hand aside what indeed should you know of mr herbert i cried you that plotted his arrest arrest he interrupted yet more dumfounded plot that is the word said i plot a simple word enough though with a damned dirty underhand meaning ah he returned with a sneer you take that interest in the husband it appears which i imagined you to have reserved for his wife but as for plots and arrests why i know no more of what you mean than does the khan of crim tartary then said i will you tell me why you paid a visit to mr herbert the night before he was arrested and why you told him that if he came to blackladies on the afternoon of the next day he would find mrs herbert and myself in the garden it was something of a chance shot for i had no more than suspicion to warrant me but it sped straight to its mark rookley started back in his chair huddling his body together then he drew himself erect with a certain defiance but zounds man he exclaimed like one exasperated with perplexity what maggots in your brains why should i send herbert devil take the fellow to find you in the garden when i knew you would not be there and i can answer that question with another said i who were in the garden at the time mr herbert was to discover us the gardeners i suppose said he thrusting his wig aside to scratch his head it is a queer kind of gardener that wears buttons of this sort said i and i pulled the button from my pocket and held it before his eyes in the palm of my hand he bent forward examined the button and again looked at me inquiringly i picked it up i explained on a little plot of trampled grass in the wilderness on the next morning rookley burst into a laugh and slapped his thighs lord mr clavering he cried and rising from his chair he walked briskly about the room your button is something too small to carry so weighty an accusation nay i answered smiling in my turn the button though small is metal solid enough it depends upon how closely it is sewn to the cloth of my argument it is true that i picked up the button on the morning that the soldiers came for me but i was in the house on the afternoon before and i saw jervas rookley stopped in his walk and his laughter ceased with the sound of his steps you were in the house his mouth so worked that he pronounced the words awry you were in the house in the little parlour which gives on to the terrace had i possessed any doubt before as to his complicity the doubt would have vanished now he reeled for a moment as if he had been struck and the blood mottled in his cheeks the housedoor may be left open for one man but two men may enter it said i you saw he took a step round the table and leaned across the corner of it what did you see i took up a lighted candle from the table i will show you said i and walked to the door he followed me at first with uncertain steps the steps grew firm behind my back they seemed to me significant of a growing purpose so in the hall i stopped we are good cousins you and i said i holding the candle so that the flame lighted his face without a doubt says he readily you begin to see that you have mistaken me i was thinking rather said i that being good cousins we might walk arminarm i should count it an honour said he with a bow and it will certainly be a relief to me said i and accordingly i took his arm we crossed the hall into the parlour the window stood open as i had left it with the curtains half drawn rookley busily pushed them back while i set the candle down the sky had cleared during the last half hour and the moon which was in its fourth quarter hung like a globe above the garden i met mr herbert in the hall said i just outside this room we had some talk of a kind you can imagine he went down the steps with his sword drawn there he dropped his cloak there he slashed at the bushes between those two trees he passed out of sight i stepped out into the terrace to follow him but before i had reached the flight of steps i heard a pistol crack and saw a little cloud of smoke hang above the bushes there i found the button the next morning at the very spot and near the button the pistol it was mr herberts pistol that said i is my part of the story but perhaps if we go back to the warmer room you will give me your part for i take it that you were not in the house else you would have heard my voice but rather in the garden you made a great mistake in not looking towards the terrace my cousin and again i took his arm and we walked back i was indeed rather anxious to discover the whereabouts of rookley during that afternoon since so far i had been able to keep mrs herberts name entirely out of the narrative if jervas rookley had been in the garden during the afternoon and had only returned to the house in time to intercept lord derwentwaters letter concerning the french kings health and had thereupon ridden off to apply for a warrant against me why there was just a chance that i might save mrs herbert from figuring in the business at all rookley said nothing until we were got back into the diningroom but walked thoughtfully his arm in mine i noticed that he was carrying in his left hand the cord by which the curtains in the little parlour were fastened he stood swinging it to and fro mechanically your suspicions said he discompose me they discompose me very much i gave you credit for more generosity and lifting up the brandy bottle he held it with trembling hands betwixt himself and the candle i am afraid that it is empty said i if you will pardon me said he i will even fetch another he laid the cord upon the table advanced to the door and opened it wide i saw him slide his hand across the lock the key is in my pocket i said he looked at me with a sorrowful shake of the head your suspicions discompose me very much and he came back for a candle i noticed too that he carelessly picked up the cord again i think said i that i will help you to fetch that bottle and i went with him into the hall there was something new in the mans bearing which began to alarm me he still used the same tone of aggrieved affection but with an indefinable difference which was none the less very apparent to me his effort seemed no longer to aim at misleading me but rather to sustain the pretence that he was aiming to mislead me it seemed to me that since he had become aware of what i knew concerning his treachery he had devised some new plan and kept his old tone to hinder me from suspecting it i noticed too a certain deliberateness in the indifference of his walk a certain intention in the discomposure in the hall he stopped and setting down the candle upon a cabinet turned to face me why did you come with me he asked gently i did not know but what you might call your servants and as you put it i am delicately circumstanced he raised his hands in a gesture of pity see what suspicion leads a man to my servants hold you in so much respect that if i harboured designs against your safety to call my servants would be to ruin me i was inclined to believe that what he said was in a measure true for i remembered the interview which i had had with ashlock in the stewards office and the subsequent consideration which had been shown me then look i cried of a sudden pointing my arm right in front of me on that vacant space of the wall amongst the pictures hung the portrait of jervas rookley rookley started ever so little and then stood eyeing me keenly the while he swung round and round in a little circle the tassel of the curtain cord you prate to me of suspicions i cried theres the proof of their justice this estate of blackladies i held on one condition that you should receive no benefit from it we jogged side by side you and i cousins with hearts cousinly mated in the same endeavour you still profess it then explain to me how comes it the whigs leave you alone you stripped of your inheritance because of the very principles which outlawed me explain that and ill still believe you prove that you live here without the governments connivance ill forget the rest of my suspicions ill count you my loyal friend only show me this how comes it that i make my bed upon the bracken and you lord it at blackladies your presence the common talk your picture staring from the walls and in my rage i plucked my sword from the sheath and slashed his portrait across the face lengthwise and breadthwise in a cross the tassel stopped swinging his shoulders hunched ever so little his head came forward the eyes shone out bright like beads and his face tightened to that expression of foxy cunning i had noted before in mid channel between dover and dunkirk it is a gallant swordsman he said with a sneer and a prudent too he looks to the original i cried to give him the occasion of imprudence and i faced him there is a better way said he with the quietest laugh and he sprang back suddenly to the cabinet on which the candle stood we will make a present of a michaelmas goose to king george i saw his hand for an instant poised above the flame red with the light of it i saw his figure black from head to foot and at his elbow another figure white from head to foot the reflection of myself in the mirror by his side and then his palm squashed down upon the wick the hall fell to darkness just as i made the first step towards him i halted on the instant he could see me i could not see him he had thrown off the mask he had proclaimed himself my enemy and he knew where i had been sheltered it was that thought which slipped into my mind as the darkness cloaked about me and made me curse the folly of my intrusion here i had hazarded not merely myself but dorothy and her father he could see me i could not see him and the outcome of this adventure struck at dorothy i stepped backwards as lightly as i could until the edge of a pictureframe rubbed against my shoulderblades and so stood gripping my swordhilt straining my ears across the hall i seemed to hear rookley breathing but it was the only sound i heard there was no shuffle of a foot he had not moved above me the twilight glimmered beneath the roof about me the chamber was black as the inside of a nailed coffin if i could only reach the windows and tear the curtains back but half the length of the hall intercepted me and to reach them i must needs take my back from the wall that i dared not do and i stood listening helplessly to the sound of rookleys breathing in that pitchdark hall it seemed to shift from quarter to quarter at one moment i could have sworn i heard his breath soft as a sigh a foots length from me i could almost have sworn i felt it on my neck and in a panic i whirled my sword from side to side but it touched nothing within the half circle of its reach my fears indeed so grew upon me that i was in two minds whether or no to shout and bring the servants about me it would at all events end the suspense but i dared not do it tervas rookley distrusted them but how much more cause had i i could not risk the safety of applegarth upon their doubtful loyalty and then a sharp sound broke in upon the silence it set my heart fluttering and fainting within me by reason of its abruptness so that for a moment i was dazed and could not come at the reason of it it was a clattering sound and so far as i could gather it came from the spot where i had last seen jervas rookley standing it was like nay it was the sound of a shoe dropped upon the boards i know not why but the sound steadied though it appalled me it spoke of a doubled danger and cried for a doubled vigilance rookley could not only see my white figure he could move to it noiselessly for he was slipping off his shoes i listened for the creak of a board for the light padding sound of stockinged feet for the rustle of his coat and while i listened i moved my sword gently in front of me but my sword touched nothing and my ears heard nothing yet he must be coming stealthily stepping across the hall i felt him coming but from what quarter would he come during those seconds of waiting the question became a torture and then a momentary hope shot through me when he put the candle out his sword was in the scabbard he had not drawn it since i had listened so strenuously that i must have heard however carefully he drew it a chain would clink or if not that the scabbard might knock against his leg or if not that there would be a little whirr a sort of whisper as the blade slid upwards out of the sheath there was still a chance then at that point of the darkness from which the sound should come i would strike strike the moment i heard it with all my strength down towards the floor i tightened my fingers about my swordhilt and waited but it was a very different noise which struck upon my hearing a noise that a man may make in the dragging of a heavy sack i drew myself up close to the wall setting my feet together pressing my heels against the panels the sound filled me with such terror as i think never before or since i have known the like of for i could not explain it to myself i only knew that it was dangerous it seemed to me to come from somewhere about midway of the room and i held my breath that i might judge the better on its repetition after a moment it was repeated but nearer and by its proximity it sounded so much the more dangerous i sprang towards it a sobbing cry leapt from my lips and i lunged at a venture into the darkness but again my sword touched nothing and with the force of that unresisted thrust i stumbled forward for a step or two my cry changed into a veritable scream i felt the fingers of a hand gently steal about each of my ankles and then tighten on them like iron fetters i understood halfway across the room rookley had lowered himself fulllength upon the floor and was crawling towards me i raised my sword to strike but even as i raised it he jerked my feet from beneath me and i fell face forwards with a crash right across his body my sword flew out of my hand and went rolling and clattering into the darkness my forehead struck against the boards and for a moment i lay half stunned it was only for a moment but when that moment had passed jervas rookley was upon me above me his arms twined about mine and drawing them behind me his knees pressed with all his might into the small of my back we will truss the goose before we send it to king george said he chapter xvi ashlock gives the news then i remembered the curtain cord i felt that rookley was trying to pass it from one hand to the other beneath my arms i could hear the tassel bobbing and jerking on the floor and i summoned all my strength to draw my arms apart for if he prevailed here was the end of all my fine resolve to secure mr herberts enlargement i had flattered myself with that prospective atonement as though it was a worthy action already counted to my credit i saw this in a flash now now that i was failing again and the perception was like an agony in my bones it seemed to me that a womans face rose out of the darkness before me mournful with reproach and the face was not the wifes who waited in keswick but dorothys she looked at me from beneath a hood half thrown back from the head and across her shoulder as though she had passed me even as i had seen in my fancies a womans face look at me when i had watched the procession of my hours to come in the rectors library at the jesuit college meanwhile rookleys knee so closely pressed me to the floor that my struggles did but exhaust myself and delay the event i was no match for him in bodily strength and he held me moreover at that disadvantage wherein a weak man might well have triumphed over a strong i could get no purchase either with hand or foot and lay like a fish flapping helplessly on the deck of a boat the while he pressed my arms closer and closer together it is not to be imagined that this unequal contest lasted any great while the thoughts which i have described raced through my mind while my cry seemed still to be echoing about the walls and as though in answer to that cry a latch clicked as i felt the cord tighten about my elbows the sound came from somewhere on the opposite side of the hall and i do not think that rookley heard it for now and again he laughed in a low satisfied fashion as though engrossed in the pleasure of his task i heard a shuffling of feet and a light brightened in the passage which led to the stewards office a great hope sprang up within me there was one servant in the house whom i could trust ashlock i shouted at the top of my voice the footsteps quickened to a run damn you muttered rookley and he let go the cord he had raised his hand to strike but i did not give him time for the blow with a final effort i gathered up my knees beneath me and raised myself on my forearms rookleys balance was disturbed already he put out a hand to the floor i got the sole of my foot upon the boards jerked him off my back and rolled over upon him with my fingers at his throat ashlock ran towards us with a lighted lamp in his hand i let go my hold and got to my feet rookley did the same you came in the nick of time said rookley my good cousin would have murdered me and he arranged his cravat thats a lie said i with a breath between each word it was mr claverings cry i heard said ashlock and while he spoke a commotion arose in the upper part of the house doors opened and shut there was a hurry of footsteps along the passages and voice called to voice in alarm my cry had roused the household and i saw jervas rookley smile i crossed the hall and picked up my sword as i returned with it i saw here and there a white face popped over the balusters of the staircase i have fought with you in your way said i it is your turn to fight with me in mine rookley crossed his arms to fight with a hunted traitor said he indeed my cousin you ask too much of me i would not rob the gallows of so choice a morsel burtham wilson blacket and he lazily called up the stairs to the servants clustered there this is your work ashlock do you carry the news to the sheriff i glanced at ashlock he did not stir on the staircase i heard a conflict of muttering voices but as yet no one had descended so a full minute passed while my life and more than my life hung in the balance i kept my eyes on rookley debating in my mind what i should do if his servants obeyed him every nerve in my body tingled with the desire to drive at him with my sword point but he stood quietly smiling his arms folded his legs crossed i could not touch him being unarmed he was best armed of all and doubtless he knew it well he asked as with some impatience are my servants leagued against their master to betray his king one man descended a couple of steps and then ashlock spoke sir he said it is not for poor men like us to talk of kings kings are for you masters are for us and as it seems there are two kings for you to choose between so there are two masters for the likes of us and for my part he raised his voice and with his voice his face towards the stairs for my part i stand here and he crossed over to me and stood by my side i can see the old man now as he held up the lamp in his tremulous hand and the light fell upon his wrinkled face i can hear his voice ringing out bold and confident it was ashlock who saved me that night i saw the servants draw back at his words and the mutter of voices recommenced very well cried rookley starting forward choose him for your master then and see what comes of it he shook his fist towards the servants in his passion one and all you pack tomorrow your master i tell you is the master of blackladies they have no master then i cried for it seemed that at his words they again pressed forward for you have less right here than i rookley turned and took a step or two towards me his eyes blazing his face white but he spoke in a low voice nodding his head between the words they shall pay for this at applegarth it was my turn to start forward dorothy curwen shall pay for this little dorothy curwen with a venomous sneer your friend eh but mine too ah my good cousin it seems your fortune always to come second at that i did what i had so much longed to do when i first saw him asleep he was within two feet of me i held my drawn sword in my hand i made no answer to him in speech but the instant the words were past his lips i took my sword by the blade raised it above my head and brought the hilt crashing down upon his face he spun round upon his heels and pitched sideways at my feet now ashlock said i get me a horse but theres no such thing sir at blackladies he replied they were seized this many a week back how travels this and i pointed to jervas rookley he travels no further than between the diningroom and the cellar and i crossed into the little parlour and picked up my cloak and hat then i returned to the hall burtham had raised jervas rookleys head upon his knee and wilson was coming from the kitchen with a bason of water and a towel they looked at me doubtfully but said no word i went to the hall door unfastened the bolts and started at a run down the drive i had not however advanced many yards when a cry from behind brought me to a halt and in a little old ashlock joined me i did but go for my hat sir he said reproachfully a bald pate and an old man they are two things that go ill with a night wind he was walking by my side as he spoke and the words touched me to an extreme tenderness he was venturing himself without a question into unknown perils and for my sake i could hear his steps dragging on the gravel and i stopped it must not be i said god knows i would be blithe and glad to have a friend to bear me company and it is a true friend you have been to me i laid a hand upon his shoulder but it is into dangers and hardships i shall be dragging you and that i have no right to do without i can give you strength to win through them and that strength i cannot give these last days the rain and hail have beat upon me by day and the night wind has whistled through my bones in the dark my rooftree has been a jutting rock my bed the sopping bracken and so it will be still it needs all my youth to bear it it will mean death and a quick death to you you must go back master lawrence he replied catching at my arm master lawrence i cannot go back and there was something like a sob in his voice had we horses i continued i would gladly take you but even this morning there is work for me to do that cries for all my speed ashlock persisted however pleading that i should name a place where he could join me two things were plain to me one that he had resolved to throw his lot in with me the other that i must cross the fells to applegarth without the hamper of his companionship for jervas rookley i felt sure would seize the first moment of consciousness to exact his retribution at last a plan occurred to me you have crossed to lords island already i said go to lord derwentwater again tell him all you have heard tonight and make this request in my name that he will keep you until i send word where you can join me but lord derwentwater has fled ashlock exclaimed he fled north to mr lambert and thence goes to his own seat at dilston in northumberland he has fled how know you this i was at lords island this two days since sir seeking news of you the warrant was out for him even then he meets mr forster at greenrig on the th of october he told me he had sent to your hidingplace and bidden you join him there at greenrig with mr forster then the countrys risen i could have gone down on my knees as i had seen my cousin do if only god wills the rising will succeed and i cried out my prayer from a feeling even deeper than that i cherished for the king listen ashlock the morning is breaking do you meet me by noon betwixt honister crag and ennerdale lake there is a path hide within sight of it and without waiting to hear more from him i set out at a run across borrowdale it was daylight before i had crossed the valley and the sun was up but i cared little now whether or no i was seen and known since jervas rookley knew i had lain hidden those first weeks at applegarth why it mattered little now who else discovered the fact but indeed jervas rookley was not the only one who knew for when i reached applegarth i found the house deserted i banged at the door and for my pains heard the echo ring chill and solitary through an empty house i looked about me not a living being could be seen backwards and forwards i paced in front of those blind windows and the unyielding door i ran to the back of the house thinking i might find an entrance there but the same silence the same deadly indifference were the only response i got i know not what wild fears what horrible surmises passed through my mind it was because the house had sheltered me i cried to myself that desolation made its home there i dropped on the grass and the tears burst from my eyes for i remembered how dorothy had sung within the chambers how her little feet had danced so lightly down the stairs ashlock was already waiting me when i retraced my steps to the honister crag and indeed i was long behind the time to greenrig i said towards evening however ashlocks strength gave out and coming to the house of a farmer i procured a lodging in truth i was wellnigh exhausted myself the next day however ashlock was in no condition to accompany me and leaving a little money which i had with me for his maintenance i went forward on my way alone sleeping now in a cottage now in the fields and little enough in either case using such means of conveyance as chance offered me upon the road i came early in the morning of the sixth to greenrig in northumberland and while wandering hither and thither in search of the place of meeting and yet not daring to inquire for it i came upon a cavalcade it was lord derwentwater at the head of his servants all armed and mounted i ran forward to meet him what is it lad he asked reining in his horse i do not wonder that he had no knowledge of me for my clothes hung about me in tatters no dirtier ragamuffin ever tramped a country road how is it they did not seize your horses i asked with my wits wandering lord derwentwater laughed heartily there is a saying of oliver cromwells he replied that he could gain his end in any place with an assload of gold but who are you that put the question and he bent over his horses neck i caught at the reins to save myself from falling i am lawrence clavering i said you bade me meet you here and with that i swooned away chapter xvii the march to preston it was more from the exhaustion of hunger than any other cause that i fainted and being come to myself i was given food and thereafter accommodated with a horse so that without any great delay the calvacade proceeded to its rendezvous we fell in with mr forster at the top of a hill which they call the waterfalls and swelled his numbers to a considerable degree there being altogether gathered at this spot now that we were come near upon sixty horse gentlemen and their attendants and all armed after a short council it was decided that we should march northwards and meet brigadier macintosh at kelso besides argued mr forster there was great reason to believe that if we did but appear before the walls newcastle would open its gates to us in the which case we should not only add largely to our forces but secure that of which we stood most in need i mean ordnance and ammunition for said he sir william blackett whose interest is very considerable in the town has armed and enlisted in troops all the colliers and keelmen and miners in his pay and does but wait for us to set them in motion accordingly in the height of confidence and good spirits the little band set out towards plainfield on the river coquett though for my part i could but ponder in the greatest distress upon the deserted aspect of applegarth nor was lord derwentwater in any way able to relieve my fears seeing that he had himself been seeking refuge from one place to another i was driven therefore to persuade myself as the best hope which offered that mr curwen and his daughter had embarked in the swallow and were now come safely to france yet somehow the while i persuaded myself my heart sank with the thought of the distance that was between us we came that night to rothbury and sleeping there marched the next morning to warkworth where the day being saturday the th of october mr forster resolved to lie until the monday it was in the parish church of warkworth that mr buxton our chaplain first prayed publicly for king james iii substituting that name for king george and it was in warkworth too that king james was first of all in england proclaimed king of great britain i remember standing in the marketplace listening to the huzzaing of our forces and watching the hats go up in the air with how heavy a heart so that many chided me for the dull face i wore but i was picturing to myself the delight with which dorothy would have viewed the scene i could see her eye sparkle her little hand clench upon her whip i could hear her voice making a harmony of these discordant shouts on monday we rode out of warkworth and being joined by many gentlemen at alnwick and other places and in particular by seventy scots horse at felton bridge marched into morpeth three hundred strong all mounted for we would entertain no foot since we had not sufficient arms even for those we had mounted and moreover were in a great haste to surprise newcastle to this end we hurried to hexham where we were joined by some more scots horse and drew out from there on to a moor about three miles distant it was there that we sustained our first disappointment for intelligence was brought to us from newcastle that the magistrates having got wind of our designs had gathered the trainbands and militia within the walls and that the gates were so far from opening to receive us that they had been walled up and fortified with stone and lime to such a degree of strength that without cannon it was useless to attempt them accordingly we marched chapfallen back to hexham and lay there until the th with no very definite idea of what we should do next however on the th a man came running into the town crying that general carpenter with churchills dragoons and hothams foot and i know not what other regiments had on this very day arrived at newcastle from london and without an instants delay had set about preparing to attack us the news you may be sure threw us into a pretty commotion and the colour of our hopes quite faded messengers sped backwards and forwards between general forster and lord derwentwater and captain shaftoe councils were held broken up reformed again the whole camp hummed and sputtered like a boiling kettle i passed that day in the greatest despair for if this rising failed every way was i undone it was not merely that i should lose my life but i should lose it without securing that for which i had designed it i mean mr herberts liberation in the midst of this flurry and confusion however mr burnett of carlips rode into hexham with a message that viscount kenmure and the earls of nithsdale carnwath and wintoun had entered england from the western parts of scotland and were even now at rothbury mr forster returned an express that we would advance to them the next morning the which we did greatly enheartened by the pat chance of their arrival and being joined together with them marched in a body to wooler on the following day and rested the friday in that village we crossed the tweed and entered kelso on the nd of october and about an hour after our entry the highlanders with their outlandish bagpipes playing the strangest skirling melodies were led in by old mackintosh from the scots side the joy we all had at the sight of them may be easily imagined and indeed the expression of it by some of the baser followers was so extravagant that a man can hardly describe it with any dignity but i think we all hallood them as our saviours and so even persuaded our ears to find pleasure in the rasping of their pipes the next day being sunday lord kenmure ordered that divine service should be held in the great kirk of kelso at which papists and protestants highlanders and englishmen attended very reverently together and i believe this was the first time that the rubric of the church of england was ever read on this side of the forth in scotland mr patten i remember who after turned his coat to save his life preached from a text of deuteronomy the right of the firstborn is his and very eloquent i am told his sermon was though i heard little of it being occupied rather with the gathering of men about me and wondering whether at the long last we had the tips of our fingers upon this muchcontested crown for the highlanders though poorly armed and clad had the hardiest look of any men that ever i saw my great question indeed was whether amongst their nobles they had one who could lead for on our side except for captains nicholas wogan and shaftoe we had few who were versed in military arts and mr forster betrayed to my thinking more of the incompetency of the born parliamentman than the resourceful instinct of the born strategist in which opinion i may say i was fully warranted afterwards by that fatal omission in regard to kibble bridge on the monday morning the highlanders were drawn up in the churchyard and marched thence to the marketplace in all the bravery of flags flying and drums beating and pipes playing there they were formed into a circle and within that circle another circle of the gentlemen volunteers whereof through the bounty of lord derwentwater in supplying me with money and arms i was now become one and within that circle stood the noblemen thereupon a trumpet sounded and silence being obtained the earl of dumferling proclaimed king james and read thereafter the famous manifesto which the earl of mar sent from his camp at perth by the hand of mr robert douglas we continued then in kelso until the following thursday the th of october our force being now augmented what with footmen and horse to the number of fourteen hundred the delay however gave general carpenter time to approach us from newcastle and he on this same thursday came to wooler and lay there the night intending to draw out to kelso and give us battle on the following day no sooner was the intelligence received than lord kenmure calls a council of war and here at once it was seen that our present union was very much upon the surface for whereas earl wintoun was all for marching into the west of scotland others were for passing the tweed and attacking general carpenter for said they in the first place his troops must needs be fatigued and in the second they do not count more than five hundred men all told whereof the regiments of dragoons are newly raised and have seen no service now either of these proposals would in all probability have tended to our advantage but when a multitude of counsels conflict it is ever upon some weak compromise that men fall at last and so it came about that we marched away to jedburgh intending thence to cross the mountains into england here it was that our troubles with the highlanders began for they would not be persuaded to cross the borders saying that once they were in england they would be taken and sold as slaves a piece of ignorance wherein it was supposed lord wintoun had tutored them consequently our plans were changed again and instead of crossing into north tynedale we turned aside to hawick the highlanders protesting that they would not keep with us for the distance of an inch upon english soil from hawick we marched to langholme a little markettown belonging to the duchess of buccleugh and there we made another very great mistake for here the earl of wintoun strongly advised that we should make ourselves masters of dumfries and to that end indeed a detachment of cavalry was sent forward in the night to ecclefechan and no doubt the advice was just and the plan easy of accomplishment dumfries he urged was unfortified either by walls or trainbands it stood upon a navigable river whereby we might have succours from france it opened a passage to glasgow and the possession of so wealthy a town would give us great credit with the country gentlemen thereabouts and so be the means of enlarging the command all these arguments he advanced as lord derwentwater who was present at the council informed me with singular moderation of tone but finding that they made no sort of headway with the english party it is sheer folly and madness he burst out you are so eager to reap your doubtful crops in lancashire that you will not stoop to the corn that lies cut at your feet i tell you there are many stands of arms stored in the tolbooth and a great quantity of gunpowder in the tron steeple which you can have for the mere taking but you will not no you will not good god sirs your kings at stake and if you understand not that your lives and so he bounced out of the room the truth is we of the english party were so buoyed up by the expresses we received from lancashire that nothing would content us but we must march hotfoot into england and though of course i had no part or share in the decision of our course i was none the less glad that our side prevailed nay more glad than the rest since i had an added motive for so long as we remained in scotland there would be no disturbance of administration in england examinations would be conducted assizes would be held and for all i knew mr herbert might be condemned and hanged while we were yet marching and countermarching upon the borders the thought of that possibility was like a sword above my head i raged against my ignorance of the place of mr herberts detention had i but known it i think that in this hesitation of our leaders i would have foregone those chances of escape which the rebellion promised and ridden off at night to deliver myself to the authorities for it was no longer of my dishonour if i failed to bring the matter to a happy event at least for anthony herbert and his wife that i thought but the prospect of failure struck at something deeper within me it seemed in truth to reach out sullying hands towards dorothy i held it in some queer way as a debt to her due in payment for my knowledge of her that i should fulfil this duty to its last letter so whenever these councils were in the holding i would pace up and down before the generals quarters as a man will before the house in which his mistress lies sick and when the counsellors came forth you may be sure i was at lord derwentwaters elbow on the instant and the first to hear the decision agreed upon from langholme then we crossed into england it is no part of my story to describe our march to preston and i need only make mention of one incident during its continuance which had an intimate effect upon my own particular fortunes this incident occurred when we were some ten miles out of penrith the whole army was drawn up upon a hill and lying upon its arms to rest the men i was standing by the side of young mr chorley with my eyes towards appleby when mr richard stokoe who acted as quartermaster to lord derwentwaters troop suddenly cried out behind me lord save us who is this old put of a fellow he mounts the white cockade said young mr chorley turning and shading his eyes with his hand and moves a living arsenal said the other with a laugh yet hardly so dangerous as his companion i should think very like well set her in front of the troops and so march to london with never a shot fired but clavering he cried of a sudden what ails the man but clavering was galloping down the hillside by this time and did not draw rein to answer him for the old put of a fellow and his companion were no other than mr curwen and his daughter a living arsenal was in truth no bad description of the old gentleman for he carried a couple of old muskets slung across his shoulders a pair of big pistols were stuck in his belt another pair protruded from the holsters a long straight sword slapped and rattled against his leg while a woodmans axe was slung across his body when i was a hundred yards from the pair i slackened my horses speed when the hundred yards had narrowed to fifty i stopped altogether for i remembered my unceremonious departure from applegarth and was troubled to think with what mien they would accost me i need however have harboured no fears upon that score for mr curwen cried out i wagered dorothy the sun to a guineapiece that we should find you here i did not take the wager cries dorothy as she drew rein she added demurely but only because he could not have paid had he lost they were followed at a little distance by some half a dozen shepherds and labourers mounted on ponies which to say the least had long since passed their climacteric and armed with any makeshift of a weapon which had happened to come handy the troop drew up in a line and mr curwen surveyed them with some pride they lack a banner said he regretfully i would have had dorothy embroider one of silk for roger purdy in the smock there to carry straighten your shoulders roger a white rose opening on a ground of skyblue but but dorothy had some slight sense of humour says she and so would not then said i with a glance of perplexity towards the girl you are indeed come to join us for i could not but wonder that she who had so resolutely removed her father from the excitement of the preceding intrigues should now second his participation in the greater excitement of the actual conflict indeed he cries i am and dorothy has come so far to wish us a godspeed but will return again with dawson there what did i tell you mr clavering there is a work for the weakest arm but you are surprised i am surprised i answered that mary tyson is not here as well ah said he do you know mr clavering i fear me i have done some injustice to mary tyson i thought her a poor witless body dorothy made a movement and he hurriedly interposed the best of servants but and he glanced again defiantly at his daughter a poor witless body outside the household service but since the messenger came with the constables to applegarth she has shown great good sense except in the matter of simples for indeed my pockets are packed with them the constables came to applegarth i exclaimed bethinking me of jervas rookleys threat and when was that miss curwen i noticed was looking at me with a singular intentness as i uttered the exclamation and gave a little nod of comprehension as i asked the question it was as though my asking it assured her of something which she had suspected when echoed mr curwen with a smile why the morning you left us you were right in your surmise and i take it very kindly that you delayed so long as to scribble your gratitude though that delay was an added danger oh i was right said i though still not very clear as to what it was that i had surmised correctly and again miss curwen nodded yes said he but indeed it was early for travellers but we were waiting for you at the breakfasttable when we first heard the sheriffs horses i was not sure that you would hear them at the back of the house but one of the windows looked down the road said i understanding why he had seen no discourtesy in my precipitate departure i could not in any case give the real reason which had prompted me to that and since here was one offered to me why i thought it best to fall in with it the window about which i hunted so long for the owl i added turning to miss curwen for her manner of a minute ago warned me that she put no great faith in her fathers explanation of my conduct and i was desirous to test the point you hunted vainly said she because the owl flitted one night and so left me in doubt that is true continued mr curwen to me i did not think of the window and indeed was somewhat puzzled by the quickness of your escape for i sent mary tyson to warn you the while i barricaded the door and held a parley with the sheriff from the window she came back to tell me you were gone would she had come back quicker exclaimed dorothy with a shudder why i cried at the sight of her distress was there was there any hurt done oh no not to you i could never forgive myself no not to us replied mr curwen dorothy takes the matter too much to heart had she fired of a purpose she would have been right or very little to blame for i am oldfashioned enough to consider a guest sacred as an altarvessel but since she fired by mistake miss curwen fired i said and shot the sheriff from behind my shoulder continued mr curwen father she entreated covering her face with her hands nay child said he reassuringly there was no great harm done a few weeks with his arm in a sling but i saw the blood redden through his sleeve cried she drawing her hands down from her face and clasping them together and as though to rid herself of the topic she jogged her bridle and rode forward i turned my horse and followed with mr curwen the while he gave me more precise account of what had happened the sheriff took an absurd and threatening tone when he found the door barred which suited me very ill so i bade dorothy load my pistols while i parleyed with the man he threatened me in i know not how many latin words and in a tone of great injury whereupon perceiving that since he spoke a learned tongue and wore the look of a gentleman it would be no derogation i threw down my glove as a gage and challenged him to take it up i shot a glance at mr curwen but he spoke in a simple ordinary voice instead of doing that he continued he disappointed me greatly by a violent flow of abuse which was cut short on the instant by dorothys pistol she was standing behind me who stood on a chair and fired beneath my arm oh the poor dear she cried i have hurt him and plumped down in a faint it was indeed the luckiest accident in the world for the constables seeing their chief wounded were sufficiently scared to stay no longer than gave them time to pick him up but all this occurred a month ago i exclaimed surely the sheriffs men returned in the evening but they found no one at applegarth dorothy and i with mary tyson were on our way to carlisle the other servants i sent to their homes we have good friends at carlisle mr clavering he said with one of his prodigiously cunning winks very good safe friends we said goodbye to them when your army had passed carlisle and so returned home and miss curwen i asked what of her since you come with us she will be safe at home now said he and mary tyson is there to bear her company she will be safe no doubt said i so long as we keep the upper hand we were by this time come to the top of the hill and dorothy was already talking to lord derwentwater so says he coming forward and taking mr curwen by the hand here are the four of us proscribed we will wear our warrants for an order at st jamess palace cries dorothy and at that moment the trumpet sounded a brief leavetake between dorothy and her father and we were marching down the hill mr curwen joined to the gentlemen volunteers his six henchmen enrolled in lord derwentwaters troop dorothy remained behind upon the hilltop with the servant who was to convey her home and though we marched away with our backs towards her i none the less gathered as we went some very distinct impressions of her appearance nor can it be said that they were the outcome of my recollections for when i first saw her riding towards the hill i was only conscious that it was she riding towards me and very wonderful it seemed and afterwards when i heard her voice i was only conscious that it was she who was talking and very wonderful that seemed too but i did not remark the particulars of her appearance now as we were marching away i gained very distinct impressions as for instance of item a little cocked hat like a mans only jauntier item a green ridingcoat item a red waistcoat etc the truth is my head was turned backwards all the time and we had not advanced more than a couple of hundred yards before my horse was turned in the same direction for i let myself fall to the rear until i was on the edge of the troops and then faced about and fairly galloped back to her she was looking with great intentness in the direction precisely opposite to that from which i came and as i halted by her side oh said she turning in the most perfect surprise i did not think that it would be you i expected it would be my father i gathered that i replied from your indifference she answered nothing but industriously stroked the mane of her horse now say owl i added she began to laugh then checked herself and looked at me with the chilliest stare and if i did say owl she asked in a puzzled simplicity would it rain i began to wish that i had not spoken well she insisted what if i did say owl i should say robin redbreast i replied weakly and a very delicate piece of wit to be sure mr clavering says she with her chin in the air you have learnt the soldiers forwardness of tongue let me pray you have learnt his and then thinking i suppose from my demeanour that i was sufficiently abashed she broke off of a sudden i would that i were a man she cried and could swing a sword she looked towards the little army which defiled between the fields with the sun glinting upon musket and scabbard and brought her clenched fist down upon the pommel of her saddle nay said i you have done better than swing a sword you have shot a sheriff though it was by accident she looked at me with a certain timidity you do not blame me for that blame you and why i do not know but you might think it bloodthirsty she said with a quaver in her voice betwixt a laugh and a cry how could i when you swooned the instant afterwards my father told you that she exclaimed gratefully and then but he did not tell you the truth of the matter he said i fired by accident but i did not i meant to fire and she spoke as though she was assuring me of something incredible now what will you say she asked anxiously why said i foolishly since it was done to save your guest oh dear no she interrupted coolly and the anxiety changed to wonder in her eyes indeed mr clavering you must not blame yourself that it was on your account i fired she spoke with the greatest sympathy you have no reason in the world to reproach yourself it was because of my father he threw down his glove from the window and challenged the sheriff to mortal combat with whatever weapons he chose and the sheriff called him mad it was that angered me i think in truth that i was mad and since the pistol was loaded and pointed at the man i i pulled the trigger then she turned to me impulsively you will have a care of my father the greatest care oh promise me that of a truth i will i replied fervently thank you said she and the old friendliness returned to her face we could not keep him from the day that he heard of the rising in northumberland he has been in a fever and he meant to go without our knowing you are familiar with his secrecies she gave a little pathetical laugh he was ever scouring his pistols and guns in the corner when he thought we should not see him he meant to go i feared that he would slip from the house one night like she caught herself up sharply with half a glance at me so it seemed best to encourage him to go openly besides she added slowly bending her head a little over her horses back she seemed to be carefully examining the snaffle i thought it not unlikely that we should find you here ah you had that thought in your mind i cried feeling my heart pulse within me indeed it turns my promise to a sacred obligation what one man can do to keep your father safe believe it shall be done by me i was looking towards the receding army as i spoke and a new thought struck me you would have let me go i exclaimed in reproach without a hint of your request had i not come back to you she coloured for an instant but instead of answering the question i knew you would come she began and broke off suddenly yes why did you come back she asked in a voice of indifferent curiosity i had not said goodbye to you you gave me no chance and it hurt me to part from you that way but i thought that was your custom she replied with some touch of resentment underneath the carelessness it would not have been the first time you were careful not to leave a light burning in the stables the last night you quitted applegarth i saw that you knew yes said she hurriedly i heard your foot upon the gravel but i said goodbye to the candle in your window all that night until the morning broke from a shoulder of high stile i had to go there were reasons she interrupted me again in a great hurry and with so complete a change of manner that i wondered for a moment whether mary tyson had related to her the conversation at the gate of the garden i have no wish to hear them she said with a certain pride nor i to tell you of them i returned and doubtless i spoke in a humble and despondent voice i do not know the secret she said gently but if i can help you at all she relapsed into gentleness why you are helping me and i would gladly pay you in the same coin nay said i shaking my head no one can help me it is my own fault and i must redeem it by myself it was a little thing in the beginning only i did not face it it grew into a trouble still i did not face it now the trouble has grown into a disaster and i must face it she sat her horse in silence for a moment i have known for a long while that there was some trouble upon you but are you sure she turned her face frankly to me are you sure i cannot help because i am a woman after all she said with a whimsical smile miss curwen said i if this was a case wherein any woman could fitly help me believe me i would come to you first in all this world but i hesitated feeling it in truth very difficult to say what yet remained but i had already said too much i had said too much when i told her i had watched the light in her window and the consciousness of that compelled me to go on but the business is too sordid i would have no woman meddle in it least of all you the trouble is the outcome of my own wilful folly and my one prayer is that i draw the consequence of it solely upon my head i gathered up the reins and prepared to ride away well said she in a voice that trembled ever so little we may at least shake hands and she held out her hand to me and observe mr clavering she continued with a smile i say hands laying some emphasis upon the word i could not take it i have not even the right i said to touch you by the fingertips but and i drew in a breath if ever i regain that right you will she interrupted her voice ringing her face flushing her eyes bright and sparkling i am sure of that you will the confidence however misplaced was none the less very sweet to me and i felt it lift my heart for a moment but then even if that comes true i replied there will still be a barrier which will prevent you and me from shaking hands and that barrier will be a prisondoor she started at the word as though with some comprehension and since i had no heart to explain to her more concerning the pit into which i had fallen i raised my hat and rode down the hill it seemed to me that the prisondoor was even then shutting between us in the open air for these last days i had lost my hopes that in this rising we should succeed the chessboard was spread open and the chessmen ranged upon the board we had no pawns and only novices to direct the game there was general wills in front of us and general carpenter behind us and moreover one question dinning in our ears at every village where we halted at every town where we encamped where is the king with the king in the midst of us who knows but what the country might have risen but alas the king was not as yet even in scotland and since he delayed what wonder that our lukewarm friends in england tarried too all this flashed through my mind as i rode down the hillside and the reflection brought with it another thought i turned in my saddle i could just see miss curwen disappearing on the further side of the hill and again i rode up to the top and descended with a shout towards her should we fail i cried hurriedly should the usurper hold his own and you think he will i know she answered you told me so a minute ago when you spoke of the prisondoor her words fairly took my breath away i stared at her dumbfoundered did she know my story then but if we fail what then and her question brought me back to her own necessities why there will be a great danger for you at applegarth she turned to me very solemnly if we fail she said keep that word you pledged to me i shall treasure the pledge knowing you will not break it guard my father but it is of you that i am thinking of me she said why if needs be i suppose i i can shoot another sheriff and with a plaintive little laugh she set the spur to her horse i rode across the hill and once upon the flat galloped after our regiments the expression of her confidence was as a renewal of my blood it sang in my ears sweet like a tune dimly remembered and heard again across a waste of years i would fulfil that double trust i cried with a leaping heart and then in more humility fell to a prayer that so i might be permitted for it was a double trust i felt it was not merely that i was pledged to the safeguarding of her father but it seemed to me that i was no less firmly pledged to bring about that other and more difficult result i must regain the right to hold her hand in mine even though i might win no advantage from the right chapter xviii at preston and afterwards the siege of preston forms no part of this story and fortunately so for me since i saw and understood of its brief and fatal enactment no more than was done under my own nose why general wills and his dragoons were allowed to pass the ribble bridge and the narrow lane which leads to it without so much impediment as a single shot might cause why mr forster made no attempt to break out down the fishergate street into the marshes beyond the town when general carpenter closed in upon our rear by what persuasions the highlanders were finally induced to lay down their arms these are questions for historians to dispute and find answer to if they can for my part i fought at macintoshs barrier a little below the church where the first attack was made with one eye upon prestons regiment of foot in front and the other upon mr curwen at my side and what with the enemy and my friend my hands were full the attack was made about eleven of the forenoon i remember very distinctly the extraordinary hush that fell upon us when our friends from the windows of the houses above us signalled that the troops were approaching in front stretched the empty street so still so bare in the sunlight and taking on of a sudden an appalling significance half an hour before messengers had ridden hither and thither with resounding hoofs patrols tramped upon the footway citizens peeped timorous from casement and door we had glanced down it as we looked to our weapons with a matteroffact word this way they will come now it seemed to wait in a conscious expectation the responsible agent of destiny france scotland england every country in europe had a stake to be played for in this street and it was as though it had been newswept and garnished for the game i know that every cobble throughout its length seemed to gleam in the sunlight distinct and separate from its fellows and then whilst we stood silent behind the barrier while from the windows the highlanders bent forward craning their necks grasping their muskets the deadly silence was broken by the ringing tramp of a single horse and from a passage at the side betwixt two houses in the middle distance an officer rode out into the open causeway with his drawn sword in his hand for a moment every man of us i think held his breath the officer looked up the street to the barrier and again down the street and at the windows to see how our men were posted then a shout went up loud unanimous like a single voice with a single movement every musket was raised to the shoulder and in a second the air whistled with bullets and flashed in a hundred tiny flames but it seemed the officer bore a charmed life no bullet struck him then and cantering back within the shelter of the passage he presently led out and ranged his men the men were prestons regiment the officer their lieutenantcolonel the lord forrester and with their appearance the battle was begun in earnest i have hinted that i had some difficulty in restraining mr curwens ardour and lord forrester gives me an instance pat to the point for during that moments silence when the colonel stood alone in the street mr curwen climbs unsteadily to the top of the barrier and with his white hair blowing from his shoulders his dreamy eyes ablaze with i know not what fancies of antique chivalry calls upon the colonel to settle then and there with him in single combat the succession to the crown or rather begins to call i should say for the moment at which he began to speak was precisely that moment at which i saw the muskets go up to the shoulders and leaping after him i pulled him unceremoniously down and here we found the value of our cannon for we had two pieces at our barricade and though they failed at first it was owing to a sailor who professing skill and experience was entrusted with the management of them and who aiming at prestons regiment in the street with great ingenuity brought down a chimney from the tops of the houses the truth is the man was full with ale but having got rid of him we fared better and firing securely from behind the barrier did so much execution as made our adversaries draw off that night we remained at the barrier firing platoons whenever a light appeared in those houses which we knew to be occupied by our opponents and getting such sleep as we could to fit us for the morrow the next morning however we heard that general carpenter by forced marches had come upon our rear so that the town was invested about and there was no way for us except by the gates of death and at the same time many rumours of a capitulation were spread abroad which drove the highlandmen into a frenzy all the morning then we remained in the greatest uncertainty but about three of the afternoon colonel cotton rode up the street with a dragoon and a drum beating a chamade before him and then we knew that these rumours were indeed the truth he alighted at the mitre whither we presently saw lord kenmure mr forster and lord widdrington making haste to join him and in a little came a messenger to us seeking lord derwentwater he was at the moment digging in a trench to deepen it with his waistcoat off and slipping on his clothes curse the fellow he cried and so turned to me lawrence never trust a tory if you outlive this misfortune never speak to one they are damned rogues in disguise heres lord widdrington good tender man that cannot travel without his soup in a bottle curse the fellow all yesterday while you and i and the rest of my good friends here were pleading the cause with the only music our enemies will dance to what was my lord widdrington doing but sitting in an alehouse licking his bottle of soup the gout he blames well well the gout is a very opportune complaint and so striking his hands together to remove the mud from them off he goes to the mitre it was some little while before he returned to me during which i bethought me not so much of the pass into which i had fallen as the means by which i might extricate myself for extricate myself i must there was mr herbert in the first place here was the end of our insurrection and i thrown back upon my first plan of delivering myself to the authorities and in the second i must needs get mr curwen to some spot in which he could lie safely until such time as the matter had blown over and furthermore to these two duties was yet added a third and new obligation yet i think it was this last which enheartened me to confront the other two for there was something very sweet in the mere notion of it which leavened all my distress in about two hours came lord derwentwater back and drawing me aside it is not a capitulation he said but a mere surrender forster is given till seven of the morning to reconcile his troops to it meanwhile i go with colonel cotton as a hostage he pulled out his purse as he spoke and rummaging in his pockets added to it such coins as he had loose about him we will divide them said he nay they will be of more service to you than to me i was quartered with an apothecary you know the house a man very discreet and loyal doubtless he will do for you what he can if you add my recommendation to your request it may be that you can escape since you are hampered with no companions and are little known nay i replied i have mr curwen to safeguard if by any means i can he gave me shelter and every kindness when i was at my wits ends besides and then i came to a stop and felt myself flushing hot but hoped the grime of the gunpowder would hide my confusion well he asked shrewdly besides besides i stammered i promised his daughter ah said he i told you it would be dorothy curwen and with that he shook me by the hand but at the touch i realized of a sudden all the love and friendliness which he had shown to me from my first coming into cumberland i had a picture before my eyes of the house on lords island my lord and his lady in the cosy parlour the children in their cots above i looked into his face it was bravely smiling the chill november evening was crowding upon us as we stood there in the street the lights began to shine in the windows close to us a soldier was cursing mr forster beyond the barrier down the street one of wills dragoons was roaring out a song and before the mitre door under the lamp colonel cotton was sitting on his horse i could say nothing to lord derwentwater but what would point his misfortunes and so my lord i cried simply god send that you and i may meet again god send no answer to that wish lawrence he replied solemnly he walked lightly to the mitre door as lightly as a man to his wedding he mounted his horse his face shone clear for a moment beneath the lamp and that was the last glimpse i had of it he rode down the street with colonel cotton i made my way in all haste to the apothecary with whom he had lodged i had some talk with the apothecary of which the purport will appear hereafter and returned for mr curwen whom i found immediately and my servant ashlock whom i did not find until late in the evening for he had been employed in carrying gunpowder from barrier to barrier so that i knew of no fixed spot where i could lay my hands on him however as i say i found him at the last and when general wills marched into preston marketplace at seven oclock of the monday morning mr lawrence clavering with a blue apron about his waist was taking down the shutters from the apothecarys shop while mr curwen much broken by fatigue and disappointment lay abed in an attic of the house with ashlock to tend on him all that day which was monday the th of november i lived in a jumping anxiety for the shop from morn to night was beset with people seeking remedies for the wounded these people however for the most part belonged to general wills force and luckily the citizens of the town had so much to distract them in the spectacle of the troops and of the prisoners now ranged in the marketplace now marched off and locked up in the church and in their own joy at escaping from the siege with so little damage that they forgot those trivial ailments which bring them to the apothecarys so the new journeyman pounding drugs in a corner as far from the window as he could creep escaped notice for that day and lay down to sleep beneath the counter with a mind a thought easier than his aching arm in something less than a minute it seemed to me i felt a tug at my coat i started up with a cry and looking to see the red coat of a soldier beheld the homely brown of my friend the apothecary his hat was on his head the door of the shop stood open and the full daylight poured into it thomas he said with a whimsical glance through his spectacles i cannot do with an idle apprentice i must cancel your indentures what do you mean i asked willy nilly i must keep you for today since i have a little journey to take and i cannot leave the shop untended but tomorrow thomas you must go with that he grew more particular and informed me that general carpenter intended to lead his troops to wigan no later than this very morning since they could not be housed in preston and were moreover in sore need of rest from the rapidity of their march general wills he continued is left to guard the prisoners and that doubtless he can do but he cannot watch the streets as well thereupon he gave me some directions as to what answers i should give to his customers and went off upon his errand and as a result of this errand on the wednesday evening the apothecary took a walk he walked down the fishergate street and every now and again when a watchman or an officer going his rounds approached he knocked twice upon the pavement with a heavy cane he carried and maybe loitered for a little until the officer had passed there were three men following him whereof one i can affirm kept his hand beneath his greatcoat tightly clasped about the butt of a loaded pistol and whenever that double knock sounded the three men dived into the first alley that presented the apothecarys walk led across the marsh to the rivers bank the marsh itself might be deemed an unlikely spot for a comfortable citizen to take the air in when the night mist was smoking up from it to a november moon but the rest of his peregrination was more extraordinary still for he chose that point of the bank at which the river shallows and makes a ford and without hesitation waded across on the opposite side he waited for the three who followed to come up with him which they did with a little delay since two of them were old and the footing not the steadiest in the world half a mile along the bank the apothecary went forward and whistled a boat slipped out from a clump of alders and the fugitives stepped on board there was a hurried whisper of thanks from the boat a bluff poohpoohing of them from the bank and the boatman pushed off we kept down the stream for some two hours and disembarking again after once more recrossing the river struck slantwise over the fields and so towards morning came to a fishermans cottage set amongst the sandhills by the sea it was here that my apothecary was wont to come upon his holidays and spend the time fishing and he could have hit upon no refuge better suited to my purpose my first thought however when the boatman admitted us into his cottage was for mr curwen it was now some hours since he had waded through the ford and what with his wet limbs and the weary tramp across the fields i was afraid lest he might fall into some dangerous fever i was the more inclined to credit this fear from a perception that he was more troubled and downcast than i had seen him even after our submission and defeat accordingly i asked the boatman to lend him some woollen stockings and other dry garments which the man very readily did and set before us thereafter a meal mr curwen however eat little or nothing but sat shaking his head as though the world had crumbled about his ears i made an effort therefore to rally him into the recovery of his good spirits though with the heaviest heart all was not lost i said for here were we with whole skins in a secure retreat while on the other hand the earl of mar might be winning who knows what victories in scotland it is not of the king he replied regretfully nor of myself that i was thinking it was of my daughter i fear me mr clavering i have given too much thought to a cause in which i was of the smallest use and too little to dorothy with whom my duty lay he spoke in a breaking voice and with a gleam of tears in his lacklustre eyes mr curwen said i changing my note on the instant on the sunday afternoon at the barricade i bethought me with all humility of the path which i must take through this tangle of our misfortunes i saw very clearly that there were three duties enjoined on me the first was to help you to security if by any means i could nay i said as he raised a hand in deprecation it was a promise i made to your daughter and believe me it is one of the few comforts left to me in what remains of life that i see some prospect of carrying that promise to a successful issue the second duty was to bring your daughter dorothy and it was my voice now which broke upon the word safely to you that i have promised to myself but i hold it no less sacred than the first he reached out a hand to me across the table and the third he asked timidly it is the payment of a debt i replied a debt incurred by me to be repaid by me and i put it last not because it is of less incumbency than the other two but because it ends my life and with my life such poor service as i can do my friends it ends your life he exclaimed so i do hope i replied and since i meant the words i can but trust there was no boastfulness in the expression for it is my life alone that can now set the tally straight god knows my trouble lies not in the payment but in the means of payment for there are matters which i do not know and it may be that i shall waste my life this i said thinking of my ignorance as to where mr herbert lay imprisoned i had a plan in my head it is true which offered me some chance of accomplishing this duty but it only offered me a chance mrs herbert had promised me that she would remain in the lodging at keswick and during the interval since i had last set eyes on her she might well have received news of her husbands whereabouts but would she keep the promise she had every reason in the world to distrust me would she keep the promise i had so urgently besought of her mr clavering said my friend i told you just now i was afeared i had thought too much of the king and too little of my dorothy but these words of yours put even that better thought to the blush you have been at my elbow all the last days protecting me you have brought about my escape you are planning how to save my daughter and all this while you have seen you young in the sap of your strength you have seen the limits of your life near to you as that barrier by the church was near to us at preston and not a word of it have you spoken while we have bemoaned ourselves and made no secret of our misery not a word have you spoken not a hint has your face betrayed mr curwen i beg of you i replied quickly for the praise jarred on me as well it might a man does not speak what it shames him even to think of but to my plan i drew from my pocket a sheet of paper and a pencil with which i had provided myself before i quitted the apothecarys shop your sloop the swallow should be lying now off the mouth of the esk by ravenglass mr curwen started at my abrupt remark was it merely that amidst the turmoil and hurry of the last weeks he had clean forgotten his design to set me over into france or was it that he had countermanded his order since that night when i had fled from applegarth it should be cruising thereabouts to pick me up i said feeling my heart drumming against my breast i did not dare to put the question in its naked directness it should have reached ravenglass by now mr curwen sat staring at me the ship the ship i mean oh answer me i cried answer me yes he said slowly the swallow should be now at ravenglass that is true he seemed to be assuring himself of the fact and speculating on its import you sent no message to prevent it sailing after i left you none said he i drew a breath of relief but we are now at the fifteenth of november how long did you bid the captain wait mr curwen seemed of a sudden to grasp my design though as he showed me in a moment he had got no more than an inkling of it until you hailed him he replied rising from his chair in some excitement he was to wait for you that was the top and bottom of his orders there was no time fixed for your coming then said i in an excitement not a whit less than his the swallow will be waiting now up the coast in the little room we could hear the surf booming upon the sand i flung open the window the sound swelled of a sudden as though the music of a spinet should magically deepen to an organharmony your swallow i exclaimed lifts and falls upon the very waves which we hear breaking on the sands mr curwen stepped over to my side the sandhills stretched before us white under the moon and with a whisper from the grasses which crowned them i found a cheering comfort in their very desolation beyond the sandhills the sea leaped and called tossing to and fro a hundred jewelled arms i felt my heart leaping with the waves answering their call and the fresh brine went stinging through my veins northwards i cried reaching out an arm round the point there up the coast beyond morcambe bay the swallow waits for us it is no great distance mr curwen god save lord bolingbroke who betrayed the catalans i heard my voice ring with an exultation i had not known for many a day i strained my eyes northwards along the sea it seemed to my heated fancies that the barrier of the shores fell back my vision leaped over cape and bay and where the esk poured into the sea by muncaster fell i seemed to see the swallow its black mast tapering across the moon i seemed to hear the grinding of its cable as it strained against the anchor then very quickly mr curwen spoke at my side there is my daughter in this great hope of ours are we not forgetting her nay i replied it is of your daughter i am thinking you trust your captain you say you trust your captain will be waiting now if so he will be waiting a fortnights time he waits until i come i drew mr curwen back to the table look you mr curwen i marched with mr forster from the outset of the rising we crossed from the cheviots into england on the st of november we proclaimed king james in preston marketsquare upon the th nine days enclosed our march and we marched in force there were other necessities beyond that of speed to order our advance there was food to be requisitioned towns to be chosen for a camp wherein our troops could quarter at penrith at appleby we drew up for battle all this meant delay some of us rode no doubt but our pace was the pace of those who walked and mark nine days enclosed our march a man alone and free to choose his path would shear two days from that nine maybe three i cannot choose my path there will be hindrances i must travel for the chief part by night but i have not so far to go grant me nine days then it is the sixteenth nay the seventeenth on the twentysixth i should be knocking at the door of applegarth nay said he you will be captured you have risked enough for us more than enough mr clavering i cannot permit that you should go yet said i with a smile you will find that easier than to prevent me you told me of a safe route between applegarth and ravenglass i continued how long will it take a woman to traverse it i called it safe he answered doubtfully making dots upon the paper with the point of his pencil because it stretched along the watersheds but that was in september now it may be there will be snow the winter indeed had fallen early that year yes the snow might be deep on the hills i had a picture before my eyes of dorothy struggling through it then we will add another day i answered and strove to make the answer light given that other day how long shall we take from applegarth to ravenglass three days said he or thereabouts nine days and three twelve together your daughter mr curwen shall be on board the swallow by the twentyninth meanwhile i think you can lie safely here with ashlock from ravenglass the sloop shall sail directly here and taking you up make straight for france so sketch me here the way from applegarth mr curwen drew a rough outline on the paper while i bent over him you will mount to the top of gillerthwaite he said then bear to the right betwixt great gable and the pillar descend the grass into mosedale here is wastdale church strike westwards thence to the great gap between scafell and the screes this is burnmoor five miles of it and there is no water after you pass burnmoor tarn until you have come down to eskdale cross eskdale towards the sea the long ridge here is muncaster fell keep along the slope of it and god send you see the swallow he gave me the paper i folded it carefully and thrust it into my pocket then i took up my hat and held out my hand to him he took it and still clasping it came to the door with me and out into the open mr clavering he said when you first came to applegarth i told you that i had lost a son tonight i seem to have found another and it would be a great joy to me if when the swallow puts in here i could see that second son upon its deck i stood for a moment looking at him his words so tempted me the difficulties of the adventure which lay before me became trivial in my eyes as the crossing of a muddy road my fancy bridging all between jumped to the moment when the swallow should loose its sails with dorothy on board i saw myself in imagination standing by her side watching the cumberland hills lessen and dwindle the while we streamed down the coast towards the sandbanks here then you shall see me i longed to cry but the thought of another woman weeping by a lonely lamp in keswick crept into my heart and thereafter the thought of a man lying somewhere kennelled in a prison chapter xix applegarth again i travelled along the beach until i reached the southern cape of morecambe bay and only now and again swerved inland when i espied ahead of me the smoke and houses of a village this i did more for safetys sake than for any comfort or celerity in the act of walking indeed the sand which being loose and dry slipped and yielded with every step i took did i think double the labour and tedium of my journey but on the other hand the country by the seacoast was flat so that i could distinguish the figures of people and the direction of their walk at a long distance a doubtful advantage you may say and one that cut both ways and so it would have been but for the grassy sandhills which embossed the wide stretch of shore it was an easy thing to drop into the grass at the first sight of a stranger and crawl down into the hollows betwixt the hillocks and had such an one pursued me he would have had the most unprofitable game of hideandseek that ever a man engaged in i had other reasons besides for keeping near the sea for since i travelled chiefly by night and in the late and early quarters of the day i had need of a restingplace when the day was full now so long as i kept to the coast i had ever one ready to my hand amongst these lonely and desolate sandhills where i was easily able to scoop out a bed and so lie snug from the wind for another thing i had thus the noise of the sea continually in my ears i did not know in truth what great store i set on that until a little short of lancaster i turned my back on it the sea sang to me by day and by night lulling me like a cradlesong when i lay cushioned among the sandhills inspiriting as the drums of an army when i walked through the night it was not merely that it told me of the swallow swinging upon its tides and of the great hopes i drew therefrom but it spoke too with voices of its own and whether the voices whispered or turbulently laughed it was always the same perplexing mystery they hinted of they seemed to signify a message they could not articulate and it came upon me sometimes as i sat tired by the shore that i would fain sit there and listen until i had plucked out the kernel of its meaning i used to fancy that once a man could penetrate to that and hold it surely there would be little more he needed to know but he would carry it with him as a magic crystal wherein he could see strangely illuminated and made plain the eternal mysteries which girded him about from morecambe bay i turned inland towards the borders of yorkshire and passing to the east of kirby lonsdale that i might avoid the line of forsters march curved round again towards grasmere here i began to redouble my precautions seeing that i was come into a country where my face and recent history might be known for since i had left the coast i had voyaged in no great fear of detection taking a lift in a carriers cart when one chanced to pass my way and now and again hiring a horse for a stage the apothecary at preston in addition to his other benefactions had provided me with an inconspicuous suit of clothes and as i had money in my pockets wherewith to pay my way i was able to press on unremarked or at least counted no more than a merchants clerk travelling upon his masters business from grasmere i mounted by the old path across cold barrow fell which had first led me to blackladies and keeping along the ridge crept down into keswick late upon the seventh day there was no light in mrs herberts lodging as i slipped down the street and for a second i was seized with a recurrence of my fear that she had left the town it was only for a second however for that conviction which i had first tasted when i rode down gillerthwaite in the early morning had been growing stronger and stronger within me more especially of late i was possessed by some instinctive foreknowledge that the occasion for which i looked would come that somehow somewhere i should be enabled to bring forward my testimony to the clearing of mr herbert from the imputation of disloyalty it was a thought that more and more i repeated to myself and each time with a stouter confidence it may be that these more immediate tasks to which i had set my hand i mean the rescue of mr curwen and his daughter from the consequence of participation in the rebellion hindered me from looking very closely into the difficulties of the third and last it may be too that this conviction was in some queer way the particular message which the sea had for me that i had received the message unconsciously while pondering what it might be i do not know i only know that when i repeated it to myself it sounded like nothing so much as the booming of waves upon a beach i slept that night under a familiar boulder on the hillside above applegarth and in the early morning i came down to the house and without much ceremony roused the household mary tyson poked her head out of a window miss dorothy i cried she is asleep wake her up and let me in so i was in time mary tyson came down and opened the door and in a little as i waited in the hall i heard dorothys footsteps on the stairs you have escaped she cried and my father you bring bad news of him no i thank god for it i bring good news and the blood came into her cheeks with a rush i told her briefly how we had escaped from preston she listened to the story with shining eyes and all this you have done for for us she said with a singular note of pride in her voice it is little i replied even if whats left to do crowns it successfully but if in that we go astray why it is less than nothing thereupon i told her of the plan which i had formed with regard to the swallow and of the journey which she and i must take she listened to me now however with an occupied air and interrupted me before i had come to a close it is you who have done this she repeated in the same tone which she had used before i did but keep my promise it was made to you i answered simply i am your debtor for all my life no i cried it is the other way about i do not feel the debt she said very softly and then raising a face all rosy ah but i let you stand here she exclaimed you shall tell me more of your plan while we breakfast for i am not sure that i gave a careful ear to it and taking me by the arm she led me towards the diningroom you have come from preston in all this haste my poor child she spoke in a quite natural tone of pity and i doubt not but what my appearance gave a reasonable complexion to her pity it was the motherliness however which tickled me what is it you laugh at she asked suddenly her voice changing at once to an imperious dignity i was thinking said i that your head miss curwen only reaches to my chin if god made me a dwarf said she with a freezing stateliness it is very courteous of you to reproach me with it the most delicate courtesy upon my word she was in truth ever very sensitive as to her height and anxious to appear taller than she was for which anxiety there was no reason whatever since she was just of the right stature and an inch more or less would have been the spoiling of her which opinion i most unfortunately expressed to her and so made matters worse for said she your condescension mr clavering is very amiable and consoling and with that she left me alone in the room until such a time as breakfast should be ready i went out however in search of mary tyson and finding her explained my design and asked her to put together in a bundle the least quantity of clothes which would suffice for dorothy until she reached france mary fell in with the plan immediately and began to regret her age and bulk that would hinder her from keeping pace with us but i cut short her discourse and bidding her hasten on the breakfast made shift with a basin of water and a towel to hurriedly repair the disarray of my toilet for now every instant of delay began to drag upon my spirits once upon the hillside it would be strange i thought if we did not contrive to come undetected to ravenglass we had to cross two valleys it is true but they were both rugged and bleak with but few dwellings scattered about them and those only of the poorer sort inhabited by men cut off from the world by the barrier of the hills who from very ignorance could not if they would meddle in their neighbours affairs the one danger of the journey that i foresaw lay as i have said in the great fall of snow but here within the walls of the house it was altogether different danger seemed impending about me every moment i looked to hear the beat of hoofs upon the road and a knocking on the door it was i assured myself the most unlikely thing that on this one day the officers should come for dorothy curwen but the assurance brought me little comfort i tasted in anticipation all the remorse which i should feel if the girl should be taken at the very moment of deliverance i was the more glad therefore when on coming into the garden i found dorothy already dressed for the journey in a furred waistcoat and a hood quilted and lined with a rosecoloured taffety that is wise said i for i fear me miss curwen we shall have it cold before we get to our journeys end she said never a word but stood looking at me and if glances could make one cold i should have been shivering then but let me be quick i continued is it known that you are at applegarth have you ridden far abroad and in my anxiety i went over to the window and gazed down the road neither did she answer my questions but standing by the fireplace in an even deliberate voice she began to read me a lecture upon my manners miss curwen i cried do you understand every moment you stay here every word you speak imperils your liberty she waited patiently until i had done and continued her lecture at the point where i had interrupted her as though i had not so much as spoken at all this is the purest wilfulness i interrupted again being indeed at my wits end to know how i should stop her i think that i showed too much anxiety with my bobbings at the window and exclamations and that seeing my alarm she prolonged her speech out of sheer perversity to punish me the more at last however she came to an end and we set ourselves to the breakfast in silence however i was too hot with indignation to keep that silence wisely the most illtimed talk that ever i heard i muttered she laid her knife and fork on the instant and quietly recommenced i rose from the table in a rage and by a lucky chance hit upon the one argument that would close her lips you forget said i that your fathers safety depends on your escape if you and i are taken here how shall he get free and in a very few minutes after that i took up the bundle mary tyson had made ready and we crossed the threshold of applegarth and made our way up gillerthwaite it was still early in the morning but i pushed on with perhaps greater urgency than suited my companion since i was anxious that we should lie that night in eskdale dorothy indeed walked more slowly than was usual with her and there seemed to me to be an uncertainty in her gait at which i was the more surprised since the wind blew from the east and we who were moving eastwards were completely sheltered from it by the cliffs of great gable towering at the head of the valley the steeper the ascent became the greater grew the uncertainty of movement so that i began to feel anxious lest some sickness should have laid hold upon her i thought it best however to say nothing of my suspicion but contented myself with glancing at her stealthily now and again there was no hint of sickness discoverable upon her face only she pursed her lips something sullenly as though she was persisting in what she knew to be wrong and once i thought that her eyes caught one of my troubled glances and she coloured like one ashamed at last just as we had topped the summit of the pass and were beginning to descend the broad grassy cliffs between that mountain and the pillar she spoke and it was the first time she had opened her lips since we had left applegarth it is an apology you need i suppose said she with a singular aggressiveness and my anxiety increased for since i could not see that i had given her any occasion to take that tone i was inclined to set it down to some bodily suffering an apology i asked with an effort at a careless laugh and what makes you fancy i need that it is so she insisted else you would not be glowering at me in this illhumour nay i answered seriously i am in no illhumour you are she interrupted almost viciously you are in the worst illhumour in the world well i do apologize i should not have kept you waiting at applegarth and i do not think that i ever heard an apology tendered with a worse grace and now that i have begged your pardon she continued i will carry my own bundle thank you and she held out her hand for it no indeed and that you will not do said i hotly if you beg pardon from now to doomsday it is perfectly plain said she that you mean to pick a quarrel with me now that i took to be the most unjust statement that she could make and who began it i asked who began the quarrel it is a question she replied with the utmost contempt that children ask in a nursery and very haughtily she marched in front of me down the hillside we had not gone more than a few yards before i stopped only half stifling the cry which rose to my lips i plumped down on the grass and fumbled in my pockets dorothy paused in her walk turned and came back to me what is it she cried and i must suppose noting my face her tone changed in an instant lawrence what is it what is the paper the paper was that on which mr curwen had sketched the line of our journey we were come to the curve in our descent into mosedale from which that line was visible as plainly marked on the face of the country as on the paper which i held in my hand on the ridge of the horizon i could see the long back of muncaster fell but it was not that which troubled me we could keep on the western flank of muncaster fell it was that gap between scafell and the screes which leads on to burnmoor i looked east and west this gap that i see i said to myself is not the gap which mr curwen meant there will be another there will be another but all the time i knew most surely that this was the gap and that over it stretched our path slantwise across wastdale and bearing to the right mr curwen had said well wastdale lay at my feet its fields marked off by their stone walls like the squares on a chessboard yes that indeed was our way why i could see burnmoor tarn of which he had made particular mention and and it lay like a pool of ink upon a sheet of white paper there was the trouble the wind had blown from the southeast this many a day and with the wind the snow so that while in gillerthwaite in ennerdale in newlands through which i had come to applegarth i had seen the snow only upon the hilltops and had not been troubled with it at all there on burnmoor it was massed from end to end and burnmoor was five miles across i looked at dorothy could she traverse it she that was ailing five miles of snow and the wind sweeping across those five miles like a wave for there was no doubt but we should have the wind if i looked upwards towards scafell i could see as it were the puff of a cannons smoke rising up into the air that was the wind whirling the snow if i looked downwards into wastdale i could see the yewtrees by the church tossing their boughs wildly this way and that i could hear it rushing and seething in mosedale bottom i looked at dorothy and my anxiety grew to alarm what is it troubles you she said again well somehow or another this line had to be traversed i should serve no end by increasing her suffering with an anticipation of the evils before us nothing i answered thrusting the paper back into my pocket i was wondering whether or no i had mistaken our road and i rose to my feet i could perceive from her face that she knew i was concealing some obstacle from her she turned abruptly from me and led the way without a word i followed noticing with an everincreasing dismay how more and more she wavered as the descent grew steeper and then all at once i caught sight of something which set me laughing loudly extravagantly as a man will at the sudden coming of a great relief dorothy stopped and regarded me not so much in perplexity as in the haughtiest displeasure good lack i cried nay dont stare at me i cannot but laugh for i believe it was the beginning of a fever troubled you and now i know it to be a pair of heels she flushed very red and turned herself to face me so that i could no longer see more than the tips of her toes i know too the cause of your anger against me it was a mere consciousness that you should not be wearing them oh what a wiseacre says dorothy confiding her opinion to the rocks about her what a wonderful perceptive wiseacre how miss curwen is honoured with his acquaintance all this in a tone of quiet sarcasm which would have been more effectual had she not stamped her foot upon the ground for on stamping the heel slipped upon a loose stone and had i not been near enough to catch her the next instant she would have been lying fulllength on the ground she gave something of a cry as i caught her and sitting down panted for a little we both contemplated the heels then i drew out the paper again from my pocket it was this i was considering and i handed it to her mr curwen sketched it for me and it is the way we have to go i pointed out the gap and the snow upon burnmoor she followed the direction of my gaze with a shiver and again but this time with equal melancholy we fell to contemplating the heels i put them on she explained with a touch of penitence before you said that about my father but you could have changed them afterwards i rejoined foolishly and for my pains saw the penitence harden into exasperation besides i cannot walk at all without heels says she briskly making a catch at her assurance you cannot walk with them i know thats a sure thing i persisted she turned to me very quietly in spite of this great knowledge of yours mr clavering of which during the last minute i have heard so much she began deliberately there is one lesson you have yet to learn and practise i have remarked the deficiency not only on this but on many occasions you lack that instinct of tact and discretion which would inform you of the precise moment when you have said enough how much longer she would have continued in this strain i do not know for i sprang to my feet if it is to be another lecture i cried i accept the conclusion before it is reached i can guess at it heels are your only wear and the taller the better sailors should be enjoined by law to wear them and they alone preserve the ropedancer from a sure and inevitable death a wiseacre first says she ticking off my qualities upon her fingers and now a humorist well there a salad bowl of all the estimable virtues estimably jumbled and meanwhile she asked innocently are we not wasting time i wellnigh gasped at her audacity for who was to blame if not she with the heels however this time i was sufficiently wise to keep silence leaving it to experience to reprove her as it most surely would in which conviction i was right for more than once she tripped on the grass as we descended halfway down she reluctantly allowed me to assist her with a hand and as we two moved along the side of mosedale beck at the entrance into wastdale she wrenched her ankle the pain of the wrench luckily was not severe and lasted no great while she was in truth more startled than hurt for we were treading the narrowest steep path and at the side the rocks fell clear for about twenty feet to the torrent thereupon she gave in and allowed me to go forward to a farmhouse lying at no great distance in wastdale and procure for her footgear of a more suitable kind and comical enough it looked when she put it on but i dared not laugh or so much as give hint of a smile since i saw that her eyes were on the alert to catch me for the worthy housewife hearing a story that i made up about a young girl who was travelling in a great haste across ennerdale to visit a father who lay sick beyond there which story was altogether a lie though every word of it was truth made me a present of a pair of her own boots and would take no money for them these dorothy put on i slipped those she had been wearing into the pockets of my greatcoat and making a hurried meal off some provisions which mary tyson had added to the bundle we again set out i was now still more inclined to push forward at our topmost speed for it was well past midday and the tokens of foul weather which i had noted in the morning had become yet more distinct the clearness had gone from the day the clouds woolly and grey sulked upon the mountaintops and crept down the sides the wind had suddenly fallen there was a certain heaviness in the air as of the expectation of a storm we went forward into the valley when we were halfway to the church a puff of wind keen and shrewd blew for an instant in our faces and then another and another but that last breath did not die like the rest it blew continuously and gathered violence as it blew the yewtrees in the churchyard resumed their tossing we were so near that i could hear the creaking of their boughs i looked anxiously towards the gap through which we were to pass to eskdale it was still clear of the mist but where a shrub grew or a tree reached out a branch on the slope beneath the gap i saw the wind evident as a beating rain and even as i looked the gap filled filled in a second not with these slow licking mists but with a column of tempest that drove exultant triumphing and now and again in the midst of it i perceived a whirling gleam of white like foam of the sea i looked forwards to the church backwards to the house the church was the nearer i took dorothy by the elbow run i cried i cannot she replied lagging behind i pressed her forward you must these shoes she began devil take the shoes cried i and thereupon with a perversity which even i would not have attributed to her she slipped a foot out of a shoe and stepped deliberately into a puddle there says she defiant but shivering i told you they were too wide you did it of a set purpose said i i looked towards the gap it was no longer visible the storm was tearing across the valley i picked up miss dorothy curwen in my arms and ran with her towards the church i got to the stone wall of the churchyard a little wicket gave admittance but the wicket was latched let me down says dorothy no says i and i pushed against the wicket with my knee it yielded a few flakes of snow beat upon my face i ran through the opening the churchyard like the church was the tiniest in the world the walls about it reached breast high and within the walls the yews were planted close in a square so that standing within this square it seemed to me that the storm had lulled i carried dorothy to that side of the church which was sheltered from the wind i tried the door of the church but it was locked i set dorothy down under the wall slipped off my greatcoat and wrapped it warm about her look said i shortly just past the angle of the church the snow swirled forwards down in the valley here it was rather sleet than snow lashing the fields through which i had run where are you going said dorothy as perhaps with some ostentation i buttoned my coat across my breast to pick up your shoe said i and i walked out through the wicket i never met a man of so wicked a perversity said she from behind me chapter xx a conversation in wastdale church when i returned with the shoe i found dorothy sitting huddled against the church wall in a very doleful attitude oh she cried remorsefully as she took the shoe from me you are drenched through and through and it is i that am to blame it matters nothing at all i replied i have been out upon the tops of these ridges and of nights it would be strange if i were not inured to a little cold you will take your coat however i had the greatest difficulty in persuading her to keep it for since i was drenched already the coat would not dry me but i should wet the coat this was the argument i employed to her though i had another and a more convincing to satisfy myself i mean the sight of her wrapped up in it it was a big rough heavy frieze coat and made a nest for her she had drawn the collar of it close about her ears and her face rosy with warmth and the whipping of the wind as we came across the fields peeped from the coat like a mossrose at the budding we sat for a while in silence for the whistling of the storm was grown so loud that we had need to shout and even then the wind snatched up the words out of hearing almost before they had passed our lips in front of us the tempest roistered about the valley twisting the sleet and snow this way and that shrieking about the bases of the hills whistling along the invisible ridges now and again however there came a momentary lull and during one of these intervals the clouds broke upon our left and disclosed the peak of great gable rising in that way from the mists that still hid its flanks the peak seemed so high that you thought it must be slung in midair it stood out black against the grey clouds barren impregnable dorothy shuddered at the aspect of it you were out upon those heights she shouted into my ear night and day after you left applegarth yes i nodded doubtless i should have pointed out that i did not make my bed upon the pinnacles and that there was all the difference in the world betwixt rain and snow but to tell the truth her anxiety on my account was of that sweetness to me that i could not lightly bring myself to dispense with it i was debating the matter in my mind when a tile loosened by the wind slid from the roof of the church and smashed upon the ground a couple of feet from dorothy it turned the current of my thoughts effectually the door of the church i knew to be locked i crept round to the east end of the building there was a great window with the panes set in lead which reached from the roof to within three feet of the ground and in that window a second window was made by the lowest of these leaded panes inserting my knife i was able to force up the latch which fastened this second window and found that with some squeezing and compression a body might crawl through the opening i went back to dorothy it will be safer in the church said i i climbed through the window by the side of the altar and turned to help dorothy in after me but as i was in the act of helping her i heard a clatter on the ground without she was halfway through the window at the moment and slipped back with a laugh this time said she as she appeared again and set her hands upon the sill this time i did not drop it on purpose and i helped her in the church was barely furnished with perhaps a dozen of rough deal pews and had not even a vestry so that the parsons surplice lay neatly folded upon a chair in the chancel into one of the pews we entered and since dorothy was warm within my coat i took and wrapped the surplice about my shoulders so we sat side by side silent in the gloom of the church the whitewashed walls glimmering about us the sleet whipping the windows and tearing at the door somehow the sound of the storm had now become very pleasant to me since it seemed to shut us off as upon an island more securely from the world it is strange how a man may walk again and again along a quite familiar path with companions who have grown familiar in his thoughts and then on some one day in a twinkling and for no reason that he can afterwards discern let him think never so hard the companions with whom he has fared will lose their familiarity will become as it were transfigured and the spot to which he has come will take on a magical aspect and a magical light he seems to have come thither for the first time on that day and let him con over the landmarks to prove the fancy wrong the fancy will none the less abide with him solid as truth he recognizes the spot as in some way intimately concerned with him it seems to have been waiting for him and for the conjunction of this one particular hour with him and the picture which he has of it thus suddenly revealed becomes henceforth part and parcel of his being imperishably treasured within the heart of recollection so at all events it was with me a picture of this valley in which we were of this church in which we sat sprang up before my eyes and i viewed it with a curious detachment it was as though i stood upon the rim of the mountains and looked down into the hollow i saw the desolate hills ringing it about made yet more desolate by the blurring snow i saw the little white church set within its stunted beaten yews apart in the midcentre of the valley it was too as though i saw by some strange clairvoyancy through the walls and beheld the two fugitives securely sheltered side by side in the dusk of the pew and the picture has remained clamped in my memory ever since so that i have but to close my eyes and not merely do i see it vividly as i did then but i experience again that vague sense of a voice crying somewhere out of natures heart this spot has been waiting for you twain and for this one hour it was a movement which dorothy made brought me to myself for she suddenly clasped her hands together with a shudder you are cold i cried no she replied in a low voice i was thinking of that peak we saw and the horror of it by night and her voice trembled for an instant and of your watching from the darkness the lights of applegarth we were comfortably in our beds and it rained that night i remember the patter of the rain against the windows nay said i there was little harm done i am no snowman to be washed away by a capful of rain she turned to me very quickly tell me she said in a voice no less quick the evening that you went from us you were talking for a long while at the gate with mary tyson you will remember i interrupted your talk yes i remember i answered staring straight in front of me well she continued i have often wondered her voice sank yet lower whether that going of yours was not a flight flight from from us at applegarth for after all it was something mary tyson said to you that made you go i turned towards her with a start you know what mary tyson said she looked at me in silence her eyes shining out of the dusk then she lowered her head i guessed it she said in a whisper i guessed it then for i know marys care for me and the next morning when we sent her to warn you that the sheriff was at the door i read it in her face i mean said she recovering herself hastily i read your departure in her face and i knew it was what she had said to you had driven you out and not your own necessities she paused i did not answer the knowledge has troubled me sorely she said for you were our guest it made but the one nights difference i urged for on the morrow came the officers ah but that was the accident she answered shrewdly they might not have come they might never have come and still you would have fled i have said this much to you she went on with a change of tone because i would have you look on me just as a friend who trusts you who has great cause to trust and thank you and who would count it a very real happiness if she could in any small way repay you i told you when we met on your march that i knew there was some great trouble and the answer i gave to you then i must give now i am bound to face that trouble by myself it was my sin brought it about ah but one never knows whence help may come she replied and the gentle earnestness with which she spoke so tempted me to unbosom myself that instinctively i drew away from her you think it is just a womans curiosity which prompts me she cried mistaking my movement ah no acquit me of that fault i am not sure but it may be that i can help you did she know i wondered my thoughts went back to that last meeting near penrith i had spoken then of a prisondoor which must close between us twain and she had made an answer which seemed to hint a suspicion of the truth and even if i cannot the mere telling sometimes helps she continued so long as one tells it to a friend i mean and here she began to speak very slowly choosing her words and with a certain difficulty in the utterance i mean i was afraid that something mary might have said checks you there are things one does not confide to an acquaintance or again to one whom you think to look upon you as ever so much nearer than an acquaintance but to a friend yes a friend is a halfway house between where one can take ones ease and she drew a breath like one that has come to the end of a dangerous task as for me i sat listening to that word friend the walls seemed to retain it and whisper it again to me after she had ceased and in the changing tones which she had used for now dorothy had spoken it with an earnest insistence as though anxious almost overanxious i should just accept the phrase as the true definition of what she felt towards me and now her voice had faltered and stumbled at the word it may have been a lack of modesty i cannot tell but i think it would have been the falsest modesty in the world had i affected to neglect the manner of the speech while considering the matter of it but be it as it may the one thought which rose in my mind engrossing me distinct horrible in distinctness was this what if that word friend cloaked and concealed another another which but for those few weeks at blackladies i might who knows perhaps have persuaded her to speak why then if that was true here was i implicating in distress the one woman who was chiefest in the front of my thoughts how that sin of mine reached out making me a ban and a curse bearing its evil fruit in unimaginable ways and in the agony of my heart i cried would to god i had never come to applegarth the cry rang fierce and sharp through the little church silence succeeded it and then that is not very kind said dorothy with a tremulous reproach it pains me ah dont mistake i went on for myself i could not hope to make you understand what my visit there has meant to me i came to applegarth on an evening the day i had passed waiting upon the hillside and while i was waiting there i made a resolve to repair under gods will a great wrong well when i first saw you i had but one thought a thought of very sincere gladness that i had come to that resolve or ever i had had speech with you and during the weeks that followed this resolve drew strength and vigour from your companionship that vigour and that strength it keeps so that my one fear now is lest chance may bar me from the performance that is your doing for until i came to applegarth all my life behind me was littered with broken pledges she laid her hand for an instant upon my sleeve but what return have i made to you i continued except a pitiful hypocrisy i came to applegarth an outlaw yes my one fault my loyalty so you believed so i let you believe i wore your brothers clothes and he died at malplaquet there was hypocrisy in the wearing of them and i turned suddenly towards her there was a picture i once saw the picture of a dead man speaking even then it seemed to me an image of myself a dead man speaking interrupted dorothy with a start yes said i and i told her of the picture which lord bolingbroke had shown to me at the monastery of the chartreux in paris and of the thought which i had drawn from it a dead man speaking she repeated in a voice which seemed hushed with awe how strange the storm had ceased to beat the window the dusk was deepening to darkness the silence was about us like a garment i sat wondering at dorothys tone wondering whether i should say what yet remained to say but i had made use before of secrecy and deception it would be best i should simply speak the truth a dead man speaking again said dorothy i had warning enough you see said i and i recognized the warning the picture seized upon my thoughts i knew it for an allegory but made no profit of my knowledge and so the allegory turns fact what do you mean she asked catching her breath oh dont speak until i have done i cried i find it hard enough to tell you as it is while you sit silent but the sound of your voice cheats me of my strength sets the duty beyond my reach for it is a duty i paused for a moment to recover the mastery of my senses i spoke to you once of a prisondoor which would close between you and me but that was not the whole of the truth that prisondoor will close but it will open again i shall come out from it but upon a hurdle oh no cried dorothy in such a voice of pain as i pray god i may never hear the like of again i felt it rive my heart she swayed forward her forehead would have struck the rail of the pew in front i put my arm around her shoulders and drew her towards me i felt her face pressed against my bosom her fingers twining tightly upon my coat yes yes it is true i went on the allegory turns fact even in paris those months agone i came to look upon myself as the figure in the picture as the dead man speaking meaning thereby the hypocrite detected but now the words take on a literal meaning it is a dead man who is speaking to you no more than that in very truth a dead man you must believe it and believe this too that since my cup of life this long while back has overbrimmed with shame and since it was i who filled it why i could go very lightly to my death but for the fear lest it should cause my little friend to suffer pain she disengaged herself gently from my clasp i cannot take that fear away from you she said in a broken whisper and indeed i would not lose it i replied in my heart of hearts i know that i would not lose it what is it then you mean to do she asked to travel with my friend as far as ravenglass to set her safe on board the swallow and then somewhere there is a man in prison whose place is mine you do not know where she exclaimed suddenly no said i but she interrupted me with a cry look she said hurriedly and pointed to a little window close beneath the roof through that window the moonlight was creeping like a finger down the wall across the floor the storm has cleared we can go she rose abruptly from her seat and moved out into the chancel something was it the hurry of her movement the tension of her voice made me spring towards her i remembered that when i spoke to her on the hillside near penrith it had seemed to me then that she had some inkling of the truth you know i exclaimed you know where the prisoner is no she cried and her voice rose almost to a scream belying the word she spoke how she came by her knowledge i did not consider she knew i had no room for any other thought oh you do know i implored and dropping on my knee i seized the hem of her dress to detain her i felt the dress drag from me i held it the more firmly you do not know oh tell me a man innocent of all wrongdoing lies in prison the charge treason think you they will weigh his innocence after this rebellion the fetters he wears are mine his punishment is mine and i must claim it theres no other way but this plain and simple one i must needs claim it oh think ever since i have known you the necessity that i should do this thing has grown on me day by day as each day i saw you i have felt that i owed it to you that i should succeed do not you prevent me she stood stock still i could hear the quick coming and going of her breath but in the uncertain twilight i could not read her face and she did not speak listen i continued if you do not tell me it will make no difference i shall still give myself up but to the other it may make all the difference in the world for it may be that i shall fail to save him still she kept silence so seeing no other way i stood up before her and told her the story from end to end beginning with that day when i first rode over coldbarrow fell to blackladies in company with jervas rookley down to the morning when i fled from the garden where the soldiers searched for me i saw her head droop as she listened and bow into her hands yet i had to go on and finish it but said she you were not all to blame the woman nay said i it can serve no purpose to portion out the blame for portion it as you will you cannot shred away my share mr herbert she objected again would have been taken in your garden whether you had returned or no that afternoon but my fault was the instrument used to ruin him he was taken while he followed me he was taken too because of me for had i not ridden so often into keswick he would never have been suspected it was his jealousy that trapped him and jervas rookley provoked the jealousy but i furnished him with the means the arguments were all old and hackneyed to me i had debated them before so that i had the answers ready there was besides one final argument and without waiting for her to speak again i used it and what of the wife waiting in keswick she turned away with a little swift movement and again stood silent then she said yes i too will face it bravely mr herbert lies in carlisle castle waiting his trial you know after the message came to applegarth my father and i fled to carlisle we took refuge with friends whigs but of my mothers family and for her sake they gave us shelter they knew the governor of the castle he told them of a prisoner newly brought thither upon a warrant a mr herbert who solaced himself night and day with the painting of the strangest picture ever known you showed to me a letter at applegarth wherein a painter was mentioned and named and i knew you had some trouble to distress you i grew curious to see the prisoner no one suspected i was in carlisle and so my friends consented to take me i saw him it is true i had no speech with him but i saw the picture it was a portrait of yourself i thought but i could not be sure i was sure before you told me i was sure when you spoke to me of that picture you had seen in paris for this portrait too that mr herbert painted was a portrait of yourself as a dead man speaking i noticed that as she spoke her voice gained confidence and strength and at the close it rang without a trace of fear or reluctance thank you said i simply thank you with all my heart yes she replied it was right that i should tell you you will go to carlisle in truth i will and as she moved into a line with the window the moonlight made a silver glory about her face i saw with a great joy that her eyes her lips were smiling it seemed to me indeed that both our hearts were lighter there was this one thing to do and now here was the means revealed by which it might be done we climbed out of the window and since it was too late for the continuance of our journey we sought lodging for the night at that farmhouse which i had already visited i remember walking across the fields in the starshine and the moonlight wondering at this vicarious revenge herbert had taken on my picture and at the strange destiny which had made this girl so dear to me the instrument of my atonement and as we waited at the door i said to her i owed you much before tonight but tonight you have doubled the debt and i am proud to hear you say it she replied from the farmer i borrowed a change of clothes and coming down the stairs again found dorothy to her evident satisfaction in her own shoes which she had taken from the pocket of my greatcoat we sat for a long while after our supper over the fire in the kitchen talking of the days at applegarth and laughing over that owlhunt only twice was any reference made to our conversation in the church for once i said do you remember when i came down to applegarth you were singing a song it was called the honest lover and i would fain have the words of it and thereupon she wrote out the song upon a sheet of paper and gave it to me and again when dorothy had lit her candle she stood for an instant by the door that resolve you spoke of she said you had come to it on the day that you first reached applegarth it was the resolve to free mr herbert at any cost yes said i and it was that you were so glad you had determined on when you first saw me yes said i again well said she it is the sweetest compliment that was ever paid to a woman the next morning we started betimes in the same cheerfulness of spirits and making light of that dreaded snow as we crossed burnmoor descended into eskdale about nine of the forenoon and so reached ravenglass before it was dusk there to my inexpressible delight i saw the swallow riding on an anchor a little way out we crept down to the beach and waited there until it was dark then i lighted a lantern which i had brought from the farmhouse for the very purpose and lifting it up swung it to and fro in a little there was an answering flash from the sloop and a little after that i heard the sound of oars in the water and fell to wondering what sort of parting we should make and perhaps in a measure to dreading it but the parting was of the simplest kind it is goodbye then said dorothy and we will shake hands if you please this time i took her hand fairly within my palm and held it clasped whilst it clasped mine i am thanking god said i for the truest friend that ever man had yes said she nodding her head that is very prettily said and no more than the truth ah said i you ever enjoyed a very proper notion of yourself and with that the boat grounded upon the beach and after all we two parted with a laugh i heard the song of the seamen at the windlass coming across the water with an airy faintness and then i set my face to the hillside chapter xxi i travel to carlisle and meet an attorney it was a lonely business whereto i now was set but in truth it is lonelier in the recollection than it was in the actual happening as i sit over my fire here on a winters night i begin at times to wonder how i went through with it i remember the incessant moaning of the sea for i followed my old plan only with a greater precaution and kept along the coast until i was nigh upon whitehaven and discover a loneliness in the thought that it was carrying dorothy from me to france i find too an overwhelming desolation in the knowledge that she and i had spoken the last goodbye and a melancholy atop of that in the cheerfulness of our parting but these notions are but the moss that gathers upon recollections the sea brought no loneliness home to me rather it crooned of dorothys safety nor was i conscious then of any desolation in the knowledge that my eyes would not again rejoice in the sight of her for that very parting raised me out of my slough more nearly to her level and as for the cheerfulness why just in that way would i have had her part from me i believe indeed that i was more sensible of her presence on that journey from ravenglass to carlisle than ever i had been even when her voice was in my ears or the knocking of her shoes upon the stones moreover there were two very immediate questions which pressed upon me and saved me from much unprofitable rumination about myself dorothy had spoken of anthony herbert waiting his trial when she herself was in carlisle and that was over a month ago was he still waiting or was the trial over i had no means of resolving that question and many a night i lay awake in some barn or outhouse blowing on my frozen fingers to keep them warm and casting up the probabilities i was thus in a perpetual fever lest after all my intentions should be thwarted by a too late arrival and to make the matter worse i was compelled to practise every precaution lest i should be recognized of which there was to my thinking no small danger for in the first place my flight from blackladies had made as i knew some noise in these parts and moreover i had ridden openly on the march to preston so here was my second question could i reach carlisle a free man for that i deemed to be an altogether necessary and integral part of my design once a captive i was foredoomed already upon my own account and any plea that i might urge on behalf of anthony herbert would win the less credit since it would be made at no cost whatever to me who made it if however i could come undetected there and so give myself up why the voluntary relinquishment of life might haply be taken as a guarantee and surety for my word consequently i was reduced to a thousand shifts to avoid attention i went miles about to come upon a solitary inn and more often than not when i reached it my heart would fail me and i would take to my heels in a panic or at best gulp down the hastiest meal and pulling my coat about my ears front the cold night again it was then a good twelve days after the swallow had lifted anchor and sailed down the coast that i crept one dusky evening through the botcher gate into carlisle and what with the fear of capture and the fevers of delay the endless fatigue to which during these many weeks i had been exposed and the inclemencies of the season you may be sure i was in a sufficiently pitiable condition i repaired at once to the marketplace and picking out the most insignificant tavern learnt therein over a glass of brandy from my host that i was as much as a week in advance of my time the news was an indescribable relief to me and going out i hired a mean lodging in a little street near the horse market where i would lie that night and determine on my course for since i had yet a week i thought that i might dispose of some portion of that time to the best advantage by discovering the particulars of the charge which anthony herbert would have to meet in which task i did not anticipate a very great difficulty inferring from what dorothy had told me that what with the speculation his picture had given rise to i should find his case a matter of common gossip accordingly in the morning i bought at a dealers a suit of clothes which would befit an apprentice and tying my own hair in a cheap ribbon which i was able to do since i had discarded a peruke for convenience sake after i left blackladies and changing my boots for a pair of shoes i walked across the town towards the castle in the hope that either amongst the loiterers at the gates or in the meadow by the river i might discover something to my purpose in this fortune favoured me for though i learned little or nothing upon the first day about three oclock of the afternoon upon the second while i stood in the open space betwixt the castle and the town a little brisk gentleman came stepping from the gatehouse and glanced at every one he passed with a great air of penetration as who should say my friend you have no secrets from me he shot the same glance at me though with more indifference as though from habit he would practise it upon any who came in his way be they mere apprentices it was he however who was the one to be discomposed for up went his eyebrows on the instant and his mouth gaped he did not however stop but rather quickened his pace and passed me a few yards away he stopped to exchange a word with an acquaintance but i noticed that he cast now and again a furtive glance towards me my curiosity was fairly aroused and being reluctant to lose any occasion that might serve me i drew nearer and loitered in his vicinity until such time as the conversation should have ended dismissing his acquaintance he turned of a sudden it is a disappointing place carlisle he began abruptly the grass grows in the streets which i take it are the dirtiest outside bagdad and the houses what with their laths and clay and thatch are as little reputable to the eye i knew not what in the world to make of this strange beginning and so stared at the man in perplexity you will have been sorely disappointed he suggested for i am told that on the contrary the streets of preston are very clean and spacious and the houses built with some taste it seems you know me said i starting forward it has almost that air he replied with a spice of mockery i have known more effectual disguises than an apron and a pair of brass buckles but indeed had you dirtied your face as you unwisely omitted to do i should have known you none the less he stood with his head cocked on one side enjoying my mystification i have no doubt sir of your discernment and penetration said i thinking to humour him but since i cannot call to mind that you and i have ever met he came a step nearer to me and with a roundabout glance to see that no listener was within earshot there is a pretty unmistakable likeness of you yonder he jerked his head towards the castle though maybe the expression wants repose moreover i could not hear that you were taken prisoner and so was inclined to expect you here then who in the world are you i exclaimed mr nicholas doyle said he and a lawyer of too much repute to be seen publicly hobnobbing with a rascally apprentice without questions asked so if you please you will just walk behind me until i come to my house and when i go in at the front door you will slink round to the back these directions i followed and was shown up the stairs to the first floor whereupon mr doyle locked the door and drew a screen before the keyhole now mr mr whitemen shall we say for though your face is little known your name has been heard here i may offer you a chair which he did drawing it politely to the fire and therewith offered me his snuffbox but without prejudice to his politics as he said for none of your scatterbrained romantical flimflam for me said he an honest whig my dear sir by the way and his eyes twinkled slyly i trust you did not find my staircase very dark i was not in the humour to take any great pleasure in his witticism as may be imagined and i replied simply you know the whole story then part the husband told me said he nodding his head part the wife i pieced it together the wife i exclaimed then mrs herbert is here at carlisle doubtless he returned where else i did not know said i it was mr doyles turn to look surprised but said he she left word for you at keswick it was for that reason i told you i was not greatly surprised to come upon you nay said i i have not been to keswick i learnt anthony herbert was here well from other sources but and i started forward eagerly in my chair herbert must then have sent for her and i spoke joyfully enough for of late and in particular since i had known where herbert lay i had begun to reflect that after all his enlargement could that be brought about did not altogether patch up the trouble no answered mr doyle herbert only talked of her i sent for her i may thank you for that said i they are reconciled it is a delicate point said he how far my client it appears was persuaded by that worthy gentleman jervas rookley that well that there were more solid grounds for his jealousy than actually existed it is true rookley has shown something of his hand but not all of it we are in the dark as to his motives and mr herbert well doubtless you have some notion of the whimsies of a man in love now he is in the depths of abasement now he is very haughty on the summits of pride a man in love my dear sir a man in love is very like a leg of mutton on my roastingjack in the kitchen first he spins this way then he spins that and always he is in the extremity of heat whichever way he spins he is like the mutton too in his lack of sense and in the losing of the fat and very often when he is roasted through and through my lady serves him up for the delectation of her friends believe me mr clavering he checked himself but the name was out of his mouth when next you figure on the jack you will do well to bear in mind my simile a leg of mutton my dear sir now i had good reason to find his simile uncommonly distasteful the more because i had a like reason for knowing it to be unjust and perhaps with more heat than was needed i answered for my part i have no objection to a man in love said he taking me up nor i indeed on the contrary i hold him in the greatest esteem not so much perhaps for his falling in love as for his consequent falling out of it whereby comes much profitable litigation well said i anxious to put an end to his discourse your advice mr doyle may be the best in the world but you offer it to a man who will never find occasion for pursuing it and at that his face became grave let us get to the root of the matter you tell me jervas rookley has shown his hand in what way why he is to be the chief witness for the crown it was he who laid the information against herbert and you will observe he is a strong witness for what object had he in view if he did not believe the information what had he to gain i will not say that he did not believe it i returned i will not say that he does not believe it but i know very well what he has to gain and that is the estate of blackladies and i told the lawyer of the double game which rookley had played one way or another whichever king sat the throne he was to recover the estate i continued if the hanoverian won why i was to be exchanged for it but since he thinks i have slipped through his fingers he will be eager to make herbert my substitute yes said the lawyer thoughtfully but there will be only your bare word for this but i shall have sacrificed my life to speak it i said anxiously for this very point had greatly troubled me no doubt that will carry weight he assented but enough i do not know it will however serve to bring about that reconciliation which seems so to weigh with you look there is a copy of the indictment and running over to a bureau he brought it back and thrust it into my hands i read it through carefully from the beginning to the end you will see said he that no direct act is alleged beyond the possession of that medal that is mine said i can you prove it said he it was found in mr herberts apartments i thought for a moment and with a cry sprang to my feet indeed i can i cried i can prove it and i told him how good he exclaimed in a voice which topped my own and then hush he whispered in the greatest reproach you should have more discretion you should indeed and very cautiously he unlocked the door and then flung it violently open the landing however was clear you see mr whitemen there is much we have to fight against apart from the charges there is the apparent honesty of mr rookley and moreover there is this rebellion which calls for examples and you may add to our difficulties a cumberland jury you will remember that we marched out against you at penrith four thousand strong that will teach you the temper of the county i do not remember i replied that your four thousand stayed to exchange opinions with us nicholas doyle laughed goodnaturedly it is a hit i will not deny said he but what if they hold to the plan and decline to exchange opinions when they are in the jurybox eh my friend what then so you see there are dangers with your help we may just save my client but it will be by no more than the skin of his teeth without you we may as well submit to a sentence at the outset but and he spoke with a voice of the deepest gravity all this which makes your evidence of the greatest value to us renders it fatal to you i do not mince words i set the truth frankly before you your evidence may serve mr herberts turn but there is no more than a chance of that it will most certainly send you to an ignominious death every word you will speak will be a plea of guilty and mark you there is but one punishment for treason it will be no stepping on to a scaffold and reading a few protestations and kneeling down at the block as though you just condescended to leave the world no you will be drawn through the streets trussed hand and foot on a hurdle then they will hang you for a bit but not until you are dead then they will light a fire and take a knife to you and it will seem i fear me a weary while before the end is reached good god i interrupted him and snatched up my hat do you wish me to leave your client precisely to that same fate where are you going he asked in an incredulous tone noticing my movement to carlisle castle said i i thought as much said he and took me by the arm i doubt if i should have said so much to you had i not felt certain it would not weigh with you but you are young mr clavering very young and though i must count you a traitor and deserving all this punishment i could not send you to that fate without you had counted up the cost that is kindly said i replied and offered him my hand which he shook very cordially but less than a fortnight ago i stood upon the seashore with never a soul in view and a ships boat on the beach and a ship spreading its sails to set me over into france i am not like to be turned aside now he looked at me with a certain shrewdness in his eyes this is a reparation which you purpose a man of the world would tell you there was no necessity for it but you do not say that i returned i say and he paused for a second i say damn women he cried and brought his fist down upon the table even in that amiable sentiment i cannot agree with you i answered with a laugh and so i will make a call upon the governor of the castle but again he caught me by the arm that would be the ruin of both of you the crown presses for an example to be made and jervas rookley i think from what you yourself have said will move heaven and earth to keep you out of court if you go now to the castle there is little likelihood of your giving evidence for mr herbert he must produce you at the trial and not a moment before thereupon he recommended to me to lie quietly in my lodging during the week and come not out except to see him now and again of a night at his bidding indeed i repaired to his house on the following evening and found a tailor there waiting for me for said mr doyle we must make the most of our advantages though my heart aches at dressing you up for the slaughter but it will make a difference whether a lad in an apron and brass buckles gives himself up or a proper young gentleman with an air of means and dignity your word will gain credit with the jury lord what a sight we shall have in the spectacle of jervas rookleys face by the way and he turned towards me with a certain customary abruptness jervas rookleys face has something changed since i set eyes on it before indeed said i indifferently and in what way it is marred by a scar a scar i cried with considerable satisfaction on the right side it should stretch from the cheek bone to the chin it does answered mr doyle dryly i wonder how he came by it yes i wonder said i reflectively and chancing to look at each other our eyes met and we laughed i think it very wise said he that you did not surrender yourself to the governor of carlisle castle this week passed monotonously enough for me cooped up in my little apartment but i had a great hope to cheer me through its passage for i had come so near to the attainment of my one end and in the face of so many difficulties that i could not but believe that providence had so willed it and having willed so much would will that final issue which should crown the work moreover two days before the trial mr doyle brought me news which enheartened me inexpressibly it was a message of thanks from anthony herbert and to that message was added another from the wife which showed me that the reconciliation had become an actual fact on the eve of the trial i slept at the house of mr doyle indeed from his window i heard the trumpeters and saw the judges carriage go by and so dressing myself the next morning in my new suit with mr doyle fluttering about me like a ladys maid i made my way quickly to the guildhall chapter xxii reparation the guildhall stands northwards of the cross in the marketplace and i remember that i paused when halfway up the steps betwixt the pavement and the portico and turned me about for a second to glance down upon that open space and men coming and going about it as they willed in the warm sunlight mean houses enclosed it shambles disfigured it but i noticed no more than its width and spaciousness how wide and free it seemed and of a sudden my thoughts flashed me away beyond these houses and beyond the gates the marketplace vanished before my eyes like a mirage i was once more marching from kelso to preston across the moors with the merlins crying overhead between the hedges under the open sky and it seemed to me so swift was the passage of my memories that i traversed in that brief interval all the distance of our march but many of the townsfolk were mounting to the court and one that passed jogged against me with his elbow and so waked me i raised my head well here was the courthouse within sat the judge and though the sunlight beat upon my face the shadow of the building had already reached about my feet the little court was nigh upon full and i pushed into a corner beneath the gallery where i was like to escape notice and yet command a view of what was done there i stood for the space of ten minutes or so watching the townsfolk enter by twos and threes in a trickling stream thronging the floor blocking the doorways and i know not why but gradually a great depression a dull melancholy overstole my spirits it was just for this moment that i had lived for many a week back i assured myself my days had been one prayer for its coming my nights one haunting fear lest it should not come yet the assurance repeat it as i might had little meaning at the outset and less and less at each repetition my blood would not be whipped i felt inert in some queer way disappointed i was like one quit of a fever but in the despondency of exhaustion i saw the prisoner set in the dock i noticed the purple hollows about his eyes the thin flushed cheeks the nervous gripping of his fingers on the rail but the spectacle waked no pity in me though i was conscious i should feel pity aroused no shame though i knew i should be tingling with shame and when anthony herbert sent his gaze piercing anxiously this way and that into the throng i wondered for a moment who it was for whom he searched i saw jervas rookley seated at a table he turned his head so that the bruised scar upon his face was visible from cheekbone to chin and i for all i felt towards him might have been looking at the face of an inanimate statue i saw the judge take his seat his robes catching the sunlight and glowing against the black panels of the wall like some monstrous scarlet flower i was as one who contemplates a moving scene through a spyglass knowing it to be very far away the actual aspect of the court became dreamlike to me and when the clerk of the crown cried out anthony herbert hold up thy hand it seemed to me that the curtain was but now rung up upon a puppetshow in this listless spirit i listened while the indictment was read it set forth that anthony herbert as a false traitor not weighing the duty of his allegiance did with other false traitors conspire compass and imagine the death of his majesty the subversion of the government and to introduce the romish religion and for the effecting thereof the said anthony herbert did conspire to levy war upon the kingdom and bring in the pretender thereupon the indictment being read the jury was empannelled which took no short time for of a sudden herbert doubtless primed for the work by nicholas doyle challenges one of them john martin i remember the man was named are you a freeholder of forty shillings a year he asked and the judge taking him up he was allowed counsel to argue the point which was done at great length and with much talk of a couple of statutes one dating from henry v the other from queen mary it seemed that they contradicted one another but i do not know i only know that the sunlight pouring through a high window on the east side shifted like the spoke of a slowrevolving wheel and was already withdrawing up the wall beneath the window when jervas rookley was called to give his evidence to this evidence i lent a careful ear and could not but perceive that though there was little fact in the recital yet innuendo so fitted with innuendo that it might well have weight with a jury already inclined to believe but even this observation i was conscious of making rather as a matter of general interest than as one in which i was so intimately concerned rookley told of herberts coming to keswick how immediately he made lord derwentwaters acquaintance and was entrusted with the painting of lady derwentwaters portrait a work which carried him daily to the house on lords island then he proceeded to tell of his own journey to paris and how he found me a novice in a jesuit college the journey to barleduc he omitted but said that i had given him advice to wait for me in paris and so had ridden off for close upon a week the journey said he aroused his suspicions on my return i had openly professed to him my adherence to the stuarts and had informed him that i had travelled to commercy and had seen the pretender he went on to describe his discovery that i carried a letter and his failure to possess himself of it then you knew mr clavering was a jacobite so long ago as that interrupted anthony herbert how comes it you waited so long before you moved for his arrest unless you had a finger in the jacobite pie yourself the witness need answer nothing that would incriminate himself interrupted the judge quickly besides your turn will come let the kings counsel finish there is no reason why i should shrink from answering it said jervas readily there was some plot on foot so much i knew but what the plot was i knew not nor ever did and had i laid the information against lawrence clavering then i should myself have closed the avenues of knowledge and what have you to say to that asked the judge of herbert you will need more discretion if you are to save your neck and he wagged his head at the prisoner my lord answered herbert in a heat i shall not want for discretion so long as i do not go begging for justice i could see mr doyle in the body of the court nodding and frowning at his client in a great fluster but it was already too late for his signs to have their effect justice roared the judge turning to the jury sirs the fellow cries for justice as though it were a stranger to a jury of englishmen nay but justice he shall have full measure i am here to see to that and he sat glowering at the unfortunate prisoner for myself the outburst was no more than i expected and i listened to it as to an ofttold tale jervas took up his story again it may have been the heat it may have been sheer weakness but though i saw his face flush from expression to expression the sound of his voice seemed to me no more than a dull droning duller with every word and yet every word i heard and clearly understood he told of my coming to blackladies of lord derwentwaters suggestion to me concerning herbert of my daily visits to the painters apartment of my subsequent journeys about the countryside and the inquiries i made as to troops and munitions even to me hearing the story it almost appeared that herbert was inextricably linked in the business with such ingenuity was it told the faces of the jury already condemned the prisoner people nudged one another about me as each detail was added and herbert himself seemed to lose hope at the sight of the tangle in which he was coiled i am for nothing in all this he cried but now in a very wail and this too i doubt not is for nothing said mr cowper the counsel with a mocking irony as he held up the medal which king james had given to me at commercy he turned to rookley you have seen this before in the prisoners lodging at keswick will you describe it i bent forward rookley began to speak again he described the head of king james struck upon the one side the british islands upon the other and made mention of the two mottoes cujus est and reddite rookley paused and there was a buzz of voices from the gallery from the doorways from the floor of the court the medal was passed up to the judge he turned it over in his hands and had it carried to the jurymen i saw their heads with many a wise wagging come together over it i leaned yet farther forward looking at rookley for the first time that day i felt a pulse of excitement had rookley chanced to glance my way he must have seen me so openly did i crane my head over my neighbours shoulders but he stood with downcast eyes in the meekest humility the very figure and image of unconscious merit had he more to say about that medal every second i fancied i saw his mouth open and frame the words i dreaded the murmurs of the throng increased i could have shouted silence silence i feared that he would speak and i miss the words i feared that the very noise about him would remind him would suggest to him would disclose to him anyhow would unlock his lips but he had no further details to give and it seemed to me that already the fresh air fanned at herberts face you saw the medal in the prisoners lodging resumed the counsel when more than once replied rookley and took up his tale again and again my excitement died away i remarked with some curiosity that he made no mention whatever of mrs herbert from first to last and i remembered how i had noticed before that the story fell into two halves whereof each seemed complete without the other he spoke it is true of a pretext by which he had lured herbert to blackladies but did not define the pretext nor did the counsel examine him as to it while i felt sure that anthony herbert would be the last to start that game now said the judge turning to the prisoner it is your turn if you have any questions to ask of the witness herbert gathered up his papers you saw this medal in my lodging yes do you know the purpose for which i had it there rookley straightened his shoulders and facing herbert said very deliberately i suppose it was a token which would pass you as trustworthy amongst the jacobites did you never see it before you saw it in my lodging never my lord i swear it upon my oath never the prisoner has no doubt some cockandbull story but that is the truth upon my oath never the prisoner has no cockandbull story answered herbert leaning fiercely over the dock but only what he will prove with witnessess and so he turned from the subject it seemed to me that rookley turned a trifle pale and for the first time lost his assurance he glanced anxiously round the court i drew closer into my corner he knew that story of his about the medal to be false he must needs have expected herbert would press him closely concerning it but he did not he did not there was reason for alarm i saw the alarm gather on rookleys face you were at great pains to effect my arrest secretly continued herbert and why was that i would not alarm lawrence clavering and his friends he replied until i had a riper knowledge of their plots but you laid the information against me with mr fuller the magistrate on august st and against mr clavering on the rd what was it made you change your mind between those dates but this is nothing to the purpose said the judge testily i pray you my lord said herbert with a certain dignity all this goes to the witness credit i am here for my life i am allowed no counsel to defend me i pray you let me go on with my questions and he turned again to rookley did you intercept a letter from lord derwentwater to mr clavering on the afternoon of the rd a letter asked rookley with the air of a man hearing the matter mentioned for the first time a letter continued herbert wherein lord derwentwater wrote that the french king was dying and that lord bolingbroke counselled all thought of a rising should be deferred and did you not thereupon that same day lay the information against mr clavering but to what end is this interrupted the judge clavering is not here were he here i should know how to deal with him but the indictment is not drawn against clavering it is drawn against you and you had best look to it my lord it is all of a piece replied herbert i was an innocent an unconscious instrument of rookleys hatred of mr clavering thereupon he proceeded to question rookley as to the reason why he had been disinherited and if it was true that he had robbed his father and ever proved a troublesome and disloyal son to these inquiries he got nothing but evasions for replies but i observed that the witness anxiety increased as i could understand for doubtless he little expected to have these facts arrayed against him and began to wonder whence herberts knowledge came the court rose at the conclusion of his evidence for a short space so that when it returned the sunlight was pouring on to the floor of the room through the western window other witnesses were called amongst them one or two whig gentlemen who spoke to seeing lady derwentwaters portrait you infer from that that i am a traitor said herbert to the first i thought it a strange thing an artist should come so far as to keswick he replied but my lord is it a crime for a man to come to keswick cried herbert i came thither for the landscapes and therefore painted portraits sneered the judge nay but a man must live answered herbert i noticed that blackett my servant from blackladies was summoned to give evidence as to messages which i had despatched him with to herbert but i cannot say that i paid great heed to what he said for that spoke of sunlight moved upwards from the floor towards the roof changing as it moved from gold to red and my weariness gained on me i felt my limbs grow heavy beneath me and my head nodding and the words which were spoken came to me muffled and drowsy as if through a woollen curtain at last herbert was enjoined to make his defence the sunlight streamed in a level blaze through the windows at the height of the gallery my lord and gentlemen he began i have nothing but innocence to plead i cannot take the jury or the court with oratory but i declare in the presence of almighty god that what is sworn against me is all a fiction for rebelling against the established government or attacking that precious life of his majesty king george i never had such a thought you have heard a great many innuendoes and suspicions but very little fact and i cannot be condemned upon suspicions moreover i shall call a witness to prove to you that jervas rookley had the best of reasons for fitting those suspicions together it is blackladies that he covets the estate from which his father disinherited him and he seeks to regain it as a reward for his zeal by pursuing me to my death though it cost him perjury there is but one fact alleged against me my lord in all this that i had possession of the medal but it never belonged to me and that jervas rookley knows i shall call a witness to prove to you that it belonged to mr clavering and to explain why it was discovered in my room well call your witness said the judge i do my lord said anthony herbert i call lawrence clavering there was a quick movement all through the court like a ripple upon still water and then absolute silence the silence of a night frostbound and empty there floated into my mind a recollection of the street beyond the barricade at preston the sunlight blazed ruddy upon motionless figures had a woman fainted it seemed you might have heard her breathing then quick and sharp rang out a laugh i knew the voice i understood the relief in it it flashed upon me of a sudden that here was i failing again and this time irretrievably i shook off the weariness which hung upon my limbs the mist which was wrapped about my senses i pushed aside the man who stood in front of me i call lawrence clavering repeated herbert the certitude of his tone weakening to a tremor from somewhere in the gallery i heard a sob halfstifled a sob as though a heart was breaking and i knew too the voice which uttered that here i shouted and thrust against the shoulders in front of me a lane was carved as though by magic and i advanced to the table my lord he is a rebel and a papist said rookley starting up his face livid his eyes starting from their sockets doubtless i shall answer for both those crimes said i in the laws good time i am here this day to prevent a wrong thereupon i was sworn and bidden to take my stand in the witnessbox which i did being so placed that my back was towards the windows and the setting sun my lord the witness laughs said mr cowper i pray your lordship warn him that he swear truly but the witness was not laughing with any levity for the task to which his hand was set and composed his face upon the instant the gallery ran round the three sides of the hall the sunlight as i say poured in from behind me and beat upon the gallery in front i was looking to that part of it over against me from which i had heard a sob and a face looked out from the rosy glow of the sunlight and smiled at me it was at that face the face of dorothy curwen that i smiled back for my heart was lifted within me exultant rejoicing i did not think then of the danger she ran though the thought pressed heavily enough upon me afterwards i did not even consider by what means she had come here she was here and this time i had not failed my musings however were interrupted by the judge who warned me very outrageously that since nothing now could save my body so i need not trust the saints would save my soul if they caught me prevaricating from the truth my lord i replied humbly i was at preston and escaped i could have fled out of england and got me safe to france i am not like to have thrown away my life that i might tell a lie i shall not be particular to recount all the questions which herbert put to me he put many and i answered them truthfully i saw the judges face cloud and grow sterner and sterner for every word i spoke was a link to fetter me the more closely to my death but the face up there in the gallery grew brighter and brighter or so at least i imagined it was to the gallery i looked for my judge and there i saw myself acquitted you have seen this medal asked herbert it belongs to me said i belongs to you said the judge it was given to me at commercy by him whom i must ever regard as my king how came it then in the prisoners lodging i took it there myself that it might be painted in my picture we shall need proof of all this said the judge and prithee friend said he with a biting irony consider the oath thou hast taken proof there is my lord i cried and a sure proof the picture itself thereupon the portrait was exhibited and since the courthouse was now falling to darkness a couple of candles were brought and set in front of it that it might be the better seen it was the horridest picture that ever was seen and the glare of the candles made it start out from the gloom like a thing alive it was not however at the face i looked for any great while there my lord i cried in excitement on the breast there the medal hangs and to his good fortune anthony herbert had painted that medal with all his minute elaboration from where i stood i could distinguish the head of king james and when the picture was held close one could read the motto cujus est i looked up to the gallery while the judge and the jury were inspecting the picture the last rays of the sun glowed tenderly about dorothys face and died off it whilst i looked but the face exclaimed mr cowper my lord this is no simple portrait we are not at the bottom of the matter the face i have painted since i was in prison replied herbert and explained in some confusion i blamed mr clavering for my arrest then said the judge we shall need proof that the medal was not painted in when you were in prison too but that proof he had and subsequently produced in the person of his landlord and the landlords wife with whom he had lodged at keswick meanwhile he continued his questioning of me you have heard jervas rookley describe the medal yes is it the true description but incomplete i answered for there are marks upon the medal upon one side is the face but there are scratches upon that face when it fell one day upon the stones the forehead is indented there is a mark lengthening the curve of the mouth there is a scratch where the cravat meets the neck beneath the ear how came these scratches asked herbert i dropped the medal out of my fob said i when i was thrown from my horse on coldbarrow fell the first time i came to blackladies and jervas rookley picked it up and gave it back to me there was a murmur amongst the spectators it is not true said rookley but in a voice so shaken that it belied the words the judge took the medal and examined it i cannot see he said bring more candles the candles were brought the judge examined the medal and handed it to the counsel my lord the jury would like to see it and the voice was that of the foreman how eagerly i watched their faces while they clustered once more about it the marks are there said the foreman as the witness has described them i should know said i i tried to rub them of so often and jervas rookley picked it up asked herbert he held it so long turning it over in his hand that i had to ask him thrice before ever i could get it back i spoke with all the earnestness i had and it seemed to me that the jury belied my words but i could not tell and i waited while the judge summed up and the jury were away considering their verdict in a fever of anxiety how long they were how slowly they filed into the court i looked up to the gallery a row of white faces bent on the rail all gazing towards the jurybox save one and that one gazed at me as i sat by the table in the court i was indeed still returning that gaze when the verdict was announced and i think it was herberts hand grasping mine which first informed me what the verdict was that night i slept in carlisle prison but as i came out upon the steps of the courthouse between my guards i saw by the light of the lamp swinging above the door herbert and his wife standing side by side and a few yards further the sergeant who led the way turned his lanthorn on one side and showed me the little figure of a girl and a face which peeped from out a taffety hood chapter xxiii the last for standing in the roadway there she seemed to me the forlornest figure that ever a man set eyes upon there was something more than a drooping sadness in the attitude something strangely like remorse as though unaccountably she blamed herself but i was not so curious to unravel her thoughts at this moment as i was fearful of the risk she ran she had sat alone in the courthouse no one had so much as spoken to her and she stood alone in the streets of carlisle the knowledge of her danger rushed in upon me and i had but one hope to lighten it i remembered that she had spoken to me of a whiggish relative who had given her shelter and i trusted that she would find a refuge with him and so it indeed proved for i had not lain more than three days in the castle before this very gentleman was admitted to see me and after a prosy exhortation on the nature of my crimes he proceeded i have thought it my duty to say this much to you but i come at the instance of a poor misguided friend of yours who is anxious you should have no fears for her safety the worthy gentleman scratched his forehead in some perplexity i cannot repeat to you all that this friend said a woman in tears a man in delirium they both say a great deal which is not to be repeated but her messages were of the friendliest of the friendliest for the rest the swallow lies off the mouth of the eden with your friends father on board it appears that the ship sailed up the coast from a spot you maybe know of better than i do our friend returns to it tonight and it sails forthwith to france at the door he stopped and scratched his head again then he rapped for the turnkey to let him out the messages were of the friendliest he repeated and as the door was opened at that moment assumed a judicial severity and so marched pompously out left to myself i fell straightway into a temper of amazing contradictions for whereas i had before been moved by the thought of dorothys danger now i was troubled that she should be in such haste to use her liberty this very night must she go i asked of myself indignantly well there is no reason why she should stay she will be safe in france and so came perilously near to weeping over myself who must remain behind in prison but to that thought succeeded another which drove the first clean from my head dorothy in tears there was matter in that notion for an indictment against the universe and the indictment i drew and supported it with such arguments as i felt sure must enforce conviction from that pursuit i came very naturally to a speculation in the nature of those friendliest messages i construed them by the dictionary of her looks as she had sat in the gallery of the courthouse it was a task of which i did not tire but drew great comfort from it and found it very improving the next day however i was taken out of the castle and sent forward under an escort to join my corebels who were being marched by easy stages to london i caught them up at st albans and coming to barnet we had our hands tied and halters thrown about our horses necks and so were carried through the streets of london to newgate gaol such a concourse of people came to view us as i have never seen the like of the town was dressed for a holiday and what with the banging of drums the hurrahing for king george and the damning of the pretender the air so rang with noise that it was as much as you could to hear your neighbour speak one sturdy whig i remember planted himself in our way and with many jeers and imprecations lifted up a jackdaw tricked out with white roses which he carried on a warmingpan and so paced backwards and in front of us until a soldier cracked him on the chest with the butt of his firelock and toppled the fellow into the gutter in newgate there i remained a weary while though this period was made as light for us as well could be we had the liberty of the press yard and were allowed to receive visitors and to visit one another no inconsiderable privilege one may think if one counts up the number imprisoned there there it came about that i saw much of charles ratcliffe lord derwentwaters brother and though he was not of his brothers amiable and endearing disposition grew to some intimacy with him he thought me indeed a great fool for running my head into the noose at carlisle for a beggarly painter and never scrupled to tell me so but i think it was just that action which inclined his friendship my way there were other consolations came to me and one of them was lighted with a glimmering of hope for one day came sir william wyndham to see me and informed me that lord bolingbroke was very active in my behalf urging upon his friends in england to make representations for my release or if that failed to concert measures for my evasion i set no great reliance upon either alternative but sir william wyndham came again in march of the year after the rebellion had closed in scotland and lord bolingbroke had been dismissed from the service of king james mr secretary stanhope encourages your kinsman said he in the hope that he may be pardoned in which event something might be done for you meanwhile i have a message to deliver to you from him tell lawrence he says that here in paris i am much plagued and pestered by a young friend of his who tells me that unless i unlock newgate i do not deserve to be related to him i am greatly humiliated by so much scolding but will do what i can it was not very much however that he could do and on the th of may i was arraigned with charles ratcliffe at the exchequer bar at westminster and tried there on the th and taken back again a few days later to receive sentence but we shall not be hanged said ratcliffe you will see indeed he ever had the greatest confidence that he would escape i recollect that on the occasion when we were being carried from newgate to receive sentence at westminster our coach was stopped in fleet street to make way for king george who was setting out upon his first visit to herrenhausen since he had come to the english throne we stopped opposite a distillers and ratcliffe leaning from the window very coolly called for half a pint of aniseed and drank it off there is some merit in the dutchman after all he said with a laugh for i was in great need of that the events however justified his confidence never shall i forget the weeks which followed our condemnation the intrigues with our friends outside the timorous bribing of the gaolers within one day the plan would be settled the moment for its execution appointed and the next thing maybe we saw was the countenance of a new gaoler and so the attempt must needs be deferred and the trouble begin again or at another time news would be brought to us that we should receive the clemency of the crown and only suffer transportation to the colonies or again that we were to be granted a free pardon or again that the sentence was to be carried out within a week so that now we kicked our heels upon the pinnacles of hope now we sank into a bog of despair and either way we shivered with fever all of us except charles ratcliffe it was with his usual serenity that when at last all arrangements had been made he invited those of us who were in the plot to a grand entertainment in a room called the castle in the upper part of the prison there are thirteen of us besides myself said he as soon as the supper was served and we were left alone the rest must shift for themselves mr clavering do you help me with this file and do you gentlemen be sufficiently illmannered to make as much clatter with the dishes and your talk as will drown the sound of it whereupon he drew a file from his pocket and i crossed over with him to a little door in the corner of the room and while the others talked and clattered i went to work with my file upon the screws of the plate which held the lock to the door when i was tired and my fingers bleeding ratcliffe took my place and after him another until at last the plate came away now said ratcliffe the passage leads to the debtors side we have been to solace our good friend mr tiverton who has been most unkindly committed by his creditors mr tiverton pray do not forget the name gentlemen for even the most obliging gaoler might cavil if we forgot the name we followed him quickly along the passage across the yard to the porters lodge poor man says ratcliffe it is very barbarous and inhuman that a man of genius should go to prison for lack of money for my part sir says the gaoler throwing open the wicket i pity his tradesmen but some men are born to be gulled says ratcliffe with his tongue in his cheek and heres five guineas for you and he stepped into the street we followed him quickly enough and once there scattered without so much as a single word of farewell each man had his own plant no doubt for myself i knew that a certain sloop was waiting for me on the thames and i hurried down to the waters edge below london bridge a boat was waiting by the steps lawrence cried a voice which sent my heart leaping hush i whispered and jumped into the stern dorothy made room for me beside her push off she said and in a moment we were floating down the river in and out between the ships give me the tiller said i no said dorothy it was my doing that you were brought into peril let me steer you out of it the number of ships diminished before they were about us like the trees of a forest now they were the trees of an alley down which we passed and ever the alley broadened and the trees grew scarce i saw you that night at carlisle she began when you were taken to the castle and at that she broke off suddenly and her voice stiffened my kinsman came to you at carlisle what did he say he said that he was charged with the friendliest messages from you is that all now there was something more but i thought it wise to make no mention of it he did not repeat the messages was all i said and she sat up as though her pride was relieved and for a little we were silent a ship was anchored some way ahead of us and a lanthorn swung on its poop is it the swallow i asked yes said she and then before i left carlisle i saw her for a moment i wondered of whom she was talking i saw her and her husband then i understood she is very plain said dorothy in a whisper oh no said i indeed she is not you do her an injustice but she is repeated dorothy she is it would have been better had i left the matter thus but i was foolish enough to seriously argue the point with her and so hot became the argument that we overshot the ship that is your fault said dorothy as she turned the boat we rowed to the ships side a ladder was hoisted over and a lanthorn held by the light of it i could see mr curwen and behind him my servant ashlock i rose to give a hand to dorothy but she sat in the stern without so much as a pretence of movement come dorothy said mr curwen dorothy looked steadily at me she is very plain she said and then looked away across the river humming a tune i was in a quandary as to what i should do for i knew that she was not plain but also i knew that dorothy would not move until i had said she was so i stood then holding on to the ladder while the boat rose and sank beneath my feet i have been told since that there was really only one expedient which would have served my turn and that was to tumble incontinently into the water and make as much pretence of drowning as i could only it never occurred to me and so i weakly gave in dorothy stepped on board the boat was hoisted the anchor raised and in the smallest space of time the foam was bubbling from the bows overhead the stars shone steady in the sky and danced in the water beneath us and so we sailed to france dorothy said i there is a word which has been much used between us friends yes said she in a low voice it is a good word and so it was many months afterwards before i came to her again in paris and pleaded that there was a better i would you thought with me i stammered out dorothy with the sweetest laugh that ever my ears hearkened to began to sing over to herself a verse of the honest lover dear heart she said i called you an owl but it should have been a bat jervas rookley i never came across again but i know that he did not win blackladies though whether a suspicion of his treachery is accountable or the avarice of the hanoverians i cannot tell i have heard too that at one time he was the master of a ship trading in the south seas but of this again i have no sure knowledge the end
