 ray bradbury dorian in excelsis good evening welcome i see you have my invitation in your hands decided to be brave did you fine here we are grab onto this the tall handsome stranger with the heavenly eyes and the impossibly blond hair handed me a wine glass clean your palate he said i took the glass and read the label on the bottle he held in his left hand bordeaux it read st emillion go on said my host its not poison may i sit and might you drink i might i sipped shut my eyes and smiled youre a connoisseur this is the best ive had in years but why this wine and why the invitation what am i doing here at grays anatomy bar and grille i my host sat and filled his own glass am doing a favor to myself this is a great night perhaps for both of us greater than christmas or halloween his lizard tongue darted into his wine to vanish back into his contentment we celebrate my being honored at last becoming he exhaled it all out becoming he said a friend to dorian dorians friend me ah i laughed that explains the name of this place then does dorian own grays anatomy more inspire and rule over it and deservedly so you make it sound as if being a friend to dorian is the most important thing in the world no in life in all of life he rocked back and forth drunk not from the wine but some inner joy guess at what how old i am you look to be twentynine at the most twentynine what a lovely sound not thirty forty or fifty but i said i hope youre not going to ask what sign i was born under i usually leave when people ask that i was born on the cusp august i pretended to halfrise he pressed a gentle hand to my lapel no no dear boy you dont understand look here and here he touched under his eyes and then around his neck look for wrinkles but you have none i said how observant none and that is why i have become this very night a fresh new stunningly handsome friend to dorian i still dont see the connection look at the backs of my hands he showed his wrists no liver spots i am not turning to rust i repeat the question how old am i i swirled the wine in my glass and studied his reflection in the swirl sixty i guessed seventy good god he fell back in his chair astonish ed how did you know word association youve been rattling on about dorian i know my oscar wilde i know my dorian gray which means you sir have a portrait of yourself stashed in an attic aging while you yourself drinking old wine stay young no no the handsome stranger leaned forward not stayed young became young i was old very old and it took a year but the clock went back and after a year of playing at it i achieved what i set out for twentynine was your target how clever you are and once you became twentynine you were fully elected as a friend to dorian bullseye but there is no portrait no attic no staying young its becoming young agains the ticket im still puzzled child of my heart you might possibly be another friend come along before the greatest revelation let me show you the far end of the room and some doors he seized my hand bring your wine youll need it he hustled me along through the tables in a swiftly filling room of mostly middleaged and some fairly young men and a few smokeexhaling ladies i jogged along staring back at the exit as if my future life were there before us stood a golden door and behind the door i asked what always lies behind any golden door my host responded touch i reached out to print the door with my thumb what do you feel my host inquired youngness youth beauty i touched again all the springtimes that ever were or ever will be jeez the mans a poet push we pushed and the golden door swung soundlessly wide is this where dorian is no no only his students his disciples his almost friends feast your eyes i did as i was told and saw at the longest bar in the world a line of men a lineage of young men reflecting and rereflecting each other as in a fabled mirror maze that illusion seen where mirrors face each other and you find yourself repeated to infinity large small very small smallest gone the young men were all staring down the long bar at us and then as if unable to pull their gaze away at themselves you could almost hear their cries of appreciation and with each cry they grew younger and younger and more splendid and more beautiful i gazed upon a tapestry of beauty a golden phalanx freshly out of the elysian fields and hills the gates of mythology swung wide and apollo and his demiapollos glided forth each more beautiful than the last i must have gasped i heard my host inhale as if he drank my wine yes arent they he said i think its time to leave i said nonsense come no one will see you theyre all busy i am moses said the sweet breath at my elbow and i hereby tell the red sea to part and we moved along a path between two tides each shadowed each more terrifying with its gasps its cries its slippages of flesh its slapping like waves its repeated whispers for more more ah god more i ran but my host grabbed on look right left now right again there must have been a hundred two hundred animals beasts no men wrestling leaping falling rolling in darkness it was a sea of flesh undulant a writhing of limbs on acres of tumbling mats a glistening of skin flashes of teeth where men climbed ropes spun on leather horses or flung themselves up crossbars to be seized down in the tidal flux of lamentations and muffled cries i stared across an ocean of rising and falling shapes my ears were scorched by their bestial moans what my god i exclaimed does it all mean there see and above the wild turbulence of flesh in a far wall was a great window forty feet wide and ten feet tall and behind that cold glass something watching savoring alert one vast stare and over all there was the suction of a great breath a vast inhalation which pulled at the gymnasium air with a constant hungry and invisible need as the shadows tumbled and writhed this inhalation tugged at them and the raw air in my nostrils somewhere a huge vacuum machine sucked in darkness but did not exhale there were long pauses as the shadows flailed and fell and then another savoring inhalation it swallowed breath in in always in devouring the sweaty air hungering the passions and the shadows were pulled i was pulled toward that vast glass eye that immense window behind which a shapeless something stared to dine on gymnasium airs dorian i guessed come meet him yes but i watched the wild convulsive shadows what are they doing go find out afraid cowards never live so he swung wide a third door and whether it was golden hot and alive i could not feel for suddenly i lurched into a hothouse as the door slammed and was locked by my blond young friend ready lord i must go home not until you meet said my host him he pointed at first i could see nothing the lights were dim and the place like the gymnasium was mostly shadow i smelled jungle greens the air stirred on my face with sensuous strokes i smelled papaya and mango and the wilted odor of orchids mixed with the salt smells of an unseen tide but the tide was there with that immense inhaled breath that rose and was quiet and began again i see no one i said let your eyes adjust wait i waited i watched there were no chairs in the room for there was no need of chairs he did not sit he did not recline he prolonged himself on the largest bed in history the dimensions might easily have been fifteen feet by twenty it reminded me of the apartment of a writer i once knew who had completely covered his room with mattresses so that women stumbled on the sill and fell flat out on the springs so it was with this nest with dorian immense a gelatinous skin a vitreous shape undulant within that nest and if dorian was male or female i could not guess this was a great pudding an emperor jellyfish a monstrous heap of sexual gelatin from the exterior of which on occasion noxious gases escaped with rubbery sounds great lips sibulating that and the sough of that labored pump that constant inhalation were the only sounds within the chamber as i stood anxious alarmed but at last impressed by this beached creature cast up from a clark landfall the thing was a gelatinous cripple an octopus without limbs an amphibian stranded unable to undulate and seep back to an ocean sewer from which it had inched itself in monstrous waves and gusts of lungs and eruptions of corrupt gas until now it lay featureless with a mere xray ghost of legs arms wrists and hands with skeletal fingers at last i could discern at the far end of this flesh peninsula what seemed a halfflat face with a frail phantom of skull beneath an open fissure for an eye a ravenous nostril and a red wound which ripped wide to surprise me as a mouth and at last this thing this dorian spoke or whispered or lisped and with each lisp each sibulance an odor of decay was expelled as from a vast nightswamp balloon sunk on its side lost in fetid water as its unsavory breath rinsed my cheeks it expelled but one lingering syllable come whispered my new friend run the gauntlet dont linger you may find tigertears on your sleeve and blood rising now and he glided he undulated me along on his soundless tuxedo slippers his fingers a pale touch on my elbow his breath a flower scent too near i heard myself say its been written that h g wells attracted women with his breath which smelled of honey then i learned that such breath comes with illness how clever do i smell of hospitals and medicines i didnt mean quickly youre rare meat in the zoo hup two three hold on i said breathless not from walking fast but perceiving quickly this man and the next and the one after that yes my god i said theyre almost all the same lookalikes bullseye halftrue and the next and the next after that as far behind as we have gone as far ahead as we might go all twentynine years old all golden tan all six feet tall white of teeth bright of eye each different but beautiful like me i glanced at him and saw what i saw around me similar but different beauties so much youngness i was stunned isnt it time you told me your name dorian but you said you were his friend i am they are but we all share his name this chap here and the next oh once we had commoner names smith and jones harry and phil jimmy and jake but then we signed up to become friends is that why i was invited to sign up i saw you in a bar across town a year ago made queries a year later you look the proper age proper well arent you just leaving sixtynine arriving at seventy well my god are you happy being seventy itll do do wouldnt you like to be really happy steal some wild oats sow them that times over its not i asked and you came curious curious about what this he bared me his neck again and flexed his pale white wrists and all those he waved at the fine faces as we passed dorians sons dont you want to be gloriously wild and young like them how can i decide lord youve thought of it all night for years soon you could be part of this we had reached the far end of the line of men with bronzed faces white teeth and breath like hg wells scent of honey arent you tempted he pursued will you refuse immortality no to live the next twenty years die at ninety and look twentynine in the damn tomb in the mirror over there what do you see an old goat among ten dozen fauns yes where do i sign up i laughed do you accept no i need more facts damn heres the second door get in he swung wide a door more golden than the first shoved me followed and slammed the door i stared at darkness whats this i whispered dorians gym of course if you work out here all year hour by hour day by day you get younger thats some gym i observed trying to adjust my eyes to the dim areas beyond where shadows tumbled and voices rustled and whispered ive heard of gyms that help keep not make you young now tell me i read your mind for every old man that became young in there at the bar is there an attic portrait well is there no theres only dorian a single person who grows old for all of you touche behold his gym i gazed off into a vast high arena where a hundred shadows stirred and moaned like a tide on a terrible shore yesssss yes what and then it added soooo how long how long i murmured has it has he been here no one knows when victoria was queen when booth emptied his makeup kit to load his pistol when napoleon yellowstained the moscow snows forevers not bad what else i swallowed hard is is he dorian dorian of the attic he of the portrait and somewhere along the line found portraits not enough oil canvas no depth the world needed something that could soak in sponge the midnight rains breakfast and lunch on loss depravitys guilt something to truly take in drink digest a pustule imperial intestine a rheum aeshophagus for sin a laboratory plate to take bacterial snows dorian the long archipelago of membranous skin flushed some buried tubes and valves and a semblance of laughter was throttled and drowned in the aqueous gels a slit widened to emit gas and the single word again yessss hes welcoming you my host smiled i know i know i said impatiently but why i dont even want to be here im ill why cant we go because my host laughed you were selected selected weve had our eye on you you mean youve watched followed spied on me christ who gave you permission temper temper not everyone is picked who said i wanted to be picked if you could see yourself as we see you youd know why i turned to stare at the vast mound of priapic gelatin in which faint creeks gleamed as the creature wept its lids wide in holes to let it stare then all its apertures sealed the sabrecut mouth the slitted nostrils the cold eyes gummed shut so that its skin was faceless the sibulance pumped with gaseous suctions yessss it whispered lisssst it murmured and list it is my host pulled forth a small computer pad which he tapped to screen my name address and phone he glanced from the pad to reel off such items as wilted me single he said married and divorced now single no women in your life im walking wounded he tapped his pad visiting strange bars i hadnt noticed creative blindness getting to bed late sleeping all day drinking heavily three nights a week twice going to the gym look every day workouts excessive prolonged steambaths overlong massages sudden interest in sports endless basketball soccer tennis matches every night and half the noons thats hyperventilation my business and ours youre balanced giddily on the rim shove all these facts in that onearmed bandit in your head yank and watch the lemons and ripe cherries spin yank jesus god yes bars drinks late nights gyms saunas masseurs basketball tennis soccer yank pull spin well my host searched my face amused three jackpot cherries in a row i shuddered circumstance no court would convict me this court elects you we tell palms to read ravenous groins yes gas steamed up from one shriveled aperture in the restless mound yessss they say that men in the grip of passion blind to their own darkness make love and run mad stunned by guilt they find themselves beasts having done the very thing they were warned not to do by church town parents life in explosive outrage they turn to the sinful lure seeing her as unholy provocateur they kill women in similar rages and guilts overdose eve lies selfslain in the garden adam hangs himself with the snake as noose but here was no passionate crime no woman no provocateur only the great mound of siphoning breath and my blond host and only words which fiddled me with fusillades of arrows like an orient hedgehog bristled with shafts my body exploded with no no no echoed and then real no yesssss whispered the vapor from the mounded tissue the skeleton buried in ancient soups yesss i gasped to see my games steams midnight bars late dawn beds a maniac sum i rounded dark corridors to confront a stranger so pockmarked creased and oiled by passion so cobwebbed and smashed by drink that i tried to avert my gaze the terror gaped his mouth and reached for my hand stupidly i reached to shake his and rapped glass a mirror i stared deep into my own life i had seen myself in shop windows dim undersea men running in creeks mornings shaving i saw my mirrored health but this this troglodyte trapped in amber myself snapshotted like ten dozen sexual acrobats and who jammed this mirror at me my beautiful host and that corrupt flatulence beyond you are selected they whispered i refuse i shrieked and whether i shrieked aloud or merely thought a great furnace gaped the oceanic mound erupted thunders of gaseous steams my beautiful host fell back stunned that their search beneath my skin behind my mask had brought revulsion always when dorian cried friend raw gymnast teams had mobbed to catapult that armless legless featureless sargasso sea before they had smothered to drown in his miasma to arise embrace and wrestle in the dark gymnasium then run forth young to assault a world and i what had i dared to do that quaked that membranous sac into regurgitated whistlings and broken winds idiot cried my host all teeth and fists out out out i cried spun to obey and tripped i do not clearly know what happened as i fell and if it was a swift reaction to the holocaust erupted like vile spit and vomit from that putrescent mound i cannot say i knew no lightning shock of murder yet knew perhaps some summer heat flash of revenge for what i thought what are you to dorian or he to you that frees the hydra behind your face or causes the slightest twitch of leg arm hand or fingernail as the last fetid air from dorian burned my hair and stuffed my nostrils it was over in a second something shoved me did my secret self insulted give that push i was flung as if on wires knocked to sprawl at dorian he gave two terrible cries one of warning one of despair i was recovered so in landing i did not sink my hands deep in that poisonous yeast into that multiflorid manof war jelly i swear that i touched raked scarified him with only one thing the smallest fingernail of my right hand my fingernail and so this dorian was shot and foundered and so the mammoth with screams collapsed and so the nauseous balloon sank fold on midnight fold upon its own boneless self fissuring volcanic sulphurs immense rectal airs outgassed whistles and whimpers of selfpitying despair christ what have you done murderer damn you cried my host riven to stare at dorians exhaustions unto death he whirled to strike but ran to reach the door and cry lock this lock whatever happens for gods sake dont open now the door slammed i ran to lock it and turn quietly dorian was falling away he sank down and down out of sight like a great membranous tent with its poles removed he vanished into the floor down flues and vents on all sides of his great platform nest vents obviously created for such a massive diseasesac melting into viral fluid and sewer gas even as i watched the last of the noxious clot was sucked into the vents and i stood abandoned in a room where but a few minutes before an unspeakable strata of discards and half born fetuses had lain sucking at sins spoiled bones and souls to send forth beasts in semblance of beauty that perverse royalty that lunatic monarch gone all gone a last choke and throttle from the sewer vent underlined its death my god i thought even now that all that that terrible miasma that stuff is on its way to the sea to wash in with bland tides to lie on clean shores where bathers come at dawn even now i stood eyes shut waiting for what there had to be a next thing yes it came there was a trembling shivering and then a quaking of the wall but especially the golden door behind me i spun to see as well as hear i saw the door shaken and then bombarded from the other side fists pummeled struck hammered voices cried out and screamed and then shrieked i felt a great mass ram the door to shiver to slam it on its hinges i stared fearful that the door might explode and let in the floodtide of nightmare ravening terrified beasts the kennel of dying things for now their shrieks as they mauled and rattled to escape to beg for mercy were so terrible that i clamped my fists to my ears dorian was gone but they remained shrieks screams screams shrieks an avalanche of limbs beyond the door struck and fell yammering what must they look like now i thought all those bouquets all those beauties the police will come i thought soon but no matter what i would not unlock that door
