wife said mr benjamin stanton as he sat down to a late breakfast i had a letter from ohio yesterday from ohio who should write you from ohio anyone i know my sister margaret you remember moved out there with her husband ten years ago oh its from her is it said mrs stanton indifferently no said her husband with momentary gravity its from a dr kent who attended her in her last illness margaret is dead dear me returned mrs stanton uncomfortably and i am just out of mourning for my aunt do you think it will be necessary for us to go into mourning for your sister no i think not said her husband margaret has lived away from us so long and people wont know that we have had a death in the family unless we mention it was that all the letter said about the death i mean why no said mr stanton with a little frown it seems margaret left a child a boy of fourteen and as she left no property the doctor suggests that i should send for the boy and assume the care of him upon my word said mrs stanton you will find yourself in business if you undertake to provide for all the beggars brats that apply to you for assistance you must remember that you are speaking of my sisters child said mr stanton who cold and selfish and worldly as he was had some touch of decency about him and did not relish the term beggars brats as applied to one so nearly related to him well call him what you like said his wife only dont be so foolish as to go spending your money on him when our children need all we have theres maria needs a new dress immediately she says all the girls at signor madalinis dancing academy dress elegantly and shes positively ashamed to appear in any of her present dresses how much will it cost asked mr stanton opening his pocketbook you may hand me seventyfive dollars i think i can make that do without a word of remonstrance the money was placed in her hand i want some money too said tom stanton who had just disposed of a very hearty meal what do you want it for tom oh some of the fellows are getting up a club its going to be a select affair and of course each of us has got to contribute some money you see we are going to hire a room furnish it nicely with a carpet black walnut furniture and so on and thatll cost something whose idea is it well sam paget was the first boy that mentioned it whose son is he his father belongs to the firm of paget norwood co hes awful rich yes it is one of our first families said mr stanton with satisfaction is he a friend of yours tom oh yes we are quit intimate thats right said his father approvingly i am glad you choose your friends so well thats one of the principal reasons i have for sending you to an expensive school to get you well launched into good society yes father i understand said tom you wont find me associating with common boys i hold my head a little too high for that i can tell you thats right my boy said mr stanton with satisfaction and now how much money do you want for this club of yours well said tom hesitatingly thirty or forty dollars isnt that considerable said his father surprised at the amount well you see father i want to contribute as much as any of the boys it would seem mean if i didnt theres only a few of us to stand the expense and we dont want to let in any out of our own set thats true said mr stanton i approve of that its all very well to talk about democracy but i believe in those of the higher orders keeping by themselves then youll give the money father said tom eagerly yes tom theres forty dollars its more than i ought to spare but i am determined you shall stand as good a chance as any of your schoolfellows they shant be able to say that your father stints you in anything that your position requires thank you father said tom pocketing the two twentydollar bills with great satisfaction the fact was that toms assessment amounted to only twenty dollars but he thought it would be a good excuse for getting more out of his father as to the extra money tom felt confident that he could find uses enough for it he had latterly though but fourteen years of age contracted the habit of smoking cigars a habit which he found rather expensive especially as he felt bound occasionally to treat his companions then he liked now and then to drop in and get an icecream or some confectionery and these little expenses counted up mr stanton was a vain worldly man he was anxious to obtain an entrance into the best society for this reason he made it a point to send his children to the most expensive schools trusting to their forming fashionable acquaintances through whom his whole family might obtain recognition into those select circles for which he cherished a most undemocratic respect for this reason it was that though not naturally liberal he had opened his purse willingly at the demands of mrs stanton and tom well said mrs stanton after toms little financial affair had been adjusted what are you going to write to this doctor of course you wont think of sending for your nephew by no means he is much better off where he is i shall write dr kent that he is old enough to earn his own living and i shall recommend that he be bound out to some farmer or mechanic in the neighborhood it is an imposition to expect because i am tolerably well off that it is my duty to support other peoples children my own are entitled to all i can do for them thats so father said tom who was ready enough to give his consent to any proposition of a selfish nature charity begins at home with tom by the way it not only began at home but it ended there and the same may be said of his father from time to time mr stantons name was found in the list of donors to some charitable object provided his benevolence was likely to obtain sufficient publicity mr stanton did not believe in giving in secret what was the use of giving away money unless you could get credit for it that was the principle upon which he always acted i suppose continued tom this country cousin of mine wears cowhide boots and overalls and has got rough red hands like a common laborer i wonder what sam paget would say if i should introduce such a fellow to him as my cousin i rather guess he would not want to be quite so intimate with me as he is now if anything had been needed this consideration would have been sufficient to deter mr stanton from sending for his nephew he could not permit the social standing of his family to be compromised by the presence of a poor relation from the country rough and unpolished as he doubtless was maria too who had been for some time silent here contributed to strengthen the effect of toms words yes said she and laura brooks my most intimate friend who is shocked at anything vulgar or countrified i wouldnt have her know that i have such a cousin oh not for the world there will be no occasion for it said her father decidedly i shall write at once to this dr kent explaining to him my views and wishes and how impossible it is for me to do as he so inconsiderately suggests its the wisest thing you can do mr stanton said his wife who was to the full as selfish as her husband what is his name father asked maria whose name the boys herbert mason herbert i thought it might be jonathan or zeke or some such name herbert isnt at all countrified no said tom slyly of course not we all know why you like that name oh youre mighty wise mr tom retorted his sister its because you like herbert dartmouth but it isnt any use hes in love with lizzie graves you seem to know all about it said maria with vexation for tom was not far from right in speaking of her preference for herbert dartmouth of course i do said tom i ought to for he told me so himself i dont believe it said maria who looked ready to cry well you neednt but its so be quiet children said mrs stanton thomas you mustnt plague your sister dont take it so hard maria said tom in rather an aggravating tone theres other boys you could get i guess you could get jim gorham for a beau if you tried hard enough i wouldnt have him said maria his face is all over freckles enough of this quarreling children said mrs stanton i hope she continued addressing her husband you wont fail to write at once they might be sending on the boy and then we should be in a pretty predicament i will write at once i dont know but i ought to inclose some money i dont see why you need to perhaps i had better as this is the last i intend to do for him at any rate it wont be necessary to send much said mrs stanton how much five dollars will do i should think because he happens to be your nephew there is no good reason why he should be thrown upon you for support perhaps it will be best to send ten dollars said mr stanton people are unreasonable you know and they might charge me with meanness if i sent less then make it ten its only for once i hope that will be the last we shall hear of him the room in which this conversation took place was a handsomely furnished breakfast room all the appointments of which spoke not only of comfort but of luxury mr stanton had been made rich by a series of lucky speculations and he was at present carrying on a large wholesale store downtown he had commenced with small means twenty years before and for some years had advanced slowly until the tide of fortune set in and made him rich his present handsome residence he had only occupied three years having moved to it from one of much smaller pretensions on bleecker street tom and maria were forbidden to speak of their former home to their present fashionable acquaintances and this prohibition they were likely to observe having inherited to the full the worldly spirit which actuated their parents it will be seen that herbert mason was little likely to be benefited by having such prosperous relations chapter ii introducing the hero if my young readers do not find the town of waverley on the map of ohio they may conclude that it was too small to attract the notice of the mapmakers the village is small consisting of about a dozen houses a church a schoolhouse and as a matter of course one of that wellknown class of stores in which everything required for the family is sold from a dresspattern to a pound of sugar outside of the village there are farmhouses surrounded by broad acres which keep them at respectable distances from each other like the feudal castles of the middle ages the land is good and the farmers are thrifty and welltodo but probably the whole town contains less than a thousand inhabitants in one of the houses near the church lived dr kent whose letter has already been referred to he was a skillful physician and a very worthy man who would have been very glad to be benevolent if his limited practice had supplied him with the requisite means but chance had directed him to a healthy and sparselysettled neighborhood where he was able only to earn a respectable livelihood and indeed found himself compelled to economize at times where he would have liked to indulge himself in expense when mrs mason died it was found that the sale of her furniture barely realized enough to defray the expenses of her funeral herbert her only son was left wholly unprovided for dr kent knowing that he had a rich uncle in new york undertook to communicate to him the position in which his nephew had been left never doubting that he would cheerfully extend a helping hand to him meanwhile he invited herbert to come to his house and make it his home till his uncle should send for him herbert was a handsome wellgrown boy of fourteen and a general favorite in the village while his mother lived he had done all he could to lighten her tasks and he grieved deeply for her loss now that she was gone his father had ten years before failed in business in the city of new york and in a fit of depression had emigrated to this obscure country village where he had invested the few hundred dollars remaining to him in a farm from which he was able to draw a scanty income being a man of liberal education he had personally superintended the education of his son till his death two years before so that herberts attainments were considerably in advance of those of other boys of his age in the neighborhood he knew something of latin and french which made him looked upon as quite a model of learning by his playmates after his fathers death he had continued the daily study of the languages so that he was able to read ordinary french with nearly as much ease as if it were english though studious he was not a bookworm but was distinguished in athletic sports popular with boys of his age enough has been said of our hero by way of introduction herberts faults and virtues will appear as the record of his adventures is continued it may be hinted only that while he was frank manly and generous in his disposition he was proud and highspirited also and perhaps these qualities were sometimes carried to excess he would not allow himself to be imposed upon if he could help it being strong for his age he was always able to maintain his rights but never abused his strength by making it the instrument of tyrannizing over weaker boys of course herbert felt somewhat anxious as to his future prospects he knew that the doctor had written to his uncle benjamin about him and he hoped that he might be sent for to new york having a great curiosity to see the city of which he had heard so much have you heard from my uncle dr kent he inquired a few days after the scene recorded in our first chapter his question was prompted by seeing the doctor coming into the yard with an open letter in his hand yes said dr kent with troubled expression and perplexed took what does uncle benjamin say asked our young hero eagerly nothing very encouraging herbert i am sorry to say returned the doctor however here is the letter you may read it for yourself herbert received the letter from the doctors hands and read it through with feelings of mortification and anger here it is dear sir i have to acknowledge yours of the th inst i regret to hear of my sisters decease i regret also to hear that her son herbert is left without a provision for his support my brotherinlaw i cannot but consider culpable in neglecting to lay up something during his life upon which his widow and son might depend i suspect that he must have lived with inconsiderate extravagance as for myself i have a family of my own to provide for and the expense of living in a city like this is very great in justice to them i do not feel that it would be right for me to incur extra expense you tell me that he is now fourteen and a stout boy he is able i should think to earn his own living i should recommend that he be bound out to a farmer or mechanic to defray any little expenses that may arise i enclose ten dollars which i hope he may find serviceable yours etc benjamin stanton this cold and selfish letter herbert read with rising color and a feeling of bitterness found a place in his young heart which was quite foreign to him well herbert what do you think of it asked the doctor i think said herbert hotly that i dont want to have anything to do with an uncle who could write such a letter as that he doesnt seem to write with much feeling acknowledged the doctor feeling repeated herbert he writes as if i were a beggar and asked charity where is the money he inclosed dr kent i have it here in my vest pocket i was afraid it would slip out of the letter and so took care of it will you let me send it back to my uncle asked herbert send it back yes dr kent i dont want any of his charity and ill tell him so i am afraid herbert that you are giving way to your pride but isnt it a proper pride doctor i hardly know what to say herbert you must remember however that as you are left quite unprovided for even this small sum may be of use to you it isnt the smallness of the sum that i mind said herbert if uncle benjamin had written a kind letter or showed the least feeling in it for me or for for mother his voice faltered a moment i would have accepted it thankfully but i couldnt accept money thrown at me in that way he didnt want to give it to me i am sure and wouldnt if he hadnt felt obliged to dr kent paced the room thoughtfully he respected herberts feelings but he saw that it was not wise for him to indulge them he was in a dependent situation and it was to be feared that he would have much to suffer in time to come from the coldness and selfishness of the world i will tell you what to do herbert he said after a while you can accept this money as a loan and repay it when you are able with interest yes with interest if you prefer it i shall be willing to accept it on those terms said herbert but i want my uncle to understand it you may write to your uncle to that effect if you like very well dr kent then i will write to him at once you will find some paper in my desk herbert i suppose you will not object to my seeing your letter no doctor i intended to show it to you you wont expect me to show much gratitude i hope i wont insist upon it herbert said the doctor smiling herbert in about half an hour submitted the following note to the doctors inspection it had cost him considerable thought to determine how to express himself but he succeeded at last to his tolerable satisfaction uncle benjamin so the letter commenced dr kent has just shown me your reply to his letter about me you seem to think i wish you to support me which is not the case all i should have asked was your influence to help me in obtaining a situation in the city where i might support myself i am willing to work and shall probably find some opportunity here the ten dollars which you inclose i will accept as a loan and will repay you as soon as i am able with interest herbert mason will that do asked herbert dr kent smiled you were careful not to express any gratitude herbert he said because i dont feel any returned herbert promptly i feel grateful to you dr kent for your great kindness i wish i could pay you for that i shall never forget how you attended my mother in her sickness when there was small prospect of your being paid my dear boy said the doctor resting his hand affectionately on herberts shoulder i have been able to do but very little i wish i could do more if you wish to repay me you can do it a hundred times over by growing up a good and honorable man one upon whom your mother in heaven can look down with grateful joy if it is permitted her to watch your progress here i will do my best doctor said herbert the world is all before you proceeded dr kent you may not achieve a brilliant destiny it is permitted to few to do that but whether your sphere is wide or narrow you may exert an influence for good and leave the world better for your having lived in it i hope it may be so said herbert thoughtfully when i am tempted to do wrong i will think of my mother it is the very best thing you can do herbert and now for your plans i wish i were in a situation to have you remain with me but as that cannot be i will do my best to get you a place i ought to be at work said herbert as i have my living to get i want you to take that ten dollars doctor as part payment of the debt i owe you the doctor shook his head i cant do that herbert not even to oblige you you were too proud to accept a favor from your uncle you will not be too proud i hope to accept one from me no doctor i am not too proud for that you are my friend and my uncle cares nothing for me when herberts letter reached new york his uncle felt a momentary shame for he saw that his nephew had rightfully interpreted his own selfishness and lack of feeling and he could not help involuntarily admiring the independent spirit which would not allow him to accept the proffered money except as a loan but mingled with his shame was a feeling of relief as he foresaw that herberts pride would not suffer him to become a burden upon him in the future he hardly expected ever to see the ten dollars returned with interest but even if he lost it he felt that he should be getting off cheap chapter iii a collision it was a week later when an incident befell herbert which is worthy of mention since it brought him into collision with a man who was destined to have some influence over his future life a neighboring farmer for whom during his mothers life he had occasionally gone on errands drove up in front of the doctors house and asked herbert if he could take his horse and wagon and drive over to the mill village to get some corn ground herbert was rather glad to accept this proposal not only because he was to receive twentyfive cents for so doing but also because he was fond of driving a horse he was only about a mile from the mill village when he saw approaching him a man in a light open buggy herbert knew every horse in waverley and every man woman and child for that matter and he perceived at once that the driver was a stranger to tell the truth he was not very favorably impressed by his appearance the man was very dark with black hair and an unshaven beard of three days growth which did not set off his irregular and repulsive features his mouth partly open revealed several yellow tusks stained with tobacco juice on his head he wore a broadbrimmed straw hat rather the worse for wear it so happened that just at this point the middle of the road was much better than the sides which sloped considerably terminating in gullies which were partly full from the recent rains the road was narrow being wide enough for two vehicles to pass each other if each veered to the side but not otherwise herbert observed that the buggy which was now rapidly approaching was kept in the center of the road and that the driver appeared to have no intention of turning out what does he mean thought our hero he cannot expect me to do the whole of the turning out i will turn out my half and if he wants to get by he must do the same accordingly he turned partially to one side as much as could be reasonably expected and quietly awaited the approach of the man in the buggy the latter still kept the center of the road and did not turn out his carriage at all as soon as it was close at hand the driver leaned forward and exclaimed angrily turn out boy if he expected that herbert would be intimidated by his tone he was much mistaken our hero was bold and not easily frightened he looked quietly in the mans face and said composedly i have turned out then turn out more you young vagabond do you hear me yes sir i hear you and should if you didnt speak half so loud curse your impudence i tell you turn out more exclaimed the stranger becoming more and more angry he had expected to get his own way without trouble if herbert had been a man he would not have been so unreasonable but he supposed he could browbeat a boy into doing whatever he chose to dictate but he had met his match as it turned out i have already given you half the road said herbert firmly and i dont intend to give you any more you dont eh young man how old are you i am fourteen i should think you were forty by the airs you put on is it putting on airs to insist on my rights asked our hero your rights retorted the other laughing contemptuously yes my rights returned herbert quietly i have a right to half of the road and i have taken it if i turn out any more i shall go into the gully that makes no difference a wetting wont do you any harm your impudence needs cooling that may be said herbert who did not choose to get angry but was resolved to maintain his rights but i object to the wetting for all that and as this wagon is not mine i do not choose to upset it you are the most insolent young scamp i ever came across exclaimed the other furiously ive a good mind to give you something much worse than a wetting such as what asked our hero coolly in reply the man flourished his whip significantly do you see that he asked yes oh very well said the other ironically im glad you do perhaps you wouldnt like to feel it no i dont think i should said herbert not exhibiting the least apprehension the stranger handled his whip eyeing our hero viciously at the same time as if it would have afforded him uncommon pleasure to lay it over his back but there was something in the look of our hero which unconsciously cowed him and much as he wished to strike him he held back well youre a cool hand he said after a moments hesitation to this our hero did not see fit to make any reply but he grasped his own whip a little tighter so brutal had been the tone assumed by the stranger that he was not sure but he might proceed to carry out his threat and lay the whip over his back he determined in that case to give him as good as he sent i will not express any opinion as to the propriety of this determination but i am certain from what i know of our heros fearless spirit that he would not have hesitated to do it be the consequences what they might but he did not have the opportunity once more demanded the stranger furiously are you going to turn out no said the boy decidedly then ill run you down so saying he brought the whip violently on the horses back the latter gave a convulsive spring forward but his driver had not taken into consideration that the farmwagon was the stronger of the two vehicles and that in any collision the buggy must come off second best so it happened that a wheel of the buggy was broken and the driver in the shock thrown sprawling into a puddle on the other side of the road the wagon suffered no damage but the old horse terrified set off at a rapid pace herbert looked back to see if the stranger was injured but seeing that he had already picked himself up unwounded but decidedly dirty he concluded to keep on his way to the mill the driver of the overturned vehicle was considerably more angry than hurt at this catastrophe it chafed his pride not a little to think that after all his vaunts the boy had maintained his ground and got the better of him for a man of fortyfive to be worsted by a boy of fourteen was it must be confessed a little mortifying it was something like a great ship of the line being compelled to surrender to a little monitor no one feels particularly dignified or goodnatured when he is picking himself out of a mud puddle our blackhaired acquaintance proved no exception to this remark he shook his fist at the receding wagon and its occupant a demonstration of defiance which our hero did not witness his back being now turned to his late opponent mr abner holden for this was the strangers name next turned his attention to the buggy which had been damaged to some extent and so was likely to involve him in expense this was another uncomfortable reflection meanwhile as it was no longer in a fit state for travel he must contrive some way to have it carried back to the stable and unless he could procure another vehicle perform the rest of the journey on foot luckily some men in a neighboring field had witnessed the collision and supposing their services might be required were now present to lend their aid pretty bad accident remarked one of them that ere wheelll need considerable tinkering afore its fit for use how came you to get it broke so squire a little rascal had the impudence to dispute the road with me and would not turn out at my bidding said mr holden in a tone of exasperation which showed that his temper had been considerably soured by the accident wouldnt turn out seems to me from the marks of the wheels you must have been drivin along in the middle of the road i guess you didnt take the trouble to turn out yourself well there was room enough for the boy to turn out one side said holden doggedly you are slightly mistaken stranger said the other who was disgusted at the travelers unreasonableness there wasnt room as anyone can see thats got eyes in his head didnt the youngster turn out at all yes snapped holden not relishing the others free speech then it seems you were the one that would not turn out if you had been a leetle more accommodating this accident couldnt have happened fair plays my motto if a feller meets you halfway its all you have a right to expect i reckon itll cost you a matter of ten dollars to get that ere buggy fixed holden looked savagely at the broken wheel but that didnt mend matters he would have answered the countryman angrily but as he stood in need of assistance this was not good policy what would you advise me to do about it he inquired you will have to leave the buggy where it is just now where did you get it over at the mill village well youd better lead the horse back taint moren a mile or so get another wagon and tell em to send for this well perhaps that is the best way where was you goin over to waverley thats where the boy came from what boy the boy that upset you what is his name asked abner holden scowling his name is herbert mason son of the widder mason that died two or three weeks since poor boy hes left alone in the world wheres he stopping asked holden hardly knowing why he asked the question dr kent took him in after the funeral so i heard but the selectmen of waverley are trying to find him a place somewheres where he can earn his own livin hes a smart capable boy and i guess he can do most a mans work abner holden looked thoughtful some plan had suggested itself to him which appeared to yield him satisfaction for he began to look decidedly more comfortable and he muttered to himself ill be even with him yet see if i dont how far am i from waverley he asked after a slight pause well risin three miles drawled the other if i could get somebody to go back with this horse i dont know but what id walk to waverley are you very busy well i dont know but i could leave off for a short time said the other cautiously works pretty drivin to be sure what do you callate to pay how much would it be worth well theres the walk there and back and then again theres the time you can mount the horse going i guess fifty centsll about pay me mr holden took out his pocketbook and paid the required sum by the way he said as if incidentally who is the chairman of the selectmen in the village of waverley you aint thinkin of takin that boy be you said the other curiously ive had enough to do with him i dont want ever to lay eyes on him again well i dunno as i should if i was you said the countryman rather slyly you havent answered my question yet said holden impatiently oh about the cheerman of the selectmen its captain joseph ross where does he live a leetle this side of the village youll know the house well enough its a large square house painted white with a wellsweep in front without a word of thanks for the information abner holden turned and began to walk toward waverley perhaps his object in making these inquiries has been guessed it happened that he needed a boy and for more reasons than one he thought he should like to have herbert bound to him herbert as he had noticed was a stout boy and he probably could get a good deal of work out of him then again it would be gratifying to him to have our hero in subjection to him he could pay him off then ten times over for his insolence as he chose to term it ill break his proud spirit thought abner holden hell find hes got a master if i get hold of him he dont know me yet but he will some time mr holden resolved to wait on captain ross at once and conclude arrangements with him to take herbert before our hero had returned from the mill village he pictured with a grim smile herberts dismay when he learned who was to be his future master with the help of a handkerchief dipped into a crystal stream at the roadside abner holden succeeded in effacing some of the muddy stains upon his coat and pantaloons and at length got himself into presentable trim for calling upon a selectman at length he came in sight of the house which had been described to him as that of captain ross there was a woman at the wellsweep engaged in drawing water does captain ross live here he inquired yes sir is he at home hes over in the threeacre lot was you wantin to see him i should like to is the field far away no its just behind the house then i guess ill go and find him i want to see him on a little matter of business mr holden crossed a mowingfield and then climbing over a stone wall found himself at the edge of the threeacre lot the captain was superintending one or two hired men and as he had his coat off had probably been assisting them captain ross said abner holden interrogatively thats my name you are chairman of the selectmen i believe yes sir i understand that you have a boy that you want to bind out i reckon you mean herbert mason yes i believe thats the name i heard are you in want of a boy yes i am looking out for one what is your business i keep a store but i should want him to work on land part of the time do you live hereabouts over at cranston if youll come to the house well talk the matter over the boys a good boy and we want to get a good place for him his mother was a widder and hes her only son hes a smart capable lad and good to work ive no doubt hell suit me ill take him on your recommendation we should want him to go to school winters hes a pretty good scholar already his father was a larned man and used to teach him before he died if he had lived i reckon herbert would certainly have gone to college ill agree to send him to school in the winter for the next two years said holden and will give him board and clothes and when hes twentyone a freedom suit and a hundred dollars will that do i dont know but thats reasonable said captain ross slowly the boys a bit highspirited but if you manage him right i guess youll like him ill manage him thought abner holden can i take him with me tomorrow he asked i dont come this way very often well i guess that can be arranged well go over to dr kents after dinner and see if they can get him ready in the meantime said holden afraid that the prize might slip through his fingers suppose we make out the papers i suppose you have full authority in the matter captain ross had no objection and thus poor herbert was unconsciously delivered over to the tender mercies of a man who had very little love for him chapter iv a disagreeable surprise after his collision with the traveler herbert hurried on to the mill intent upon making up for lost time he was satisfied with having successfully maintained his rights and as he had no reason to suppose he should ever again see his unreasonable opponent dismissed him from his thoughts on reaching the mill he found he should have to remain an hour or two before he could have his grain ground he was not sorry for this as it would give him an opportunity to walk around the village i wish he thought i could get a place in one of the stores here theres more going on than there is in waverley and i could go over sundays to see dr kents family on the spur of the moment he resolved to inquire if some of the storekeepers did not require help there was a large drygoods store the largest in the village kept by beckford keyes he entered and inquired for the senior partner mr beckford is not in said the clerk mr keyes is standing at that desk herbert went up to the desk and said inquiringly mr keyes that is my name said that gentleman pleasantly is there anything i can do for you i am in search of a place said our hero and i thought you might have a vacancy here we have none just at present said mr keyes who was favorably impressed by herberts appearance but it is possible we may have in a few weeks where do you live not in the village i suppose no sir said herbert and a shadow passed over his face my mother died three weeks since and i am now stopping at the house of dr kent dr kent ah yes i know the doctor he is an excellent man he is said herbert warmly he has been very kind to me what is your name herbert mason then herbert i will promise to bear you in mind i will note down your name and address and as soon as we have a vacancy i will write to you come into the store whenever you come this way thank you said herbert he left the store feeling quite encouraged even if the chance never amounted to anything the kind words and manner of the storekeeper gave him courage to hope that he would meet with equal kindness from others kind words cost nothing but they have a marvelous power in lightening the burdens of the sorrowful and cheering the desponding herbert left the store feeling that he should consider himself truly fortunate if he could obtain a place in such an establishment but there was a rough experience before him of which at present he guessed nothing after sauntering about the village a little longer and buying a stick of candy for little mary kent the doctors only daughter who was quite attached to herbert our hero got back to the mill in time to receive his bags of meal with which he was soon on his way homeward about the place where he met mr holden he was hailed by a man at work in the field the same who had taken back that gentlemans horse to the stable well boy you had a kind of scrimmage didnt you coming over did you see it asked herbert yes said the other grinning i seed the other feller in the mud puddle he was considerably riled about it it was his own fault i gave him half the road i know it but theres some folks that want more than their share was his buggy broken i dont know but i ought to have stopped to help him but he had been so unreasonable that i didnt feel much like it his wheel got broken i drawed the buggy into the bushes there tis now itll cost him a matter of ten dollars to fix it im sorry for that said herbert but i cant see that i was to blame in the matter if i had turned out as he wanted me to i should have tipped over and as the wagon didnt belong to me i didnt think it right to risk it of course not you wasnt called on to give in to such unreasonableness where did the man go he concluded to walk on to waverley and hired me to take the horse back to the stable he wanted to know who you were did he maybe hes goin to sue you for damages i dont believe hell get much if he does laughed our hero my property is where he cant get hold of it ho ho laughed the other understanding the joke after this conversation herbert continued on his way and after delivering the grain took his way across the fields to his temporary home he entered by the back yard little mary came running out to meet him have oo come back herbert she said where have oo been been to buy mary some candy he said lifting her up and kissing her whose horse is that at the gate asked herbert as the doctors wife entered the room it belongs to captain ross she said he has come on business connected with you connected with me repeated herbert in surprise yes my dear boy i am afraid we must make up our minds to lose you has he found a place for me asked herbert in a tone of disappointment yes i believe he has bound you out to a man in cranston i am sorry said herbert i shall be sorry to have you go herbert but i thought you wanted to go so i do but by waiting a few weeks i could probably get a place in beckford keyes store at the mill village what makes you think so herbert detailed his interview of the morning with the junior partner just at this moment the doctor entered the kitchen have you told him he inquired looking at his wife yes and he says that but for this he might probably have got a chance to go into beckfords store at the mill village i am sorry for this they are good men and he would have been near us while cranston is forty miles away who is the man that wants me asked herbert a mr holden he is in the other room with captain ross it was all arranged before they came he wants you to go with him tomorrow morning so soon said herbert in dismay yes at first he wished you to set off with him this afternoon but i told him decidedly you could not be ready quite impossible said mrs kent some of herberts clothes are in the wash and i cant have them ready till evening you had better come into the other room herbert said the doctor i will introduce you to your new employer herbert followed the doctor into the sittingroom his first glance rested on captain ross whom he knew he went up and shook hands with him next he turned to mr holden and to his inexpressible astonishment recognized his opponent of the morning mr holden herbert introduced the doctor mr holden this is the boy we have been speaking of i have seen mr holden before said herbert coldly yes said mr holden writhing his disagreeable features into an unpleasant smile we have met before dr kent looked from one to the other in surprise as if seeking an explanation our acquaintance doesnt date very far back said mr holden we met this morning between here and the mill village indeed said the doctor you passed each other i suppose well no i cant say we did exactly said mr holden with the same unpleasant smile we tried to but the road being narrow there was a collision and i came off secondbest i hope there was no accident oh nothing to speak of i got tipped out and my clothes as you may observe suffered some as for my young friend here he rode on uninjured you must excuse my not stopping to inquire if i could help you said herbert but my horse was frightened by the collision and i could not easily stop him oh its of no consequence said mr holden in an offhand manner he was determined not to show himself out in his true colors until he had got herbert absolutely under his control but where is your horse mr holden asked captain ross i think you were walking when you came to my house i sent it back to the village by a man i met on the road my buggy being disabled your carriage wasnt much injured i hope oh no not much i dont see exactly how it could happen said captain ross i thought the road from here to the mill village was broad enough at any point for carriages to pass each other i didnt dream said mr holden not noticing this remark that the young man i had engaged was my young acquaintance of the morning herbert looked at him puzzled by his entire change of manner a change so sudden that he suspected its genuineness the more he thought of it the more unwilling he felt to live with mr holden but could it be avoided he resolved to try he accordingly told the doctor and captain ross of the promise that mr keyes had made him it would be a good place said the captain but it aint certain now heres mr holden ready to take you at once if i was in the mill village i could come over and see my friends here now and then besides i think i should like being in a store oh ive got a store too said mr holden and i should expect you to tend there part of the time i dont think i can let you off my young friend he added with a disagreeable smile i think we shall get along very well together herbert did not feel at all sure of this but he saw that it would do no good to remonstrate farther and kept silence soon after mr holden and captain ross rose to go ill call round for my young friend about nine tomorrow morning said abner holden with an ingratiating smile we will endeavor to have him ready said the doctor after they went away herbert wandered about in not the best of spirits he was convinced that he should not be happy with mr holden against whom he had conceived an aversion founded partly upon the occurrences of the morning and partly on the disagreeable impression made upon him by abner holdens personal appearance chapter v the envelope herbert woke up early the next morning and a feeling of sadness came over him as he reflected that it was his last morning in waverley he was going out into the world and as he could not help thinking under very unfavorable auspices new scenes and new experiences usually have a charm for a boy but mr holdens disagreeable face and unpleasant smile rose before him and the prospect seemed far from tempting when he came downstairs he found mrs kent in the kitchen you are up early mrs kent said herbert yes herbert i want you to have a good breakfast before you go it certainly was a nice breakfast tender beefsteak warm biscuit golden butter potatoes fried crisp and brown and excellent coffee might have tempted any appetite herbert in spite of his sadness did full justice to the bountiful meal the family had hardly risen from breakfast when the sound of wheels was heard outside and directly there was a knock at the door its mr holden said the doctor looking from the front window must we part from you so soon herbert said mrs kent affectionately where oo goin herbert asked little mary clinging to his knee herberts going away mary said he stooping and kissing his little friend herbert mustnt go way said the little girl in discontent herbert come back soon and bring candy for mary he said wishing that his words might come true by that time mr holden had entered and was surveying the scene with his disagreeable smile little mary is quite attached to herbert said the doctor i am sorry said mr holden that i have no little girls as herbert seems fond of them herbert doubted if he could become attached to anyone related to mr holden im a bachelor said mr holden though perhaps i ought to be ashamed to say so if i had had the good fortune early in life to encounter a lady like your good wife here it might have been different it isnt too late yet mr holden said the doctor well perhaps not if mrs kent is ever a widow i may try my luck what a disagreeable man thought the doctors wife not propitiated by the compliment herbert she said here are a couple of handkerchiefs i bought in the village yesterday i hope you will find them useful yes no doubt he will said mr holden laughing he will think of you whenever he has a bad cold nobody even smiled at this witty sally and mr holden a little disappointed remarked well times getting on i guess we must be going as we have a long journey before us the whole family accompanied herbert to the road after kissing mary and mrs kent and shaking the doctor cordially by the hand herbert jumped into the wagon just before the horse started the doctor handed our hero a sealed envelope saying you can open it after a while though like most boys of his age herbert had a great horror of making a baby of himself he could hardly help crying as he rode up the street and felt that he had parted from his best friends his eyes filled with tears which he quietly wiped away with the corner of his handkerchief come come dont blubber boy said mr holden coarsely herbert was not weak enough to melt into tears at an unkind word it roused his indignation and he answered shortly when you see me blubbering itll be time enough to speak mr holden it looked a good deal like it at any rate said abner however im glad if im mistaken theres nothing to cry about that i can see no perhaps not said herbert but theres something to be sorry for something to be sorry for is there said abner holden yes well what is it ive left my best friends and i dont know when i shall see them again nor i said mr holden but i think its high time you left them why asked herbert indignantly because they were petting you and making too much of you you wont get such treatment as that from me i dont expect it said our hero thats lucky said abner holden dryly its well that people shouldnt expect what they are not likely to get here a sense of the ludicrous came over herbert as he thought of being mr holdens pet and he laughed heartily not understanding the reason of his sudden mirth that gentleman demanded in a tone of irritation what are you making a fool of yourself about what am i laughing at said herbert not liking the form of the question yes snarled abner the idea of being your pet explained herbert frankly mr holden did not appreciate the joke and said roughly you better shut up if you know whats best for yourself they rode along in silence for a few minutes then abner holden thinking suddenly of the envelope which dr kent had placed in herberts hand at parting and feeling curious as to its contents asked what did the doctor give you just as you were starting it was an envelope i know that but what was there in it i havent looked said our hero he felt a little satisfaction in snubbing mr holden whom he saw he would never like why dont you open it i didnt think of it before i suppose there is some present inside herbert decided to open the envelope out of respect for dr kent on opening it he drew out a fivedollar bill and a few penciled words which were as follows dear herbert i would gladly give you more if i had the means i hope you will use the inclosed money in any way that may be most serviceable to you you must write to me often be a good boy as you always have been let your aims be noble try to do right at all hazards and may god bless your efforts and make you a good and true man such is the prayer of your affectionate friend george kent herbert read these lines with emotion and inwardly resolved that he would try to carry out the recommendations laid down his thoughts were broken in upon by mr holden whose sharp eyes detected the banknote theres money in the letter isnt there yes how much five dollars five dollars hey he said youd better give it to me to keep for you thank you mr holden i can take care of it myself it isnt a good plan for boys to have so large a sum of money in their possession said abner holden who was anxious to secure it himself why not asked herbert because they are likely to spend it improperly dr kent didnt seem to think i was likely to do that no he trusted you too much i hope it wont prove so youd better keep out of the way of temptation you might lose it besides i dont often lose things come boy said mr holden getting impatient dr kent no doubt intended that i should take care of the money for you youd better give it up without further trouble why didnt he give it to you then demanded herbert he supposed you would give it to me mr holdens motive for getting the money into his own hands was twofold first he knew that without money herbert would be more helpless and more in his power secondly as he had agreed to supply herbert with clothing he thought he might appropriate the money towards this purpose and it would be so much of a saving to his own pocket perhaps herbert suspected some such design at any rate he had no intention of gratifying mr holden by giving up the money well are you going to give me the money blustered abner holden taking out his pocketbook ready to receive it no said herbert youll repent this conduct young man said holden scowling i dont think i shall said our hero i dont understand why you are so anxious to get hold of the money it is for your good said abner id rather keep it said herbert abner holden hardly knew what to do the money was by this time safely stowed away in herberts pocket where he could not very well get at it however he had a plan for getting it which he resolved to put into practice when they stopped for dinner chapter vi on the way by the time they had ridden twenty miles both herbert and mr holden felt hungry the fresh air had produced a similar effect upon both they approached a broad low building with a swinging sign and a long piazza in front which it was easy to see was a country tavern do you feel hungry boy inquired abner holden yes sir returned our hero so do i i think i shall get some dinner here you can get some too if you like thank you sir oh theres no occasion to thank me said mr holden dryly i shall pay for my dinner and if you want any you can pay for yours herbert looked surprised as he had entered mr holdens employ he supposed of course that the latter would feel bound to provide for him and it certainly seemed mean that he should be compelled to pay for his own dinner however he was beginning to suspect that his new employer was essentially a mean man how much will it cost asked herbert at length thirtyseven cents was the reply it must be remembered that this was in the day of low prices when gold was at par and board could be obtained at firstclass city hotels for two dollars and a half a day and in country villages at that amount by the week thirtyseven cents herbert hardly liked to break in upon his scanty hoard but the morning air had sharpened his appetite and he felt that he must have something to eat besides he remembered one thing which fortunately mr holden did not know that in addition to the five dollars which dr kent had given him he had the ten dollars sent him by his uncle and not only that but a little loose change which he had earned well are you going to get out asked abner holden its nothing to me whether you take dinner or not yes i guess i will very well said holden who had a reason for being pleased with his decision both went into the tavern there were two or three loungers on a settle who gazed at them curiously one of them at once appeared to recognize abner holden how dy do holden he said whove you got with you a boy ive taken said holden shortly a pretty smartlooking boy whered you pick him up over in waverley hes got some pretty high notions but i guess ill take em out of him in time yes chuckled the other i warrant you will while this conversation was going on herbert had entered the tavern but he could not avoid hearing what was said including mr holdens reply he was not frightened but inwardly determined that he would do his duty and then if mr holden saw fit to impose upon him he would make what resistance he was able i wonder what high notions he means thought our hero if he expects to make a slave of me he will be mistaken thats all sit down there and ill go and order dinner said mr holden entering just then however the landlord came in and greeted abner holden whom he appeared to know i want dinner for two mr robinson he said for two you havent brought your wife along with you holden he said jocosely no i havent come across any such lady yet ive got a boy here who is bound to me and hark you landlord he added in a lower voice that herbert might not hear he will pay you for his dinner out of a fivedollar bill which he has with him you neednt give back the change to him but to me yes i understand said the landlord winking i prefer to keep the money for him he has refused to give it up and this will give me a chance to get hold of it without any fuss all right if he kept it himself hed spend it in some improper way just so ill attend to it now our hero was gifted with pretty sharp ears and he caught enough of this conversation to understand mr holdens plot which he straightway determined should not succeed you shant take me in this time mr holden he thought he opened his pocketbook to see if he had enough small change to pay for his dinner without intrenching upon his bill there proved to be a quarter and two halfdimes amounting of course to thirtyfive cents this would not be quite sufficient i must change the bill somewhere he said to himself looking out of the tavern window he saw the village store nearly opposite he took his cap and ran over there was a clerk leaning with his elbows upon the counter appearing unoccupied it occurred to herbert that he might want some paper and envelopes he inquired the price we sell the paper at a penny a sheet and the envelopes will cost you eight cents a package then you may give me twelve sheets of paper and a package of envelopes said herbert the package was done up for him and in payment he tendered the bill the clerk gave him back four dollars and eighty cents in change he put the money in his pocketbook and the paper and envelopes in his jacketpocket and returned to the tavern well pleased with his success mr holden was in the barroom taking a glass of bitters and had not noticed the absence of our hero dinner was soon ready there was some beefsteak and coffee and a whole apple pie herbert surveyed the viands with satisfaction having a decidedly good appetite he soon found however that hungry as he was he stood a poor chance with abner holden that gentleman being a very rapid eater managed to appropriate twothirds of the beefsteak and threequarters of the pie however the supply being abundant herbert succeeded in making a satisfactory repast and did not grudge the amount which he knew he should have to pay for it before leaving now said abner holden his eyes twinkling at the thought of our heros coming discomfiture well go and settle our bill very well said herbert quietly they entered the public room and advanced to the bar this boy wants to pay for his dinner mr robinson said abner significantly how much will it be asked herbert thirtyseven cents herbert took out of his vest pocket a quarter a dime and two cents and handed them over to say that abner holden looked amazed is not sufficient he looked disgusted and wronged and glared at herbert as if to inquire how he could have the face to outrage his feelings in that way ho ho laughed the landlord who having no interest in the matter was amused at the course affairs had taken herbert suppressed his desire to laugh and looked as if he had no knowledge of mr holdens plans where did you get that money growled abner with a scowl out of my vest pocket said herbert innocently i know that of course but i thought you had only a bill oh i got that changed at the store how dared you go over there without my permission roared abner i didnt think it necessary to ask your permission to go across the street well you know it now dont you go there again without my knowledge very well sir did you buy anything at the store continued mr holden yes sir what was it some paper and envelopes humph muttered abner discontentedly he proceeded to pay his own bill and in a few minutes got into the wagon and drove off rather sulkily herbert saw that mr holden was disturbed by the failure of his little plan and felt amused rather than otherwise but when he reflected that he was going to live with this man and be to a considerable extent under his control he felt inclined to be sad one thing he resolved that he would not submit to tyranny the world was wide and he felt able to earn his own living he would give mr holden a trial and if he treated him with reasonable fairness he would remain with him but he was not going to be any mans slave meanwhile they were getting over the road and a few more hours brought them to their journeys end abner holdens house stood in considerable need of paint it had no great pretensions to architectural beauty being about as handsome for a house as abner holden was for a man there was a dilapidated barn a little to one side and the yard was littered up with a broken wagon a woodpile and various odds and ends giving the whole a very untidy look is this where you live mr holden asked herbert looking about him yes and im glad to get home do you know how to unharness a horse yes sir then jump out and unharness this horse a man will come for it tomorrow herbert did as directed then he took his little trunk from the wagon and went with it to the back door and knocked chapter vii a new home the door was opened by an elderly woman rather stout who acted as abner holdens housekeeper though decidedly homely she had a pleasant look which impressed herbert favorably he had feared she might turn out another edition of mr holden and with two such persons he felt that it would be difficult to get along come right in said mrs bickford for that was her name let me help you with your trunk you can set it down here for the present thank you said herbert you must be tired said the housekeeper no not very said our hero we rode all the way well its tiresome riding at any rate when its such a long distance you came from waverley mr holden tells me yes and that is more than thirty miles away isnt it yes i believe so so youve come to help mr holden she added after a pause yes i suppose so said herbert rather seriously what is your name herbert mason i hope herbert we shall be able to make you comfortable thank you said herbert a little more cheerful as he perceived that he was to have one friend in mr holdens household has mr holden generally kept a boy he asked yes he calculates to keep one most of the time who was the last one his name was frank miles was he here long asked herbert in some curiosity well no said the housekeeper he did not stay very long how long he was here most a month most a month didnt he like it well no he didnt seem to like mr holden much herbert was not much surprised to hear this he would have thought frank miles a singular sort of a boy if he had liked abner holden have any of the boys that have been here liked mr holden he asked i cant say as they have said mrs bickford frankly and somehow they dont seem to stay long why didnt they like him sh said the housekeeper warningly herbert looked round and saw his employer entering the room well boy have you put up the horse he asked abruptly yes sir did you give him some hay yes sir and some grain no i didnt know where it was kept if youll tell me ill do it now no you neednt he isnt to have any hes only a hired horse considering that the hired horse had traveled over thirty miles herbert thought he was entitled to some oats but mr holden was a mean man and decided otherwise where is herbert to sleep mr holden asked the housekeeper up garret theres a small corner bedroom in the second story suggested mrs bickford who knew that the garret was not very desirable i guess he wont be too proud to sleep in the garret said mr holden shall you he continued turning to herbert put me where you please said herbert coldly then it shall be the garret you can take your trunk up now mrs bickford will show you the way its too heavy for you herbert said the housekeeper i will help you oh he can carry it alone said abner holden he isnt a baby id rather help him said the housekeeper taking one handle of the trunk you go first herbert youre young and spry and can go faster than i on the second landing herbert saw the little bedroom in which the housekeeper wanted to put him it was plainly furnished but it was light and cheerful and he was sorry he was not to have it you could have had that bedroom just as well as not said mrs bickford its never used but mr holdens rather contrary and as hard to turn as a a mule suggested herbert laughing its pretty much so said the housekeeper joining in the laugh they went up a narrow staircase and emerged into a dark garret running the whole length of the house without a partition the beams and rafters were visible for the sloping sides were not plastered herbert felt that he might as well have been in the barn except that there was a small cot bedstead in the center of the floor it isnt very pleasant said the housekeeper no said herbert i dont think it is i declare its too bad you should have to sleep here mr holden isnt very considerate i guess i can stand it said our hero though i should rather be downstairs ill bring up the trap and set it before you go to bed said mrs bickford the trap repeated herbert in surprise yes theres rats about and i suppose youd rather have a trap than a cat yes the cat would be about as bad as the rats at this moment abner holdens voice was heard at the bottom of the stairs and mrs bickford hurried down followed by our hero i thought you were going to stay up there all day said mr holden what were you about up there that is my business said mrs bickford shortly the housekeeper was independent in her feelings and knowing that she could readily obtain another situation did not choose to be browbeaten by mr holden he was quite aware of her value and the difficulty he would experience in supplying her place and he put some constraint over himself in the effort not to be rude to her with herbert however it was different he was bound to him and therefore in his power abner holden exulted in this knowledge and with the instinct of a petty tyrant determined to let herbert realize his dependence you may go out and saw some wood he said youll find the saw in the woodshed what wood shall i saw the wood in the woodpile stupid very well sir said our hero quietly herbert thought mr holden was losing no time in setting him to work however he had resolved to do his duty unpleasant as it might be as long as abner holden only exacted what was reasonable and herbert was aware that he had a right to require him to go to work at once mrs bickford however said a word in his favor ive got wood enough to last till tomorrow mr holden she said well what of it its likely the boy is tired whats he done to make him tired i should like to know ridden thirty miles and eaten a good dinner which i paid for myself said herbert what if you did said abner holden turning to him i suppose youll eat supper at my expense and youd better do something first to earn it that i am willing to do then go out to the woodpile without any more palavering mr holden said the housekeeper seriously after herbert had gone out if you want to keep that boy i think you had better be careful how you treat him why do you say that demanded abner eying her sharply has he been saying anything to you about me no then why did you say that because i can see what kind of a boy he is well what kind of a boy is he asked abner with a sneer he is highspirited and will work faithfully if hes treated well but he wont allow himself to be imposed upon how do you know that i can read it in his face i have had some experience with boys and you may depend upon it that i am not mistaken he had better do his duty blustered abner if he knows whats best for himself he will do his duty said the housekeeper firmly but there is a duty which you owe to him as well as he to you dont i always do my duty by boys mrs bickford no mr holden i dont think you do you know very well you can never get a boy to stay with you this boy is bound to me mrs bickford legally bound that may be but if you dont treat him as he ought to be treated he will run away take my word for it if he does hell be brought back take my word for that mrs bickford i shall treat him as i think he deserves but as to petting and pampering the young rascal i shall do nothing of the kind i dont think you will said the housekeeper however ive warned you you seem to take a good deal of interest in the boy said abner sneeringly yes i do after half an hours acquaintance ive known him long enough to see that hes better than the common run of boys and i hope that hell stay theres no doubt about that said abner holden significantly hell have to stay whether he wants to or not chapter viii the ghost in the attic after working two hours at the woodpile herbert was called in to tea there was no great variety abner holden not being a bountiful provider but the bread was sweet and good and the gingerbread fresh herberts two hours of labor had given him a hearty appetite and he made a good meal mrs bickford looked on approvingly she was glad to see that our hero enjoyed his supper there was tea on the table and after pouring out a cup for mr holden the housekeeper was about to pour out one for herbert he dont want any tea said abner noticing the action keep the cup for yourself mrs bickford what do you mean mr holden asked the housekeeper in surprise tea isnt good for a growing boy a glass of cold water will be best for him i dont agree with you mr holden said the housekeeper decidedly herbert has been hard at work and needs his tea as much as you or i do therefore without waiting for his permission she handed the cup to herbert who proceeded to taste it abner holden frowned but neither herbert nor the housekeeper took much notice of it the latter was somewhat surprised at this new freak on the part of abner as he had never tried to deprive any of herberts predecessors of tea or coffee but the fact was mr holden disliked herbert and was disposed to act the petty tyrant over him he had neither forgotten nor forgiven the boys spirited defiance when they first met nor his refusal to surrender into his hands the five dollars which the doctor had given him feeling tired by eight oclock herbert went up to his garret room and undressed himself an instinct of caution led him to take out the money in his portemonnaie and put it in his trunk which he then locked and put the key under the sheet so that no one could get hold of it without awakening him this precaution proved to be well taken herbert lay down upon the bed but did not immediately go to sleep he could not help thinking of his new home and the new circumstances in which he was placed he did not feel very well contented and felt convinced from what he had already seen of mr holden that he should never like him then thoughts of his mother and of her constant and tender love and the kind face he would never more see on earth swept over him and almost unmanned him to have had her still alive he would have been content to live on dry bread and water he thought too of the doctors family and their kindness how different it would have been if he might have continued to find a home with them but when he was tempted to repine the thought of his mothers christian instructions came to him and he was comforted by the reflection that whatever happened to him was with the knowledge of his father in heaven who would not try him above his strength try and trust that was almost the last advice his mother had given him as the surest way of winning the best success yes he thought i will try and trust and leave the rest with god meanwhile mr holden had not been able to keep out of his head the five dollars which he knew herbert possessed he was a mean man and wished to appropriate it to his own use besides this he was a stubborn man and our heros resistance only made him the more determined to triumph over his opposition by fair means or foul it struck him that it would be a good idea to take advantage of our heros slumber and take the money quietly from his pocketbook while he was unconscious accordingly about eleven oclock he went softly up the attic stairs with a candle in his hand and with noiseless steps approached the bed herberts regular breathing assured him that he was asleep abner holden took up his pants and felt for his pocketbook he found it and drew it out with exultation aha he thought ive got it but this brief exultation was succeeded by quick disappointment the pocketbook proved to be quite empty curse it muttered abner what has the boy done with his money it was at this moment that herbert his eyes possibly affected by the light awoke and he discovered his employer examining his pocketbook his first feeling was indignation but the sight of abner holdens disappointed face amused him and he determined not to reveal his wakefulness but to watch him quietly perhaps hes got two pocketbooks thought abner but in this he was mistaken next he went to herberts trunk and tried it but found it locked i wonder where he keeps the key was his next thought he searched herberts pockets but the search was in vain plague take the young rascal he muttered loud enough for herbert to hear herbert turned in bed and abner holden fearing that he might wake up and being on the whole rather ashamed of his errand and unwilling to be caught in it went downstairs well he didnt make much thought our hero its lucky i thought to put the money in my trunk if he only knew i had fifteen dollars instead of five he would be all the more anxious to get hold of it how did you sleep last night herbert inquired the housekeeper at breakfast very well thank you mrs bickford he was resolved not to drop a hint of what had happened being curious to see if mr holden would make any further attempts to obtain his money as his employer might possibly find a key that would unlock the trunk he thought it prudent during the day to carry the money about with him he hardly knew whether to expect a visit from abner the next night but formed a little plan for frightening him if such a visit should take place it so happened that he had in his trunk a fish horn which had been given him by someone in waverley this he took out of the trunk before retiring and hid it under his pillow it was about nine oclock when he went to bed but by considerable effort he succeeded in keeping awake for an hour or two about eleven oclock abner holden before going to bed himself decided to make one more attempt to obtain possession of herberts money he reflected that possibly our hero had only put away his money by chance on the previous evening and might have neglected to do so on the present occasion he desired to get possession of it before any part of it was spent as judging from what he knew of boys it would not remain long unexpended once more therefore he took his candle and removing his thicksoled shoes which might betray him by their sound crept softly up the steep and narrow staircase but herbert heard him and moreover was warned of his visit by the light of the candle which he carried he closed his eyes and awaited his coming in silent expectation abner holden looked towards the bed herberts eyes were closed and his breathing was deep and regular hes sound asleep thought abner with satisfaction he set down the candle on a chair beside the bed and began to examine our heros pocketbook once more but it proved to be empty as before in the pocketbook however he found a key the key as he supposed to herberts trunk it was not however being only a key which herbert had picked up one day in the street and kept he had put it in his pocket with a view to mislead his employer that gentleman uttered a low exclamation of satisfaction when his fingers closed upon the key never doubting for a moment that it would open the trunk leaving the candle in its place he rose from his recumbent position threw the pants on the bed and went round on the other side to try the key he got down on his knees before the trunk and had inserted the key in the lock or rather had made an ineffectual attempt to do so when suddenly the candle was extinguished and a horrible blast on the fish horn resounded through the garret now abner holden was not a very courageous man in fact he was inclined to superstition he knew that he was engaged in a dishonorable attempt to rob a boy who was placed in his charge and there is an old proverb that says conscience makes cowards of us all it must be admitted that it was rather calculated to affect the nerves to find ones self suddenly in the dark and at the same time to hear such a fearful noise proceeding from an unknown quarter abner holden jumped to his feet in dire dismay and without stopping to reflect on the probable cause of this startling interruption struck a bee line for the staircase and descended quicker probably than he had ever done before narrowly escaping tumbling the entire distance in his headlong haste herbert had to stuff the bedclothes into his mouth to keep from bursting into a shout of laughter which would have revealed his agency in producing the mysterious noise i thought i heard a frightful noise last night soon after i went to bed said mrs bickford at the breakfast table didnt you hear anything mr holden no said abner i heard nothing you were probably dreaming perhaps i was didnt you hear anything herbert i sleep pretty sound said herbert quietly abner holden watched him as he said this and was evidently more perplexed than ever but that was the last visit he paid to the garret at night chapter ix exposing a fraud it would be hard to tell what abner holdens precise occupation was he had thirty or forty acres of land but only cultivated enough to produce supplies of vegetables for his own table and grain for his horses he kept four cows and he had at this time three horses he had the yankee propensity for swapping and from time to time traded horses generally managing to get the best of the bargain for he was tolerably sharp and not much troubled by conscientious scruples about misstating the merits of his horses but about two months before herbert came into his employ he had himself been overreached and found himself the possessor of a horse of excellent outward appearance but blind of one eye and with a very vicious temper he accepted the situation with a bad grace and determined as soon as possible to trade the horse to another party one day about a fortnight after herberts arrival a gentlemanlylooking stranger knocked at abner holdens door the call was answered by the housekeeper is mr holden at home he inquired yes sir was the reply i should like to see him abner holden soon made his appearance mr holden said the stranger i am in search of a good family horse i am told that you have some animals for sale and called on you thinking i might get suited through you youve come to the right place said abner glibly ive got just the animal that will suit you i should like to see it hes in the pasture now if you dont object to walking a short distance i will show him to you i feel sure he will suit you very well i will go with you this way then the two walked down a green lane at the back of the house to the entrance of the pasture where the three horses at present comprising abner holdens entire stock were grazing leisurely now it happened that of the three the blind and vicious horse was much the best looking he held his head erect had a graceful form and was likely to attract favorable notice at first sight abner holden paused at a little distance and pointed him out what do you think of that horse mr richmond he said a very goodlooking animal said the stranger with an approving glance but i must explain that i want such an animal as my wife can drive it is absolutely necessary that he should be goodtempered and gentle if with this he is handsome and of good speed all the better now you know what i am in search of can you recommend this horse of yours yes said abner confidently he will just suit you i did calculate to keep him for my own use but im rather short of money and i shall have to let him go you say he is gentle oh yes as gentle as need be could a woman drive him oh no trouble about that said abner and he has no serious defect no well that seems satisfactory i like his appearance he would look well in harness what is your price two hundred and fifty dollars cash down said abner thats too cheap hes worth a cool hundred more but i got him cheap and can afford to sell him cheap the horse had cost mr holden just a hundred and ten dollars and at this price he considered himself decidedly taken in but this he did not particularly care to mention two hundred and fifty dollars mused the stranger it is a little more than i intended to pay still if the animal is what you describe i dont know that i shall object on that score you had better take him said abner itll be the best bargain you ever made ill warrant youll pay cash down i suppose of course then shall we say its a bargain not quite yet ill take till the afternoon to think about it better decide now the fact is mr richmond i ought not to let the horse go at that figure and i may change my mind i think i shall take your horse but i have agreed to look at another and must see that first whose it belongs to a man named nichols sam nichols i believe so i wouldnt advise you to have anything to do with him why not hes a regular sharper you cant depend on anything he says thank you for the caution i will be on my guard but i promised to take a look at his horse before deciding if i dont come to terms with him and i dont think i shall i will come round some time this afternoon and make a bargain with you mr holden thought it was hardly politic to urge him farther with a renewed caution as to dealing with sam nichols he let him go well thought abner after he was gone it will be a pretty good thing if i get rid of spitfire he had named him thus for two hundred and fifty dollars hes a badtempered brute and blind into the bargain but im not bound to tell mr richmond that and so spoil my trade ive put a flea in his ear about nichols and i guess he will be back again the prospect of making a good bargain caused abner to be unusually pleasant and goodhumored so much so that mrs bickford regarded him with surprise he voluntarily asked her if she did not wish something at the store volunteering to bring home whatever was needed whats come over the man thought the housekeeper its too good to last she was quite correct there mr holden was naturally crabbed and fair weather with him was the exception rather than the rule on the present occasion it did not last many hours abner holden went to the store but made other calls on the way so that he was three hours absent and did not return till twelve oclock the usual dinner hour in his household meanwhile mr richmond his caller of the morning had been to see sam nichols and inspected the horse he had for sale he did not altogether like its appearance and moreover he was prejudiced against him by what he had heard from abner holden and came away without effecting a purchase i dont think i can do better he reflected than to take that horse of holdens let me see it is only halfpast ten i shall have time to go up there this morning i suppose i might as well settle matters at once accordingly eleven oclock found him again in abner holdens yard herbert was out in the yard engaged in splitting wood is mr holden at home inquired the stranger pausing no sir will he be at home soon yes sir i think so he only went out to the store he ought to be home now then i think i will wait i was here once before this morning i was talking with him about buying one of his horses if you can spare the time i would like to have you go with me to the pasture and i will take another look at the one i saw this morning certainly sir said herbert driving the ax into the block upon which he had been splitting prepared to accompany mr richmond to the pasture they reached the bars dividing the pasture from the next field spitfire was cropping the grass just on the other side there said the stranger pointing him out that is the horse i was looking at that one repeated herbert in a tone of surprise yes he is a finelooking animal yees said herbert hesitatingly however i dont so much care about that as for his being gentle i want him for a family horse such as my wife may drive without fear while i am away did mr holden say hes gentle asked herbert yes he recommended him highly for that and told me he had no serious defect are you sure this is the horse asked herbert certainly i am not likely to be mistaken in it i suppose it is all as he says herbert was in a perplexing position he knew that if he told the truth he should incur abner holdens anger but his conscience revolted at suffering the stranger to be taken in and thus perhaps exposing his wife to serious danger i am afraid i cannot confirm what mr holden says he answered reluctantly the horse is very illtempered and is blind of one eye is it possible then i have had a narrow escape you have done me a good service my boy in telling me the truth for i am myself unused to horses and should have taken the animal on your employers recommendation accept this acknowledgment of my indebtedness he would have placed a fivedollar bill in herberts hand but our hero firmly refused to receive it i have only done my duty sir i cannot accept money for doing that thank you all the same perhaps you are right my lad if i ever have a chance to serve you dont hesitate to let me know it therell be a storm if mr holden hears of this thought herbert but i could not do otherwise chapter x the clouds gather at twelve oclock abner holden returned home still in good humor as he did not anticipate another call from his expected customer until the afternoon he made no inquiries perhaps he wont hear about it thought herbert and as he did not wish to have any trouble with mr holden he hoped it might prove so abner was so elated at the thought of his good bargain in prospect that he could not keep it to himself ive about sold spitfire mrs bickford he said to the housekeeper sold spitfire who wants to buy him a man that called here this morning what do you think he wants him for to break his neck suggested the housekeeper he wants him for a good family horse for his wife to drive and abner holden burst into a laugh perhaps hes anxious to become a widower said mrs bickford no the fact is he thinks the horse is gentle you told him so i suppose of course i did knowing it to be false shut up mrs bickford you know all is fair in trade no i dont mr holden to my mind a lies just as much a lie in trade as in anything else i suppose the man trusted to your recommendation suppose he did i got cheated on the horse and ive got to get rid of it somehow as it is i shall make a handsome profit well mr holden all ive got to say is i am glad i havent got as tough a conscience as you have you dont know anything about business mrs bickford well manage things your own way i aint responsible but i pity the poor man if he buys spitfire so do i chuckled abner thats where you and i agree mrs bickford herbert listened in silence he was disgusted with the utter disregard of fair dealing exhibited by abner holden though he was not surprised at it he felt glad that he had been the means of saving mr richmond from being overreached though he know very well that mr holdens rage would be furious when he learned what had interfered with the trade he did not feel under any obligations to reveal his own agency in the matter unless direct inquiry was made of him in that case he would manfully stand by his acts im expecting the man this afternoon mrs bickford said mr holden and shall stay around home to see him when he comes call me at once and mind not a word about spitfire just as you say i wash my hands of the whole affair washing your hands wont do you any harm said abner with a laugh at what he supposed to be a witticism mrs bickford took no notice of this remark it was not quite easy to say why she remained in charge of mr holdens household for certainly she had no respect for her employer however he did not meddle with her or if he did he got the worst of it and it was perhaps the independence that she enjoyed which led her to remain in the house knowing abners character she was not particularly shocked at this last evidence of it but went about her work as usual with scarcely a thought of what had passed abner holden sat at the window and looked up the road awaiting anxiously the appearance of the customer i hope hell bring the money with him he thought id like to have matters all arranged today before he smells a rat if i get the money once in my hands he may scold all he pleases about the horse it wont disturb my rest but the old clock in the corner kept ticking minute after minute passed and still the stranger did not appear he cant have struck a bargain with sam nichols muttered abner apprehensively if he has itll be sort of a swindle on me maybe nichols has been telling him lies about me abner waxed so angry over this supposition that although it was merely conjecture he already began to consider in what way he could come up with sam nichols that money would come very handy thought abner theres a horse worth two of spitfire i can get for a hundred and fifty and that would leave me a hundred i wish he would come he looked out of the window and not content with that went out of the front door and shading his eyes with his hands looked up the road but he could see nothing of mr richmond abner began to fear that he had lost his bargain i guess ill put on my hat and go round to the tavern he said to mrs bickford if the gentleman i spoke of should call while i am away just send the boy around after me as quick as possible very well abner holden walked hurriedly to the tavern determined to bring about a bargain which would be so desirable for him if it were a possible thing he must and would get rid of spitfire however many falsehoods he might have to tell what was truth in comparison to two hundred and fifty dollars suppose spitfire should run away with the strangers wife and break her limbs or even her neck it was everybodys duty to look out for himself in this world thus reasoned abner holden there is no particular need of my commenting upon the fallacy of this reasoning since it is not likely that any of my young readers will sufficiently admire his character to be in any danger of being led into imitation of it at the end of a very few minutes abner stood on the piazza of the tavern a little out of breath with rapid walking is mr richmond still here he inquired of the landlord anxiously yes but he means to leave in five minutes where is he in his room i want to see him on particular business i wish you would send up and ask him to come down very well william said the landlord summoning his son go up and tell mr richmond that mr holden wishes to see him you dont know of his having bought a horse of sam nichols do you asked abner nervously of the landlord no i am sure he has not abner felt somewhat relieved by this as long as he was still unprovided with a horse there was still a chance of spitfire he resolved if necessary to abate something from the rather high price he had demanded in the morning mr richmond followed william downstairs you wish to see me he asked glancing toward mr holden yes about the horse you were looking at this morning i have concluded not to take him said the other coldly you didnt buy of sam nichols did you no his horse did not suit me you havent any other in your eye have you asked mr holden no then hadnt you better look at mine again he said persuasively it would be of no use if the price is any objection said abner insinuatingly i dont know but i might say a leetle less though the animals wuth moren i ask for it it isnt the price that stands in the way mr holden what is it then sam nichols haint been slandering me i hope if he has ill be even with him spare your anger against sam nichols he said nothing against you though i believe you warned me against him yes i did i felt it my duty to caution you so you might not be overreached by him you prefer to overreach me yourself said the other quietly abner started and changed color what do you mean he said who told you i wanted to overreach you why this is the way the matter stands i asked you for a good family horse such as my wife might drive with safety didnt you understand me so of course and you tried to sell me an illtempered brute blind of one eye for an extortionate price can you deny it somebodys been telling you a pack of lies said abner hoarsely i dont think they are lies i have every reason to think they are true by the way what is the animals name spitfire said abner rather reluctantly a good name for a family horse said the stranger sarcastically where did you learn all this demanded abner whos been slandering the horse i got my information at your place from one who ought to know a light dawned upon abner holdens mind herbert told him muttered abner to himself that cursed boy has spoiled my bargain and he shall smart for it in a furious rage he retraced his steps homeward breathing threats of vengeance dire against our hero chapter xi a crisis abner holdens disappointment was excessive at the sudden falling through of his horse trade and his feeling of anger against herbert for his agency in the matter was in proportion to his disappointment his chief thought as he hurried home from the tavern was that he would make the boy smart for his interference ill give him a good flogging muttered abner to himself and he felt that this would be some slight compensation for the injury and slight loss which herbert had caused him to sustain ill teach him to spoil my bargains he said while his face wore an expression decidedly ugly i reckon he wont do it a second time it was in this frame of mind that he reached home herbert had just entered the kitchen with an armful of wood for the housekeeper and having thrown down his burden was about to go back when on turning he confronted the stormy and wrathful face of his employer hes found out herbert concluded at once and he braced his nerves for the storm which he knew must come well young man ive an account to settle with you said abner abruptly herbert did not reply but waited for mr holden to state the matter but in abners present angry condition he chose to construe his silence into cause of offense why dont you speak he said what do you mean by looking me impudently in the face i have no intention of being impudent said herbert i think you are mistaken mr holden do you dare to tell me i am mistaken roared holden lashing himself into a rage i dont mean to do or say anything that is not perfectly respectful said herbert manfully looking steadily in his employers face why did you tell a pack of lies about my horse this morning and so make me lose my trade i didnt tell a pack of lies said herbert didnt you tell the man who came here that he was an illtempered brute and blind of one eye abner holden glared upon the boy as if he wanted to spring upon him and give him a thrashing on the spot i told him that spitfire was not suitable for a family horse what did you tell him that for because it was true supposing it was true didnt you know that you were spoiling my trade i am sorry for that mr holden but if he had bought the horse supposing it to be gentle it might have broken his wifes neck what business was that of yours that was his lookout i didnt look upon it in that way i thought he ought to buy the horse with his eyes open you did did you roared abner then i advise you to open your own eyes for youre going to get one of the worst lickings you ever had abner holdens anger now reached an ungovernable pitch looking about him for a weapon he espied the broom resting against the wall he seized it and with a scream of rage made for herbert shaking off the grasp of the housekeeper who tried to stay him herbert perceiving the peril in which he stood ran round the table which stood with leaves open in the middle of the floor abner pursued him with headlong haste lord preserve us the man is mad ejaculated the housekeeper trying to get out of the way but in this she was not successful the kitchen was small and before she could guard against a collision abner had stumbled over mrs bickford and both came down together she uttered a succession of piercing shrieks and with a view of relieving herbert pretended that her life was in danger grasping abner by the hair and holding him fast herbert saw that this was the favorable moment for escape and seizing his hat dashed out of the house he ran across the fields as fast as his limbs could carry him expecting that he would be pursued before we follow him we will describe the scene that took place after his flight let go my hair mrs bickford exclaimed abner tugging vainly to break from the housekeepers grasp i dare not she said im afraid youll murder me you are making a fool of yourself retorted abner what should i murder you for but i will if you dont let go hello whos talking of murder demanded a rough voice the speaker was a neighbor who chanced to be passing and was led to enter by the uproar which was plainly audible outside save me exclaimed mrs bickford hes threatened to murder me stop your nonsense you old fool retorted abner vexed at the equivocal position in which he was placed whats all this row about mr holden you ought to be ashamed of yourself for attacking a defenseless woman i didnt intend to said abner sullenly she got in my way and i stumbled over her and then she seized me by the hair what were you going to do with that broom demanded the other suspiciously what was i going to do i was going to thrash that rascally boy of mine and mrs bickford knew it perfectly well what has he done he hes spoiled a trade of mine by his lying and i was going to flog him for it when mrs bickford got in my way well said the visitor shrugging his shoulders i dont want to interfere in your affairs i suppose that youve a right to flog the boy but it strikes me that a broom handle is rather an ugly weapon it isnt half heavy enough said abner savagely but where is the boy did you see him given legbail i reckon and i dont wonder at it run away ejaculated abner disappointed did you see where he went no i didnt and if i had im not sure that i would tell you abner would like to have thrashed the man who showed so little sympathy with his anger but he felt that it would hardly be prudent he went to the door and looked out but there was no trace of herbert to be discovered hell get it when he does come back he said to himself the idea that herbert might not come back at all never once occurred to him he resolved that the flogging should lose nothing by being deferred we must now return to herbert whom we left running across the fields his departure had been so sudden that his prominent idea was to get out of the way of his employers violence he was at first under the impression that he was pursued but when after running perhaps a quarter of a mile he ventured to look around he saw to his great relief that there was no one on his track being out of breath he stopped and throwing himself down on the grass in the shadow of a stone wall began to consider his plans for the future everything was in doubt except one point he felt that he had broken finally the tie that bound him to mr holden he would not return to him he had experienced enough of abners ugly and unreasonable temper to feel that there could be no harmony between them and as to submitting to personal violence from such a man as that his blood boiled at the thought he knew that he should resist with all the strength he possessed and what the result might be he did not dare to think what lay before him in the future he could not conjecture but whatever it might be he felt that it was better than to remain an inmate of abner holdens household and in his power but where should he go that was a question not easily answered after his experience of his uncles indifference to him he did not wish to appeal to him for aid yet he felt that he should like to go to new york and try his fortune there thousands of people lived there and earned enough to support them comfortably why not he it was a thousand miles off and he might be some time in getting there he might have to stop and work on the way but sooner or later he resolved that he would find his way to the great metropolis but there was one difficulty which presented itself at the outset this difficulty related to his clothing he had on a pair of overalls and a ragged vest which abner had provided for him intending that he should save the good suit he brought with him for sundays his present suit which had been worn by half a dozen of his predecessors herbert decidedly objected to wearing as in addition to being faded and worn it was by no means a good fit he must get his other suit but this was in mr holdens attic and it would hardly be prudent to venture back for it as abner was on the lookout for him and there would be a collision and perhaps he might be forcibly detained fortunately his money he had about him this amounted as the reader already knows to nearly fifteen dollars and would no doubt be of essential service to him in the project which he had undertaken as to the clothes he must think of a way of securing them before setting out on his journey to new york chapter xii ralph the ranger one thing was certain there was no chance of obtaining the clothes at present probably his best course would be to wait till night and then come back to the house on the chance of gaining mrs bickfords attention in the meantime probably the best thing to be done was to conceal himself temporarily in a belt of woods lying about a mile back of abner holdens house as soon as his breath was recovered herbert got up and headed for these woods a few minutes found him in the midst of them he made his way with some difficulty through the underbrush parting the thick stems with his hands until he reached a comparatively open space of perhaps an acre in extent in the midst of this space a rude hut was visible constructed of logs and covered with the branches of trees in front of it sitting on the stump of a tree which perhaps had been spared for that purpose sat a tall man with very brown complexion clad in a rough hunting suit his form though spare was tough and sinewy and the muscles of his bare arms seemed like whipcords a short black pipe was in his mouth the only covering of his head was the rough grizzled hair which looked as if for months it had never felt the touch of a comb or brush herbert though he had never before seen this singular being recognized him at once as ralph the ranger as he was properly called in the village for years he had lived a hermitlike existence in the forest supporting himself mainly by his rifle this was not difficult for his wants were few and simple what cause led him to shun the habitations of his kind and make his dwelling in the woods no one knew and perhaps no one ever would know for of himself he was silent and it was not easy to draw him out he looked up as he heard herberts step and said abruptly well boy what do you want his manner was rough but our hero was not afraid he answered frankly i am hiding hiding who from from abner holden humph why should you hide from him what has he to do with you i am bound to him and he is angry with me because he thinks i interfered in a trade of his he wanted to beat me so i ran away good said ralph approvingly tell me about it herbert drew near and told his story ralph listened attentively boy said he i think you are honest there are not many that can be said of as for abner holden i know him hes a mean skinflint pah and he spit contemptuously youd better not go back to him i dont mean to said herbert promptly what are your plans have you formed any i want to go to new york to new york repeated ralph thoughtfully you wish to get into the crowd while i seek to avoid it but it is natural to youth at your age it was so with me i hope my boy the time will not come when you like me will wish to shun the sight of men herbert listened in sympathy not unmingled with surprise to the speech of this man which was quite superior to what might have been expected from one of his appearance when do you wish to start asked ralph after a pause first i want to get my clothes where are they in my room at mr holdens house how do you expect to get them mrs bickford the housekeeper is a friend of mine i thought i might go there tonight and attract her attention without rousing mr holden she would get them for me good i will go with you will you asked herbert gladly he had felt a little doubt as to the result of his expedition as if mr holden should be awake and start in pursuit he would stand a good chance of being captured which above all things he most dreaded but with so able an auxiliary as ralph he knew he could bid easy defiance to abner however much the latter might desire to molest him yes i will stand by you and you shall share my cabin with me as long as you like you are not afraid of me no said herbert quickly ralph looked kindly at him some of the children run from me he said it is not strange perhaps for i look savage i suppose but you do well to trust me i will be your friend and that is something i have not said to any living being for years i like your face it is brave and true thank you for your favorable opinion mr here herbert paused in uncertainty for he had never heard ralphs surname call me ralph i have done with the title of civilization call me ralph that will suit me best thank you for your kindness then ralph what is your name herbert herbert mason then herbert i think you must be hungry have you eaten your dinner no said herbert then you shall share mine my food is of the plainest but such as it is you are welcome come in herbert entered the cabin the only table was a plank supported at each end by a barrel from a box in the corner ralph drew out some cornbread and some cold meat he took a tin measure and going out of the cabin filled it with water from a brook near by this he placed on the rude table all is ready he said take and eat if my food is not too rude herbert did eat and with appetite he was a growing boy whose appetite seldom failed him and he had been working hard since breakfast which he had taken at six while it was now one oclock no wonder he was hungry ralph looked on with approval you are the first that has shared my meal for many a long day he said day after day and year after year i have broken my fast alone but it seems pleasant after all he said musingly men are treacherous and deceitful but you he said resting his glance on the frank ingenuous face of his youthful guest you must be honest and true or i am greatly deceived i hope you will find me so said herbert interested more and more in the roughlooking recluse about whose life he suspected there must be some sad secret of which the world knew nothing after dispatching the meal provided by his hospitable entertainer herbert sat down on the grass just outside the cabin and watched lazily the smoke which issued from ralphs pipe as it rose in many a fantastic curl how long have you lived here ralph asked our hero at length ten years said the recluse removing his pipe from his lips it is a long time yes boy a long time in the life of one as young as you but to me it seems but yesterday that i built this cabin and established myself here are you not often lonely lonely yes but not more so than i should be in the haunts of men i have company too there are the squirrels that leap from bough to bough of the tall trees then there are the birds that wake me with their singing they are company for me they are better company than men they at least will not deceive me he paused and bent his eyes upon the ground he was thinking not of the boy beside him but of some time in the past and the recollection apparently was not pleasant the afternoon wore away at length and the shadows deepened in the woods herbert wandered about and succeeded in gathering some nuts which he carried to ralphs cabin when eight oclock came the ranger said you had better lie down and rest my boy i will wake you up at twelve and we will go together to holdens place and see if we can get your clothes to this proposal herbert willingly assented as he began to feel tired he slept he knew not how long when he was gently shaken by ralph where am i he asked rubbing his eyes the sight of the ranger bending over him soon brought back the recollection of his position and he sprang up promptly ralph showed him an easier way out of the woods than that by which he had entered and less embarrassed by the growth of underbrush in half an hour they were standing by abner holdens house it was perfectly dark the inmates probably being fast asleep i know where the housekeeper sleeps said herbert ill throw up a pebble at her window and perhaps it will wake her up he did as proposed mrs bickford who was a light sleeper heard and went to the window whos there she asked it is i mrs bickford said herbert what herbert shall i let you in no i dont want to come in all i want is my clothes they are up in my trunk ill go up and get them for you she went upstairs and quickly returned with the clothes which she let down from the window are you hungry herbert she asked let me bring you something to eat no thank you mrs bickford i am stopping with ralph the ranger he has kindly given me all the food i want what are you going to do are you going to stop with him no i am going east in a day or two i am going to new york i will write to you from there i am sorry to have you go herbert i wish things could have been pleasanter so that you might have stayed but i think i hear mr holden stirring goodby and may god be with you she closed the window hastily and herbert not wishing to get into a collision with abner holden who he suspected might have heard something withdrew swiftly ralph who was standing near by joined him and both together went back to the woods chapter xiii a moment of peril abner holden did not suspect that herbert actually intended to leave him permanently but when evening came and he did not return he became apprehensive that such was the case now for more than one reason he objected to our heros leaving first because he was a strong capable boy and his services were worth considerable and secondly because he disliked herbert and it was a satisfaction to tyrannize over him as his position enabled him to do there are some men in whom the instinct of petty tyranny exists to such an extent that they cannot feel happy without someone to exercise their authority over such a man was abner holden he was a bully and a tyrant by nature and decidedly objected to losing one so completely in his power as herbert was when night came and herbert did not return he decided to search for him and bring him back if found the very next day he did not impart his purpose to mrs bickford for he was at no loss to discover that the sympathies of the kindhearted housekeeper were not with him but with the boy whom he wished to abuse when breakfast was over therefore he merely said mrs bickford i am going out for a short time if herbert should return while i am absent you may tell him to finish hoeing those potatoes in the garden do you think he will come back mr holden asked the housekeeper yes he will soon be tired of wandering about he will learn to prize a good home after he has slept out of doors one night mrs bickford did not reply but she did not feel quite so much confidence as her employer appeared to do in the excellence of the home which herbert had enjoyed under abner holdens roof its just as well he doesnt suspect herberts plan she thought and without further words began to clear away the breakfast dishes abner was not long in deciding that herbert was hidden in the woods that indeed seemed the most natural place of refuge for one placed in his circumstances he determined therefore to seek there first we must now return to herbert if you will wait till nightfall said ralph you will be more safe from pursuit and i will accompany you for a few miles this seemed plausible and our hero consented ralph went off on a hunting expedition but herbert remained behind fearing that he might tear or stain his clothes of which it was necessary now to be careful how to pass the time was the question to tell the truth the hunters cabin contained little that would help him there were no books visible for ralph seemed to have discarded everything that would remind him of that civilization which he had forsaken in disgust herbert went outside and watched the squirrels that occasionally made their appearance flitting from branch to branch of the tall trees after a while his attention was drawn to a bird which flew with something in its beak nearly to the top of a tall tree not far off i shouldnt wonder thought herbert interested if shes got a nest and some young ones up there i have a great mind to climb up and see whether she has or not he measured the tree with his eye it was very tall exceeding in its height most of its forest neighbors i dont know as i can climb it he said to himself a little doubtfully but anyway i am going to try theres nothing like trying this was a lucky determination for herbert as will speedily appear it was twenty feet to the first branching off and this was of course the most difficult part of the ascent since it was necessary to shin up and the body of the tree was rather too large to clasp comfortably however it was not the first time that herbert had climbed a tree and he was not deficient in courage as well as skill so he pushed on his way and though once or twice in danger of falling he at length succeeded in reaching the first bough from this point the ascent was comparatively easy in a short time our hero was elated to find himself probably fifty feet from the ground so high it made him feel a little dizzy to look down he reached the nest and found the young birds three in number the parent bird hovered near by evidently quite alarmed for the safety of her brood but herbert had no intention of harming them he only climbed up to gratify his curiosity and because he had nothing more important to do though he did not know it his own danger was greater than that which threatened the birds for just at that moment mr holden in his wanderings had reached ralphs cabin and herbert looking down beheld with some anxiety the figure of the unwelcome visitor he saw abner enter the cabin and after a few moments interval issue from it with an air of disappointment and dissatisfaction how lucky thought our hero that he did not find me inside abner holden looked about him in every direction but the right one he little dreamed that the object of his pursuit was looking down upon him securely from above i dont think hell find me thought herbert wouldnt he give something though to know where i am but our young hero was doomed to disappointment just at that moment the unluckiest that could have been selected he was seized with a strong inclination to sneeze alarmed lest the sound should betray him he made desperate efforts to suppress it but nature would have its way and probably did so with greater violence than if no resistance had been made kerchew sneezed herbert violently as he anticipated abners attention was attracted by the loud noise which he rightly concluded could hardly proceed from a bird or squirrel he had just been on the point of leaving the cabin for some other part of the woods but at this sound he stood still looking up to discover whence it proceeded his keen eyes detected herbert in his lofty perch his eyes sparkled with joy ha you young rascal he exclaimed so you are there are you you were going to run away were you now that herbert was actually discovered his fear left him and he became perfectly selfpossessed and confident yes mr holden he answered quietly such is my intention boldly spoken said abner provoked by our heros coolness for he had hoped to find him terrified and pleading for forgiveness i admire your frankness and will try to equal it i suppose youll give it up as a bad job now no sir said herbert firmly take care sir said abner in anger and astonishment take care how you defy me come down here at once what for inquired herbert without stirring what for repeated abner holden that i may flog you within an inch of your life thats no inducement said our hero coolly do you refuse to obey me shouted abner stamping angrily i refuse to be flogged you dont get me down for any such purpose mr holden then by heaven if you wont come otherwise ill come up and help you down the angry man at once commenced the ascent anger gave him strength and though he was unaccustomed to climbing he continued to mount up about halfway to the first branching off somewhat to herberts uneasiness for he felt there was a chance that he might fall into abners clutches but abners success was only temporary at the height of a dozen feet he began to slip and despite his frantic struggles he slid gradually to the ground tearing his coat which he had not taken the precaution to remove and blistering his hands what was to be done in his anger and excitement he drew a pistol from his breast pocket and pointed upward saying menacingly come down at once you young rascal or i will fire herbert was startled he did not believe the pistol to be loaded still it might be will you come down repeated abner fiercely quick or i fire herberts cheek was pale but in a resolute voice he answered i will not abner holder laid his finger upon the trigger and would in his anger have carried his threat into execution but at the critical moment he was conscious of a violent blow and the pistol was wrenched from his hand turning quickly he met the stern glance of ralph the ranger chapter xiv taken prisoner what does all this mean demanded ralph in a tone of command what right have you to interfere said abner holden sulkily the right that any man has to prevent murder said ralph briefly i wasnt going to murder him what were you going to do asked ralph looking keenly at abner why were you pointing the pistol at him i wanted to frighten him you meant to have him think you were going to fire i believe you were why didnt he come down when i bade him ill answer that question said herbert from the top of the tree mr holden promised to beat me if i would come down but i didnt think that a sufficient inducement i have a right to beat you said abner doggedly aint you bound to me tell me that i was said herbert and if you had treated me well i would have stayed with you but i dont mean to remain to be abused you hear the lads answer said ralph i like his spirit and ill stand by him he wont return with you while this conversation had been going on abner had been slowly edging himself toward the spot upon which ralph had thrown the pistol which he had wrenched from him while ralph was speaking he suddenly darted forward seized the weapon and facing about said with malicious triumph now youre in my power both of you well see whether hell go back with me or not as he spoke he pointed the pistol toward ralph the latter laughed contemptuously this irritated abner holden i will count ten he said unless the boy begins to come down before i stop i fire at you one two hold said ralph and drawing his revolver from beneath his huntingjacket he pointed it at abner two can play at that game abner holden this revolver is fully loaded it gives me six chances of hitting you you have but one chance with your pistol the moment your finger touches the trigger your doom is sealed i never miss my aim a sickly hue overspread the face of abner holden he had counted on ralphs being unarmed he saw that he had made an important and most unlucky mistake put down your revolver he said in a very different tone i wasnt in earnest you know i know nothing of the kind retorted ralph you looked to me as if you were very much in earnest still with his revolver he covered abner put down your weapon said abner nervously it might go off yes it might returned ralph i will lower it on one condition what is that that you lay down your pistol on the ground abner demurred but finally felt compelled to do as he was commanded that is well said ralph quietly now i will take care that you are not tempted by it again he walked toward the pistol lifted it and pointing it in the reverse direction fired it off among the trees so much for that he said now herbert you may come down herbert complied promptly he felt the utmost confidence in the prowess and good faith of his new friend and did not fear to descend though his bitterest enemy awaited him beneath meanwhile an idea struck abner holden he saw that he was no match for herbert as long as ralph chose to befriend him he resolved to enlist the latter on his side hark you ralph he said come aside with me i wish to speak to you a moment ralph followed him a few paces in silence now what is it you have to say to me he demanded about this boy said abner insinuatingly he is bound to me well and the law gives me authority over him well i want him to go back with me well will you promise not to interfere between us i cant promise that said ralph briefly stay a moment said abner seeing that he was on the point of leaving him of course i am willing to make it worth your while ill give you well three dollars to help me secure him and carry him back to my house what do you take me for asked ralph looking at the other steadily for a poor man said abner think a moment three dollars will buy you provisions for a week they couldnt be more easily earned in fact you neednt do anything only promise not to interfere between the boy and myself ralph turned upon him scornfully i have promised the boy my protection he said and you would have me forfeit my word for a paltry three dollars ill give you five said abner supposing that the sum he had offered was not sufficient not for five dollars nor five thousand returned ralph shortly i thought you meant to insult me but i see you only judge me by yourself the boy shall not return with you make up your mind to that i can have you arrested said abner angrily ralph laughed let that comfort you for the loss of the boy he said ill have the boy too muttered abner turning to leave them where are you going demanded ralph i am going home not yet why not demanded abner facing about because i cant spare you yet what right have you to interfere with my movements said abner none perhaps but i will inquire into that afterward it is enough that for the present you must stay here i shall do no such thing said abner and he again turned to go ralph deliberately lifted his weapon and took aim what do you say now he asked surely you will not fire at me said abner turning pale not if you remain where you are how long do you mean to keep me demanded abner sullenly as long as may be necessary that is all herbert go into the cabin and look in one corner for a cord herbert soon returned with a stout cord tough and strong what are you going to do with that asked abner suspiciously im going to bind you said ralph coolly ill have the law on you for this said abner hoarsely all in good time said ralph but i advise you to consider whether the law has nothing to say against attempted murder what do you mean by that i mean that you attempted to murder this boy and would have done so in all probability if i had not interfered when i am arrested i shall feel it my duty to make this known to the authorities abner was silent he felt that ralphs testimony would have an ugly look let me go he said after a pause you neednt be afraid of my troubling either of you dont tie me abner holden said ralph i know you and i know you are not to be trusted i have resolved to help this boy to escape from you and i mean to do it effectually for this purpose i must subject you to temporary inconvenience i advise you not to resist he had already tied the hands of abner holden who as he looked into the fearless resolute face of the ranger felt that it would not do to resist it chafed him most to think that herbert his bound boy should be a witness of his humiliation and he scowled savagely at our hero but herbert showed no triumph his was a brave and generous nature and had it rested with him he would have let mr holden go but he did not think it best to interfere ralph quickly tied both hands and feet and then took the helpless body of abner into the cabin where he placed him in one corner are you thirsty he asked yes said abner sullenly ralph placed a cup of water to his lips he also placed a loaf of bread beside him which though his hands were tied at the wrist he would still be able to reach and then beckoned to herbert come he said it is time that we were going abner gnashed his teeth with anger as he watched them issue from the cabin together and felt how utterly helpless he was to prevent them chapter xv a fourfooted foe abner holdens reflections when he found himself left alone in ralphs cabin bound hand and foot were not of the most agreeable nature it was humiliating to find himself baffled at every point and for once completely defeated in his attempt to exercise his authority over the boy who had been bound to him that herbert should escape from him beyond the chance of recovery seemed now almost certain if he were free something might be done but he was so securely bound that it was impossible to get free without help and the lonely situation of the cabin made it very doubtful whether anyone would come within hearing until the return of ralph himself when that would be was uncertain three hours passed and still no prospect of release the bonds chafed his wrists and his situation was far from comfortable he tried to loosen the cords but without success must i stay here all night he thought in alarm but deliverance was at hand though its first approach was disagreeable a large dog entered the cabin through the open door drawn thither probably by curiosity when he saw abner he appeared to take a dislike to him and barked vehemently go away you brute said abner wrathfully the dog however appeared instinctively to understand that abner holden was able only to threaten him and barked more furiously than before sometimes approaching within a foot of the helpless prisoner and showing a formidable row of teeth which abner feared every moment might fasten upon his arm or leg abner holden was not a man of courage though his disposition was that of a bully he was easily frightened and the fierce look of the dog alarmed him not a little in fact it might have tested the courage of a much braver man than mr holden go away he shrieked shrinking back as far as he could from the open mouth of his persecutor a hoarse bark was the only reply and the dog made an artful spring which was only a feint but had too much the appearance of earnest to suit his enemy oh will nobody save me from the brute groaned abner in an ecstasy of terror if i could only get my hands loose and he tugged frantically at the cord feeling how utterly he was at a disadvantage he condescended to coax his fierce antagonist be quiet thats a good dog he said with hypocritical softness the dog noticed a change in his tone and evidently viewed it with some suspicion still his bark became less fierce and his looks less threatening good dog repeated abner in wheedling tones theres some dinner and he pushed over the provisions which ralph had left while the dog was apparently taking his offer into consideration a boys voice was heard outside calling carlo carlo the dog pricked up his ears and ran out of the cabin so you are here you truant said the boy why did you run away what have you to say for yourself sir the dog answered by a wag of his tail oh yes you may wag your tail but ive a great mind to punish you for running away and putting me to the trouble of finding you hello cried abner in a loud voice whos that thought the boy surprised as the voice evidently came from within the cabin he ventured to the door and looked in he was considerably surprised to see abner holden whom he knew well by sight lying bound hand and foot in the corner is that you mr holden he asked in a tone of surprise of course it is said abner who was not in a very pleasant frame of mind are you tied dont you see i am snarled abner who tied you that rascal ralph i mean to have him hung if i live ralph why i thought he was quiet and peaceable he tried to murder me but changed his mind and tied me as you see i cant understand it there is no need of understanding it come and unfasten these cords i feel stiff and cramped the boy tried to unfasten the cord but it was too securely tied where is your knife i havent got any then take the axe there was an axe standing at the corner of the room this the boy got and with the keen edge severed the string abner stretched himself to relieve his cramped limbs then he bethought himself of his late persecutor is that your dog he asked surveying his fourlegged enemy with no friendly expression yes thats carlo come here carlo hes been in here barking at me and threatening to bite me and now ill have my revenge what do you mean inquired the boy in alarm as abner seized the axe and swung it over his head stand aside boy what are you going to do im going to kill that brute no no hes a good dog he wont do any harm said the boy in alarm ill kill him said abner fiercely the dog surveyed his enemy with suspicion he seemed to understand that danger menaced him he growled in a low hoarse ominous tone which showed that he was on his guard and meant to do his part of the fighting if necessary his owner had retreated to the door and now tried to call him away carlo carlo come out here sir but carlo would not come he had no intention of shrinking from the danger that threatened him but was bent on defending himself as became a brave and dauntless dog whose courage was above suspicion if abner had not been so exasperated he might have been terrified but anger reenforced his courage and moreover he had a great deal of confidence that the axe which he held in his hand would make him more than a match for the dog ill kill him he exclaimed and once more he swung the axe over his head and brought it down with a tremendous force in the direction of the dog alas for poor carlo if the axe had struck him but he was wary and knew something of warlike tactics and with watchful eye carefully noted abners movements the boy uttered a cry of alarm at the peril of his favorite but carlo sprang to one side just as the axe descended and it was buried in the earthen floor of the cabin so deeply that abner could not immediately recover it the advantage was thus transferred to the other side and the dog was not slow in perceiving it with a bound he sprang upon his adversary and bore him to the floor seizing his coat between his strong teeth he pulled and tugged at this with a strength which no ordinary cloth could possibly withstand take him off take him off shrieked abner in terror the boy sprang to the rescue come away carlo he said grasping him by the collar come away thats a good dog but habitually obedient as carlo was his young master found it difficult to get him away he felt that he had received a grievous injury that his life had been attempted and he wanted to have satisfaction finally his master succeeded in drawing him away but not till mr holdens coat was badly torn the latter was crestfallen and angry and not so grateful as he ought to have been to his young defender ill make your father pay for this coat you young rascal he said it isnt my fault mr holden said the boy yes it is it was your dog that tore my coat carlo wouldnt have torn it if you hadnt attacked him he attacked me first you had better go away mr holden or he may go at you again a low growl from the dog whom he held by the collar reenforced this suggestion and abner uttering threats both against the dog and his master strode out of the cabin and bent his steps homeward as he entered the kitchen the housekeeper turned and noticing his torn coat exclaimed good gracious mr holden whats happened to you how came your coat so badly torn it was a dog muttered abner who did not care to be questioned mrs bickford supposed he must have taken off the coat and the dog had torn it as it lay upon the ground what a pity she exclaimed whose dog was it alfred martins ill make martin pay for the coat he has no right to keep such a brute you must be hungry mr holden yes get me something as quick as possible have you seen anything of herbert asked the housekeeper no snapped abner this was a falsehood of course but he felt rather ashamed to confess that he had seen herbert and that the latter had got the better of him mrs bickford perceived that he was out of humor and did not press the question she concluded that he was angry because his quest had been unsuccessful chapter xvi just too late leaving abner holden bound in his cabin ralph led herbert by a short path out of the woods your best course he said will be to take the cars for columbus at vernon at columbus you will go to wheeling and from there over the baltimore ohio railroad to baltimore and thence to new york but all this will cost money i have money said herbert how much about fifteen dollars is that all is it not enough to carry me to new york hardly besides when you get there how will you get along have you any relations in the city yes an uncle then you will go to him no said herbert hastily why not he does not care to see me shall i tell you what sort of a letter he wrote to dr kent about me yes tell me herbert in indignant language which correctly represented his feelings gave the substance of the letter which is already known to us i shall not feel easy he said until i am able to return the ten dollars which my uncle sent me i am not willing to remain under obligations to one who cares so little for me i think you are proud said ralph bending his eyes upon the lads glowing countenance perhaps i am said herbert but is it not a proper pride i cannot say no answered ralph but would you feel the same about incurring obligations to a friend no said herbert that would be different i am glad to hear you say so for i am going to ask you to accept help from me to herberts surprise ralph drew out a small bag originally intended for shot and drew therefrom five golden coins of five dollars each take them he said simply herbert hesitated while his face indicated extreme surprise i thought he commenced and then paused you thought me poor said ralph finishing the sentence for him is it not so yes said herbert most people think so said ralph but it was not poverty that drove me from the busy world to this solitude rich or poor i had money enough for my wants here i have little use for money to me it is a useless and valueless thing you need have no hesitation in taking this but on second thoughts i had better give you more and he was about to draw forth more no no said herbert hastily it is quite sufficient you are very very kind some time i hope to repay you no said ralph do not talk of repayment let me have the pleasure of giving you this small sum how kind you are said herbert impulsively and to a stranger yet my obligation to you is greater than yours to me said ralph how can that be asked the boy raising his eyes to ralphs grave face you are the first human being in whose society i have taken pleasure for years deeply injured by man i conceived a hatred for the whole race but in your frank face i see much to like i think i could trust you i hope so said herbert you have inspired in me a new feeling for which i cannot account yesterday the world had no attractions for me today i feel an interest in your welfare at least why do you bury yourself in this lonely place said herbert you cannot be happy in it come with me to new york it must be a beautiful place ralph smiled gravely to the young the world seems bright he said it is after years have swept away one illusion after another after faith in ones fellowmen has been sorely tried and the hollowness of the worlds friendship has been proved that the brightness fades you have seen more of life than i said herbert and perhaps it is presumption in me to question what you say but i cannot help feeling that you are mistaken i am sure that there is such a thing as true friendship how many true friends are you blessed with asked ralph a little sarcasm in his tone not many perhaps but some there is good dr kent and his family i am sure of their friendship then he added his color slightly rising i think i have found another friend and he looked in the face of his guide the grave face softened thank you my lad said ralph you are right there at least you can rely upon my friendship being sincere then i am right am i not said herbert smiling brightly i believe you are said the guide after a pause and i thank you for teaching me a lesson man was made in the image of god said herbert if we doubt man i think it is the same as doubting god ralph did not reply but walked on in thoughtful silence how far is it to vernon asked herbert when they had emerged from the woods it is five miles farther can you walk so far oh yes i have good stout legs but suppose mr holden should escape he might pursue us ralph smiled i think i shall find him in the same place when i return he said he will be very angry with you yes i suppose so said ralph indifferently are you not afraid he will have you arrested no i care little if i am fined i will pay the fine and that will be the end of it but you might be imprisoned if i see any danger of that i shall be tempted to charge abner holden with his attempt upon your life dont make yourself anxious about me my lad i have little fear of what the law may do as far as my agency in this affair is concerned ralph seemed so entirely unconcerned that something of his confidence was imparted to herbert noting the erect mien and fearless glance of his guide every movement betokening strength he could not help feeling that abner holden would be rash to make such a man his enemy he felt safe in his protection and his apprehensions of capture passed away so with lightened heart he walked the five dusty miles to the village of vernon accompanied by ralph it was a thrifty village with neat and tasteful dwellings lining the principal street the railroad and manufactories had built it up rapidly and given it an air of prosperity which was pleasant to see we will go at once to the railway station said ralph you may catch the next train and it will be as well to leave this neighborhood as soon as possible they were fortunate enough to reach the station fifteen minutes before the eastern train departed herbert bought a ticket for columbus fifty miles distant and entered the train goodby herbert said ralph from the platform goodby said herbert thank you for all your kindness to me shall i not see you again i do not know said ralph musing i have no wish nor intention of going to new york at present yet i have a feeling that we shall meet again i hope it may be so said herbert i shall be glad to see you again while he spoke the shrill sound of the railway whistle was heard the train started and herbert was fairly off on his journey just as he was leaving the depot a wagon drove hastily up to the station and abner holden jumped out herbert saw him as he looked from the window and for a moment he was apprehensive but the train was fairly on the way stop stop vociferated abner stop i say for he had also caught sight of his bound boy on the way to freedom you dont think they will stop the train for you you fool said a man standing by you ought to have come sooner if you wanted to go by this train i dont want to go by it said abner what do you want then my boys run away and i have just seen him aboard the train oh thats it is it your son no i hope not its a young rascal thats bound to me if hes a young rascal i shouldnt think youd want him back turning away for he saw that he had failed his glance rested on ralph instantly his anger rose its your doings said he shaking his fist in impotent wrath at the sturdy hunter whom he would have attacked had he dared its your fault and you shall pay for it if theres law in the land what will the law say to your attempt to shoot the boy demanded ralph coolly abner turned pale and realized that his best course was to keep quiet about an affair which might seriously compromise himself chapter xvii new acquaintances herbert stopped overnight at columbus the first train eastward left columbus at seven oclock in the morning it was herberts intention to take this train but unfortunately as he thought at the time the clock at the hotel by which his movements were guided was ten minutes too slow the consequence was that before he had quite reached the depot he saw the cars going out at the other end he ran as fast as possible hoping still to make up for lost time but it was in vain youre too late youngster said a porter who had been assisting to stow away baggage youll have to wait till the next train when does the next train start asked our hero twelve oclock then i shall have to wait till that time herbert concluded with regret yet as he directly afterwards thought it could make no particular difference since he had no stated engagement to meet and this consideration enabled him to bear the inevitable delay with a better grace i suppose he reflected i might as well go back to the hotel he turned to leave the building when a carriage drove hastily up to the station it was drawn by two horses and driven by a negro in livery a lady put her head out of the window and inquired anxiously if the train had started she addressed this question to herbert who happened to be nearest yes madam he answered respectfully i am so sorry said the lady in a tone of vexation and perplexity it was very important that my father should take that train there is another train that starts at twelve said herbert it will make a difference of a few hours only yes said the lady but you do not understand my difficulty the few hours difference in time would be of small importance but my father is blind and is of course for that reason dependent upon the kindness of others a gentleman of our acquaintance was going by this train who would have taken charge of him and seen him safe to his destination by losing the train we lose his services my dear said an elderly gentleman sitting on the opposite seat if i can get somebody to see me on board i think i can manage very well on no account father was the hasty reply particularly under present circumstances where is the gentleman going asked herbert with interest to philadelphia i am going on to new york said our hero i have been disappointed like you i expected to take the early train do you intend to go by the next train then asked the lady yes madam then perhaps i have a great mind to ask you to take charge of my father i shall be very glad to be of service to you said herbert there is only one objection he added with some embarrassment what is that why said herbert frankly i am obliged to be economical and i was thinking of buying a secondclass ticket oh said the lady promptly there need be no difficulty about that if you will take the trouble to look after my father we will gladly pay for your ticket i am afraid my services will not be worth so much said herbert modestly you must leave us to estimate them if you do what you have undertaken we shall consider the expense well incurred herbert made no further objection he felt indeed that it would be quite a lift to him in the present state of his finances and besides would be a very easy way of earning the money he therefore signified his thanks and his acceptance of the offer when did you say the train starts asked the lady at twelve nearly five hours that will be too long to wait i think father we will go home yes my dear i think that will be best are you obliged to go home before starting the lady inquired addressing herbert no madam i have no home in columbus i passed last night at a hotel have you any particular plan for spending the next few hours herbert answered in the negative then will you not ride home with us you will then be ready to start with my father i shall be happy to do so i think that will be much the best plan pompey open the carriage door for the young gentleman our hero was about to say that he could just as well open the door for himself but he reflected that it was best to adapt himself to the customs of those he was with he bowed therefore and waited till the coachman had opened the door for him and stepped into the carriage the lady signed to him to take a seat beside her and the door was closed home pompey said she briefly the coachman ascended to his seat and the spirited grays were soon whirling the party rapidly homeward it was a new position for our hero and he felt it to be so his parents had never been rich and latterly had been very poor living in a small country village he had never even seen so elegant a carriage as that in which he was now riding he sank back upon the luxuriously cushioned seat and he could not help thinking how pleasant it would be if he could command so comfortable a conveyance whenever he wanted to ride out but another thought succeeded this if he were blind like the gentleman whom he was to take charge of it would be a very poor compensation to ride in a luxurious carriage after all things were not so unequal as they seemed at first sight since you are to be my fathers traveling companion said the lady perhaps you will not object to telling us your name certainly said our hero my name is herbert mason are you going from home for the first time inquired the lady i have no home said herbert my father and mother are both dead excuse me said the lady gently i am sorry to have touched upon a subject which must awaken sorrowful recollections my fathers name is carroll father you have heard that your young escort is mr herbert mason the old gentleman extended his hand which herbert took respectfully i am afraid you will find me a troublesome charge he said since i have become blind i have been compelled to tax the kindness of others the journey will be pleasanter to me said herbert politely than if i were alone mr carroll was evidently pleased with this remark for he turned toward herbert with increased interest you can imagine how much more so it will be to me he said i have not your resources for beguiling the tedium of the way i would give all my possessions gladly for your young eyes all journeys are alike to me now since however interesting the scenery it is a blank to me that is indeed a privation sir especially in the journey we are about to take the baltimore ohio railroad as it is called runs through a romantic and charming country and affords views at once bold and beautiful have you ever traveled over the road no sir then you will have all the pleasure of a first discovery before i became blind before indeed the railway was located i became as a young man familiar with this whole section of country so that i have at least the remembrance of it i am obliged now to live upon my memory you say you have never been over this railroad said the lady have you ever been to the east no madam i have always lived in the state of ohio and you are now going to philadelphia she inquired i am going to new york said herbert indeed is it on a visit no madam i am expecting to live there that is if i can make a living are you dependent then upon your own exertions for support yes madam you seem very young for such a responsibility i am fourteen i thought you a year older my oscar is fourteen and i am afraid he would make a poor hand at supporting himself what do you think father i think you are right my dear oscar has not been placed in circumstances to develop his selfreliance no that probably has something to do with it but herbert if you will permit me to call you so do you not look forward to the future with apprehension no madam said herbert i am not afraid but that i shall be able to get along somehow i think i shall find friends and i am willing to work that is the spirit that leads to success said the old gentleman approvingly work comes to willing hands i think you will succeed i hope so sir our hero was gratified to meet with so much sympathy from those whose wealth placed them far above him in the social scale but it was not surprising for herbert had a fine appearance and gentlemanly manners marked too by a natural politeness which enabled him to appear better than most boys of his age chapter xviii a young aristocrat after a drive of three miles which was accomplished in a short time by the spirited horses the carriage entered through an ornamental gate upon a smooth driveway which led up to a handsome mansion of large size with a veranda stretching along the entire front a boy a little smaller than herbert ran out of the front door and opened the door of the carriage before pompey had time to descend from the box what grandpa come back he said in surprise yes oscar we were too late for the train said his mother i brought you back a companion for a few hours this is herbert mason whom i intrust to your care depending upon you to see that he passes his time pleasantly oscar looked at herbert inquisitively herbert offered his hand saying i am glad to make your acquaintance oscar how long are you going to stay asked oscar as his mother and grandfather went into the house i must return in time to take the twelve oclock train is grandpa going too yes and are you going to take care of him i believe so i wouldnt want to why not oh its an awful bore to be tied to a blind man youd find it more of a bore to be blind yourself said herbert yes i suppose i should grandpa wants me to go to walk with him sometimes but i dont like it if i had a grandfather who was blind i think i should be willing wait till you have one and youll see how it is then i suppose he needs somebody oh well he can take one of the servants then its their business to work where do you live he asked after a pause i am going to live in new york are you i should like to go there perhaps you wouldnt want to go as i am going what alone yes i should rather go that way then i could do as i pleased now its oscar do this and you mustnt do that all the time that isnt what i mean exactly ive got to earn my own living after i get there and i dont know anybody in the city you havent run away from home have you i havent got any home wheres your father and mother they are both dead what are you going to do i hope to get into a store or countingroom and learn to be a merchant i shant have to work for a living said oscar in a tone of importance because your family is rich i suppose said herbert yes weve got a large estate ever so many acres thats what mothers got then grandpa is rich besides and i expect he will leave me a good deal of his money hes pretty old and i dont believe hell live very long oscar said this with such evident satisfaction that herbert was disgusted thinking it not very creditable to him to speculate so complacently upon his grandfathers speedy death you seem to be well off then said he at last to the boy yes said oscar our family is one of the first in the state my father is a peyton is he asked herbert not appearing as much awestruck as oscar expected weve got a plantation in virginia we live there part of the year my fathers there now i hope we shall go there soon do you like it better than here yes a good deal this is a handsome place yes this is mothers estate the other belongs to father have you any brothers and sisters oscar ive got one sister shes about twelve but i say i thought you were a gentlemans son when i first saw you so i am said herbert emphatically was your father rich no did he have to work for a living yes then he wasnt a gentleman said oscar decidedly isnt anybody a gentleman that has to work for a living asked herbert his indignation excited by his companions assumption of superiority of course not said oscar coolly it isnt respectable to work niggers and servants work that is where i dont agree with you said herbert his face flushing you dont pretend to be a gentleman do you demanded oscar insolently yes i do said herbert firmly but youre not one you know i dont know anything of the kind said herbert angrily i suppose you call yourself one of course i am a gentleman said oscar complacently you dont talk like one at any rate retorted herbert this was new language for oscar to hear he had been accustomed to have his own way pretty much and had been used to order round his fathers servants and slaves like a little despot the idea of being told by a boy who had to work for a living that he did not talk like a gentleman did not suit him at all his black eyes flashed and he clenched his fists do you mean to insult me he demanded i never insult anybody said herbert not feeling particularly alarmed by this hostile demonstration it is you that have insulted me didnt you tell me i was not a gentleman said oscar hotly i said you did not talk like one thats about the same thing said oscar just as you like even if i did say so you said the same of me well suppose i did i am as much a gentleman as you to say the least asserted herbert if you say that again ill knock you down said oscar furiously ill say it all day if i like said herbert defiantly perhaps it would have been better for herbert to stop disputing and to have taken no notice of oscars words but herbert was not perfect he had plenty of spirit and he was provoked by the airs oscar chose to assume and by no means inclined to allow him to arrogate a superiority over himself merely on account of his wealth though manly and generous he was quick to resent an insult and accordingly when oscar dared to repeat what he had said he instantly accepted the challenge as recorded above had oscar been prudent he would have hesitated before endeavoring to carry his threat into execution a moments glance at the two boys would have satisfied anyone that the chances in a personal contest were decidedly in our heros favor herbert was not only a little taller than oscar perhaps an inch and a half but his shoulders were broader and his frame more muscular oscar had never done any work to strengthen his arms while herbert had been forced by circumstances to do so oscar flung himself upon herbert and endeavored to bear him to the ground but the latter without an effort repelled the charge and flung himself free from his antagonists grasp this naturally made oscar more determined to overcome his foe his face red with passion he showered blows upon herbert which the latter parried with ease at first he acted wholly upon the defensive but finding that oscars impetuosity did not abate suddenly closed with him and threw him down oscar rose but little hurt for herbert used no unnecessary force and recommenced the assault but the result was the same as before oscar was almost beside himself with mingled rage and mortification and it is hard to tell how long the contest would have lasted had not a servant come up and informed the boys that mrs peyton wished to see them immediately she had witnessed the whole scene from a window and felt called upon to interfere how is this young gentleman she asked gravely you have scarcely been together twenty minutes and i find you fighting i beg your pardon mrs peyton said herbert in a manly tone i feel ashamed of myself but oscar attacked me for claiming to be a gentleman and i am afraid that my blood was up and so we got into a fight how is this oscar said his mother did you so wholly lose your politeness as to attack your guest for asserting his claims to be a gentleman i am annoyed with you he says he has to work for a living said oscar sullenly so may you some time i am rich you may not always be at any rate being rich doesnt insure gentlemanly behavior as your conduct today clearly shows herbert i hope you will excuse my sons rudeness here is my hand oscar said herbert cordially let us be friends oscar hardly knew how to receive this overture but he was finally thawed by herberts manner and they were soon sauntering about on the lawn on the best of terms at halfpast eleven after an inviting lunch the carriage was ordered and herbert and mr carroll were driven to the depot accompanied by oscar who went in his mothers place herbert purchased tickets for both being intrusted with mr carrols pocketbook for that purpose he found a comfortable seat for the old gentleman and sat down beside him chapter xix a suspicious character i pass over the route pursued by the travelers from columbus to wheeling in west virginia as it possesses no special interest but after leaving wheeling there is quite a change those of my readers who are familiar with the baltimore ohio railway will be able to understand the enjoyment which herbert derived from the bold and romantic scenery visible from the car windows mr carroll made him take the seat nearest the window that he might have a better view and from time to time herbert described what he saw to his sightless fellowtraveler northwestern virginia is very mountainous and the construction of a railway through such a region was a triumph of engineering skill at times the road makes bold curves so that the traveler looking from the car window can see opposite him across an intervening gulf the track over which the train was passing five minutes before at some places the track is laid on a narrow shelf midway of the mountain a steep and rugged ascent on one side a deep ravine on the other somewhat like the old diligence road over the alpine mt cenis here and there appear small hamlets consisting of onestory cabins with the chimney built alongside instead of rising from the roof in the usual manner how long shall we be in reaching baltimore mr carroll asked herbert i believe it takes about twentysix hours said the old gentleman but i do not mean to go through without stopping i didnt know what your plan was said herbert i have been meaning to tell you our tickets will allow us to stop anywhere and resume our journey the next morning or even stop two or three days if we like that is convenient yes if it had been otherwise i should have purchased the ticket piecemeal i cannot endure to travel all night it fatigues me too much where shall we stop then i have not yet quite made up my mind we will ride till about eight oclock and then stop over at whatever place we chance to have reached this arrangement struck herbert favorably he was in no particular hurry and the scenery was so fine that he feared that he should lose a great deal by traveling at night when of course he could not see anything they sat for a while in silence then mr carroll inquired suddenly did you ever fire a pistol herbert yes sir was the surprised reply then you understand how to use one oh yes sir there was a young man in waverley the town where i used to live who owned one and i sometimes borrowed it to fire at a mark then i think i will intrust this weapon to your charge said the old gentleman drawing from his pocket a handsome pistol and placing it in herberts hand is it loaded sir no not at present we will have it loaded before going to bed i will tell you he added in a lower tone my reason for going armed it so happens that i have a large amount of money with me and of course i feel a little concerned about its safety perhaps it will be well not to say anything more about it at present sir suggested herbert in a low voice you may be heard by someone who would like to take advantage of his discovery no doubt you are right i will follow your advice herbert would not have thought to give this caution but just as mr carroll uttered the words i have a large sum of money with me a man dressed in a rough frieze coat with black whiskers and a general appearance which to say the least did not prepossess herbert in his favor chanced to walk through the car whether he caught the words herbert could not tell but he paused a moment and fixed an unpleasant eye upon the two as if determined to know them when he should meet them again there was another suspicious circumstance it had evidently been his intention to pass through the car but he paused abruptly and turning back sank into an unoccupied seat a few feet back of that occupied by mr carroll and his young companion his attention naturally drawn by this suspicious conduct herbert was impelled to glance back once or twice each time he met the watchful look of the man fixed upon them instead of being directed at the scenery outside as was the case with the other passengers when he saw that the boy was watching him he turned his head carelessly and commenced whistling but this apparent indifference did not deceive herbert for a moment i will watch him thought our hero i do not like his looks if he means mischief as i think very probable it is necessary that i should be on my guard against him at halfpast seven oclock mr carroll signified his intention of getting out at the next station i am beginning to feel tired he said and shall feel the better for a good supper and a nights rest very well sir said herbert it occurred to him that now they would get rid of the man who was watching them so closely if he gets out of the train with us he thought i shall know what it means the train slackened its speed the sound of the whistle was heard the brakes were applied and soon the conductor putting his head in at the door called out oakland here we are said herbert give me your hand mr carroll and i will lead you out the old gentleman rose from his seat and guided by herbert walked to the car door at the door herbert turned and looked back the man with the black whiskers who a moment before seemed absorbed in a newspaper had left his seat and was but a few feet behind him herbert did not believe that this was an accident he felt sure that it meant mischief but he did not on that account feel nervous or regret that he had assumed a charge which seemed likely to expose him to peril he had the pistol in his pocket and that he knew would make him even with the rascal who was following them there was a covered carriage waiting outside to convey passengers to the only hotel which the village afforded shall we take the carriage mr carroll asked herbert yes was the reply herbert assisted him in and placed himself in a seat opposite there were two or three other passengers but the man with the black whiskers was not to be seen among them i may be mistaken thought herbert who had rather expected to see him perhaps he lives here and i have been alarming myself without reason still it is always best to be on ones guard a ride of half a mile brought them to a small but comfortablelooking inn herbert assisted mr carroll to descend and together they entered the house of entertainment we shall want some supper herbert said mr carroll you may order some what shall i order sir i should like some tea and toast and some beefsteak if there is anything that you would prefer you may order that also no sir i should not wish anything better than you have ordered tell them to get it ready as soon as possible i feel weary with my days ride and shall retire early i feel tired too thought herbert but it wont do for me to sleep i must keep my eyes open if possible supper was soon served the toast was well browned and spread with excellent butter the steak was juicy and tender contrary to the usual custom of country inns and the tea was fragrant and strong both the travelers partook heartily having eaten nothing since noon with the exception of a little fruit purchased from the car window at one of the stations herbert was not usually in the habit of drinking tea at night but on this particular occasion he wanted to keep awake and therefore drank two cups of undiminished strength now herbert said mr carroll when they had finished supper you may ask the clerk to assign me to a large room with a couple of beds in it i should prefer to have you in the same room with me very well sir he rose from the table and went to the public room one portion of which was occupied by the office as he made his way to the desk he observed the man with black whiskers on a settee at one end of the room he was smoking a clay pipe herbert caught a stealthy glance directed towards himself but that was all the man continued smoking fixing his eyes with apparent interest on a large yellow handbill pasted on the opposite wall announcing a performance by the great american circus company the succeeding evening herbert succeeded in obtaining such a room as he sought and accompanied by a servant bearing a lamp went back to the diningroom to accompany mr carroll to it chapter xx facing a burglar herbert deliberated as to whether it would be best to inform his aged traveling companion of the suspiciouslooking man who appeared to have followed them for no good purpose he finally decided not to do so since it would only alarm mr carroll and prevent his sleeping off his fatigue while there would be no advantage gained since a blind and feeble man could be of little use in repelling the burglar should the stranger prove to be such the bedroom was large and square and contained two beds the larger of these was placed in the corner and this was assigned to the old gentleman the smaller was situated between the two side windows and was of course the more exposed of the two this herbert was to occupy do you know how to load the pistol herbert asked mr carroll yes sir said herbert confidently i dont anticipate any occasion for using it continued the old gentleman still it will be best to be prepared so i think sir you wont be afraid to use it if it should be necessary no sir mr carroll took a package from his carpetbag and showed it to herbert this package he said contains five thousand dollars in bank bills if it were known that i had it i should be in danger i suppose it will be best to put it back in the carpetbag if it were mine said herbert i would not do that where then would you put it i would put it between the mattresses if anyone should get into the room they would seize the carpetbag first and perhaps make off before they could be stopped i dont know but you are right said mr carroll perhaps it will be well to put my watch in the same place yes sir i think it would be well you see herbert continued the old gentleman how much confidence i repose in you knowing where my watch and money are it would be very easy for you to secure both and leave me here destitute and helpless but you dont think there is any danger of my doing so no said the old gentleman though our acquaintance is so recent i feel great confidence in you as i cannot see the face i have learned to judge of the character by the tone of the voice and i am very much mistaken if you are not thoroughly honest and trustworthy thank you sir said herbert his face flushed with pleasure at this evidently sincere commendation you shall not repent your confidence i am sure of that herbert said mr carroll kindly but i must bid you goodnight this has been a fatiguing day and i shall lose no time in getting to sleep goodnight i hope you will sleep well sir said herbert there wont be much sleep for me he thought mr carroll lay down and his deep tranquil breathing soon assured our hero that he was asleep he rose from his bed and examined the windows all but one were provided with fastenings but the one on the righthand side of his bed could be raised from the outside without difficulty i wish i had a nail thought herbert i could soon make it fast but there was none in the room and he did not wish to go downstairs for one since he would probably meet the stranger who would then learn what precautions he was taking and so perhaps vary his attack that window will need watching thought herbert i wonder whether i shall be able to keep awake the excitement of his situation and perhaps the strong tea to which he was unaccustomed helped him to remain vigilant his mind was active and on the alert and his ears were open to catch the least sound it was only halfpast ten probably the attempt to enter the room would not be made before twelve at least in order to insure their being asleep herbert examined his pistol it was in excellent order and was provided with two barrels both of which he loaded thus he would have a double chance to defend himself he did not remove all his clothing but kept on his pants in order to be prepared for emergencies there was an hour and a half to wait before midnight the minutes passed slowly herbert for a time heard the murmur of voices in the barroom below then steps ascended the stairs and after a while all was hushed i wish the fellow would come quick he thought if he is coming at all so that it might be all over and i might go to sleep time sped on herbert could hear the village clock striking twelve but still all around remained quiet it might have been a half an hour later when he heard a slight noise as he thought under the window jumping softly out of bed he took a peep out it was just light enough for him to distinguish a dark form moving about bearing something which he soon perceived to be a ladder that it was the blackwhiskered man who had followed them he did not doubt and he felt confident that he intended to place the ladder against the window he was not mistaken he heard the top of the ladder softly inclined against the house and then he felt that the critical moment which was to test his courage was close at hand herberts heart began to beat rapidly he felt that he was taking upon himself a fearful responsibility in shooting this man as he would probably be obliged to do in selfdefense but one thing he resolved upon he would not take his life he would only use such a degree of violence as should be absolutely necessary he would even give him a chance by firing the first barrel in the air in hope of frightening the robber if that failed he must wound him there was little time for these thoughts to pass through his mind for all the while the man was creeping up the ladder herbert had moved a little aside that he might not be seen soon he perceived by the indistinct light the face of the stranger rising above the windowsill next the window was slowly raised and he began to make preparations to enter the room then herbert felt that it was time for him to appear stepping intrepidly to the window he said i know your purpose unless you go down instantly i will shoot you there was no tremor in his voice as he said this courage came with the occasion and his tone was resolute and selfpossessed so youre awake are you my chicken was the reply if you know whats best for yourself youll hand over the old mans money and save me the trouble of getting in never said herbert firmly then i will take it myself and give you something to remember me by you little fool he placed his knee on the windowsill and prepared to jump in one step farther said herbert resolutely and i fire he displayed the pistol at the sight of which the burglar hesitated hold on a bit said he pausing ill give you some of the plunder if youll put up that shooting iron and make no trouble do you think me a villain like yourself asked herbert by you shall repent this said the robber with an oath and he made another attempt to enter click there was a sharp report but herbert had fired in the air and the burglar was unhurt confusion he exclaimed that will raise the house then espying the carpetbag he determined to jump in seize it and get away before the people in the house were fairly awake as for the pistol that had been discharged and he supposed that nothing was to be feared from it but he reckoned without his host as he put one leg over and had all but succeeded in getting in herbert fired once more this time hitting him in the shoulder he uttered a shriek of pain and losing his hold tumbled backward to the ground the two reports alarmed the house whats the matter exclaimed mr carroll awakened and alarmed dont be alarmed sir said herbert a man just attempted to get in through the window and i have wounded him you are a brave boy said mr carroll where is he now he has tumbled to the ground shot through the shoulder i think there was a loud thumping at the door herbert opened it and admitted half a dozen guests headed by the landlord whats the matter exclaimed all in chorus if you will come to the window gentlemen i will show you said herbert they followed him curiously and the sight of the ladder and the wounded man who was uttering groans of pain from the ground below told the story at once served the rascal right said the landlord who is he the blackwhiskered man who was in the barroom last night said herbert i remember now he asked particularly where you were to sleep you and the old gentleman but i did not suspect his purpose i did said herbert and kept awake to be ready for him you are a brave lad i only did my duty said herbert modestly help help groaned the wretch below herbert heard the cry of pain and his heart was filled with pity the man was indeed a villain he had only been served right as the landlord said still he was a fellowcreature and he was in pain herbert could not regret that he had shot him but he did regret the necessity and he felt sympathy for him in his suffering poor fellow he said compassionately i am afraid he is a good deal hurt poor fellow echoed the landlord it serves him right still he is in pain and he ought to be cared for he has no claim upon us he may he there till morning no said mr carroll herbert is right he is guilty but he is in pain and it is the part of humanity to succor him landlord if you will have him brought in and send for the doctor you may look to me for your pay yet he was going to rob you sir said the landlord considerably surprised yes that is true but you dont know how strongly he was tempted he looks like a hard ticket i didnt like to give him a bed but we cant well refuse travelers if they have money to pay their reckoning i made him pay in advance pray lose no time said herbert as another groan was heard i will go out and help you bring him in a lantern was lit and the whole company followed the landlord out well said he throwing the light of the candle full on the sufferers face youve got yourself into a fine pickle havent you oh groaned the burglar if it hadnt been for that accursed boy youd have got off with the old gentlemans money well it was rather unkind to interfere are you in much pain asked herbert bending over him there was something in his voice that betrayed the compassion he really felt the burglar looked up youre the boy that wounded me aint you he asked yes said herbert curse you i dont know but youve killed me im shot through the shoulder then that cursed fall i feel as if i had broken my back i did not want to shoot you said herbert what did you do it for then because you forced me to it you were after mr carrolls money didnt i offer to divide with you yes but of course i would not agree to that are you so much better than common folks sneered the burglar i dont know about that i would not steal take him up said the landlord to the hotel servants he dont deserve it but ive promised the old gentleman wed see to him tom white you may go for the doctor two men approached and attempted to lift the wounded burglar but in the first attempt they touched the injured shoulder he uttered a shriek of pain and exclaimed youll murder me let me lift him said herbert perhaps you were too rough at length but not without much groaning on the part of the burglar he was got into the house and laid on a bed in a small room on the first floor do you feel better asked herbert a little do you think you have broken any bones in falling i thought so at first but perhaps i am only bruised when the doctor comes he will extract the bullet and relieve you of a good deal of your pain you are a strange boy said the burglar with a look of surprise why am i you shot me and yet you pretend to be sorry for me now so i am then why did you shoot me i have already told you because i was obliged to i would not have done it if there had been any other way i shot the first barrel in the air by accident no i thought it would alarm you and i might save the money without injuring you do you really mean that yes and you dont have any illwill against me now no that is strange i dont know why it should be i suppose i ought to hate you because you have brought me to this pass said the burglar thoughtfully but i dont that is strange too i am so glad you feel so said herbert i am very sorry for your pain and i will do what i can to relieve it i have no money to pay the landlord and the doctor mr carroll says he will pay all needed expenses the man i wanted to rob yes then hang me if i aint ashamed of trying to rob him said the burglar earnestly have you ever robbed anyone before no i havent im a rough customer and have done plenty of mean things but this is the first job of the kind i ever attempted i wouldnt have done it only i heard the old man say in the cars that he had a lot of money with him i was hard up and on my way to cedarville to try to get work but when i heard what he said the devil tempted me i believe and i determined to keep you both in sight and get out where you did ive tried and failed and thats the end of it its my first attempt at burglary i hope it will be the last you may bet your life on that then said herbert quietly i will intercede with mr carroll for you and ask him not to have you arrested will you do that asked the wounded man eagerly i promise it if you will boy i will bless you and if god would listen to such a scamp as i am id pray for you he will listen to you said herbert try to lead a better life and he will help you i wish id met with such as you before said the burglar id have been a better man than i am here the doctor entered and herbert gave place to him the wound was discovered not to be serious and the bullet being extracted the sufferer found relief herbert returned to bed and this time having no anxious thoughts to weigh upon his mind he soon sank into a refreshing sleep in which the fatigues and excitements of the day were completely forgotten chapter xxi herberts reward i owe the safety of my money to you my brave boy said mr carroll the next morning as after rising he replaced the package of bank notes in his carpetbag i only did my duty said herbert but his face flushed with pleasure at the commendations bestowed upon him but in doing your duty you displayed a courage and fidelity rare in one of your age i am glad you approve of my conduct said herbert if you continue to deserve as well of those who employ you i am sure you will achieve success i hope so sir said our hero i shall try to do my duty in whatever situation in life i may be placed what are your plans when you reach new york i shall try to find a place in a store or countingroom have you friends in the city on whose influence you can rely to help you to such a situation as you desire no sir i have only myself to look to only yourself it is a bold undertaking dont you think i shall succeed asked herbert a little anxiously i do not doubt that you will succeed after finding a place but that is the difficulty i supposed there must be plenty to do in a great city like new york there is truth in what you say but nevertheless many are led astray by it there is indeed a great deal to do but there are a great many ready to do it and generally i may say always the laborers exceed the work to be done perhaps said herbert many fail to get work because they are particular what they do if i can find nothing better to do i will black boots with such a spirit i think you will succeed but perhaps i can smooth away some of the difficulties in your path i know a firm in new york connections of our family to whom i will give you a letter of introduction if they have no room for you in their house they may influence someone else to take you i shall feel very much obliged to you for such a letter it will do me a great deal of good said herbert gratefully i will gladly write it but now let us go down to breakfast after breakfast was over they looked in upon the wounded man how do you feel this morning asked herbert going up to the bedside rather stiff but i am not in such pain as i was i am glad to hear it that is the gentleman i was going to rob said the burglar looking in the direction of mr carroll yes is he did you say anything to him about not prosecuting me he asked nervously be under no apprehension said mr carroll mildly i do not care to punish you more than you have already been punished i prefer that you should lead a better life i will try to do so sir but i was poor and that made the temptation stronger i can easily believe it are you wholly without means nearly so here then is a purse containing a hundred dollars it will probably pay your expenses during your illness the wounded man looked up in surprise there aint many that would pay a man for trying to rob them he said i do not pay you for that said mr carroll but because i do not wish you to be subjected to a similar temptation again the wounded man who under different treatment would have been defiant and profane seemed quite subdued by such unexpected kindness well sir he said all i can say is that i am very much obliged to you and i hope you will be rewarded for your kindness it is easier to lead men than to drive them said mr carroll as they left the chamber this man is rough and not troubled much with a conscience but harshness would make him still worse yes sir said herbert i think you are right after breakfast they resumed their journey in due time they reached baltimore and remained over night at a hotel in the course of the succeeding day they arrived at philadelphia which was the termination of mr carrolls journey as the country through which they passed was unknown to herbert the journey was full of interest but there was no adventure worth recording the time came when the two travelers were compelled to part if i were going to a hotel herbert said mr carroll i would invite you to remain with me a day or two but i shall proceed at once to the house of a friend and i shall not feel at liberty to invite you thank you sir said herbert i think it will be best for me to go on to new york at once i have got my living to make and i am anxious to get to work as soon as possible it is a praiseworthy feeling said the old gentleman life lies before you i have left nearly the whole of it behind me i am drawing near the end of my journey you are just at the beginning i shall hope to meet you again but if not be assured that i shall always remember with pleasure my young traveling companion thank you sir said herbert i shall not soon forget the essential service which you have rendered me continued the old gentleman dont think of it sir said herbert modestly anyone would have done the same thing in my place i am by no means sure of that at any rate the obligation remains you must allow me to acknowledge it in some measure mr carroll drew out his pocketbook and handed it to herbert will you oblige me he said by counting the bills in this pocketbook herbert did so there are sixtyfive dollars he said passing it back will you take out fifty dollars yes sir i have done it thats the sum you will oblige me by keeping said mr carroll i hope it may be of service to you you give me so much money said herbert in surprise it is but a very small sum compared with that which you have saved me i dont think i ought to take so much said herbert hesitating you need not hesitate my young friend i am blessed with abundant means and very well able to part with it besides it is only one per cent of the money which you have been instrumental in saving me and you are certainly entitled to as much as that i thank you very much for the gift mr carroll said our hero and still more for the kind manner in which you give it to me you accept it then that is well said the old gentleman with satisfaction there is one thing more you remember that i spoke to you of a business firm in pearl street new york with the members of which i am acquainted last evening i prepared a letter of introduction to them for you here it is thank you sir said herbert i was very fortunate in meeting with one so able and willing to assist me you are very welcome to all the help i am able to give you i shall be very glad if your life shall be as prosperous as mine has been i must trouble you to do me one more service if you will find me a cab i will go at once to my friends house no difficulty was experienced in obtaining a carriage there was a cordial leavetaking and herbert once more found himself alone but with rather more than sixty dollars in his pocket he felt rich and looked forward eagerly to his arrival in the great city where he hoped to deserve and win success chapter xxii robbed in the night herbert entered the cars and took a seat by the window his small bundle containing all the extra clothing he had been able to bring away from the inhospitable home of mr holden he placed in the seat beside him it was yet early and there were but few persons in the car but as the hour for starting approached it gradually filled up still the seat next to herbert remained untaken at length a young man apparently about nineteen walked up the aisle and pausing inquired is this seat engaged no said herbert at the same time removing his bundle then if you have no objection ill take possession he accordingly seated himself and commenced a conversation going to new york he asked yes said herbert do you live there no i have never been there before are you going on a visit no i am going to live there that is if i can find anything to do are you alone yes so am i suppose we hitch teams i dont understand suppose we go to some hotel together i have been there before and can tell you where to go its awful dull being alone i always like to pick up company herbert hardly knew what to say to this proposition he did not exactly like the appearance or fancy the free and easy manners of his new acquaintance but he felt lonely and besides he hardly knew what excuse to make he therefore gave his assent to the arrangement proposed whats your name asked his new friend familiarly herbert mason mine is greenleaf peter greenleaf have you come from a distance from waverley in ohio not far from cincinnati i am from philadelphia ive been in a store there but i didnt like the style and i concluded to go to new york theres more chance for a fellow of enterprise there what sort of a store were you in drygoods store hatch macy old hatch is a mean skinflint and wouldnt pay me half what i was worth i dont want to brag but there wasnt a man in that store that sold as much as i did and how much do you think i got i dont know only seven dollars a week if i hadnt made something another way i couldnt have paid my expenses i should think you might live on seven dollars a week this was before the war had increased the expenses of living couldnt do it board cost me four dollars a week and that only left three for other expenses my cigars cost me nearly that then i wanted to go to the theater now and then and of course i must dress like a gentleman i tell you what seven dollars a week didnt begin to do me how did you manage then oh i made so much more by banking by banking repeated herbert in astonishment yes only it was a faro bank i used to pick up considerable that way sometimes a faro bank repeated herbert in dismay why thats the same as gambling isnt it well whats the odds you take your chance and you may win or lose its a pretty fair thing after this confession herbert became more than ever doubtful whether he should care to remain long in the company of his present companion meanwhile the cars were moving rapidly peter greenleaf as he called himself talked volubly and appeared to have a considerable familiarity with certain phases of life the knowledge of which was not likely to have been very profitable to him still herbert was interested in his communications though the opinion which he formed of him was far from favorable where are you going to stop when you get to new york inquired peter i dont know anything about the city i suppose i shall have to go to a hotel first suppose we go to frenchs hotel where is that near the park its on the european plan you pay fifty cents a day for your rooms and whatever you please for your meals i think i shall like that i shall want to get into a boardinghouse as soon as possible all right well take a room together at the hotel this arrangement was not to herberts taste but he did not care to offend his companion by objecting to it so by his silence he gave consent what are you going to do in new york he asked i shall look up a situation i wont take less than fifteen dollars a week a man of my experience ought to be worth that dont you think so yes said herbert dubiously though it occurred to him that if he were an employer he would not be likely to engage such a clerk at any price but it is rather fortunate all things considered that we are able to keep our thoughts to ourselves otherwise the complacency of our companions and sometimes our own would run the risk of being rudely disturbed in course of time the terminus of the road was reached and crossing over from jersey city herbert found himself for the first time in his life in the noise and whirl of the great city and i am actually to live here thought herbert i wonder what mr holden would say if he knew where i was uncertain as his prospects were he felt very glad that he was out of the clutches of the petty despot whose chief pleasure was to make him uncomfortable here at least the future was full of possibilities of good fortune there it was certain discomfort and little to hope for where is the hotel you spoke of he asked turning to greenleaf ill lead you to it they walked up to broadway then up by the astor house and across the park to the hotel well go in and secure a room the first thing he said they entered greenleaf taking the lead show us a room with two beds said peter to the clerk a servant was summoned and the room assigned to them was indicated have you any baggage asked the clerk no said greenleaf carelessly mine was checked through from philadelphia i shant send for it till morning then i must ask you to pay in advance all right fifty cents isnt it yes mason said greenleaf have you got a dollar about you ive got nothing less than a ten herbert drew out a dollar and paid for himself and his companion they were now shown up to a room on the third floor which proved to be a very comfortable one looking out on the street herbert was glad to get a chance to wash himself thoroughly after the dusty journey which he had just completed this ceremony over they went down to the restaurant connected with the hotel and took a hearty meal greenleaf made an effort to have herbert pay for both but this time herbert also had a bill to change it was rather a suspicious circumstance he thought that greenleaf who had no bill smaller than a ten paid for his meal out of a onedollar bill after supper greenleaf bought a couple of cigars and offered herbert one no thank you said our hero dont you smoke no where have you been living all your life i couldnt get along without my cigar dont you think it hurtful to a boy to smoke i dont know about that im a man now but ive smoked ever since i was a boy i think it does a fellow good but its expensive yes thats so i expect ive smoked a thousand dollars worth of cigars in the course of my life dont you wish you had the money instead yes i should rather like the money but i shouldnt be half the man i am if i hadnt smoked its mostly milksops that dont smoke nothing personal you know mason of course not said herbert smiling better have a cigar no i guess not youll come to it in time ill smoke it for you then after smoking greenleaf expressed his intention of going to the theater herbert preferred to go to bed early feeling rather tired he was kept awake at first by the noise of the horsecars and the bustle of the street outside as well as by the exciting thoughts that crowded upon him suggested by his actual arrival in the city where he hoped to make a place for himself by energy and industry but at last he fell asleep he slept soundly through the night but towards morning he had a dream in which abner holden figured his old employer seemed to be approaching him with a smile of exultation and was about to lay violent hands upon him when he awoke it was broad daylight being already seven oclock in the morning herbert remembered where he was and looked across the room for greenleaf but he was not visible the bed was disarranged and evidently had been slept in but the occupant had risen i didnt think he was a fellow to rise early thought herbert i suppose he is downstairs i might as well get up too herbert jumped out of bed and going to the washstand washed his face and hands he then proceeded to dress i wonder greenleaf didnt wake me up he thought but the reason was too soon made evident happening to put his hand in the pocket where he usually kept his pocketbook he was startled at finding it empty somewhat alarmed he began to hunt round upon the floor thinking it possible that it might have dropped out but his search was vain it was not to be found he then examined carefully the remaining pockets still without success it was not until this moment that a suspicion entered his mind concerning his companion is it possible he thought that greenleaf has been mean enough to strip me of my money herbert did not want to believe this he disliked to think badly of anyone and he still hoped it would prove otherwise it was barely possible that greenleaf had taken his money by way of playing a practical joke upon him and he might now be downstairs waiting to be amused at herberts look of dismay when he discovered that he was penniless drowning men will catch at straws and herbert in his trouble tried to think this was probably the way it had happened greenleaf is rather a hard case according to his own account he said to himself but i cant believe he would be mean enough to rob me i will go downstairs and see if i can find him accordingly leaving his chamber he descended the staircase and made his way to the office herbert went up and spoke to the clerk who chanced to be inside have you seen my roommate he asked what is the number of your room no i remember now he has gone gone echoed herbert in dismay yes didnt you know of it he went away while i was asleep how long since did he go he came to the office two hours since and said he should not require the room any longer did he leave any message for me no did he say where he was going no such an expression of dismay and perplexity overspread herberts face that the clerk could not help observing it is anything wrong he asked yes said herbert he has robbed me of my pocketbook containing all my money whew whistled the clerk how much had you about sixty dollars youre unlucky thats a fact have you nothing left just then it flashed across herberts mind that when he had paid for his supper he had changed a fivedollar bill and placed the balance about four dollars and a half in his vest pocket he at once felt in that pocket and found it still there greenleaf had contented himself with the pocketbook i have a little left he said he paid for his room in advance for another day and went down to breakfast chapter xxiii a business call it was certainly a startling discovery for herbert to make that out of sixty dollars he had only four left now that he had paid for another day at the hotel and this small sum must be further diminished by the expense of a breakfast unfortunately too he was quite hungry for his misfortune had not taken away his appetite i will make a good breakfast at any rate said herbert philosophically afterwards i will consider what to do he ordered a substantial breakfast which even at the low prices of a dozen years ago amounted to fifty cents and did full justice to what was set before him after paying at the desk he went outside it was a bright sunshiny morning and this with the comfortable feeling produced by having eaten a good breakfast gave him courage for the new career upon which he was about to enter while considering what he should do first the thought of the letter given him by mr carroll flashed upon him he felt for it hastily and was rejoiced to find that that was safe at least greenleaf had not taken that away fortunately he looked at the direction it was addressed to messrs godfrey lynn no pearl st it was not sealed and was probably meant to be read by herbert at any rate our hero so concluded and opened the letter not without curiosity as to what mr carroll had written about him he knew it must be favorable of course but found it even more so than he anticipated here it is my dear mr godfrey this letter will be handed you by a young friend of mine by name herbert mason my acquaintance with him has been brief but he has been able by his coolness and bravery to do me a most important service having saved me from being robbed of a large sum of money while acting as my escort from ohio to philadelphia i have talked with him freely about his plans and find that he will reach new york without friends and with a very small sum of money hoping before it is gone to secure a place in some countingroom where he can make an honest living i feel a strong interest in his success and am persuaded that wherever he is placed he will show rare capacity and fidelity i wish it might be in your power to receive him into your own countingroom but of course that must be according to your convenience at any rate may i rely on you to act a friendly part by my young friend and to exert your influence toward procuring him a position elsewhere if you cannot employ him yourself anything that you may have it in your power to do for herbert i shall consider as a favor done to myself i have just left my daughter who with her family is well sincerely your friend james carroll that is a very kind letter thought herbert gratefully i hope it will do me good he decided to call and deliver it the same forenoon if he had not been robbed of nearly the whole of his small capital he would first have gone about the city which was entirely new to him but with less than four dollars between himself and utter destitution he felt that he had no time for sightseeing it was necessary that he should get to work as soon as possible he waited till ten oclock thinking it possible that the heads of the firm might not reach the countingroom till about that time it was now eight oclock only he had two hours therefore to look about him shine yer boots said a ragged urchin approaching with a suggestive look at his soiled shoes it occurred to herbert that it would be best to look as well as possible when visiting godfrey ten cents its too much said herbert thinking how few dimes constituted his entire worldly wealth well five then said the bootblack coming down to his regular price do you get much to do asked our hero some days i get considerable how much do you make pleasant days i makes a dollar but when it rains there aint much to do how much do you have to pay for sleeping six cents six cents repeated herbert in surprise where can you get lodged for that at the lodgin house corner of fulton and nassau streets well thought herbert i neednt starve if i cant get anything better to do i can buy a box of blacking and a brush and set up in business for myself to be sure this would not be an agreeable occupation but herbert was bound to make a living by honest labor if one avenue was closed to him he must enter such as were open to him he could not afford to be particular after his shoes were brushed he crossed the park and walked up broadway it was a wonderful sight to the countrybred boy this gay thoroughfare with its busy and bustling crowds and its throngs of vehicles never ceasing wholly save at the dead hours of night he thought to himself what a quantity of business there must be to do certainly there must be room for one more worker so on the whole the busy scene gave him courage and he sauntered along as cheerfully as if he were not nextdoor to a beggar but at last the time came when he might safely seek out the gentleman to whom he had an introduction being a stranger in the city he had to inquire for pearl street from a policeman who answered his inquiry very civilly he followed the direction and found it at length but the number of which he was in search was not so easily found for he found the street meandered in a very perplexing way so that at times he was not quite sure whether he was still in it or had wandered from his way at last he found the place it was a large solidlooking building of four stories in height there were a number of boxes outside on the sidewalk inside there was a large apartment occupying the entire first floor with the exception of a room in the rear which had been partitioned off for a countingroom the partition was of glass and as he looked from the entrance he could see a couple of high desks and a table is this godfrey lynns he asked of a porter at the entrance yes said the porter i want to see mr godfrey i dont think hes in you can go to the office and inquire accordingly herbert passed down the length of the warehouse and pausing a moment before the door he opened it and entered there were two persons in the office one was a thinfaced man who sat on a high stool at one of the desks making entries apparently in the ledger this was the bookkeeper mr pratt a man with a melancholy face who looked as if he had lived to see the vanity of all things earthly he had a high forehead naturally made still higher by the loss of his front hair apparently he was not a man to enjoy conviviality or to shine on any festive occasion besides mr pratt there was a boy if we may take the liberty of calling him such of about herberts age he was fashionably dressed and his hair was arranged with exceeding care in fact as herbert entered he was examining the set of his necktie in a little handglass which he had taken from his coat pocket not quite suiting him he set himself to rearranging it have you copied that bill thomas asked mr pratt looking up not yet sir you have been long enough about it put back that glass you are quite too much troubled about your appearance yes sir if i didnt look any better than some people said thomas sotto voce i shouldnt look in a glass very often herbert naturally concluded that mr pratt was the man to whom his inquiries should be addressed i would like to see mr godfrey sir he said he is out of the city out of the city repeated herbert disappointed when will he be back nor till day after tomorrow herberts countenance fell in his reduced circumstances he could hardly afford to wait two days at his present rate of expenditure he would be penniless by that time is mr lynn likely to be in soon he asked thinking that perhaps he would do in mr godfreys absence no he is sick at home he may not be here for a week perhaps i can attend to your business he added what is it i think said herbert that i will wait till day after tomorrow if you think mr godfrey will be back then i have a letter for him if its a business letter you had better leave it it is a letter of introduction said herbert i would rather present it in person very well and mr pratt went back to his ledger thomas looked critically at the boy who had a letter of introduction to mr godfrey and said to himself he got his clothes from a country tailor ill bet a hat chapter xxiv finding a boarding place herbert left the countingroom of godfrey lynn not a little depressed in spirits the two days which must elapse before he could see mr godfrey were to him a formidable delay by that time his money would be almost exhausted then suppose which was very probable mr godfrey could do nothing for him immediately but only hold out his promise of future assistance how was he to live in the meantime after all he might have to realize his thought of the morning and join the ranks of the bootblacks that was not a pleasant thought to a boy of his education all labor is honorable to be sure but then some occupations are more congenial than others if greenleaf had not robbed him so basely he could have afforded to wait he felt sore and indignant about that nobody likes to own that he has been victimized but herbert was obliged to confess to himself that such was the case with him he walked about rather aimlessly feeling miserable enough but all at once it occurred to him would it not be cheaper for him to take board by the week in some boardinghouse reckoning up he found that his hotel bill would be three dollars and a half a week while his meals even if he were quite abstemious would make as much more in all seven dollars surely he could be boarded somewhere for less than that in the readingroom of the hotel he found a daily paper and carefully ran his eye down the advertisements for boarders and lodgers the following attracted his attention boarders wanted a few mechanics may obtain comfortable rooms and board at no stanton street at three dollars per week this be it remembered was previous to the war and before the price of board had doubled three dollars a week repeated herbert less than half my present rate of expense i must go at once and secure it he found the way to stanton street and found that no was a shabbylooking house in a shabby neighborhood but he could not afford to be fastidious he accordingly stepped up without hesitation and rang the bell which emitted a shrill sound in reply a middleaged woman with a red handkerchief tied around her head and a broom in her hand opened the door and looked inquiringly at our hero whats wanted she said i saw your advertisement for boarders said herbert yes i advertised in the paper this morning will you let me see your rooms who are you looking for myself i dont know as youll be suited my price is low and i cant give firstclass accommodations for three dollars no i suppose not come up if you would like to see what ive got the interior of the house was shabby like the outside the oilcloth carpet faded and the wall paper torn off in places the stairs too were narrow and uncarpeted all this herbert observed but he could not afford to be critical on the third floor his guide threw open the door of a dark little hall bedroom meagerly furnished i could give you this room by yourself she said or a larger room with someone else i would rather be alone thats the only single room i have will you take it i think so said herbert though he did not anticipate much enjoyment in such a poor place when do you want to come tomorrow morning very well i shall expect a deposit so that i may be sure the room is let how much a dollar will do herbert drew a dollar from his pocket and handed it to mrs morgan for such she informed him was her name then he went downstairs and out into the air again well he said to himself im sure of a home such as it is for a week in that time something must turn up examining his pocketbook he found that he had two dollars and a half left of that sum two dollars must be reserved to pay the balance of his weeks board out of the remaining fifty cents he must pay for his meals until the next morning when he would take possession of his new boarding place he wished that he had proposed to come to breakfast but it was too late now with such a small sum in hand he could not afford to dine on the same magnificent scale as he had breakfasted but he must be rigidly economical he decided that the cheapest food he could buy was a fivecent loaf at some bakers this would probably last him through the day and might prove sufficient for breakfast also since he would take a regular dinner though he doubted from what he had seen of the establishment in stanton street whether it would be a very inviting repast but it was the best he could afford and that was all he need consider late in the afternoon it occurred to herbert to wonder where in the city his uncle stanton lived not that he had any intention of applying to him for assistance even if matters came to a crisis but he felt a natural curiosity as to how his uncle was situated he found the directory readily and turning to the letter s ran down the list of names till he came to stanton benjamin he learned that his uncles store was in the lower part of broadway while his house was in west seventeenth street between fifth and sixth avenues i should like to see what sort of a house uncle benjamin lives in thought herbert there was nothing to prevent his gratifying this wish as he had plenty of time on his hands if he had had more money he would have taken the horse cars but in his present circumstances this would be imprudent he decided as it was only five oclock to take a leisurely walk up broadway noticing his uncles place of business on the way a few minutes brought him in front of the latter an imposinglooking building with all the appearance of belonging to a prosperous merchant appearances are deceitful to be sure and no doubt there are some merchants as outwardly prosperous who might profitably change places with their head clerks but herbert naturally judged from appearances and he could not help contrasting in his mind his own condition with that of his uncles but he was too manly to be despondent on this account and thought rather i am young and ready to work some time if i am patient and work hard i may be as well off as uncle benjamin the thought of applying to him for assistance was as far off as ever he pursued his way uptown finding it a longer walk than he anticipated arriving at halfpast five at union square at the upper end he turned off and went down seventeenth street carefully noting the numbers he at length found his uncles house it was a handsome substantial city mansion and seemed appropriate as the residence of a rich new york merchant so my uncle lives here thought herbert and there rose involuntarily in his mind the memory of the humble western home where he and his mother had struggled against poverty while his uncle who was evidently so amply provided with the worlds goods coldly held aloof and forbore to offer the assistance which he could so well afford if i had a sister i could never treat her like that thought herbert indignantly he would not help my mother i will starve before i ask him to help me he paused a moment on the opposite side of the street to look at his uncles house while he was standing there a boy of about his own age apparently came down the street whistling and ascended the steps of his uncles house i wonder if that is my cousin tom thought herbert he knew the names of his cousins from his mother though he had never seen them while he looked he was struck by something familiar in the appearance of this boy where had he seen him before all at once it flashed upon him it was the same boy he had seen in the countingroom of godfrey he knew him by his dandified dress and his face which he had noticed at the time this was certainly a strange coincidence that his cousin for it was doubtless he should be the first boy he encountered after reaching new york it would be still stranger if mr godfrey should offer him employment and he should find himself a clerk in the same office as the son of his rich uncle but it was by no means certain that he would be lucky enough to obtain such employment therefore there was no need of wondering whether under such circumstances tom would recognize him as a relation herbert walked thoughtfully back and on reaching his room ate the remainder of the loaf which he had purchased at the bakers in the morning it was not a very luxurious repast but his walk had given him an appetite and he had no difficulty in disposing of all that was left chapter xxv getting a situation the next morning herbert reported himself at his new boarding place he found the fare very far from firstclass while his fellowboarders appeared at the table mostly in shirtsleeves and were evidently workingmen our hero would have preferred a greater degree of neatness both in the table and in the guests but he felt that he would be lucky if he should find himself able to pay his expenses even here he was not to be daunted by little annoyances but looked for compensation in the future he waited impatiently for the next day when mr godfrey would return upon the success of the interview with him much depended at length it came and herbert once more set out for the warehouse on pearl street he entered without question and made his way to the countingroom looking through the glass door he saw his cousin whom he surveyed with new interest now that he knew the relationship and the bookkeeper but besides these there was an elderly gentleman rather stout with a pleasant face the expression of which reassured him is mr godfrey in he asked on entering with a look of inquiry at the gentleman just described that is my name what can i do for you said mr godfrey turning towards him i have a letter for you sir said herbert producing it from his pocket mr godfrey held out his hand for it and ran his eye rapidly over its contents so your name is herbert mason he said raising his eyes after finishing it yes sir at the mention of this name tom stanton whose curiosity had led him to listen to the conversation wheeled rapidly round on his stool and surveyed our hero with intense curiosity he knew that herbert mason was the name of his cousin could it be possible that this boy was the cousin whom he had never seen a little later and he was convinced of it you have just come from ohio i suppose yes sir my friend mr carroll writes me that you were instrumental in saving him from being robbed while acting as his escort to philadelphia it wasnt worth mentioning said herbert modestly mr godfrey noticed his modest tone and it pleased him modesty not being an unvarying characteristic of young america my friend refers to it as an important service i should like to know the particulars mr carroll is a connection of mine and i am naturally interested in all that relates to him in reply herbert gave a brief but clear and intelligent account of the attempted burglary passing over his own achievement as lightly as possible but it was easy to infer even from the little he said that he had acted with bravery and selfpossession you behaved in a very creditable manner said mr godfrey approvingly many boys would have lost their selfpossession you have come to new york in search of employment mr carroll writes me yes sir i dont of course know how you were situated in ohio said the merchant but as a general rule i think boys make a mistake in leaving the country for the city here the competition for work is sharp and there is a surplus of laborers in every department of labor still he proceeded scanning herberts earnest face you look like a boy capable of making his way if an opportunity offers you have but little money mr carroll writes i have lost nearly all i had said herbert so that now i have very little left you have met with a loss tell me about it indeed i should be glad if you would confide to me freely your situation and hopes and then i shall be better able to help you i am almost ashamed to tell you how i was taken in said our hero i suppose i ought to have been more prudent he recounted the manner in which greenleaf had robbed him mr godfrey listened with interest and so did tom stanton who burst into a laugh when the narrative was concluded what are you laughing at thomas asked the merchant rather sharply i was thinking how neatly he was taken in said tom a little abashed i should apply a different word to it said mr godfrey it appears to me the height or rather the depth of meanness to take advantage of a boys confidence and defraud him so scandalously how much money have you left herbert forty cents sir only forty cents to begin life with in a great city yes sir i have paid my board in advance for a week where do you board in stanton street tom turned up his nose at the name of this street which he knew was very far from fashionable but this demonstration our hero did not observe what board do you pay three dollars a week sir a poor place probably yes sir but i could afford no better you are sensible to accommodate yourself to circumstances well my young friend it appears that you cant wait long for employment mr carroll has asked me to do something for you and i am disposed to oblige him not wholly for his sake but partly for your own for you seem to me a very modest and sensible boy mr pratt do we need another boy no sir i dont think we do well business will be brisker by and by i think you can find a little for this young man to do in the meantime he can go to the post office and i believe i have a little extra writing to be done pass him a pen and let him give us a specimen of his handwriting fortunately herbert was a handsome writer and this went a considerable way in his favor very neat said the merchant by the way herbert i suppose of course you know nothing of french yes sir i can read it pretty well indeed said mr godfrey surprised then you can be of service to me that is if you know it well enough i received this morning a letter from a silk house at lyons a part of which i dont quite understand the fact is my french is rather poor do you think you could help me translate it if you will show me the letter i will try sir the merchant took a letter from the table before him and handed it to herbert our hero ran his eye rapidly over it and then rendered it into english in a clear and grammatical way bless me youre quite a scholar said mr godfrey i understand now youve made it all plain where did you learn so much french my father taught me sir he also taught me latin indeed i congratulate you on possessing so good an education latin however isnt so much in my way i havent many latin correspondents i suppose not sir said herbert laughing still it does no harm to know something of it tom stanton had listened with considerable surprise mingled with mortification to what had passed it appeared then that his country cousin whom he had looked upon as a country boor was his superior in education and as tom secretly knew in courage and now he was going to be his fellowclerk he felt jealous and angry fearing that herbert who appeared to be high in favor already would eclipse him in the office how much can you live upon economically asked the merchant i know little of the city said herbert you can judge better than i sir you pay three dollars a week board youll need double that amount mr pratt you may pay him six dollars a week he will come to work tomorrow morning and you may pay him saturday as if it was a whole week thank you sir said herbert gratefully you are very kind do your duty my young friend and i shall be satisfied tom stanton listened in indignant surprise he only got four dollars a week and here was a country boy placed over his head he was imprudent enough to give expression to his feelings wont you give me six dollars a week also he said why should i dont i deserve as much as he perhaps you do but i dont give it to herbert because he earns it for it is not likely that he will do so at present but he has no other resources you have a comfortable home and are not obliged to pay for your board out of your wages no i hope not said tom therefore you do not need as much as he does you are not entitled to this explanation but i give it nevertheless that you may know my motives tom did not reply feeling that it would be imprudent to do so but he bent sullenly to his work by no mans satisfied with the explanation he began to feel a dislike for his cousin and determined to injure him if he could in the estimation of the firm it would have been satisfactory if he could have looked down upon him as an inferior but that was not easy i hope the fellow wont find out the relationship between us he said to himself hed be calling me cousin tom all the time and i dont care about owning a cousin that lives in stanton street tom need not have troubled himself herbert had no idea of claiming relationship though as we know he was fully aware of its existence chapter xxvi a family council as soon as he was released from business tom stanton hurried home to impart the unexpected intelligence that his cousin herbert had arrived in the city as might be expected the news gave no particular pleasure in the stanton homestead did you tell him who you were thomas asked his mother catch me doing it said tom i aint quite a fool i dont care about owning any pauper relations he isnt a pauper said mr stanton who hard man of the world as he was could not forget that herbert was the son of his sister hes the next door to it said tom carelessly thomas is right said mrs stanton you may depend upon it mr stanton that when this boy finds you out he will apply to you for assistance possibly he may i hope you wont be such a fool as to encourage him in his application if he were in actual distress my dear said mr stanton i should feel that i ought to do something then youd allow yourself to be imposed upon thats all ive got to say there is no need of his being in distress he is a stout boy and capable of earning his own living he might get sick suggested mr stanton who was not so hardhearted as his wife then let him go to the hospital its provided for such cases is herbert goodlooking asked maria with interest he wont get a prize for his beauty said tom disparagingly is he homely no said tom reluctantly i suppose hell pass but hes countrified he hasnt got any style and he glanced complacently at his own reflection in a mirror for tom was vain of his personal appearance though by no means as goodlooking as herbert in fact he was compelled secretly to confess this to himself and for this reason was more than ever disposed to view his cousin with prejudice i should like to see herbert said maria who had her share of female curiosity and thought it would be pleasant to have a cousin to escort her round perhaps id better invite him round to dinner tomorrow said thomas sarcastically i wish you would thomas will do no such thing said mrs stanton decidedly its my opinion that the less notice we take of him the better your father is in good circumstances to be sure but whatever he is able to do ought of right to go to his own family we dont want any poor relations coming here to get their living out of us just my sentiments mother said tom stanton approvingly it doesnt seem quite right said mr stanton uncomfortably to neglect my sisters child dont make yourself ridiculous with your scruples mr stanton said his wife its the boys duty to take care of himself it would only do him harm and lead to false expectations if we allowed him the run of the house besides said tom i shouldnt want to have tom paget and percy mortimer and other fellows that i associate with ask me who he is and have to tell them that he is my cousin this argument had considerable weight with mr stanton who was anxious to elevate himself in society and looked with complacency upon the school acquaintances tom had formed with the scions of distinguished families well said he rising from the table let it be as you will we wont go out of our way to invite the boy here but if he presents himself as he doubtless will we must take a little notice of him i dont see why he couldnt have stayed in the country said mrs stanton it was the best place for him of course it was said tom he could have had no other object than to seek us out and see what he could get out of us for my part i would advise you to recommend him to go back he has secured a place it seems and would not be likely to give it up its a great pity he should have got into the same countingroom with tom he will presume on the relationship as soon as he finds it out mrs stanton need not have been alarmed for herbert was too highspirited to seek an intimacy where he had reason to think it would be disagreeable but his aunt knew nothing of him and judged him by herself hes there and it cant be helped said mr stanton at any rate if he does stay in the city persisted mrs stanton i hope youll give him to understand that he neednt call here more than once in three months that is as much as he can expect after all he is my sisters son said mr stanton i cant feel that this would be quite kind in us leave it to me then if youre too softhearted mr stanton i will take all the responsibility and the blame if there is any well i think youve said enough on the subject said her husband tom run upstairs and bring me a cigar you know where i keep the cigar box youd better send a servant father said tom coolly it appears to me you are getting lazy thomas said his father thomas is right said mrs stanton what do we keep servants for but to run errands still tom might have obliged me in such a little matter you shouldnt have asked him mr stanton you seem to forget that we are not living in the style of half a dozen years ago you should adapt yourself to circumstances mr stanton said no more but sent a servant in toms place but he could not help thinking that the outward prosperity for which he was striving was not without its drawbacks since it compelled him to look to servants for the most ordinary services the next morning tom went to the countingroom fully expecting that herbert would claim relationship as soon as he discovered his name while he would be compelled to admit it he determined to treat herbert with such a degree of coolness that he would take the hint and keep his distance when he arrived at the countingroom herbert was already there and mr pratt also goodmorning said herbert morning muttered tom this is thomas stanton your fellowclerk said mr pratt the bookkeeper i believe you have not been introduced now for it thought tom but rather to his surprise herbert made no demonstration but merely bowed slightly what does it mean thought tom a little perplexed is it possible that he is not my cousin after all i think you came from ohio inquired tom impelled by his curiosity to ask the question yes said herbert why didnt you stay there couldnt you make a living there asked tom not overpolitely probably i might said herbert quietly then i think you should have stayed there which do you like best the city or the country asked our hero the city so do i but theres a difference i have always lived in the city i suppose boys often do come from the country to the city said herbert was your father born in the city no said tom glancing keenly at herbert to see if he meant anything by the question then it seems he must have preferred the city to the country tom had his share of curiosity he knew that it would be better not to pursue this subject further if he wished his cousin to remain ignorant of the relationship between them still he was anxious to know what herberts actual knowledge was and whether he would be likely to avail himself of it he was therefore tempted to say i suppose you have no relations in the city what makes you think i havent asked herbert looking at tom rather peculiarly i dont think anything about it i only asked said tom a little confused yes i have an uncle in the city said herbert quietly oh indeed said tom he said nothing more for he felt that he might betray his knowledge of the relationship unintentionally herberts manner left him as much in the dark as ever mr pratt set herbert to work on some writing and tom also was soon busy after a while mr godfrey came in goodmorning herbert he said pleasantly offering his hand so mr pratt has set you to work has he yes sir i think we shall find enough for him to do eh mr pratt yes sir i think so said the bookkeeper who perceived that herbert was in favor and it was as well to fall in with his employer thats well how do you like your boarding place herbert it isnt a very nice one sir but it is as good a one as i have a right to expect for the money i pay come round and dine with us tonight said the merchant mrs godfrey will be glad to see you ill give you my street and number thank you sir said herbert i shall be glad to accept your kind invitation tom listened to this invitation with envy mr godfrey occupied a high social position moreover he had a pretty daughter whom he tom had met at dancing school and he would have been very glad to receive the invitation which had been extended to that beggar herbert as he mentally styled him chapter xxvii at the concert herbert felt a little diffident about accepting his employers invitation to dinner brought up in the country in comparative poverty he felt afraid that he should show in some way his want of acquaintance with the etiquette of the dining table but he had a better than ordinary education and having read diligently whatever books he could get hold of possessed a fund of general information which enabled him to converse intelligently then his modest selfpossession was of value to him and enabled him to acquit himself very creditably julia godfrey the merchants only daughter was a lively and animated girl a year or two younger than herbert she had been the belle of the dancing school and tom stanton among other boys had always been proud to have her for a partner she however had taken no particular fancy to tom whose evident satisfaction with himself naturally provoked criticisms on the part of others of this however tom was unconscious and flattered himself that his personal appearance was strikingly attractive and was quite convinced that his elaborate and gorgeous neckties must attract admiration julia awaited the advent of her fathers young guest with interest and her verdict was favorable he was to be sure very plainly dressed but his frank and open face and pleasant expression did not need fine clothes to set them off julia at once commenced an animated conversation with our hero werent you frightened when you saw the robber she asked for her father had told her of herberts adventure with the burglar no said herbert i did not feel afraid how brave you must be said julia with evident admiration there was no need of my being frightened said herbert modestly i was expecting him i know i should have been frightened to death said julia decidedly you are a girl you know said herbert i suppose it is natural for girls to be timid i dont know but it is but i am sure it is not natural to all boys to be brave herbert smiled i was out in the country one day walking with frank percy proceeded julia when a big uglylooking dog met us frank instead of standing by and defending me ran away as fast as his feet could carry him i laughed at him so much about it that he doesnt like to come near me since that how did you escape asked herbert with interest i saw there was no use in running away so i patted him on the head and called him poor dog though i expected every minute he was going to bite me that calmed him down and he went off without doing any harm herbert found mrs godfrey to be a pleasant motherlylooking lady who received him kindly he felt that he should like it very much if she was his aunt instead of mrs stanton whom he had never seen and did not think he should care about meeting what do you think of tom stanton asked julia of course you know him the other boy in pas countingroom i am not very well acquainted with him yet said herbert evasively for he did not care to say anything unfavorable of tom do you know him yes he used to go to the same dancing school with me last winter then you know him better than i do i dont like him much said julia hes always thinking of himself and his neckties he always came to dancing school in a different necktie to let us know how many he had i suppose didnt you notice his necktie it was pretty large i thought said herbert smiling yes hes fond of wearing large ones i am afraid you are talking uncharitably julia said her mother mildly girls you know are sometimes fond of dress so the conversation drifted on to other topics julia at first addressed our hero as mr mason until he requested her to call him herbert a request which she readily complied with they were soon on excellent terms and appeared to be mutually pleased young people said mr godfrey after dinner there is to be an attractive concert at the academy of music this evening i secured seats this morning for four suppose we all go i shall be delighted for one papa said julia you will like to go herbert wont you very much said our hero then you can escort me while papa and mamma walk together herbert felt that this arrangement would be very agreeable so far as he was concerned it was in fact adopted and the four paired off together as julia had suggested julia amusing herbert by her lively remarks entering the hall they followed the usher to their seats which were eligibly located only a few rows back from the stage just behind them sat a party among whom the new arrivals produced quite a sensation not to keep the reader in suspense that party consisted of mr and mrs stanton tom and maria there was but slight acquaintance between the two families as mr godfreys stood higher socially than mr stantons the gentlemen however had a bowing acquaintance and the young people had met at dancing school why theres mr godfrey and his family tom said maria turning towards her brother whos that boy with them julia hasnt got any brother has she tom had watched the entrance of the party with lively dissatisfaction that his beggarly cousin should appear in public on such intimate terms with julia godfrey to whom he himself had paid attention but without any special encouragement struck him as particularly mortifying mr godfreys son he said disdainfully that boy is herbert mason our cousin asked maria with interest ma did you hear she whispered eagerly that boy in front of us is cousin herbert that boy with the godfreys said mrs stanton in surprise yes hes talking with julia now are you sure who told you tom is it true tom yes said tom frowning what could have induced the godfreys to bring him along said mrs stanton who was no better pleased than tom at the social success of the poor relation hes quite goodlooking said maria nonsense said her mother sharply he has a very countrified look the news was communicated to mr stanton who looked with interest at his sisters son whom he had not seen since he was a very young child he fervently wished him back again in ohio where he might conveniently forget his existence here in new york especially since an unlucky chance as he considered it had brought him into the same countingroom as his son it would be difficult to avoid taking some notice of him but so far as pecuniary assistance was concerned mr stanton determined that he would give none unless it was forced upon him had he known our hero better he would have been less alarmed with all his prejudices mr stanton could not help confessing that herbert was a boy of whom any uncle might be proud though plainly dressed he did not seem out of place at a fashionable concert surrounded by welldressed people it must not be supposed that herbert was left in ignorance of the vicinity of the only relations he had in the city theres tom stanton just behind you with his father and mother and sister whispered julia herbert turned his head slightly he was desirous of seeing what his uncle and aunt were like his uncle met his gaze and turned uncomfortably away appearing not to know him yet conscious that in his affected ignorance he was acting shabbily mrs stanton did not flinch but bent a cold gaze of scrutiny upon the unwelcome nephew tom looked supercilious and elevated his pug nose a trifle maria only looked as if she would like to know her cousin it was only a hasty glance on herberts part but it brought him to a rapid conclusion that he would not claim relationship if any advances were made they must come from the other side tom fidgeted in his seat watching with illconcealed vexation the confidential conversation which appeared to be going on between julia and his cousin what she can see in that boor i cant imagine he said to himself moreover though julia had looked around she had not deigned any recognition of himself and this hurt his pride he finally determined to overlook the neglect and address her which he could readily do as he sat almost directly behind her goodevening miss julia he said familiarly bending forward oh goodevening mr stanton said julia coldly just turning slightly herbert isnt that a beautiful song she calls him herbert said tom in scornful disgust i wonder if she knows he is nothing but a beggar how are you enjoying the concert miss julia he continued resolved not to take the rebuff very well said julia by the way she continued with a sudden thought i believe you are acquainted with mr mason herbert upon this bowed pleasantly but tom said in rather a disagreeable tone i know mr mason slightly oh said julia arching her eyebrows i thought you were both in papas countingroom we shall know each other better by and by said herbert smiling tom did not appear to hear this but tried to keep up the conversation with julia desiring to have it appear that they were intimate friends but the young lady gave brief replies and finally turning away devoted herself once more to herbert much to toms disgust in fact what he saw made tom pass a very unpleasant evening and when on their return home maria suggested that julia had taken a fancy to herbert he told her to mind her own business which maria justly considered a piece of rudeness wholly uncalled for chapter xxviii peter greenleaf again notwithstanding he was receiving a salary larger than is usually paid boys of his age herbert felt cramped for the want of money six dollars a week would have paid his expenses comfortably if he had been well provided to begin with but all the clothing he had besides what he wore he had brought with him in a small bundle the greatest part having been left in his trunk at the house of abner holden he often wished that he could have them with him but of course this wish was vain indeed mr holden when the conviction was forced upon him that there was no chance of recovering his bound boy quietly confiscated the trunk and its contents and this to some extent consoled him for the departure of the owner herbert found himself sadly in need of underclothing and of course his only suit from constant wear was likely to deteriorate rapidly he saved all the money he could from his weekly wages toward purchasing a new one but his savings were inconsiderable besides he needed a trunk or would need one when he had anything to put in it if i only had that money greenleaf stole from me i should be all right he said to himself after long and anxious thought on the great question of ways and means i dont see how i can save up more than two dollars a week out of my wages and it will take a long time for that to amount to much there certainly did not appear to be much chance of saving more his boarding place was as cheap as he could obtain or if there were cheaper anywhere they would probably be also poorer and our hero felt that mrs morgans was as poor as he should be able to endure he was rather mortified too at the poverty of his wardrobe mrs morgan asked him one day when is your trunk coming and herbert was obliged to own with some shame that he had none the landlady looked surprised but he had no explanation to offer i suppose i shall have to wait till my wages are raised thought herbert with a little sigh this he reflected would not be very soon as he had started with a salary greater than he was likely to earn as mr godfrey had said but relief was nearer than he anticipated one day as he was walking up the bowery he saw at a little distance in front of him a figure which he well remembered the careless jaunty step and wellsatisfied air were familiar to him in short it was peter greenleaf who had played so mean a trick upon him at the hotel herberts heart beat quick with excitement mingled with pleasure he felt a natural indignation against this young man who had cheated him so remorselessly and left him indifferent to his fate alone and almost penniless in a strange city what should he do close behind him was a policeman slowly pacing his regular round herbert went up to him and pointing to greenleaf rapidly recounted his grievances it was a mean trick said the policeman who was a favorable specimen of his class is this the first time you have seen him yes tell me what you want to do i want to get my money back probably he has spent it how long since he robbed you three weeks not much chance then probably his pockets empty unless hes fleeced somebody else in the meantime however its as well to see what can be done now ill tell you how to act go up to him boldly and demand your money if he bluffs you off call me all right said herbert he hastened his step and advancing tapped greenleaf on the shoulder greenleaf turned when he recognized herbert he looked surprised and disconcerted but he had plenty of assurance and quickly determined upon his course assuming a stolid look he said well my lad who are you and what do you want you know who i am well enough said herbert angrily do i then im uncommonly forgetful i havent any recollection of your interesting countenance he said with a sneer i suppose you dont want to remember me mr greenleaf said herbert greenleaf you are thinking of somebody else my names thompson your name was greenleaf when you stopped with me at frenchs hotel said herbert sturdily youre crazy i fancy said greenleaf shrugging his shoulders i never stopped at the hotel you mention in my life wheres the money you took from me demanded herbert who felt convinced of greenleafs identity in spite of his denial what are you talking about said greenleaf assuming a look of surprise you went off before i was awake with more than fifty dollars of mine do you mean to insult me said greenleaf drawing himself up ive a great mind to knock you over mr greenleaf said herbert firmly either return my money or as much as you have got left or i will call a policeman just what i shall do myself unless you stop this nonsense said greenleaf angrily but not without a sensation of uneasiness as it struck his mind that herbert might really intend to do what he had said once more will you give up that money said herbert firmly stand out of the way said greenleaf if you know what is best for yourself he was about to push by thrusting herbert roughly out of the way when our hero turned and his look summoned the policeman who hastened to the spot give this boy his money he said authoritatively i know all about your little game its up now unless you hand over your plunder you must go with me greenleaf changed color and was evidently alarmed ive got nobodys money except my own he said come along then said the officer taking him by the arm stop a minute said he hurriedly finding that matters had come to a crisis if i give up what i have will you let me go well that depends on how much you have ive got twenty dollars herbert was about to say that this would do but the policeman shook his head wont do said he come along after a little haggling greenleaf produced forty dollars which herbert pocketed with much satisfaction now go along and mind you dont try any more such games greenleaf needed no second permission to be gone he feared that the officer might change his mind and he might after all be consigned to the station house thank you said herbert gratefully i needed the money badly i shouldnt have recovered it but for you take better care of it next time said the officer not unkindly take care not to trust a stranger too easily better take my advice and put it in a savings bank i shall be obliged to use most of it said herbert what i dont need i will put in the bank the recovery of so much of his lost money seemed to herbert quite a lucky windfall he went at once to a trunk store and for five dollars purchased a good durable trunk which he ordered sent home to his lodgings fifteen dollars more he invested in necessary underclothing and this left him onehalf of the money for future use besides this he had six dollars which in three weeks he had saved from his wages with this sum and the articles he had purchased he felt quite rich and returned to the countingroom this happened during the hour given him for dinner in unusually good spirits he had other reasons for encouragement he was getting accustomed to his duties at the countingroom mr godfrey always treated him kindly and had called upon him again that very morning to assist him in translating a french letter complimenting him at the same time upon his scholarship ill do my best thought herbert try and trust thats my motto i think it will bring me success but even while he spoke an unforeseen danger menaced him chapter xxix sparring after the concert tom stanton took even a greater dislike to his cousin than before to say that he was in love with julia godfrey would be rather ridiculous considering his youth even if he had been older tom cared too much about himself to fall in love with another but julia had been a belle among the children of her own age at the dancing school and there was considerable rivalry among the boys or i should perhaps say young gentlemen for the honor of her notice tom desired it because it would give him a kind of distinction among his fellows so though he was not in love with julia he was jealous when she showed favor to anyone else but this feeling was mild compared with that he experienced when julia bestowed her notice upon his penniless cousin that herbert should be preferred to himself he thought not only showed great lack of taste on the part of the young heiress but was a grievous wrong to himself i cant understand how girls can be such fools thought tom as that evening after returning from the concert he surveyed his rather perturbed face in the mirror surmounting his bureau i wouldnt have believed julia godfrey would stoop to notice such a pauper then a cheerful thought came to him perhaps she was only trying to rouse his jealousy he had heard of such things but if so why should she choose such a beggar as herbert to practice her arts upon certainly to an unprejudiced observer such a thought would never have suggested itself the cool indifference with which julia had treated tom did not appear to argue any such feeling as would lead to the attempt to rouse his jealousy but then tom was not an unprejudiced observer and considered his personal attractions such that any girl might appreciate them when he arrived at the countingroom the next morning he found herbert already there indeed our hero was very particular to be punctual in his attendance while tom was generally at least a quarter of an hour behind time i saw you at the concert last evening mason said tom who wanted to get a chance to say something disagreeable yes i was there said herbert you sat in the row just behind us yes i suppose you were never at a concert before not in new york mr godfrey was very kind to take you that was what herbert thought himself but as tom expressed it there was something in his tone which implied a conviction of herberts social inferiority which our hero did not like i have found mr godfrey very kind he said briefly there are not many employers who would invite a boy in your position to a concert with his family said tom i believe my position is the same as yours said herbert nettled i dont see it said tom haughtily will you explain yourself i believe we are both in mr godfreys employ said herbert oh yes so far as that goes but i am the son of a rich man said tom pompously herbert might have replied that he was the nephew of a rich man but he had no disposition to boast of his relationship to his cousins family i dont see that that makes any difference said herbert dont you well i do we are both boys in mr godfreys employ thats true but then he took you out of pity you know toms tone as he said this was very aggravating and herberts face flushed i dont know anything of the sort he retorted no i suppose you dont consider it in that light said tom carelessly but of course it is clear enough to others where would you have been if mr godfrey hadnt given you a place blacking boots probably among the street ragamuffins perhaps i might said herbert quietly if i couldnt have got anything better to do its a very genteel occupation sneered tom i dont think it is said herbert but its an honest one you may have to take it yet perhaps so so may you do you mean to insult me demanded tom haughtily his face flushing i only said to you the same thing you said to me if its an insult on one side it is on the other you seem to forget that our circumstances are very different said tom they are just now so far as money goes i get a larger salary than you tom was very much incensed at this remark being aggrieved by the fact that herbert received more than he i didnt mean that said he of course if mr godfrey chooses to give away money in charity it is none of my business i dont need any charity mr godfrey pays me for my services said herbert if he pays me too liberally now i hope to make it up to him afterward you seemed to be very intimate with julia godfrey last evening said tom unpleasantly i found her very pleasant yes she is very kind to take notice of you i suppose the notice you have taken of me this morning is meant in kindness said herbert thinking his cousin very disagreeable yes of course being in the same countingroom i think it right to take some notice of you said tom condescendingly i am very much obliged to you said herbert sarcastically but theres one piece of advice i should like to give you proceeded tom what is that inquired herbert looking his cousin in the face dont feel too much set up by julia godfreys notice she only took notice of you out of pity and to encourage you if you had been in her own position in society like you for instance yes like me said tom complacently she would have been more ceremonious i thought i would just mention it to you mason or you might not understand it it was only natural that herbert should be provoked by this elaborate humiliation suggested by tom and his cousins offensive assumption of superiority this led him to a retort in kind i suppose that is the reason she took so little notice of you he said tom was nettled at this statement of a fact but he answered in an offhand manner oh julia and i are old friends ive danced with her frequently at dancing school herbert happened to remember what julia had said of his cousin and was rather amused at this assumption of intimacy i am much obliged to you for your information said herbert though i am rather surprised that you should take so great an interest in my affairs oh youre new in the city and i know all the ropes said tom i thought i might as well give you a friendly hint i am lucky in having such a friend said herbert and will take the advice as it was given here the bookkeeper entered and soon after mr godfrey made his appearance i hope you had a pleasant evening herbert he said kindly very pleasant sir thank you said herbert in a very different tone from the one he had used in addressing tom i believe i saw you also at the concert thomas said mr godfrey yes sir said tom i am very fond of music and attend all the firstclass musical entertainments indeed said mr godfrey but this was all the reply he made my daughter insists that i shall invite you to the house again soon said mr godfrey again addressing herbert i am very much obliged to her and to you sir said herbert modestly i shall be very glad to come toms face darkened as he heard this he would have given considerable to receive such an invitation himself but the prospect did not seem very promising mr godfrey must he infatuated he said to himself impatiently to invite such a beggar to his house mason ought to have good sense enough to feel that he is out of place in such a house i wouldnt accept any invitation given out of pity i wonder why tom dislikes me so much thought herbert he certainly takes pains enough to show his feeling would it be different i wonder if he knew that i was his cousin herbert thought of mentioning to mr godfrey that he had recovered threequarters of the money of which he had been robbed it would have been well if he had done so but mr godfrey seemed particularly engaged and he thought it best not to interrupt him chapter xxx an unexpected blow herbert felt happier than usual he had recovered the greater part of his money and thus was relieved from various inconveniences which had resulted from his straitened circumstances he was the more elated at this as it had seemed extremely improbable that the lost money would ever have found its way back to the pocket of its rightful owner then he had a good place and a salary sufficient to defray his modest expenses and the prospect of promotion if he should be faithful to the interests of his employer as he firmly intended to be it was agreeable also to reflect that he was in favor with mr godfrey who had thus far treated him with as much kindness as if he had been his own son there was to be sure the drawback of toms enmity but as there was no good reason for this he would not allow it to trouble him much though of course it would have been more agreeable if all in the office had been his friends he determined to take an early opportunity to write to his good friend dr kent an account of his present position he would have done so before but had hesitated from the fear that in some way the intelligence would reach abner holden whom he preferred to leave in ignorance of all that concerned him these thoughts passed through herberts mind as he went about his daily work meanwhile a painful experience awaited him for which he was not in the least prepared about one oclock a gentleman entered the countingroom hastily and said mr godfrey i wonder whether i happened to leave my pocketbook anywhere about your office when i was here an hour ago i dont think so when did you miss it a few minutes since i went to a restaurant to get a lunch and on finishing it felt for my pocketbook and found it gone was there much in it no sum of any consequence between twenty and thirty dollars i believe there were however some papers of value which i shall be sorry to lose i hardly think you could have left it here however i will inquire mr pratt have you seen anything of mr waltons pocketbook no sir said the bookkeeper promptly herbert have you seen it no sir said our hero thomas tom stanton was assailed by a sudden and dangerous temptation his dislike to herbert had been increased in various ways and especially had been rendered more intense by the independent tone assumed by our hero in the conversation which had taken place between them that very morning now here was an opportunity of getting him into disgrace and probably cause him to lose his situation true he would have to tell a falsehood but tom had never been a scrupulous lover of truth and would violate it for a less object without any particular compunction he hesitated when the question was asked him and thus as he expected fixed mr godfreys attention why dont you answer thomas he said in surprise i dont like to said tom artfully why not demanded his employer suspiciously because i dont want to get anybody into trouble speak out what you mean if you insist upon it said tom with pretended reluctance i suppose i must obey you of course if any wrong has been done it is your duty to expose it then sir said tom i saw mason pick up a wallet from the floor and put it in his pocket just after the gentleman went out he did it so quickly that no one probably observed it but myself herbert listened to this accusation as if stunned it was utterly beyond his conception how anyone could be guilty of such a deliberate falsehood as he had just listened to so he remained silent and this operated against him herbert said mr godfrey mildly for he was unwilling to believe our hero guilty of intentional dishonesty you should have mentioned having found the pocketbook so i would sir said herbert having found his voice at last if i had found one do you mean to say that you have not demanded mr godfrey with a searching look yes sir said herbert firmly what then does thomas mean when he asserts that he saw you do so i dont know sir i think he means to injure me as i have noticed ever since i entered the office that he seems to dislike me how is that thomas do you again declare that you saw herbert pick up the wallet i do said tom boldly of course i expected that he would deny it i leave it to you sir if he does not show his guilt in his face just look at him now it unfortunately for herbert happened that his indignation had brought a flush to his face and he certainly did look as a guilty person is supposed to do mr godfrey observed this and his heart sank within him for unable to conceive of such wickedness as toms he saw no other way except to believe in herberts guilt have you nothing to say herbert he asked more in sorrow than in anger no sir said herbert in a low voice nothing except what i have already said tom has uttered a wicked falsehood and he knows it of course i expected you would say that said tom with effrontery this is a serious charge herbert proceeded mr godfrey i shall have to ask you to produce whatever you have in your pockets certainly sir said our hero calmly but as he spoke it flashed upon him that he had in his pocket twentysix dollars and the discovery of this sum would be likely to involve him in suspicion he could indeed explain where he got it but would his explanation be believed under present circumstances he feared that it would not so it was with a sinking heart that he drew out the contents of his pockets and among them his own pocketbook is that yours asked mr godfrey turning to mr walton no it is not but he may have transferred my money to it upon this hint mr godfrey opened the pocketbook and drew out the small roll of bills which he proceeded to count twentysix dollars he said how much did you lose between twenty and thirty dollars i cannot be sure how much here are two tens and three twos i had two tens i dont remember the denomination of the other bills even tom was struck with astonishment at this discovery he knew that his charge was groundless yet here it was substantiated in a very remarkable manner was it possible that he had after all struck upon the truth of the matter he did not know what to think herbert said his employer sorrowfully this discovery gives me more pain than i can express i had a very high idea of you i could not have believed you capable of so mean a thing as deliberate dishonesty i am not guilty said herbert proudly how can you say this in the face of all this evidence do you mean to say that this money is yours i do said herbert firmly where could you have got it said his employer incredulously did you not tell me when you entered my employ that you were almost penniless you have been with me three weeks only and half your wages have been paid for board yes sir you are right what explanation then can you offer your case looks bad the six dollars i saved from my wages at the rate of two dollars a week the twenty dollars is a part of the money i was robbed of i succeeded in recovering forty dollars of it yesterday here herbert related the circumstances already known to the reader a likely story said tom scornfully be silent thomas said mr godfrey your story does not seem probable he proceeded speaking to herbert it is true sir said our hero firmly what could he have done with your wallet however said the merchant turning to mr walton he has been out to the post office since said tom he might have thrown it away this unfortunately for herbert was true he had been out and of course could have disposed of the wallet in the way mentioned i dont know what to think mr walton said mr godfrey im afraid the boys guilty im afraid so i dont care so much for the money if he will give me back the papers i cant do it sir said herbert for i never had them what shall we do the other boy declares that he saw this one take the wallet from the floor where i probably dropped it it seems to me that settles the matter i am afraid it does once more herbert will you confess asked mr godfrey i can only say sir that i am innocent mr walton what shall we do let the boy go i will leave it to his honor to return me the papers and he may keep the money i think he will make up his mind to do so by tomorrow you hear herbert said mr godfrey while this matter remains in doubt you cannot retain your situation thank you mr walton for your indulgence said herbert but i am sorry you think me guilty the truth will some time appear i shall try to do my duty and trust to god to clear me he took his hat and left the countingroom with a heavy heart feeling himself in disgrace i had great confidence in that boy walton said mr godfrey even now i can hardly believe him guilty chapter xxxi mr stanton is surprised while the events recorded in the last chapter were taking place in mr godfreys countingroom another and a different scene took place at the office of mr stanton he had just finished reading the morning paper and as it slipped from his hand his thoughts turned transiently to the nephew whose persistent failure to claim relationship puzzled him not a little he was glad not to be called upon for money of course still he felt a little annoyed at herberts reticence especially as it left him unable to decide whether our hero knew of the tie which connected them it was scarcely possible to suppose that he did not but in that case why did he not make some sign the truth did suggest itself to mr stantons mind that the boy resented his cold and indifferent letter and this thought made him feel a little uncomfortable while he was thinking over this subject one of his clerks entered the office a gentleman to see you mr stanton he said briefly mr stanton raised his head and his glance rested on a tall vigorous man of perhaps thirtyfive years of age who closely followed the clerk the strangers face was brown from exposure and there was a certain appearance of unconventionality about his movements which seemed to indicate that he was not a dweller in cities or a frequenter of drawingrooms but accustomed to make his home in the wilder haunts of nature in brief for there is no occasion for mystery mr stantons visitor was ralph the ranger who had assisted herbert from the clutches of abner holden mr stanton gazed at the stranger with some curiosity but was unable to recognize him have you any business with me he asked yes said the visitor in a voice whose depth carried with it an assurance of strength state it then as briefly as possible said the merchant with a little asperity for there was not as much deference in the manner of the other as he thought there should have been like most new men he was jealous of his position and solicitous lest he should not be treated with due respect i will do so said the stranger but as it cannot be summed up in a sentence i will take the liberty of seating myself as he spoke he sat down in an office chair which was placed not far from that in which mr stanton was sitting my time is valuable said the merchant coldly i cannot listen to a long story as the visitor was plainly if not roughly dressed he suspected that he desired pecuniary assistance on some pretext or other and that his story was one of misfortune intended to appeal to his sympathies had such been the case there was very little prospect of help from mr stanton and that gentleman already enjoyed in anticipation the pleasure of refusing him dont you know me demanded ralph abruptly mr stanton did not anticipate such a commencement it had never occurred to him to suppose that his rough visitor was one whom he had ever before met no he said i never saw you before ralph smiled a little bitterly so i have passed entirely out of your remembrance have i he said well it is twelve years since we met twelve years repeated mr stanton he scanned the strangers face with curiosity but not a glimmer of recollection came to him i dare say i met many persons at that distance of time whom i cannot remember in the least now even by name i think you will remember my name said ralph quietly your memory of ralph pendleton cannot be wholly obliterated mr stanton started and it was evident from the expression of his face that the memory was not a welcome one are you ralph pendleton he asked in an undecided voice yes but not the ralph pendleton you once knew then i was an inexperienced boy now i am a man yes you have changed considerably said mr stanton uncomfortably where have you kept yourself all these years why have you not made yourself known before before i answer these questions i must refer to some circumstances well known to both of us i hope i shall not be tiresome i will at least be brief you were my fathers friend at least he so considered you i was so when he died as i had not yet attained my majority he left you my guardian yes i was in rather an idle frame and being possessed as i supposed of fifty thousand dollars i felt no necessity impelling me to work you gave me no advice but rather encouraged me in my idle propensities when i was of age i took a fancy to travel and left my property in your hands with full power to manage it for me this trust you accepted well this is an old story an old one but it shall not be a long one my income being sufficient to defray my expenses abroad i traveled leisurely with no thought for the future in your integrity i had the utmost confidence imagine then my dismay when while resident in paris i received a letter from you stating that owing to a series of unlucky investments nearly all my money had been sunk and in place of fifty thousand dollars my property was reduced to a few hundreds it was unlucky i admit said mr stanton moving uneasily in his chair my investments were unlucky as it turned out but the best and most judicious cannot always foresee how an investment will turn out besides i lost largely myself so you wrote me said ralph quietly however that did not make it any the easier for me to bear perhaps not but it shows at any rate that i took the same risk for my own money that i did for others ralph proceeded without noticing this remark what made matters worse for me was that i had fallen in love with a young american lady who with her parents was then traveling in europe my circumstances as i supposed them to be justified me in proposing marriage i was accepted by the young lady and my choice was approved by the parents when however i learned of my loss of fortune i at once made it known and that approval was withdrawn the father told me that under the altered circumstances the engagement must be considered broken still he held out the prospect that should i ever again obtain a property as large as that i had lost i might marry his daughter she on her part promised to wait for me well i came to new york received from you the remnant of my lost fortune and sailed the next week for california then just open to american enterprise the most glowing stories were told of fortunes won in an incredibly short time having no regular occupation and having a strong motive for acquiring money it is not surprising that i should have been dazzled with the rest and persuaded to make the journey to the land of gold a quixotic scheme as i thought at the time said mr stanton coldly for one that succeeded there were fifty who failed you had better have taken the clerkship i offered you you are wrong said ralph composedly there were many who were disappointed but i was not among the number did you succeed asked mr stanton surprised so well answered the other that at the end of two years residence i found myself as rich as i had ever been had you made fifty thousand dollars demanded the merchant in amazement i had what did you do why did you not let me know of your success when i once more found myself possessed of a fortune i took the next vessel home with my money i had but one thought and that was to claim the hand of my promised bride who had promised to wait for me ten years if necessary well i found her married said ralph bitterly she had forgotten her promise or had been overpersuaded by her parents i do not know which and had proved false to me that was unfortunate but do you still possess the money i do indeed i congratulate you said mr stanton with suavity and he held out his hand which ralph did not appear to see ralph pendleton rich was a very different person from ralph pendleton poor and it occurred to him that he might so far ingratiate himself into the favor of his former ward as to obtain the charge of his second fortune he saw that it would be safe as well as politic to exchange his coldness for a warm and cordial welcome proceed with your story he said i am quite interested in it chapter xxxii risen from the dead ralph pendleton proceeded this blow overwhelmed me all that i had been laboring for seemed suddenly snatched from me you had your money suggested mr stanton yes i had my money but for money itself i cared little mr stanton shrugged his shoulders a little contemptuously he could not understand how anyone could think slightingly of money and he decided in his own mind that ralph was an unpractical enthusiast i valued money only as a means to an end and that end was to make margaret lindsay my wife she failed me and my money lost its charm there were plenty who could have consoled you in her place no doubt i might have been successful in other quarters but i did not care to try i left new york in disgust and going west i buried myself in the forest where i built a rude cabin and there i have lived since an unsocial solitary life years have passed since i visited new york what did you do with your money all this while i left it in the hands of men whom i could trust it has been accumulating all these years and i find that the fifty thousand dollars have swelled to ninety thousand indeed ejaculated mr stanton his respect for ralph considerably raised and now you have come here to enjoy it i suppose a different motive has led to my coming a motive connected with you said ralph fixing his eyes steadily upon mr stanton connected with me repeated the merchant uneasily yes may i ask in what manner i expected the question and am come to answer it when i returned from europe impoverished you gave me a brief statement of the manner in which you had invested my fortune and showed me how it had melted away like snow before the sun you remember rightly i bought on your account shares in lake superior mining company which promised excellently and bade fair to make handsome returns but it proved to be under the management of knaves and ran quickly down from par to two per cent at which price i thought best to sell out considering that a little saved from the wreck was better than nothing this is according to the statement you made me said ralph quietly i am sure said mr stanton that no one regretted more than i do the disastrous result indeed i had reason to do so for i was myself involved and suffered considerable loss i am aware now that you were concerned in the matter said ralph significantly what do you mean asked mr stanton quickly detecting something peculiar in his tone i will tell you you were right in denouncing the management as knavish the company was got up by knaves on a basis of fraud and was from the first intended as a trap for the unwary but there is one important circumstance which you have neglected to mention what is that asked mr stanton in a voice which strove to be composed i mean this said ralph firmly that you yourself were the prime originator of the company that you engineered it through to the end that you invested my money with the express intention of converting it to your own profit i charge you with this that all or nearly all the property i lost went into your pocket the color came and went in mr stantons face he seemed staggered by this sudden and unexpected accusation and did not at first make reply feeling forced to speak at last he said this is very strange language mr pendleton it is unexpected no doubt for after all these years you probably thought it would remain forever unknown but in what respect is it strange i have given you a statement of facts as directly as i could they are not facts your charge is wholly false said the merchant but his tone was not that of a man who speaks the truth boldly i wish i could believe it said ralph i wish i could believe that i was not deliberately swindled by one who professed to be my fathers friend on what authority do you bring this monstrous charge demanded mr stanton more boldly how happens it that you have not made it before for the simple reason that i myself did not suspect any fraud i presumed that it was as you stated to me and that your only fault was your injudicious investment well i admit that as it turned out the investment was injudicious everything else i deny your denial is vain you cannot prove the truth of what you say so you fall back on that but you are mistaken i can prove the truth of what i say said ralph firmly how do you remember a man named david marston he is dead said mr stanton hastily so you have supposed said ralph but you were deceived he is not dead i only encountered him a week since quite by accident in my western home he was your confidential clerk you remember and fully acquainted with all your business transactions at the time of which i am speaking from him i learned how basely i had been deceived and with what deliberate cruelty you conspired to rob the son of your dead friend i dont believe david marston is alive said mr stanton hoarsely with a certain terror in his face indeed i have proof that he is dead i know the character of your proof a paper was forwarded to you from australia whither you had sent him containing the record of his death yes what have you to say against this that the publication was a mistake he was dangerously sick and it was falsely announced that he was dead that notice was sent to you and you believed it to be true i believe it now said mr stanton doggedly why should i not if you wish to be convinced proof is at hand wait a moment ralph pendleton rose from his seat and left the countingroom two minutes had not passed when he returned with an elderly man thin of face and wasted in figure looking twenty years older than mr stanton though really of about the same age this is david marston said ralph the living proof that i have told you the truth mr stanton gazed at him wildly for to him it was as the face of one risen from the dead how do you do mr stanton said david marston humbly it is many many years since we met sir are you really david marston demanded mr stanton never taking his eyes off the shrunken figure of his old clerk i am sir greatly changed indeed but still the david marston who was formerly in your employ time hasnt treated me as well as it has you sir ive been unlucky and aged fast i am afraid your mind is also affected you have been telling strange stories to mr pendleton here true stories sir said david firmly come come how much is he going to give you for this evidence of yours stop mr stanton you insult us both said ralph pendleton sternly i am not the man to buy false evidence nor is david marston the man to perjure himself for pay david i want you in mr stantons presence to make a clear statement of his connection with the mining company by which i lost my fortune david marston obeyed and in a few words as possible unfolded the story it is not necessary to repeat it here enough that it fully substantiated the charge which ralph had brought against his early guardian when he had finished ralph said you can judge what weight marstons testimony would have before a court of justice and whether it would help your commercial standing to have his story made public what is it you want of me said mr stanton sullenly i want restitution dollar for dollar of my lost money i will waive interest though i might justly claim it but were it all paid interest and principal the wrong would not be redressed you cannot restore the bride who would have been mine but for your villainy how much time will you give me to pay this money asked the merchant moodily ten days it is a short time it must suffice do you agree i must bind yourself to that and for ten days i leave you free satisfactory security was given that the engagement would be met and ralph pendleton left the countingroom but his countenance was scarcely more cheerful than that of the man he had conquered i am rich he said to himself but of what avail is it whom can i benefit with my wealth this thought had scarcely crossed his mind when he came face to face with herbert walking with a sad and downcast face in the opposite direction chapter xxxiii a friend in need herbert left mr godfreys countingroom very much depressed in spirits but an hour before he had rejoiced in his excellent prospects and depending on the favor of his employer and his own fidelity had looked forward to a bright future now all was changed he was dismissed from his situation in disgrace suspected of a mean theft he had to be sure the consciousness of innocence and that was a great deal he was not weighed down by the feeling of guilt at least still his prospects were dark suppose the matter should not be cleared up and he should still remain under suspicion how could he hope to obtain another place without a recommendation from his late employer no he must resign all hope of a position and adopt some street occupation such as selling papers or vending small articles in a basket as he had seen boys of his own age doing he did not doubt but that in some way he could get a living but still he would be under suspicion and that was hard to bear while these things were passing through his mind he walked down broadway with his eyes fixed upon the sidewalk all at once he started to hear his name called and looking up to his unbounded astonishment he saw before him ralph the ranger whom he had supposed a thousand miles away in his cabin in the ohio woods the sight of a friendly face was most welcome to him at such a time and ralphs face was friendly ralph he exclaimed seizing the rangers hand how did you come here when did you arrive you are the last person i expected to see and you are the one i most wanted to see said ralph his tone unconsciously softened by his friendly interest in the boy before him i can say the same ralph said herbert soberly for i am in trouble in trouble boy i am sorry for that is it money i can get you out of that trouble it is not that exactly ralph if you will come into the city hall park and sit down on a bench with me i will tell you all about it instead of that let us go into the astor house said ralph it is where i am stopping you are stopping at the astor house said herbert in momentary surprise perhaps you do not know that there are cheaper hotels shall i direct you to one no herbert i am not poor as you perhaps think i suppose i should be called rich but that i can explain afterwards for the present your affairs require attention come in they went up the steps of the astor house and ralph led the way to his room an apartment of good size and handsomely furnished now herbert take a chair and tell me all he said to repeat herberts story here is unnecessary ralph listened with attention and when it was concluded he said the main thing is to account for the money in your possession do you think you should remember the policeman who aided you in recovering your money i am sure i should did he know how much money you recovered yes for he saw me count the bills then we must seek him out and induce him to go with us to mr godfreys countingroom and give his testimony i never thought of that said herbert his face brightening when shall we go now i have nothing else to occupy me and the sooner you are righted the better they went out together and made their way at once to the spot where herbert had encountered greenleaf they had to wait but a brief time when the policeman came up do you remember me asked herbert going up to him yes he replied you are the boy that overhauled a thief the other day and got back his money you see he remembers said herbert with satisfaction my friend said ralph when will you be off duty in half an hour said the policeman in surprise in half an hour then i want you to go with me to this boys employer and repeat your story the possession of the money has caused him to be suspected and your evidence confirming his own will clear him of having obtained it improperly i will go said the officer and shall be glad to get him out of a scrape it was all fair and aboveboard and ill say so cheerfully at the end of the half hour the three made their way to mr godfreys place of business and entered together mr godfrey marked their entrance with surprise and looked inquiringly at herbert mr godfrey said herbert respectfully i have come to prove to you that the money i have in my pocketbook is my own i shall be very glad if you can do so said mr godfrey and it was evident from his manner that he spoke sincerely this officer knows all the circumstances and will tell you what he knows the policeman made his statement partly in answer to questions from mr godfrey the explanation is satisfactory said mr godfrey and convinces me it does not however absolutely clear you since between the time of the money being lost and your being searched you went out to the post office and you might have disposed of the pocketbook and its contents on the way herberts countenance fell but mr godfrey hastened to add although your vindication is not complete i will say that i believe you fully and will receive you back into my employ you have forgotten one thing sir said herbert thomas declares that he saw me pick up the wallet and put it in my pocket so i did said tom boldly mr godfrey looked perplexed and was hesitating what to say when mr walton the owner of the lost pocketbook hurriedly entered mr godfrey he said i have to beg your pardon and most of all the pardon of this boy indicating herbert i have found my pocketbook i didnt lose it here but my pocket was picked in the street the pickpocket was arrested and the wallet has been returned to me this boy is innocent i am very glad to hear it said mr godfrey with emphasis herbert i will try to make amends to you for my transient suspicions of your honesty as for you he continued turning to thomas and speaking sternly i despise you for your mean attempt to injure your fellowclerk you must leave my employment today i shall write to your father the reasons for dismissing you i can get along without your paltry four dollars a week said tom with bravado i am not a beggar you may be something worse if you do not amend said mr godfrey mr pratt you may pay him for the entire week and he can go at once although tom professed so much disdain for the four dollars a week he did not decline the weeks pay directed to be paid to him but placed the money in his vest pocket and went out with assumed nonchalance though in reality deeply mortified at the unexpected discovery of his meanness as for you herbert said mr godfrey you can come back at once and i will raise your pay to eight dollars a week i owe you some reparation for the injury you came so near suffering i will never again doubt your integrity thank you sir said herbert i shall be glad to come back before this matter is decided said ralph i have a proposition to make to herbert i am rich and have no one to share or inherit my wealth i propose to adopt him to give him an opportunity to complete his education in europe whither i propose going and if some years hence you shall be willing to receive him he can then enter your countingroom to learn business the amount of compensation will be unimportant as i shall provide for him amply herbert stared at ralph in amazement he could hardly realize that the offer was indeed a genuine one do you mean that i am to go to europe with you ralph he said yes if you like i shall like it very much said herbert enthusiastically how can i thank you for so much generous kindness your companionship will cheer me and give me something to live for herbert said ralph through you i hope some day to enjoy life again herberts clasped the rangers hand in impulsive gratitude while his face beamed with pleasure i congratulate you herbert said mr godfrey kindly though i am sorry to lose you whenever your guardian is ready to have you enter on a business career a place in my countingroom shall be open to you ralph said herbert seriously as they went from the countingroom in company all that has happened seems so wonderful that i am a little afraid i shall wake up to find it all a dream it is a change to me also said ralph to have a new interest in life the past is a sealed book let us look forward to a bright and pleasant future whatever pleasures and advantages money can obtain for you shall be yours thank you said herbert gratefully chapter xxxiv conclusion where are you boarding herbert asked ralph in stanton street i shall wish you at once to remove to the astor house in order that we may be together until we sail for europe to this pleasant arrangement herbert made no opposition he found it a great change from the dirty and slipshod boardinghouse to the elegant arrangements of a firstclass hotel it is needless to say that he enjoyed that change not a little he often had the feeling of which he had spoken to ralph that it was a dream from which he would some time awake but the dream was destined to be a pretty long one within a week much against his will mr stanton paid over to ralph pendleton the fifty thousand dollars of which he had years ago defrauded him and thus the ranger found himself master of a fortune of nearly one hundred and fifty thousand dollars he settled without delay a comfortable annuity on david marston the old clerk through whose evidence he had been able to ferret out the treachery of mr stanton marston needed it for his health was broken down and he was an invalid prematurely old he is now settled in a comfortable boardinghouse in clinton street and usually spends his mornings at the mercantile library readingroom in astor place reading the morning papers sometimes he ventures downtown and takes a slow walk through the streets crowded with busy bustling men and recalls the years when he too was one of them before sailing for europe herbert expressed a desire to repay his uncle the sum of ten dollars which the latter had sent to him ralph was surprised when he learned that this uncle of whom herbert spoke was the same man who had been his former guardian he approved our heros determination and one morning herbert entered for the first time his uncles place of business is mr stanton in he asked of a clerk the clerk in reply pointed to the office herbert entered his uncle looked up but although he had seen our hero at a concert at the academy of music he did not recognize him in the new and fashionable suit which ralph had purchased for him mr stanton i suppose said herbert with quiet selfpossession yes do you wish to speak with me i must introduce myself said herbert i am herbert mason your nephew indeed said mr stanton surprised when did you come to the city some weeks since what brought you here i had my living to make i preferred to make it in the city the city is crowded you had better have remained in the country i do not think so said herbert you could have got a place on a farm and in time perhaps might have bought a little land for yourself herbert smiled i did get a place on a farm he said but i did not like it what are you doing in the city have you got a place not at present so i supposed said his uncle frowning i told you the city was overcrowded you should not have come here i suppose you relied on me to help you to something but i have my own family to take care of and my first duty is to them as you must be aware i dont think you quite understand my object in calling said herbert quietly i have not come for assistance of any kind indeed returned mr stanton appearing to be puzzled you sent me ten dollars in a letter to dr kent some months since yes i felt that it was best for you to depend on yourself and that more would only encourage you to idleness i have come to thank you for the loan said herbert emphasizing the last word and to return the money what exclaimed mr stanton now thoroughly amazed herbert repeated his former words but i dont understand this you are out of a place yet you do not need this money no i do not need it this was certainly astonishing and mr stanton gazed at his nephew as if he did not know what to make of it what are your plans he asked what are you going to do i sail for europe next week said herbert enjoying his uncles surprise sail for europe ejaculated mr stanton scarcely believing his ears yes i am to go to school there and shall probably remain three or four years you are trifling with me said his uncle irritably how can you go to europe without money herbert felt that the time had come for an explanation a friend he said kindly undertakes to pay all my expenses i go with him who is your friend mr ralph pendleton i believe you know him ralph pendleton repeated mr stanton in renewed surprise how did you become acquainted with him the farmer with whom i was placed in ohio illtreated me ralph lived near by and helped me to run away mr stanton made no comment indeed his surprise was such that he knew not what to say his friendless and penniless nephew as he had regarded him was about to share advantages which he would gladly have obtained for his own son when that evening at home he told his family of herberts good fortune tom was filled with bitter envy if it had been any other boy he would have cared less but for that begger herbert to go to europe in charge of a man of wealth was very mortifying to his pride mr stanton made a faint protest against receiving the ten dollars tendered by his nephew but herbert was determined to repay it he placed it on the desk and eventually mr stanton placed it in his pocketbook after some reflection finding his nephew very differently situated from what he had supposed mr stanton with the concurrence of his wife whose opinion also had been changed sent an invitation to ralph and herbert to dine with them previous to their sailing for europe herbert by his new guardians direction returned a polite reply to the effect that they were too busy in making preparations for their departure to accept the invitation ralph did not feel like sitting as the guest of a man who had cruelly defrauded him and had only done him justice when he was actually compelled to do so in due time our hero sailed for europe with mr ralph pendleton they divided their time between paris and berlin herbert studying at both places with his natural good abilities he made rapid progress and at the end of four years was an accomplished scholar able to speak both french and german with facility in watching his progress ralph pendleton found a new and fresh interest in life he recovered from his old morbid feeling and became cheerful and happy on returning to new york herbert who felt that he should enjoy a life of business better than a professional career entered the countingroom of mr godfrey at twentyone the junior partner retiring he was received as partner in his place his guardian ralph pendleton purchasing an interest for him at a cost of fifty thousand dollars he developed good business abilities and bid fair to swell this sum in time to a large fortune there is a prospect that he will in time sustain a closer relation to his senior partner as it is rumored that julia godfrey now a brilliant young belle prefers her fathers young partner to any of the crowd of young men who pay her court the other characters in our story demand a few closing words first for mr stanton it might have been the sudden withdrawal of the fifty thousand dollars from his business that embarrassed him at any rate from that time nothing prospered with him he met with loss after loss until in a time of financial panic he failed he saved but a little from the wreck of his fortune that little started him in a modest business yielding him perhaps onetenth his former income the brownstone house was sold he moved into a shabby house in an obscure street where mrs stanton spends her time mostly in bewailing the loss of her former splendor tom developed habits of extravagance and seemed indisposed to work steadily finally when his reverses came his father was compelled to refuse further assistance and now tom in an inferior clerkship on a small salary gazes with envy at his oncedespised cousin with whom he has completely changed places how he will come out eventually is doubtful unless he changes considerably it is not likely that his circumstances will ever be much better than at present abner holden died suddenly last year in a fit of delirium tremens his habits of intemperance grew upon him until they led to this sad result his death did not excite any very prolonged grief in the community as his temper and uncertain honesty had made him very far from popular to the housekeeper who had been kind to him herbert sent a valuable silk dress of the richest fabric of which mrs bickford is very proud she only wears it on great occasions and then is particular to mention that it was presented to her by herbert mason of the great new york firm of godfrey mason who was once abner holdens bound boy nor was herbert forgetful of his good friends the kents he paid off the mortgage on the doctors place and insisted on putting the house in thorough repair and newly furnishing it so that now the town of waverley does not contain a handsomer house inside and out than that of dr kent so we bid farewell to our young hero fairly launched on a prosperous career trusting that his lifepath may be bright to the end and that he may leave behind him at the end of his career the reputation of a noble and honorable merchant and a life filled with good deeds the end
