 deadspeak brian lumley book of the necroscope series gasping his shock his horror feeling his blood running cold in his veins laverne tremblingly held out the torch over the trench his disbelieving eyes took in the bed of spikes and the figure of his friend crucified and worse upon them george vulpe squirmed there impaled through his body and all his limbs his lifes blood was pumping from each dark wound staining the rusty spikes flowing in thickly converging streams around and between his twitching feet and down towards the stone spout beneath that spout as the first of the scarlet rain slopped and spattered the black urn began to belch puffs of vapour issued like smoke rings from its obscene clay mouth black slime bubbling up from within blistered on the cold rim like congealing tar and as vulpes blood was consumed so something formed and expanded within the urn like some monstrous alchemical catalyst his blood transformed the dust of the centuried thing which was within prologue harry keogh a rйsumй and chronology necroscope christened harry snaith in edinburgh harry is the son of a psychic sensitive mother mary keogh and gerald snaith a banker harrys father dies of a stroke the following year and in the winter of his mother marries again this time choosing for a husband a russian by the name of viktor shukshin like marys mother before him shukshin has fled the ussr a supposed dissident which perhaps accounts for marys initial attraction to him in what will soon become an unmitigated mismatch winter of harrys mother is murdered by shukshin at bonnyrig outside edinburgh where he drowns her under the ice of a frozen river he alleges that while skating she crashed through a thin crust and was washed away there was nothing he could do to save her he is distraught almost out of his mind with grief and horror mary keoghs body is never found shukshin inherits her isolated bonnyrig house and the not inconsiderable monies left to her by her first husband within six months the infant harry has gone to live with an uncle and his wife at harden on the northeast coast of england the arrangement is more than satisfactory to shukshin who could never stand the child harry commences schooling with the roughneck children of the colliery village a dreamy introspective sort of child he is a loner develops few friendships and thus falls easy prey to bullying and the like and as he grows towards his teens so his daydreaming spirit psychic insight and instincts lead him into further conflict with his teachers but he is not lacking in grit on the contrary harrys problem is that he has inherited his maternal forebears mediumistic talents and that they are developed in him to an extraordinary degree he has no requirement for real friends as such because the many friends he already has are more than sufficient and willing to supply his needs as to who these friends are they are the myriad dead in their graves up against the school bully harry defeats him with the telepathic assistance of an exexarmy physical training instructor a man who before the fall from sea cliffs which killed him was expert in many areas of selfdefence punished with mathematical homework harry receives help from an exheadmaster of the school but in this he almost gives himself away his current maths teacher is the son of harrys coach who lies at rest in harden cemetery and as such he very nearly recognizes his fathers hand in harrys work in harry passes examinations to gain entry into a technical college at west hartlepool a few miles down the coast and in the course of the next five years until the end of his formal education does his best to tone down use of his talents and extraordinary skills in an attempt to prove himself a normal average student except in one field knowing that he will soon need to support himself he has taken to writing even by the time he finishes school he has seen several short pieces of fiction in print his tutor is a man once moderately famous for his vivid short stories who has been dead since but this is just the beginning under a pseudonym and before he is nineteen harry has already written his first fulllength novel diary of a seventeenthcentury rake while falling short of the bestseller lists still the book does very well it is not so much a sensation for its storyline as for its amazing historical authenticity until one considers the qualifications of harrys coauthor and collaborator namely a thcentury rake shot dead by an outraged husband in summer of in a few months harry will be nineteen he has his own unassuming topfloor flat in an old threestorey house on the coast road out of hartlepool towards sunderland perhaps typically the house stands opposite one of the towns oldest graveyards harry is never short of friends to talk to whats more and now that his talent as a necroscope has developed to its full he can converse with exanimate persons even over great distances he needs only to be introduced or to have spoken to one of the teeming dead and thereafter can always seek him out again with harry however its a matter of common decency that he physically go to see them that is to attend them at their gravesides he does not believe in shouting at his friends in their turn harrys dead people love him he is their pharos the one shining light in their eternal darkness he brings hope where none has ever before existed he is their single window their observatory on a world they had thought left behind and gone forever for contrary to the beliefs of the living death is not the end but a transition to incorporeality immobility the flesh may be weak and corruptible but mind and will go on great artists when they die continue to visualize magnificent canvases pictures they can never paint architects plan fantastic faultless continentspanning cities which can never be built scientists follow through the research they commenced in life but never had time to complete or perfect except that now through harry keogh they may contact one another and even obtain knowledge of the corporeal world and so while they would never deliberately burden him all the trials and tribulations of harrys countless dead friends are his and his troubles are theirs and harry does have troubles at his flat in hartlepool when he is not working harry entertains his childhood sweetheart brenda who will shortly fall pregnant and become his wife but as his worldly scope widens so a shadow from the past grows into an obsession harry dreams and daydreams of his poor murdered mother and time and again in his darkest nightmares revisits the frozen river where she died before her time finally he resolves to take revenge on viktor shukshin his stepfather in this as in all things he has the blessing of the dead murder is a crime they cannot tolerate knowing the darkness of death anyone who deliberately takes life is an abhorrence to them winter of and harry goes to see shukshin confronting him with evidence of his guilt his stepfather is plainly dangerous even deranged and harry suspects hell now try to kill him too in january of he gives him the opportunity they skate on the river together but when shukshin moves in for the kill harry is prepared his plan goes wrong however they both fall through the ice and emerge together by the riverbank the russian has the strength of a madman and will surely drown his stepson but no for harrys mother rises from her watery grave to drag shukshin down and harry has discovered a new talent or rather he now knows how far the dead will go in order to protect him knows that in fact they will rise from their graves for him harrys talent has not gone unnoticed a topsecret british intelligence organization ebranch and its soviet counterpart are both aware of his powers he is no sooner approached to join the british organization than its head is killed taken out by the romanian spy and necromancer boris dragosani a ghoul dragosani rips open the dead to steal their secrets right out of their blood and guts by butchering the top man in ebranch he now knows all the secrets of the british espers harry vows to track him down and even the score and the teeming dead offer their assistance of course they do for even they are not safe from a man who violates corpses what harry and the dead dont know is that dragosani has been infected with vampirism he has the vampire egg of thibor ferenczy inside him growing there gradually changing him and taking control more dragosani has murdered a colleague max batu the mongol in order to steal the secret of his killing eye he can now kill at a glance time is short and harry must follow dragosani back to the ussr to soviet ebranch headquarters at the chateau bronnitsy where the vampire is now supremo and there kill him but how harry is no spy a british precog has foreseen harrys involvement not only with vampires but also in connection with the twisted figure sigil of the mцbius strip to get to dragosani he must first understand the mцbius connection here at least harry is on familiar ground for august ferdinand mцbius has been dead since and the dead will do anything for harry keogh in leipzig harry visits mцbiuss grave and discovers the longexpired mathematician and astronomer at work on his spacetime equations what he did in life he continues undisturbed to do in death and in the course of a century he has reduced the physical universe to a set of mathematical symbols he knows how to bend spacetime and ride his mцbius strip out to the stars teleportation an easy route into the chateau bronnitsy or anywhere else for that matter fine but all harry has is an intuitive grasp of maths and he certainly doesnt have a hundred years still he has to start somewhere for days mцbius instructs harry until his pupil is sure that the answer lies right here just an inch beyond his grasp he only needs a spur and the east german grepo have their eye on harry on the orders of dragosani they try to arrest him in the leipzig graveyard and this is the spur he needs suddenly mцbiuss equations are no longer meaningless figures and symbols they are a doorway into the strange immaterial universe of the mцbius continuum harry conjures a mцbius door and escapes from the grepo trap by trial and error he learns how to use this weird and until now entirely conjectural parallel universe eventually he projects himself into the grounds of soviet ebranch hq against the armoured might of the chateau bronnitsy harrys task seems nigh impossible he needs allies and he finds them the chateaus grounds are waterlogged peaty white under the crisp snow of a russian winter but not frozen and down in the peat preserved through four centuries since a time when moscow was sacked by a band of crimean tartars the remains of that butchered band stir and begin to rise up with his zombie army harry advances into the chateau destroys its defences seeks out and kills dragosani and his vampire tenant in the fight he too is killed his body dies but in the last moment his mind his will transfers to the metaphysical mцbius continuum and riding the mцbius strip into future time harrys id is absorbed into the unformed infant mentality of his own son wamphyri august drawn to harry jnrs allabsorbing mind like an iron filing to a magnet like a mote in a whirlpool the harry keogh identity is in danger of being entirely subsumed dislocated wiped clean as the childs perceptions expand how much of his fathers id will be left will anything at all of harry snr remain harrys one avenue of freedom lies in the mцbius continuum he can still use it at will but only when his infant son is asleep and only as an incorporeal entity thats harrys big problem now the fact that he doesnt have a body and another is this that while exploring the infinity of the future timestream he has noted among the myriad blue lifethreads of mankind a scarlet thread a vampire in our midst and worse the thread crosses young harrys in the very close future harry investigates in september he speaks to the spirit of thibor ferenczy no longer undead but truly extinct a vampire no more where his tomb keeps watch on the cruciform hills under the carpatii meridionali and to thibors father faethor ferenczy where he died in a world war ii bombing raid on ploiesti towards bucharest where even today the ruins lie overrun with weeds and brambles even dead vampires are devious the worst liars imaginable even dead they tempt taunt terrorize if they can but harry has nothing to lose and thibor has much to gain with one exception harry keogh is thibors last remaining contact with a world he once planned to rule one exception yes in the vampire had infected a pregnant woman using the arts of the wamphyri he had touched and tainted her foetal male child and willed it that one day this man as yet unborn would remember him and return to the cruciform hills in search of his true father and now it is and yulian bodescu not yet eighteen years old is a strange precocious and yes even occasionally frightening young man to know him too well is to know fear and revulsion thibor ferenczys taint has taken full hold on him his blood and soul are corrupt he is a fledgling vampire yulians mother is english his father a romanian is dead mother and son live alone together at harkley house in devon his life is a constant tugofwar between frustration and lust hers is lived like a chicken penned with a fox she knows he is evil and capable of greater evil but fears him too greatly for public accusation also having protected him since childhood she still dares hope that he will change in the fullness of time and indeed he is changing rapidly but not for the better yulian halfguesses halfknows what he is he constantly dreams of motionless trees black hills in the shape of a cross a tomb in a silent glade on a hillside and of the old thing in the ground which once lay waiting there and of what it left behind to wait for him the scarlet vampire thread which was once thibor and is now yulian tugs at him beckoning him to attend his father and this is that selfsame thread which harry keogh has seen crossing his own infant sons pure blue thread in the mцbius continuums future timestream but even as harry plays catandmouse wordgames with the anciently wise utterly devious and immemorially evil wamphyri so the espers of british ebranch have staked out harkley house in devon telepaths they are only waiting for harry to give them the word and they will move in on harkley and try to destroy yulian and any other infected person whom they may find there and they will do this because they know that if any such person or thing breaks out then that vampirism could spread like a plague through the length and breadth of the land even the world also in romania alec kyle and felix krakovitch current heads of their respective espionage organizations have joined forces to destroy whatever remains of thibor ferenczy in the black earth of the cruciform hills they succeed in burning a monstrous remnant but not before thibor sends yulian a dreammessage and warning for thibor had hoped to use his english son as a vessel and in him rise up again to resume his vampire existence but now that his last vestiges are destroyed instead he turns to vengeance thibor is gone forever dead and gone like all the teeming dead but just like them his mind remains and in the dream he sends to yulian he tells all and lays the blame on ebranch and especially on harry keogh what ebranch has done to thibor it also plans to do to yulian bodescu but keogh is the one to watch out for the only one who poses any real threat only destroy himand yulian may pick off the rest of his enemies in his own good time one by one and he vows to do just that as for destroying keogh that should be the very simplest thing harry keogh is incorporeal a bodiless id his own infant sons sixth sense only remove the child and the father goes with him meanwhile harry has learned all he can of vampire history of means to destroy them of ancient ground which may still require cleansing of their evil he initiates ebranchs attack on harkley house in the ussr however felix krakovitch has been killed and alec kyle head of ebranch is falsely accused of his murder russian espers have taken kyle to the chateau bronnitsy where they are using a combination of high technology and esp to drain him of all knowledge that is all knowledge the most severe form of brainwashing and intelligencegathering the treatment will leave him literally braindead a husk a body robbed of its governing mind and when the body dies kyle will be dumped in west berlin with never a mark on him that at least is the plan in the interim yulian bodescu has not been idle for a long time he has been breeding something in harkleys cellars his alsatian dog is more than a dog he has raped and vampirized a visiting aunt and cousin and even infected his own mother the house when ebranchs men attack is discovered to be a place of total lunacy mayhem and nightmare bodescu escapes the only survivor as harkley house goes up in cleansing fire intent on destroying the keogh child he heads north for hartlepool his trail is bloody and littered with ebranch agents when finally he enters the house and climbs to brenda keoghs topfloor flat the mother tries to protect her child and is hurled aside harry jnr is awake his mind contains harry keogh the monster is upon them powerful hands reaching harry can do nothing trapped in the infants whirlpool id he knows that they are both about to die but then go little harry tells him through you ive learned what i had to learn i dont need you that way any longer but i do need you as a father so go on get out save yourself the mental attraction which binds harry to his sons mind has been relaxed he can now flee into the mцbius continuum but he cant youre my son how can i go and leave you here with with this but harry jnr has no intention of being left behind he has his fathers knowledge he is a mature mind in the body of an infant lacking only experience they both flee to the mцbius continuum the child has inherited much more than this however what the father could do the infant son can do in spades harry jnr is a necroscope of enormous power in the ancient cemetery just across the road the dead answer his call they come out of their graves shuffle flop crawl from the graveyard and into the house and up the stairs bodescu flees but they trap him and employ the old timetested methods of eradication the stake decapitation cleansing fire harry keogh is free but free to do what incorporeal the mцbius continuum must eventually absorb him or perhaps expel him elsewhere elsewhere however bodiless he is still a foreign body in mцbiuss enigmatic emptiness of mathematical conjecture except there is a force an attraction other than harry jnrs infant id a vacuum to be filled it is the vacuum of alec kyles drained mind and when harry explores he is sucked in irresistibly to reanimate the braindead esper it is late september and harry keogh necroscope and explorer of the metaphysical mцbius continuum has taken up permanent residence in another mans body indeed to all intents and purposes and to anyone who doesnt know better he is that other man but harry is also the natural father of a most unnatural child a child with awesome supernatural powers harry employs ultrahigh explosives to blow the chateau bronnitsy to hell then rides the mцbius strip home to seek out his wife and child only to discover that they have disappeared not only from england but from the face of the earth indeed entirely out of this universe the source in in the urals there occurs the perchorsk incident an industrial accident according to the soviets but an accident of some magnitude in fact the russians seeking an answer to the usas proposed star wars have built and tested a lasertype weapon to create a shield against incoming missiles the experiment is a failure there is a blowback in the weapon in the deeps of the perchorsk pass havoc is wreaked as the fabric of spacetime itself receives a terrible wrenching the worlds intelligence agencies including intesp are interested to discover what moscow is hiding up there under the snow and ice and mountains curious to know what exactly the perchorsk projekt really is or was a year later and something is tracked from novaya zemlya on a course which takes it west of franz josef land and on a beeline for ellesmere island mig interceptors have been sent up from kirovsk south of murmansk the object is two miles higher than the migs when they catch up with it but it sees them descends and destroys them their debris is lost in snow and ice some six hundred miles from the pole and a like distance short of ellesmere a usaf awacs reports the migs lost from its screens presumed down but hotline moscow is curiously cautious even ambiguous what migs what intruder the americans angrily this thing is coming out of your airspace if it sticks to its present course it will be intercepted forced to land if it fails to comply or acts hostile it may even be shot down and unexpectedly good from the russians we renounce it utterly do with it as you see fit two usaf fighters have meanwhile been scrambled up from a strip near port fairfield maine the awacs guides them to their target at close to mach theyve crossed the hudson bay from the belcher islands to a point two hundred miles north of churchill the awacs is left behind a little but their target is dead ahead at feet they spot it and take it out no questions asked one look at it is enough reason to fire on the thing equipped with experimental airtoair firedevils the usaf planes succeed where the migs paid the price the thing burns blows apart over the hudson bay crashes to earth the awacs has caught up gets the whole thing on film eventually british ebranch is invited to a picture show and to offer an educated opinion a guess anything will be appreciated ebranch keeps its expert opinion to itself for the sanity of the world reason the thing from perchorsk was obviously similar very similar to the monstrosity that yulian bodescu bred in his cellars also to the thibor ferenczy remnant burned on the cruciform hills of romania except that by comparison they were pigmies and this one was a giant and armoured in a nutshell it was a thing of vampire protoflesh and ebranch suspects that the russians at perchorsk made it an incredible biological experiment which perhaps broke free of its controlled or test environment this is one theory at least but not the only one ebranch contrives to put a contact inside the perchorsk projekt to act as a spy and telepathic transmitter before he is discovered they learn enough to convince them of the worldthreatening evil of the place even enough to cause them to reestablish their old contact with harry keogh it is eight years since yulian bodescu died and harry wrecked the chateau bronnitsy eight long years since his halfderanged wife and her necroscopic child fled apparently right out of this world and ever since then hes been looking for them they are not dead for if they were the teeming dead would know it and likewise harry keogh but if theyre alive then harry no longer knows where to search he has exhausted every bolthole searched everywhere darcy clarke head of intesp goes to see harry at his edinburgh home he starts to tell him about perchorsk but harry isnt interested as clarke fills in the details however harrys interest picks up his old enemies the soviet mindspies have established a cell at perchorsk to block metaphysical prying theyre obviously hiding something big something very unpleasant they have a regiment of troops up there in the mountains equipped with real firepower for what who is likely to attack the urals who do the russians think theyre keeping out what are they keeping in we think theyre doing something with genetics clarke tells harry we think theyre breeding warrior vampires even now harry is only halfswayed but at last clarke plays his trump the british spy in perchorsk michael j simmons has vanished the very best of ebranchs espers cant find him they believe hes alive but they dont know where hes alive which precisely parallels harrys own problem perhaps by some weird freak of coincidence harry jnr brenda keogh and the perchorsk spy are all in the same place to be doubly sure that ebranch arent just using him to their own ends harry asks his myriad dead friends to look into it is there a recent arrival in their teeming ranks by the name of michael j simmons but there is not simmons isnt dead hes simply not here harry investigates and discovers that the accident at the perchorsk projekt has blown a hole in spacetime a grey hole leading to a world parallel with our own also that the world on the other side is the spawning ground of vampires indeed the source of all vampire myth and legend he talks again to the longdead august ferdinand mцbius to the devious mind of the extinct faethor ferenczy and to more recent friends among the legions of the dead until finally he discovers an alternate route into the vampire world and what a monstrous world that is sunside is hot a blazing desert starside is the realm of the wamphyri where their aeries stand kilometrehigh close to the mountain pinnacles which divide the planet on sunside the travellers the original gypsies wander in bands and tribes through the verdant foothills of the central range active during the long days they burrow in dark holes and caves through the short fearfilled nights for when the sun sets on sunside thats when the wamphyri come ahunting travellers and trogs are to the wamphyri what the coconut is to earths tropical islanders they form a large part of their diet provide slaves workers women even when they die or are disposed of there is rarely any waste their remains go to feed wamphyri gasbeasts siphoneers and warriors which are themselves fashioned of transmuted trogs and travellers their grotesquely altered fossilized bodies decorate the vertiginous glooming castles of the wamphyri are even formed into furniture or hardened into exterior sheaths so protecting the aerie properties of their vampire masters against the elements as for the lords of these rearing keeps the wamphyri are monstrous warlike jealous of their territories and possessions forever scheming and feuding there is nothing a vampire hates and distrusts more than another vampire and no one they all hate and distrust more than the dweller in his garden in the west following a nightmare series of adventures and misadventures a party of travellers including jazz simmons and the beautiful telepath zek foener have joined forces with the dweller by the time harry keogh arrives the wamphyri have set aside all personal arguments and disputes to unite against their common enemy preparatory to invading the garden the dwellers territory in the hills of all the awesome wamphyri lords only the lady karen a gorgeous oncetraveller whose vampire tenant has not yet reached full maturity renegues and flees to the dweller warning him of the coming war the battle is joined the lords shaithis menor maimbite belath volse pinescu lesk the glut and many others with all their hybrid warriors and trog minions against the dweller and his small party of humans but harry keogh is with the dweller and the dweller is harry jnr by means of a timeslip harry jnr is not the mere boy his father expected but grown to a young man in a golden mask and this is the world to which he has transported his poor demented mother for her safety and peace of mind yes and until now he has provided amply for all her needs and his own for individually the wamphyri lords were no match for him and his science now that they are united however harry snr has arrived just in time by ingenious use of the mцbius continuum and of the necroscope powers of father and son shaithis and his vampire army are defeated their aeries destroyed all bar the lady karens she goes back there and harry keogh visits her he seeks to free her of her vampire not for her sake but for his sons for the dweller has become infected with vampirism harry will use karen to test a theory hopefully provide a cure he drives karens vampire out and destroys it alas he also destroys her she had been wamphyri and now she is a shell when one has known the magnified emotions the freedom from guilt timidity and remorse the sheer lust and power of the wamphyri what is there after that nothing and she throws herself from the aeries battlements but the dweller still has a vampire in him and back in the garden where his band of travellers are rebuilding their shattered lives and homes harry jnr is ever more aware of his fathers hooded eyes watching him intently necroscope iv deadspeak castle ferenczy transylvania the first week of september still an hour short of midday two peasant wives of halmagiu village wended their way home along welltrodden forest tracks their baskets were full of small wild plums and the first ripe berries of the season all with the dew still glistening on them some of the plums were still a little green all the better for the making of sharp tangy brandy darkrobed with coarse cloth headsquares framing their narrow faces the women cheerfully embroidered tidbits of village gossip to suit their mood their teeth flashing ivory in weathered leather as they laughed over especially juicy morsels in the neardistance blue wood smoke drifted in almost perpendicular spirals from halmagius chimneys it formed a haze high over the earlyautumn canopy of forest but closer in among the trees themselves were other fires cooking smells of spiced meats and herbal soups drifted on the still air small silver bells jingled a bough creaked where a wildhaired darkeyed silent staring child dangled from the rope of a makeshift swing there were gaudy caravans gathered in a circle under the trees outside the circle tethered ponies cropped the grass and brightcoloured dresses swirled where barearmed girls gathered firewood inside blackiron cooking pots suspended over licking flames issued puffs of mouthwatering steam male travellers tended their own duties or simply looked on smoking their long thinstemmed pipes as the encampment settled in travellers yes wanderers gypsies the szgany had returned to the region of halmagiu the boy on the rope in the tree had spotted the two village women and now uttered a piercing whistle all murmur and jingle and movement in the gypsy encampment ceased upon the instant dark eyes turned outwards in unison staring with curiosity at the romanian peasant women with their baskets the gypsy men in their leather jackets looked very strong somehow fierce but there was nothing of animosity in their eyes they had their own codes the szgany and knew which side their bread was greased for five hundred years the people of halmagiu had dealt with them fairly bought their trinkets and knickknacks and left them in peace and so in their turn the gypsies would work no deliberate harm against halmagiu good morning ladies the gypsy king stood up on the steps of his wagon and bowed to them please tell our friends in the village well be knocking on their doors pots and pans of the best quality charms to keep away the night things cards to read and keen eyes that know the lie of a line in your palm bring out your knives for sharpening and your broken axehandles all will be put to rights why this year weve even a good pony or two to replace the nags that pull your carts well not be here long so make the best of our bargains before we move on good morning to you the oldest of the pair at once answered if in a breathless fashion and be sure ill tell them in the village and in a hushed aside to her companion stay close move along with me say nothing as they passed by one of the wagons so this same older woman took a small jar of hazelnuts from her basket and a double handful of plums placing them on the steps of the wagon as a gift if the offering was seen no one said anything and in any case the activity in the camp had already resumed its normal pace as the women headed once more for home but the younger one who hadnt lived in halmagiu very long asked why did you give the nuts and plums away ive heard the gypsies give nothing for nothing do nothing for nothing and far too often take something for nothing wont it encourage them leaving gifts like that it does no harm to keep well in with the fey people the other told her when youve lived here as long as i have youll know what i mean and anyway theyre not here to steal or work mischief she gave a small shudder indeed i fancy i know well enough why theyre here oh said her friend wonderingly oh yes its the phase of the moon a calling theyve heard an offering theyll make they propitiate the earth replenish the rich soil appease their gods their gods are they heathens then what gods call it nature if you like the first one snapped but ask me no more im a simple woman and dont wish to know nor should you wish to know my grandmothers grandmother remembered a time when the gypsies came aye and likely her granny before her sometimes fifteen months will go by or eighteen but never more than twentyone before theyre back again spring summer winter only the szgany themselves know the season the month the time but when they hear the calling when the moon is right when a lone wolf howls high up in the mountains then they return yes and when they go they always leave their offering what sort of offering the younger woman was more curious than ever dont ask said the other hurriedly shaking her head dont ask but it was only her way the younger woman knew she was dying to tell her she bided her time and resolved to ask no more but in a little while fancying that theyd strayed too far from the most direct route back to the village she felt obliged to inquire but isnt this a long way round were taking be quiet now hushed the older woman look they had arrived at a clearing in the forest at the foot of a gaunt outcrop of grey volcanic rock bald and domed with several humps this irregular mound stood perhaps fifty feet high with more forest beyond then sheer cliffs rising to a firclad plateau like a first gigantic step to the misted grimly forbidding heights of the zarundului massif the trees around the base of the outcrop had been felled all shrubs and undergrowth cleared away at its summit a cairn of heavy stones stood like a small tower or chimney pointing to the mountains and up there seated on the bare rock at the foot of the cairn working with a knife at a shard of stone which he held in his lap a young man szgany he was intent upon his work seeing nothing but the stone in his hands he gazed down across a distance of little more than one hundred feet gazed seemingly head on so that the women of the village must surely be central to his circle of vision but if he saw them he gave no sign and indeed it was plain that he did not see them only the stone which he worked and even at that distance clearly there was something not quite right with him but whats he doing up there the younger of the two inquired in a hoarse whisper hes very handsome and yet strange and anyway isnt this a forbidden place my hzak tells me that the great stone of the cairn is a very special stone and that shhhr the other once again cautioned her a finger to her lips dont disturb him they dont take kindly to being spied upon the szgany not that this one will hear us anyway still best to be careful he wont hear us you say then why are we talking in whispers no i know why were whispering because this is a private place like a shrine almost holy unholy the other corrected her as to why he wont notice us why just look at him up there his skins not so much dark as slategrey sickly dying eyes deepsunken burning obsessed with that stone hes carving hes been called cant you see hes mazed hypnotized doomed even as the last word left her lips so the man on the rock stood up took up his stone and ground it firmly into position on the rim of the cairn it sat there side by side with many dozens of others like a brick in the topmost tier of a wall and anyone having seen the ritual of the carving would know that each single stone of that cairn was marked in some weird meaningful way the younger woman opened her mouth to say something but her friend at once anticipated her question his name she said he carved his name and his dates if he knows them like all the other names and dates carved up there like all the others gone before him that rude stone is his headstone which makes the cairn itself a graveyard now the young gypsy was craning his neck looking up up at the mountains he stood frozen in that position for long moments as if waiting for something and high in the greyblue sky a small dark blot of cloud drifted across the face of the sun at that the eldest of the two women gave a start she herself had become almost hypnotized stalled there and without the will to move on but as the sun was eclipsed and shadows fell everywhere she grabbed the others elbow and turned her face away come she gasped suddenly breathless lets be gone from here our men will be worried especially if they know there are gypsies about they hurried through the shadows of the trees found the track soon began to see the first wooden houses on halmagius outskirts where the forest thinned down to nothing but even as they stepped out from the trees into a dusty lane and their heartbeats slowed a little so they heard a sound from behind and above and far far beyond not quite midday in halmagiu the sun coming out from behind a small stray cloud the first days of true winter still some seven or eight weeks away but every soul who heard that sound took it as a wintry omen anyway aye and some took it for more than that it was the mournful voice of a wolf echoing down from the mountains calling as wolves have called for a thousand thousand years and more the two women paused clutched their baskets held their breath and listened but theres no answering cry said the younger eventually hes alone that old wolf for now the other nodded aye alone but hes been heard all right take my word for it and he will be answered soon enough following which she shook her head and hurried on the other caught up with her yes following which she pressed the older woman peered at her scowled a little finally barked but you must learn to listen anna there are some things we dont much talk about up here so if you want to learn then when they are talked about you must listen i was listening the other answered its just that i didnt understand thats all you said the old wolf would be answered soon enough and and then aye and then said the older one turning towards her doorway where bunches of garlic dangled from the lintel drying in the sun and over her shoulder and then the very next morning why the szgany will be gone no trace of them at all except maybe the ashes in their camp the ruts in the tracks where their caravans have rolled moving on but their numbers will have been shortened by one one who answered an ancient call and stayed behind the younger womans mouth formed a silent o thats right said the first nodding you just saw him adding his soul to those other poor souls inscribed in the cairn on the rock that night in the szgany camp the girls danced whirling to the skirl of frenzied violins and the primal thump and jingle of tambourines a long table stood heavy with food joints of rabbit and whole hedgehogs still steaming from the heat of the trenches where theyd baked wild boar sausages sliced thin cheeses purchased or bartered in halmagiu village fruit and nuts onions simmering in gravy poured from the meats gypsy wines and sharp throatclutching wild plum brandy there was a festival atmosphere the flames of a central fire inspired by the music leaped high and the dancers were sinuous sensuous alcohol was consumed in large measure some of the younger gypsies drank from a sense of relief others from fear of an uncertain future for those who had been spared this time around there would always be other times but they were szgany and this was the way of things they were his to the ends of the earth his to command his to take their pact with the old one had been signed and sealed more than four hundred years ago through him they had prospered down the centuries they prospered now they would prosper in all the years to come he made the hard times easier aye and the easy times hard but always he achieved a balance his blood was in them and theirs in him and the blood is the life only two amongst them were alone and private even with the girls dancing the drinking the feasting still they were alone for all of this noise and movement around them was an assumed gaiety wherein they could scarcely participate one of them the young man from the cairn sat on the steps of an ornately carved and painted wagon with a whetstone and his longbladed knife bringing the cutting edge to a scintillant shimmer of silver in the flicker of neardistant firelight while in the yellow lamplight behind him where the door stood open his mother sat sobbing wringing her hands praying for all she was worth to one who was not a god indeed to one who was the very opposite that he spare her son this night but praying in vain and as one tune ended and bright skirts whispered to a halt falling about gleaming brown limbs and moustached men quit their leaping and highkicking in that interval when the fiddlers sipped their brandy before starting up again then the moon showed its rim above the mountains whose misted crags were brought to a sudden prominence and as mouths gaped open and all eyes turned upwards to the risen moon so the mournful howl of a wolf drifted down to them from unseen aeries of rock for a single moment the tableau stood frozen but the next saw dark eyes turning to gaze at the young man on the caravan steps he stood up looked up at the moon and the crags and sighed and sheathing his knife he stepped down to the clearing crossed it on stiff legs headed for the darkness beyond the encircling wagons his mother broke the silence her wail rising to a shriek of anguish was that of a banshee as she hurled herself from their caravan home crashed down the wooden steps came reeling after her son her arms outstretched but she did not go to him instead she fell to her knees some paces away her arms still reaching aching for him for the chief of this band their king had stepped forward to embrace the young man he hugged him kissed him on both cheeks released him and without more ado the chosen one went out of the firelight between the wagons and was swallowed by darkness dumitru his mother screamed she got to her feet made to rush after him and flew into the arms of her king peace woman he told her gruffly his throat bobbing weve seen it coming a month now watched the change in him the old one has called and dumitru answers we knew what to expect this is always the way of it but hes my son my son she sobbed rackingly into his chest aye he said his own voice finally breaking sending tears coursing down his leathery cheeks and mine mine too aye he led her stumbling and sobbing back to their caravan and behind them the music started up again and the dancing and the feasting and drinking dumitru zirra climbed the ramparts of the zarundului like a fox born to those heights the moon lit a path for him but even without that silver swath he would have known the way for there was guidance from within a voice inside his head which was not his voice told him where to step reach grasp there were paths up here if you knew them but between these hairpin tracks were vertiginous shortcuts dumitru chose the latter or someone made that choice for him dumiitruuu the dark voice crooned to him drawing out his name like a cry of torment ah my faithful my szgaaany son of my sons step here and there and here dumiitruuu and here where the wolf stepped see his mark on the rock the father of your fathers awaits you dumiitruuu the moon is risen up and the hour draws niiigh make haste my son for im old and dry and shrivelled close to death the true death but you shall succour me dumiitruuu aye and all your youth and strength be miiine almost to the tree line the youth laboured his breath ragged and his hands bloody from the climbing to the blackest crags of all where a vast ruin humped against the final cliff on the one side a gorge so sheer and black it might descend to hell and on the other the last of the tall firs shielding the tumbled pile of some ancient keep set back against sheerrising walls of rock dumitru saw the place and for a moment was brought up short but then he also saw the flameeyed wolf standing in the broken gates of the ruin and hesitated no more he went on and the great wolf led the way welcome to my house dumiitruuu that glutinous voice oozed like mud in his mind you are my guest my son enter of your own free will dumitru zirra clambered dazedly over the first shattered stones of the place and mazed as he was still the queer aspect of these ruins impressed him it had been a castle of that he was sure in olden times a boyar had lived here a ferenczy janos ferenczy no question of that for down all the ages since the time of grigor zirra the first szgany king the zirras had sworn allegiance to the baron ferenczy and had borne his crest a bat leaping into flight from the mouth of a black urn with wings outspread showing three ribs to each wing the eyes of the bat were red likewise the ribs of its wings made prominent in scarlet while the vessel from which it soared was in the shape of a burial urn aye and now the youths deepsunken staring eyes picked out a like design carved on the shattered slab of a huge stone lintel where it lay halfburied in debris and indeed he knew that he stood upon the threshold of the great and ancient patron of the zirras and their followers for it was that same sigil as described which even now was displayed on the sides of vasile zirras caravan similarly old vasile dumitrus father wore a ring bearing a miniature of this crest allegedly passed down to him from time immemorial this would have been dumitrus one day had he not heard the calling some little way ahead of dumitru the great wolf growled low in its throat urging him on he paused however uncertain where the shadows of fallen blocks obscured his vision the front edge of the ruin seemed to have been tossed out to and beyond the rim of the gorge where still a jumble of massive stones and slates were spread in dark confusion so that dumitru supposed a large part of the castle had gone down into the gorge as to what could have caused such destruction he had no but you hesitate my son came that monstrous mental voice oozing like a slug in his mind overriding and obliterating all matters of question and conjecture and will that voice which had completely overwhelmed and taken control of him during the course of the last four or five weeks making him its zombie and see that it is as i suspected dumiitruuu you are strongwilled good very good the strength of the will is that of the body and the strength of the body is the blood your blood is strong my son as it is in all your race the great wolf growled again and dumitru stumbled after the youth knew he should flee this place run headlong break his bones in the dark and crawl if he must anything but carry on and yet he was powerless against the lure of that ancient evil voice it was as if he had made some promise he could not break or as if he kept the promise of some longdead and honoured ancestor which was inviolable now guided by the voice in his head he stumbled among leaning menhir blocks in search of a certain spot now he went on all fours clearing away freshfallen leaves damp grey lichens and shards of black rock now he discovered a narrow slab with an iron ring which he lifted easily a blast of foul air struck his face filled his lungs made him more dizzy yet where he crouched over the black and reeking abyss and when at last his head cleared of the fumes at least he was already descending into nightmare depths now the voice told him here here my son a niche in the wall torches a bundle and matches all wrapped in a skin aye better than the flints of my youth light one torch and take two more with you for be sure youll need them dumiitruuu the stone stairwell spiralled dumitru descended nitrous steps obliged to clamber in places where the stair had collapsed he reached a buckled floor littered with blocks of fireblackened masonry another trapdoor the descent continued through dankly echoing bowels of earth down ever down to sinister and sentient netherpits until at last well done dumiitruuu the dark voice complimented him a voice that smiled monstrously invisibly whose owner was well pleased with himself his pleasure grating like a file on the nerveendings of the young mans brain and suddenly dumitru might have bolted for a split second he was his own man again he knew he stood on the very threshold of hell but then that alien intelligence closed like a vice on his mind the inexorable process started five weeks ago guided him towards its logical conclusion the strength of free will flickered like a guttering candle in him almost extinguished and look about you dumiitruuu look and learn what are the works and mysteries of your master my son behind dumitru on the stone staircase the great flameeyed wolf and before him the lair of a necromancer such things were legends amongst the szgany tales to be told about the campfires in certain seasons but neither dumitru nor any other who might view this scene would require any special knowledge or explanation save that of his own imagination his own instinct and wideeyed and gapemouthed with his torch held high the youth wandered unsteadily through the ordered remnants and relics of chaos and madness not the chaos of the upper regions which was purely physical for these secret nethervaults had suffered little of the destruction of the higher levels they were preserved pristine under the dust and cobwebs of half a century no this was a mental chaos the knowledge that these were the works of a man or men or again taking into account all manner of szgany myth and legend the works of things disguised as such of the vaults themselves the stonework was ancient indeed hoary nitrestreaked and yet not noticeably damp in places the masonry even showed signs of dripstone concretion wispy stalactite strings depended from the highvaulted ceilings and around the edges of the rooms where the floor had been not so frequently trodden smoothdomed stalagmite deposits formed small nodes or blisters on the roughly fitted flags dumitru was no archaeologist but from the primitive roughness of the dressed stone and the poor condition of the ancient mortar alone even he would have dated the castle or at least these secret regions of the castle as being some eight or nine hundred years old it would need to be at least that for the formation of these calcium deposits or else the solutions seeping from above must be unusually heavily laced with crystalline salts there were numerous archways uniformly eight feet wide and eleven high all wedged at their tops with massive keystones some of which had settled a little from the unimaginable tonnage of the higher levels the ceilings none of them less than fourteen or fifteen feet tall at apex were vaulted in an interlocking design similar to the archways in several places massive blocks had fallen doubtless shaken loose by whatever blast had doomed the place shattering the heavy flags of the floor like schoolroom slates beyond the archways were rooms all of a large size all with archways of their own dumitru had descended to a maze of ancient rooms where the tenant of this broken pile had practised his secret arts as to the nature of those arts so far with the single exception of his first terrified guess dumitru had avoided conjecture but this was no longer possible the walls were covered in frescoes which however faded told the entire tale and many of the rooms contained undeniable evidence of a much more solid much more frightening nature also the voice in his head now cruel and full of glee would not permit of his ignorance it desired that he know the way of these old matters necromancy you thought dumitru when first your torch cast back the shadows down here the voice reiterated the resurrection of defunct salts and ashes back into life for the purpose of interrogation the history of the world as it were from the horses mouth from the reanimated imperfect wraiths of them that lived it the unravelling of ancient secrets and perhaps even the foretelling of the dimly distant future aye divination by use of the dead that is what you thought well and you were right as far as you went but you did not go far enough you have avoided looking you avoid it even now what and are you my son dumitru or some puling babe in arms i thought i had called strong wine in unto myself only to discover that the szgaaany have been brewing water all these years hahaahaaa but no i make jokes dont be so angry my son it is anger is it not dumiitruuu no fear perhaps you fear for your life dumiitruuu the voice had sunk to a whisper now but insidious as the drip of a slow acid but you shall have your life my son in me the blood is the life dumiitruuu and that shall go on and on aaand but there now the voice sprang alive became merry why we were grown morose and that must never be what but we shall be as one and live out all our life together do you hear me dumiitruuu well i i hear you the youth answered speaking to no one and do you believe me say it say that you believe in me as your fathers fathers believed in me dumitru was not sure he did believe but the owner of the voice squeezed inside his head until he cried out yes yes i believe just as my fathers believed very well said the voice apparently placated then dont be so shy dumiitruuu look upon my works without averting your eyes without shrinking back the pictures painted and graven in the walls the many amphorae in their racks the salts and powders contained in these ancient vessels in the daring torchlight dumitru looked racks of black oak standing everywhere and on their shelves numberless jars urns amphorae as the voice had termed them throughout these rooms in this subterranean hideaway there must be several thousands of them all tightstoppered with plugs of oak in leaden sheaths all with faded centuriesstained labels pasted to them where handles joined necks one rack had been shattered thrown aside by a falling ceiling stone its jars had been spilled some of them breaking open powders had trickled out forming small cones which themselves had taken on the dust of decades and when dumitru looked at these spilled remains see how fine they are these essential salts whispered the voice in his head which now contained a curiosity of its own as if even the owner of that voice were awed by this ghoulish hoard stoop down feel them in your hands dumiitruuu the youth could not disobey he sifted the powders which were soft as talc and yet free as mercury they ran through his fingers and left his hands clean without residue and while he handled the salts in this fashion so the thing in his mind gave a mental sniff it seemed to taste of the essence of what it had bade dumitru examine and ah he was a greek this one the voice informed recognize him we conversed on several occasions a priest from greekland aye who knew the legends of the vrykoulakas hed crusaded against them he said and carried his crusade across the sea to moldavia wallachia even to these very mountains he built a grand church in alba lulia which possibly stands there even to this day and from it would go out among the towns and villages to seek out the monstrous vrykoulakas individuals of the townspeople would name their enemies often knowing them for innocents and depending on the power or stature of the accuser the venerable arakli aenos as this one was called would prove or disprove the accusation for example if a famous boyar gave evidence that such and such persons were bloodsucking demons be sure that the greek would discover them as such but only let a poor man bring such a charge however faithfully and he might well be ignored or even punished for a liar a witchfinder and a fake old aenos who upon a time accused even myself aye and i must needs flee to escape them from visegrad who came to put me down oh i tell you it was a very troublesome business that time but time settles many a score ashes to ashes dust to dust when he died they buried the old fraud in a leadlined box in alba lulia beside the church hed built there what a boon for just exactly as had been intended so the imperishable lead of his coffin sufficed to keep out the seepage and worms and all manner of rodent malefactor until a time one hundred years later when i dug him up oh yes we conversed on several occasions but in the end what did he know nothing a fraud a faker still i evened the score that pile of dust you sifted there arakli aenos himself and ah how he screeaaamed when i gave him back his form and flesh and burned the dog with hot ironsss hahaahaaa dumitru hissed his horror and snatched back his fingers from the strewn salts he flapped his hands as if they too were burned with hot irons blew on them wiped them trembling down his coarsely woven trousers he lurched upright and backed away from the broken urns only to crash into another rack which stood behind him he fell sprawling in dust and powder and salts but his confusion had served to clear his mazed mind a little which the owner of the voice at once recognized so that now he tightened his grip steady now steady my son ah i see you think i torment you to no purpose you believe i derive pleasure from such instruction but no no deem it only fair that you should know the gravity of the service you perform you make unto me a considerable offering of succour sustenance replenishment wherefore i grant you knowledge for however short a time now stand up stand tall hear well my words and follow their directions the walls go to the walls dumiitruuu good now trace the frescoes with your eyes my son and with your hands now look and learn here is a man he is born lives his life dies prince or peasant sinner or saint all go the same way you see them there in the pictures holy men and blackguards alike moving swiftly from cradle to grave rushing headlong from the sweet warm moment of conception to the cold empty abyss of dissolution it is the lot of all men it would seem to become one with the earth and all the lessons learned in their lives wasted and their secrets remaining secret unto them alone forever oh but some there are whose remains by circumstance of their interment like the greek priest perhaps remain intact and others perhaps cremated and buried in jugs whose powdered ashes are kept apart from the earth and pure there they lie a crumbled bone or two a handful of dust and in them all the knowledge of their waking seasons all the secrets of life and sometimes of death and maybe even conditions between the two which they took with them to the grave all lost and again i say oh and you will say but what of knowledge in books or knowledge passed down by word of mouth or carved in stone surely a learned man if he so desire may leave his knowledge behind him for the benefit of others to come after what stone tablets bah even the mountains are worn down and the epochs they have known blown away as dust word of mouth tell a man a story and by the time he retells it the theme is altered after twenty tellings it may not even be recognized books given a century and they wither two and they become so brittle as to snap three they crumble into nothing no dont speak of books they are the most fragile of things why there was once in alexandria the worlds most wondrous library and where pray are all of those books now gone dumiitruuu gone like all the men of yesteryear but unlike the books the men are not forgotten not necessarily and again what if a man does not desire to leave his secrets behind him but enough of that for now for see the frescoes are changed and here is another man well at least we shall call him a man but strange for he is not only conceived of man and woman see for yourself for parent he has but what is this a snake a slug and the creature issues an egg which the man takes in unto him and now this most fortunate person is no longer merely human but something else ah and see this one does not die but goes on and on always perhaps forever do you follow me dumiitruuu do you follow the pictures on the wall aye and unless this very special one is slain by some brutal man who has the knowledge or dies accidentally which may occur upon a time why then he will go on forever except he has needs this one he may not sustain himself like ordinary men rather he knows better sources of sustenance the blood is the life do you know the name of such a one my son i i know what such men are called dumitru answered though to an outside observer it would have seemed that he was speaking to a vault empty of life other than his own the greeks call them vrykoulakas as you have made mention the russians viesczy and we travellers the szgany we call them moroi vampires there is another name said the voice from a land far far away in space and time the name by which they know themselves wamphyri and for a moment perhaps in a certain reverence the voice paused then now tell me dumiitruuu do you know who i am oh i know im a voice in your head but unless youre a madman the voice must have a source have you guessed my identity dumiitruuu perhaps youve even known it all along eh you are the old one dumitru gulped his adams apple bobbing throat dry as a stick the undead undying patron of the szgany zirra you are janos the baron ferenczy aye and you may be a peasant but youre in no wise ignorant answered the voice indeed i am that one and you are mine to command as i will but first a question is there one among your father vasile zirras band whose hands are threefingered a child perhaps male born recently since last you szgany were here or perhaps a stranger youve seen on your travels who desired to join your company a strange question some would think but not dumitru it was part of the legend that one day a man would come with three fingers on his hands instead of the usual four three broad strong fingers and a thumb to each hand born that way and natural enough neither surgically contrived nor even grotesque to look upon no he answered at once he has not come the voice gave a mental grunt dumitru could almost see the impatient shrug of broad powerful shoulders and not come the voice of janos ferenczy repeated his words not yet come but the attitude of the unseen presence was mercurial it changed in a moment disappointment was put aside and resignation took its place ah well and so i wait out the years what is time to the wamphyri anyway eh dumitru made no answer in examining the faded frescoes he had reached a part of the wall which showed several very gruesome scenes the frescoes were like a tapestry telling a story in pictures but these pictures were straight out of nightmare in the first a man was held down by four others one to each limb a fifth tormentor in turkish breeches stood over him with a curved sword raised high while a sixth kneeled close by with a mallet and sharp stake of wood in the next picture the victim had been beheaded and the stake driven through him pinning him down but a huge fat sluglike worm or snake was emerging from his severed neck so that the men about him reared back in horror in a third picture the men had encircled the thing with a ring of torches and were burning it likewise the head and body of its oncehost upon a pile of faggots the fourth and penultimate scene of the set was of a priest swinging his censer in one hand while with the other he poured the vampires ashes into an urn presumably it was a rite of exorcism of purification but if so then it was mistaken wasted for the final scene was of the same urn and above it a black bat in flight rising like a phoenix from the ashes indeed the very sigil of the ferenczy and aye said janos darkly in dumitrus head but not until the advent of the threefingered man not until he comes the true son of my sons for only then may i escape from one vessel into the next ah for there are vessels and there are vessels dumiitruuu and some of them are of stone again the youths mind had started to unmaze itself of his own will suddenly he saw how low his torch had burned where hed placed it in a stone bracket on the wall he took it down and tremblingly lit another from it waving it a little to get the flame going and licking his dry lips he looked at the myriad urns and wondered which one held his tormentor how easy it would be to shatter the thing scatter its dust thrust his torch amongst those sentient remains and see if theyd burn a second time janos was not slow to note the resurgence of szgany will or to read the threat in the mind hed mastered he chuckled voicelessly and said ah not here not here dumiitruuu what youd have me lie among scum and could it be i heard you thinking treacherous thoughts just then still youd not be of the blood if you didnt eh and again his evil chuckle following which but you were right to rekindle your torch best not let the flame die dumiitruuu for its an exceeding dark place youve come to also theres yet a thing or two i want to show you for which well need the light now see theres a room to your right my son go in through the archway if you will and there discover my true lair dumitru might have struggled with himself but useless the vampires grip on his mind had returned more solid than ever he did as instructed passing under the arch and into a room much like the others except for its appointments no racks of amphorae or frescoed walls here the place was more habitation than warehouse woven tapestries were on the walls and the floor was of greenglazed tiles set in mortar centrally a mosaic of smaller tiles described the prophetic crest of the ferenczy while to one side and close to a massive fireplace stood an ancient table of dense black oak the wall hangings were falling into mouldering tatters and the dust lay as thick here as anywhere but yet there was a seeming anomaly upon the desk were papers books envelopes various seals and waxes pens and inks modern things by comparison with anything else dumitru had seen the ferenczys things he had assumed the old one to be dead or undead but all of this seemed to suggest otherwise no the barons viscous mental voice contradicted him not mine but the property of shall we say a student of mine he studied my works and might even have dared to study me oh he knew well enow the words to call me up but he did not know where to find me nor even that i was here at all but alas i fancy hes no more most likely his bones adorn the upper ruins somewhere it shall delight me to discover them there one day and do for him what he might so easily have done for me while the voice of janos ferenczy so darkly and yet obscurely reminisced so dumitru zirra had crossed to the table there were copies of letters there but not in any language he could read he could make out the dates though from fifty years earlier and something of the farflung postal addresses and addressees there had been a m raynaud in paris a josef nadek in prague one colin grieve in edinburgh and a joseph curwen in providence oh and a host of others in the towns and cities of as many different lands again the writer to all of these names and addresses as witness his handwriting on the browned paper was one and the same person a certain mr hutchinson or edw h as he more frequently signed himself as for the books they meant nothing to dumitru a peasant however much travelled and practised in certain tongues and dialects such titles as the turba philosophorum bacons thesaurus chemicus and trithemiuss de lapide philosophico meant nothing to him or if they did he made no real connection but in one book which still lay open and despite the dust lying thick on its pages dumitru saw pictures which did mean something and something quite horrific for there in painstaking and paingiving detail were shown a series of the most hideous and brutal tortures the like of which caused him even halfhypnotized as he was to flinch and draw back a little distancing himself from the page but in the next moment his eyes were drawn to the rest of that rooms appurtenances which until now had not impressed themselves upon his mind that is to the great manacles fastened to the walls by heavy chains to certain badly corroded implements idly tossed to the floor in one corner and to the several iron braziers which still contained the ashes of olden fires before he could give these items any further attention however if he had wanted to dumiitruuu crooned that gurgling voice in his head now tell me have you ever thirsted have you ever wandered in a dry desert with never sight nor sign of water and felt your throat contract to a throbbing ulcer through which you can scarce draw breath well possibly you may have known a time when you felt dry as salt which might help you to understand something of the way i feel now but only something of it certainly you have never been as salt ah if only i could describe my thirst my son but enough im sure now that you perceive something of my arts my meaning my power and destiny and that the requirements of one such as i have importance far above any question of common life and lives and the time has come to introduce you to the final mystery wherein we both shall know the most exquisite ecstasies the great chimney dumiitruuu go in go into a chimney a fireplace dumitru looked at it felt the urge to draw back from it and could not massively built the firescarred hole was all of four feet wide and five high arched over and set with a central keystone at its top he need stoop only a little to pass inside before doing so he lit another torch a pause which janes ferenczy saw as a sign of hesitancy quickly now dumiitruuu the awful voice urged for even in dissolution no especially in dissolution my need is not to be kept waiting it is such that i cannot endure it dumitru passed into the fireplace held up his torch to light the place above him soared a wide scorched flue which angled back gradually into the wall holding his torch away the youth looked for light from above and saw only darkness that was not strange the chimney must pass through several angles in its climb to the surface and of course it would be blocked where the upper regions lay in ruins bringing the torch close again dumitru saw iron rungs set in the sloping back wall of the flue in its heyday the castles chimneys would need sweeping from time to time and yet there was no accumulation of soot such as might be expected apart from a superficial scorching the chimney seemed hardly used at all oh it has been used my son janos ferenczys mental voice chuckled obscenely you shall see you shall see but first step aside a little before you ascend there are those who must descend small minions of mine small friends dumitru crushed back against a side wall there came a fluttering rapidly amplified by the chimney into a roar and a colony of small bats whose hurtling bodies formed an almost solid shaft rushed down and out from the flue dispersing into the subterranean vaults for long moments they issued from the flue until dumitru began to think they must be without number but then the roaring in the chimney diminished a few latecomers shot by him and all was silence once more now climb said the ferenczy again closing his grip on the mind of his mental slave the rungs were wide and shallow twelve inches apart and set very firmly into the mortar between the stones dumitru found that he could carry his torch and using only his feet and one hand still climb easily enough after only nine or ten rungs the chimney narrowed considerably and after as many again flattened through about fortyfive degrees to become little more than an upwardsloping shaft within the space of a further twenty feet the rungs petered out and were replaced by shallow slablike steps the floor then levelled out entirely and the ceiling gradually receded to a height of some nine or ten feet now dumitru found himself in a narrow featureless stone passageway no more than three feet wide and of indeterminate length where a feeling of utmost dread quickly enveloped him bringing him to a crouching halt trembling and oozing cold sweat with his heart fluttering in his chest like a trapped bird and clammy perspiration sticking his clothes to his back and thighs the youth thrust out his torch before him up ahead in the shadows where they flickered beyond the full range of illumination a pair of yellow triangular eyes wolf eyes and feral floated low to the floor and reflected the torchs fitful light they were fixed upon dumitru an old friend of mine dumiitruuu janos ferenczys voice crawled in his mind like mental slime just like the szgany he and his kith and kin have watched over me many a year why all manner of curious folk might come wandering up here but for these wolves of mine did he perhaps frighten you you thought him below and behind you and here he is ahead but cant you see that this is my bolthole and what sort of a bolthole pray with just one way in and out no only follow this passage far enough and it emerges in a hole in the face of the sheer cliff except you shall not be required to go so far the voice scarcely bothered to disguise its threat the ferenczy would not be denied his dues now his grip on dumitrus mind and will tightened like a vice of ice and proceed he coldly commanded ahead of the youth the great wolf turned and loped on a grey shadow that merged with the greater darkness dumitru followed his step uncertain his heart pounding until he thought he could actually hear the blood singing in his ears like the ocean in the whorl of a conch and he wasnt the only one who could hear it ah my son my son the voice was a gurgle of monstrous anticipation of unbridled lust your heart leaps in you like a stag fixed with a bolt such strength such youth i feel it all but whatever it is that causes such panic in you be sure it is almost at an end dumiitruuu the passage widened on dumitrus left the wall as before but on his right a depression a trench running parallel cut in the solid rock indeed in bedrock that deepened with each pace he took he extended his torch out over the rim and looked down and in the deepest section of the trench saw the rim and narrow neck of a black urn halfburied in dark soil the rim of the urn like a dark pouting mouth with lips that seemed to expand and contract loathsomely in the flickering light stood some five feet below the level of dumitrus path beyond the urn the bed of the trench had been raised up cut in a v like a sluice it sloped gently downwards to a raised rim channelled into a narrow spout which projected directly over the mouth of the urn in the other direction the vshaped bed sloped upwards and out of sight into shadows the raised rim of rock and carved spout above the urn looked for all the world like guttering over a rain barrel and like guttering they were stained black from the flow of some nameless liquid for several long moments dumitru stood trembling there gasping not fully understanding what he saw but knowing with every instinct of his being that whatever it was this contrivance was the very embodiment of evil and as he oozed cold slimy sweat and felt his entire body racked with shudders so the voice of his tormentor came again in his staggering mind go on my son that terrible voice urged a pace or two more dumiitruuu and all will become apparent but carefully very carefully dont faint or fall from the path whatever you do two more paces and the youths bulging eyes never leaving that terrible urn nor even blinking until he saw the place where the trench came to an end a black oblong like an open grave and as the light of his torch fell within what that terrible space contained spikes needlesharp fangs of rusted iron filling that final gap side to side and end to end three dozen of them at least and dumitru knew their meaning and the ferenczys terrible purpose in an instant oh hahaahaaa hahaaa terrible laughter filled dumitrus mind if not his ears and so finally its a battle of wills eh my son a battle of wills dumitrus will hardened he fought for control of his mind his young powerful muscles and i wont kill myself for you old devil he gasped of course you wont dumiitruuu not even i can make you do that not against your will beguilement has its limits you see no you wont kill yourself my son i shall do that indeed already have dumitru found his limbs full of a sudden strength his mind free at last of the ferenczys shackles licking his lips eyes starting out he looked this way and that which way to run somewhere up ahead a great wolf waited but he still had his torch the wolf would back off before its flaring and behind him from behind him in this previously still place suddenly the air came rushing like a wind fanned by a myriad of wings the bats in another moment the crushing claustrophobia of the place crashed down on dumitru even without the bats whose return seemed imminent he knew he could never find courage to retrace his steps down the false flue and then through the castles vaults with their graveyard loot and on up that echoing stone stairwell to the outside world no there was only one way forward to whatever awaited him and as the first bats came in a rush so he hurled himself along the stone ledge which at once tilted under his weight and ahaaa said the awful voice in his head full of triumph now but even a big wolf weighs much less than a man full grown dumiitruuu opposite the spiked pit the ledge and entire section of wall that backed it an l of hewn stone tilted through ninety degrees and tossed dumitru onto the spikes his single shriek of realization and the horror it brought combined was cut off short as he was pierced through skull and spine and most of his vital organs but not his heart still beating his heart continued to pump his blood to pump it out through the many lacerations of his impaled writhing body and did i not say it would be an ecstasy dumiitruuu and did i not say id kill you the monsters gloating words came floating through all the youths agonies but dimly and fading as was the agony itself and that was the last of janos ferenczys torments his final taunt for now dumitru could no longer hear him but janos was not disappointed no for now there was that which was far more important an ancient thirst to quench at least until the next time blood coursed down the vshaped channel spurted from the spout splashed down into the mouth of the urn to wet whatever was inside ancient ashes salts the chemicals of a man of a monster soaked it up bubbled and bulked out smoked and smouldered such was the chemical reaction that the obscene lips of the urn seemed almost to belch in a little while the great wolf came back he passed scornfully under the bats where they chittered and formed a ceiling of living fur stepped timidly where the pivoting floor and wall of the passage had rocked smoothly back into place and paused to gaze down at the now silent urn then he whined deep in the back of his throat jumped down into the pit and up onto the runnelled slab above the urn and crept timidly between the spikes to a clear area at the head of the trench there he turned about and began to free dumitrus drained body from the spikes lifting the corpse from them bloodied shaft by bloodied shaft when this was done hed jump up out of the pit which wasnt deep here reach down and worry the body out and drag it to the place of many bones where he could feed at will it was a routine with which the old wolf was quite familiar hed performed this task on several previous occasions so had his father before him and his and his seekers savirsin romania evening of the first friday in august the gaststube of an inn perched on the steep mountainside at the eastern extreme of the town where the road climbs up through many hairpin bends and out of sight into the pines three young americans tourists by their looks and rig sat together at a chipped agesblackened heavilygrained circular wooden table in one corner of the barroom their clothes were casual one of them smoked a cigarette their drinks were local beers not especially strong but stinging to the palate and very refreshing at the bar itself a pair of gnarled mountain men hunters complete with rifles so ancient they must surely qualify as antiques had guffawed and slapped backs and bragged of their prowess and not only as hunters of beasts for over an hour before one of them suddenly took on a surprised look staggered back from the bar and with a slurred oath aimed himself reeling through the door out into the smoky bluegrey twilight his rifle lay on the bar where hed left it the bartender not a little gingerly took it up and put it carefully away out of sight then continued to wash and dry the days used glasses the departed hunters drinking companion and partner in crime or whatever roared with renewed laughter he slapped the bar explosively finished off the others plum brandy and threw back his own then looked around for more sport and of course he spied the americans where they sat at their ease making casual conversation in fact and until now their conversation had centred on him but he didnt know that he ordered another drink and whatever they were drinking for them at the table one for the barman too and swayed his way over to them before filling the order the barman took his rifle too and placed it safely with the other gogosu the old hunter growled thumbing himself in his leatherclad chest emil gogosu and you touristi are you he spoke romanian the dialect of the area which leaned a little towards hungarian all three they smiled back at him two of them somewhat warily but the third translated and quickly answered tourists yes from america the usa sit down emil gogosu and talk to us taken by surprise the hunter said eh eh you have the tongue youre a guide for these two eh profitable is it the younger man laughed god no im with them im one of them an american impossible gogosu declared taking a seat what why j never before heard such a thing foreigners speaking the tongue youre pulling my leg right gogosu was peasant romanian through and through he had a brown weatherbeaten face grey bullhorn moustaches stained yellow in the middle from pipesmoking long sideburns curling in towards his upper lip and penetrating grey eyes under bristling even greyer brows he wore a patched leather jacket with a high collar that buttoned up to the neck over a white shirt whose sleeves fitted snug at the wrist his fur caciula cap was held fast under the right epaulet of his jacket a halffilled bandolier passed under the left epaulet crossed his chest diagonally fed itself up under his right arm and across his back a wide leather belt supported a sheath and hunters knife several pouches and his coarselywoven trousers which he wore tucked into his climbers pigskin calfboots a small man still he looked strong and wiry all in all he was a picturesque specimen we were talking about you their interpreter told him eh oh gogosu looked from one face to the next all the way round about me so im a figure of curiosity ami of admiration the wily american answered a hunter by your looks and good at it or so wed guess youd know this country these mountains well there isnt a man knows em better gogosu declared but he was wily too and now his eyes narrowed a little youre looking for a guide eh we could be we could be the other slowly nodded but there are guides and there are guides you ask some guides to show you a ruined castle on a mountain and they promise you the earth the very castle of dracula they say and then they take you to a pile of rocks that looks like someones pigsty collapsed aye ruins emil gogosu thats what were interested in for photographs for pictures for mood and atmosphere the barman delivered their drinks and gogosu tossed his straight back eh eh youre going to make one of those picture things right moving pictures the old vampire in his castle chasing the girls with the wobbling breasts god yes ive seen em the pictures i mean down in old lugoj where theres a picturehouse not the girls no sodall wobbly tits round here i can tell you withered paps at best in this neck of the woods my lads but ive seen the pictures and thats what youre looking for eh ruins oddly and despite the brandy hed consumed the old boy seemed to have sobered a little his eyes focussed more readily became more fixed in their orbits as he studied the americans each in his turn first there was their interpreter he was a queer one for sure with his knowledge of the tongue and what all he was tall this one a sixfooter with inches to spare long in the leg lean in the hip and broad at the shoulders and now that gogosu looked closer he could see that he wasnt just american not all american anyway whats your name eh whats your name the hunter took the young mans hand and made to tighten his grip on it but it was snatched back at once and down out of sight under the table george the owner of the refused hand quickly replied reclaiming gogosus startledtoflight attention george vulpe vulpe the hunter laughed out loud and slapped the table making their drinks dance oh ive known a few vulpes in my time but george what kind of a name is george to go with a name like vulpe eh now come on lets be straight you and i you mean gheorghe dont you the others dark eyes darkened more yet and seemed to brood a very little but then they relaxed and exchanged grin for grin with the grey eyes of their inquisitor well youre a sharp one emil their owner finally said sharpeyed too yes i was romanian once theres a story to it but its not much the gnarled old hunter returned to studying him tell it anyway he said giving vulpe a slow onceover and the young man shrugged and sat back in his chair well i was born here under the mountains he said his voice as soft as his deceptively soft mouth he smiled and flashed perfect teeth so they should be gogosu thought in a man only twentysix or seven years old born here vulpe repeated yes but its only a dim and distant memory now my folks were travellers which accounts for my looks you recognized me from my tanned skin right and my dark eyes aye gogosu nodded and from the thin lobes of your ears which would take a nice gold ring and from your high forehead and wolfish jaw which arent uncommon in the szgany oh your origins are obvious enough to a man who can see so what happened happened again vulpes shrug my parents moved to the cities settled down became workers instead of the drones theyd always been drones you believe that no but the authorities did they gave them a flat in craiova right next to the new railway the mortar was rotten and shaky from the trains the plaster was coming off the walls someones toilet in the flat above leaked on us but it was good enough for workshy drones they said and until i was eleven thats where id play next to the tracks then one night a train was derailed it ploughed right into our block took away a wall brought the whole place crashing down i was lucky enough to live through it but my people died and for a while i thought id be better off dead too because my spine had been crushed and i was a cripple but someone heard about me and there was a scheme on at the time an exchange of doctors and patients between american and romanian rehabilitation clinics and because i was an orphan i was given priority not bad for a drone eh so i went to the usa and they fixed me up whats more they adopted me too two of them did anyway and because i was only a boy and there was no one left back here why i was allowed to stay ah said gogosu and so now youre an american well ill believe you but its strange for gypsies to leave the open road sometimes they get thrown out and go their own ways disputes and what have you in the camps usually over a woman or a horse but rarely to settle in towns what was it with your folks did they cross the gypsy king or something i dont know i was only a boy vulpe answered i think perhaps they feared for me i was a weak little thing apparently a runt at any rate they left the night i was born and covered their tracks and never went back a runt gogosu raised an eyebrow looked vulpe up and down yet again well youd not know it now but they covered their tracks you say thats it then say no more thered been trouble in the camp for sure ill give you odds your father and mother were secret lovers and she was promised to another then you came along so he stole her away oh it happens thats a very romantic notion vulpe said and who knows you could be right my god were ignorant gogosu suddenly exploded beckoning to the barman heres you and me chatting in this old tongue of ours and your two friends bewildered and left out entirely now let me get you all another drink and then well have some introductions i want to know why youre here and what i can do to help and how much youll pay me to take you to some real ruins the drinks are on us said vulpe and no arguments god do you expect us to keep up with you emil gogosu now slow down or youll have us all under the table before weve even got things sorted out as for introductions thats easy he clasped the shoulder of the american closest to him this great gangly one is seth armstrong from texas they build them tall there emil as you can see but then its a big state why your entire romania would fit into texas alone three times over gogosu was suitably impressed he shook hands with armstrong and looked him over the texan was big and rawboned with honest blue eyes in an open face sparse strawcoloured hair arms and legs as long and thin as poles his nose was long over a wide expressive mouth and a heavy bristly chin just a little short of seventyeight inches even seated armstrong came up head and shoulders above the others hah said the hunter this texas would have to be big to accommodate such as him vulpe translated then nodded in the direction of the third member of his group and this one he said is randy laverne from madison wisconsin it mightnt be so mountainous up there but believe me it can get just as cold cold said gogosu well that shouldnt bother this one i envy him all that good meat on his bones and all the good meals it took to put it there but its not much use in climbing me im able to cling to the rocks snug as a lichen in places where gravity would get him for sure vulpe translated and laverne laughed goodnaturedly he was the youngest and smallest of the three americans twentyfive frecklefaced way overweight and constantly hungry his face was round and topped with wavy red hair his green eyes friendly and full of fun the corners of his eyes and mouth running into mazes of laughter lines but there was nothing soft about him his huge hands were incredibly strong a legacy of his blacksmith father very well said george vulpe so now we know each other or rather you know us but what about you emil youre a hunter yes but what else nothing else said gogosu i dont need to be anything else ive a small house and a smaller woman in ilia in the summer i hunt wild pig and sell meat to the butchers and skins to the tailors and boot makers in the winter i take furs and kill a few foxes and they hire me to shoot the occasional wolf and so i make a living barely and now maybe ill be a guide too why not for i know the heights as well as the eagles who nest in em and the odd ruined castle you can show us one of those too castles abound said gogosu but you told me there are guides and guides well so are there castles and castles and youre right anyone can show you a tumble of old boulders and call it a castle but i emil gogosu can show you a castle the americans armstrong and laverne got the gist of this and became excited armstrong in his texas drawl said hey george tell him what were really doing here explain to him how close he was when he talked about dracula and vampires and all in america vulpe told the hunter all over the world in fact transylvania and the carpatii meridionali are famous not so much for their dramatic beauty or gaunt isolation as for their myths and legends you talked of dracula who had his origins in a cruel vlad of olden times but dont you know that every year the tourists flock in their droves to visit the great drakuls homeland and the castles where hes said to have dwelled indeed its big business and we believe it could be even bigger pah said gogosu why this whole country is steeped in olden lore and superstitious myths this impaler vlads just a one of them he leaned closer lowered his voice and his eyes went big and round i could take you to a castle old as the mountains themselves a shattered keep so feared that even today its left entirely alone in a trackless place like naked bones under the moon kept secret in the lee of haunted crags he sat back and nodded his satisfaction with their expressions there after vulpe had translated randy laverne said wow and more soberly but do you think hes for real and the hunter knew what hed said he stared straight and frowning into lavernes wide eyes and instructed vulpe you tell him that i shot the last man who called me a liar right in his backside and you can also tell him this that in these ruins i know theres a great grey wolf keeps watch even today and thats a fact for ive tried to shoot him too vulpe began to translate but in the middle of it the hunter started to laugh hey hey he said not so serious and dont take my threats too much to heart oh i know my storys a wildsounding thing but its true all the same pay me for my time and trouble and come see for yourselves well what do you say vulpe held up a cautionary hand and gogosu looked at it curiously in the moment before it was withdrawn it had felt strange that hand when hed grasped it and thered been something not quite right about it when vulpe had clasped the gangling armstrongs shoulder also vulpe seemed shy about his hands and kept them out of sight most of the time now wait said the young expatriate romanian reclaiming the hunters attention lets first see if were talking about the right place the right place said gogosu puzzled and just how many such places do you think there are i meant vulpe explained lets see if maybe weve heard of this castle of yours i doubt it youll not find it on any modern maps and thats for sure i reckon the authorities think that if they leave it alone if they just ignore it for long enough then maybe itll finally crumble away no no youve not heard of this place im sure well lets check it out anyway said vulpe you see the deeds territories and history of the original dracula i mean of the wallachian prince from whom dracula took his name are well chronicled and absolutely authentic an englishman turned the fact into fiction thats all and in so doing started a legend then there was a famous frenchman who also wrote about a castle in the carpathians and possibly started a legend or two of his own and finally an american did the same thing now the thing is this american his name would mean nothing to you has since become very famous if we could find his castle it could be the dracula story all over again tourists ah but youd see some touristi then emil gogosu and who knows but that youd be chief guide eh gogosu chewed the centre of his moustache huh he finally snorted but his eyes had grown very bright and not a little greedy he rubbed his nose finally said very well so what do you want to know how can we decide if the castle i know and the one youre looking for is one and the same eh it might be simpler than you think said vulpe for example how long has this place of yours been a ruin oh it blew up before my time gogosu answered with a shrug and was at once astonished to see vulpe give a great start eh but already the american was translating to his friends and astonishment and wonder were mirrored in their faces too finally vulpe turned again to the hunter blew up you say you mean exploded or bombed yes said gogosu frowning when a wall falls it falls but some of these walls have been blasted outwards hurled afar vulpe was very excited now but he tried not to show it and did it have a name this castle what of its owner before it fell that could be very important its name gogosu screwed up his face in concentration he tapped his forehead leaned back in his chair finally shook his head my fathers father had old maps he said the name of the place was on them thats where i first saw it and when i first decided to go and see it but its name its gone now vulpe translated maps like this one said armstrong he produced a copy of an old romanian map and spread it on the table it soaked up a little beer but otherwise was fine like this one aye gogosu nodded but older far older this is just a copy here let me see he smoothed the map out stared at it in several places not shown he said my castle is not shown just a blank space well thats understandable enough gloomy old place its like i said theyd like to forget it legends you dont know the half of it and a moment later ahhhr he jerked back in his seat and clutched at his forehead with both hands jesusr cried laverne is he ok ok yes ok said emil gogosu and to vulpe now i remember gheorghe it was ferenczy vulpes bottom jaw and those of his friends fell open jesus said laverne again this time in a whisper the castle ferenczy armstrong reached over and grabbed the hunters forearm gogosu nodded thats it and thats the one eh vulpe and the others fell back in their seats gaped at each other they acted bewildered confused or simply astonished but at last vulpe said yes thats the one and youll take us to it tomorrow oh be sure i will said gogosu for a price and he looked at vulpes hands where hed spread them on the table holding down the map vulpe saw where the hunter was looking but this time made no attempt to hide his hands away instead he merely raised an eyebrow an accident the old romanian asked him if so they patched you up rather cleverly no vulpe answered no accident i was born like this its just that my parents always taught me to hide them away thats all and so i do except from my friends because of the mountains the sun seemed a little late in rising when it did it came up hot and smoky at eightthirty the three americans were waiting for gogosu on the dusty road outside the inn their packs at their feet peaked caps on their heads with tinted visors to keep out the worst of the sun the old hunter had told them hed collect them here at this hour though they hadnt been sure exactly what hed meant randy laverne had just drained a small bottle of beer and put it down to one side of the inns doorstep when they heard the rattle and clatter of a local bus these were so rare as to be nearfabulous certainly the arrival of one such demanded a photograph or two seth armstrong got out his camera and started snapping as the beatenup bus came lurching out of the pines and down the serpentine road towards the inn the thing was a wonderful contraption bald tyres bonnet vibrating to a blur over the backfiring engine windows bleary and flyspecked the drivers window was especially bloody from the eviscerations of a thousand suicided insects and emil gogosu was leaning out of the folding doors at the front with a huge grin stamped on his leathery face waving at them indicating they should get aboard the bus shuddered to a halt the driver grinned nodded and held up a roll of brown tickets gogosu stepped down and helped the three strap their packs to runningboards which went the full length of this ancient vehicle then they were aboard paid their fare collapsed or were shaken into bonejarring seats as the driver engaged a low gear to let the oneinfive downward slope do the work of his engine george vulpe was seated beside gogosu ok he said when hed recovered his breath so where are we going first the payment said the hunter old man vulpe returned ive this feeling you dont much trust us not so much of the old im only fiftyfour said gogosu i weather easy but even so i didnt get this old without learning that its sometimes best to collect your pay before the fact trust has nothing to do with it i dont want you falling off a mountain with my wages in your pocket thats all and he burst into laughter at vulpes expression but in another moment were going down to lipova where well pick up a train to sebis then well try to hitch a ride on a cart to halmagiu village and then we start climbing actually its a longcut you know what that is the opposite to a shortcut you see the castle is only oh maybe fifty kilometres from here as the crow flies but were not crows so instead of crossing the zarundului were going round em cant cross em anyway no roads and halmagiu is a good base camp for the climb now dont go getting all worried its not that much of a climb not in daylight if an old man like me can do it you young uns should shoot up there like goats couldnt we have taken the train from savirsin all the way vulpe wanted to know if there was one scheduled but there isnt dont be so eager well get there you did say you had six days left before you have to be in bucuresti to catch your plane so whats the hurry the way i reckon it we should be in sebis before noon if we make the connection in lipova there may be a bus from sebis to halmagiu which would get us there by oh twothirty at the latest or we hitch rides on trucks carts what have you so we could get in late and have to put up there for the night any time after four is too late unless you maybe fancy sleeping on the mountain we wouldnt fancy that no hah gogosu snorted fairweather climbers but in fact the weather is fair too damned warm for me thered be no problems a big tin of hungarian sausages in brine they come in cheap from across the border a loaf of black bread a cheap bottle of plum brandy and a few beers what a night under the stars in the lee of the crags with a campfire burning red and the smell of resin coming up off the pines would do you three the world of good your lungs would think theyd died and gone to lung heaven he made it sound good well see said vulpe meanwhile well pay you half now and the rest when we see these ruins youve promised us he took out a bundle of leu and counted off the notes probably more money than gogosu would normally see in a month but very little to him and his companions then topped up the hunters cupped palms with a pile of copper banis shrapnel or scrap metal to the three americans gogosu counted it all very carefully and finally tucked it away tried to keep a straight face but couldnt hold it in the end he grinned broadly and smacked his lips thatll keep me in brandy for a while he said and more hurriedly a short while you understand vulpe nodded knowingly oh yes i understand and smiled as he settled back in his half of the seat from behind the strident excited voices of armstrong and laverne grew loud to compensate for the rumble and clatter of the bus in front an old woman sat with a huge wire cage of squabbling chicks in her lap a pair of hulking young farmers were hunched on the other side of the central aisle discussing fowlpest or some such and arguing over a decadesbrowned copy of romanian farming life there was a family group in the rear of the bus all very smart incongruous uncomfortable and oddlooking in almostmodern suits and dresses possibly on their way to a wedding or reunion or whatever to vulpes american companions it must all seem very weird and wonderful but to gheorghe to george himself it was like home like coming home yes and yet as well as poignant it was also puzzling hed felt it ever since they got off the plane a fortnight ago something hed thought burned out of him in the fifteen long years since his doctor had taken him to america and come back without him hed wanted it to be burned out too that bitterness which had come with being orphaned for in those first years in america he had hated romania and couldnt even be reminded of his origins without retreating into black depression it was one of the reasons hed come back now he supposed to be able to shrug off the shroud of the place and finally say there was nothing here for them nothing here for me i escaped in short he had expected the place the entire country to depress him and make him bitter all over again but for the last time and that afterwards he really would be free of it glad that it was gone and finally forgotten he had felt that hed be able to get down out of that plane look around and shrug and say to himself who needs it but hed been wrong what pain thered been had quickly drained away instead of feeling alienated it was as if romania had at once taken hold of him and told him you were a part of this you were part of the blood of this ancient land your roots are here you know this place and it knows you especially here on these dusty roads and tracks under the mountains these lanes and forest ways and high passes these valleys and crags and forbidding desolations of skypiercing rock these dark woods and rearing aeries such places were in his blood yes if he listened hard enough he could hear them surging there like a tide on a distant shore calling to him something was calling to him certainly tell me again said gogosu digging him in the ribs vulpe started and was back in the bus drawn down from his flight of fancy if thats what it had been what tell you what why youre here what its all about i mean im damned if i can understand you vampirefanciers no said vulpe shaking his head thats why they are here he tilted his head back indicating the two in the seats behind but its only one of my reasons actually well i suppose i really wanted to know where i was born i mean i lived in craiova as a boy but thats not the same as being under the mountains but up here i guess this is it and now ive seen it and im satisfied i know what its about and what im about i can go away now and not worry about it any more the other reason youre here then the hunter insisted this thing about ruined castles and what all vulpe shrugged sighed then gave it his best shot it has to do with romance now thats something you should understand easily enough emil gogosu what you a romanian speaking a romance language in a land as full of romance as this one oh i dont mean the romance of boy and girl mean more the romance of mystery of history of myths and legends the shiver in our spines when we consider our past when we wonder who we were and where we came from the mystery of the stars worlds beyond our ken places the imagination knows but cant name or conjure except from old books or scraps of mouldering maps like when you suddenly remembered the name of your castle its the romance of tracking down legends and it infects people like a fever scientists go to the himalayas to seek the yeti or hunt for bigfoot in the north american woods theres a lake in scotland do you know where i mean where every year they sweep the deep water with echosounders as they seek evidence of a survivor out of time its the fascination in a fossil the proof that the world was here and that creatures lived in it before we did its this love man has for tracking things down for leaving no stone unturned for chipping away at coincidence until its seen that nothing is accidental and everything has not only a cause but a result its a synchronicity of soul its the mystique of stumbling across the unknown and making it known of being the first to make a connection scientists study the fossil remains of a fish believed to be extinct for sixty million years and pretty soon discover that the same species is still being fished today in the deep waters off madagascar when people got interested in the fictional dracula they were astonished to discover thered been a reallife vlad the impaler and they wanted to know more about him why he might well have been forgotten except that an author whether intentionally or otherwise gave him life and now we know more about him than ever in england in the th century there might have been a king arthur and people are still looking for him today searching harder than ever for him and its possible he was just a legend right now in america right across the world in fact there are societies dedicated to researching just such mysteries me armstrong and laverne were members of one of these groups our heroes are the oldtime writers of books of horror whose like you dont much find these days people who felt a sense of wonder and tried to transfer it to others through their writing well fifty years ago there was an american author who wrote a novel of dark mystery in it he mentioned a transylvanian castle which he called the castle ferenczy according to the story the castle was destroyed by unnatural forces in the late s my friends and i came out here to see if we could find just such a pile and now you tell us its real and you can actually show us the tumbled boulders its a perfect example of the kind of synchronicity ive been talking about but if youve romance in your soul well perhaps its more than just that oh we know that the name ferenczy isnt uncommon in these parts there are echoes from the past we know there were boyars in hungary wallachia and moldavia with the name of ferenczy weve done a little research you see but to have found you was it was marvellous and even if your castle isnt really what we expect still it will have been marvellous and what a story well have to tell our society when we all meet up again back home eh gogosu scratched his head offered a blank stare you understand not a word said the old hunter vulpe sighed deeply leaned back and closed his eyes it was obvious hed been wasting his time also he hadnt slept too well last night and believed he might try snatching forty winks on the bus well dont worry about it he mumbled oh i wont gogosu was emphatic romance im done with all that ive had my share and finished with it what longlegged girls with their wobbly breasts hah the evil old bloodsucking moroi in their gloomy castles can take the lot of em for all i care vulpe began to breathe deeply and said umm eh gogosu looked at him but already the young american was asleep or appeared to be gogosu snorted and looked away vulpe opened one eye a crack and saw the old hunter settle down then closed it again relaxed let his mind wander and in a little while he really was asleep the journey passed quickly for george vulpe he spent most of it oblivious to the outside world locked in the land of his dreams strange dreams in the main which were forgotten on the instant he opened his eyes in those several places where the journey was broken and the closer he drew to his destination the stranger his dreams became surreal as dreams usually are still they seemed paradoxically real which was even more odd for they were not visual but entirely aural it had been vulpes thought that the land itself called to him and in the back of his sleeping mind that idea remained uppermost except that now it was not so much romania as a whole which was doing the calling but a definite location a specific genius loci the source of that mental attraction was gogosus promised castle of course which now seemed provisioned with a dark and guttural voice of its own know you are near blood of my blood flesh of my flesh child of my children i wait as i have waited out the centuries feeling the brooding mountains closing me in but there is now a light in my darkness a quartercentury and more gone by since first that candle flickered into being it came when you were born and it strengthened as you grew but then i knew despair the candle was withdrawn afar its light diminished it dwindled to a distant sputtering speck and was extinguished i thought your flame dead or perhaps not put out but merely placed beyond my reach and so i put myself to the effort reached out in search of you and found you faintly gleaming in a distant land or so it was my fond preference to believe but i could not be sure and so i waited again ah its easy to wait when youre dead my son and all hope flown why theres precious little else to do but harder when youre undead and trapped between the pulsing tumult of the living and the vacuous silence of a shunned and dishonoured grave tenant neither of one nor the other denied the glory of your own legend aye even denied your rightful place in the nightmares of men for then the mind becomes a clock which ticks away all the lonely hours and one must learn to modulate the pendulum lest it go out of kilter oh indeed for the mind is finely balanced only let it race and it will soon shake itself to shards and in the end wind down to madness and yes i have known that terror that i should go mad in my loneliness and in so doing forsake forever all dreams of resurrection all hope of of being as once i was ah have i frightened you do i sense a shrinking but no this must not be an ancestor a grandfather nay your very father is what i am that selfsame blood which runs in your veins once ran in mine it is the river of lifes continuity there can be no gulf except perhaps the gulf of ages flown between such as you and i why we might even be as one oh yes and indeed we shall be friends youll see friends with a place vulpe mumbled in his sleep friends with the spirit of a place the spirit of ah i see you think that im an echo from the past a page of history torn forever from the books by timorous men a dark rune scored through defaced from the marble menhir of legends and scattered as dust because it wasnt pretty the ferenczy is gone and his bones are crumbled away his ghost walks impotent amid the scattered ruins the vastly tumbled masonry of his castle the king is dead long live the king hah you cannot conceive that i am that i remain that i sleep like you and only require awakening youre a dream said vulpe im the one who needs waking up a dream oh yes oh hahaa a dream which reached out across the world to draw you home at last a powerful dream that my son which may soon become reality gheorrrghe gheorghe emil gogosu elbowed him roughly god what a man for sleeping george seth armstrong and randy laverne finally shook him awake jesus youve slept most of the day what eh vulpes dream receded like a wave leaving him stranded in the waking world just as well for hed feared it was beginning to suck him under hed been talking to someone he remembered that much and it had all seemed very real and yet now he couldnt even be sure what it had been about he shook his head and licked his lips which were very dry where are we almost there pal said armstrong which is why we woke you up you sure youre ok you havent got a fever or something some local bug vulpe shook his head again this time in denial no im ok just catching up on a load of missed sleep i suppose and a bit disorientated as a result memories came flooding in of catching a train in lipova hitching a ride on the back of a brokendown truck to sebis paying a few extra bani to loll on a pile of hay in a woodenwheeled donkeyhauled cart straight out of the dark ages en route for halmagiu and now our drivers going thataway said laverne pointing along a track through the trees to virfurileo home and the end of the line for him and halmagius thataway he pointed along a second track seven or eight kilometres thats all said gogosu depending on how fast youre all willing to crack along we could be there in an hour and plenty of time left over to shake off the dust eat a meal moisten our throats a bit and climb a mountain before nightfall if youre up to it or we could take our food with us make camp eat and sleep in the ruins and how would that be for a story to take back home to america eh anyway its up to you they brushed straw from their clothes climbed into their packs and waved the driver of the cart farewell as he creaked from sight around a bend in the forest track and then they too got underway randy laverne uncapped a bottle of beer took a swig and passed it to vulpe who used it to wash his mouth out almost there armstrong sighed gangling along pace for pace with the sprightly gogosu and if this place is half of what its cracked up to be im sure it will be said vulpe quietly and he frowned for in fact he really was sure it would be well well know soon enough george said laverne his short legs hurrying to keep up and from some secret cave in the back of vulpes mind oh yes soon now my son soon now gheorrrghe at something less than five miles the last leg of their journey wasnt much at all in the previous week the americans had trekked close to twenty times that distance they got into halmagiu in the middle of the afternoon found lodgings for the following night washed up changed their footwear and had a snack alfresco on the open wooden balcony of their guesthouse where it overlooked the villages main street what you have to remember their guide had told them in an aside as they negotiated the price of their rooms is that these people are peasants theyre not sophisticated like me and used to the ways of foreigners citydwellers and other weird types theyre more primitive suspicious superstitious so let me do the talking youre climbers thats all no not even that youre ramblers and were not going walking up in the zarundului but the metalici whats the difference vulpe asked him later when they were eating between the zarundului and the metalici i mean the old hunter pointed northwest over the rooftops to a serrated jaw of smoky peaks goldrimmed with sunlight thems the metalici he said the zarundului are behind us theyre grey always greygreen in the spring greybrown in the autumn grey in the winter and white of course the castle is right up on the tree line backed up to a cliff aye a cliff at its back and a gorge at its front a keep a stronghold in the old days one hell of a place to crack i meant vulpe was patient why shouldnt the locals know were going there gogosu wriggled uncomfortably superstitious like i said they call those heights the szgany mountains because the travelling folk are so respectful of them the locals dont go climbing up there themselves and they probably wouldnt like us doing it neither because of the ruins again gogosu wriggled cant say dont know dont much care but a couple of winters ago when i tried to shoot an old wolf up there why these people treated me like a leper there are foxes in the foothills that raid the farms but they wont hunt or trap em theyre funny that way thats all the grandfathers tell ghost stories to keep the young uns away you know the old wampir in his castle but theyll see us headed that way surely no for well skirt round vulpe was wary i mean were not moving onto government property or something are we there isnt a military training area or anything like that up there is there lord no gogosu was getting annoyed now its like i said stupid superstition thats all you have to remember if a young un dies up here and no simple explanation for it they still put a clove of garlic in his mouth before they nail the lid down on him aye and sometimes they do a lot more than that too so leave it be before you get me frightening myself right seth armstrong spoke up i keep hearing this word szgany whats it mean gogosu didnt need an interpreter for that one he turned to armstrong and in broken english said in the germany is zigeuner da here is szgany the roadpeoples gypsies said vulpe nodding my kind of people he turned and looked back into the dusty yellow interior of the inns upper levels looked into the rooms across the stairwell and out through the rear wall it was as if his gaze was unrestricted by the matter of the inn tilting his head back he looked at the grey unseen mountains of the zarundului where they reared just a few miles away and pictured them frowning back at him and thought to himself maybe the locals are right and there are places men shouldnt go and unheard a chuckling secretive dark and sinister voice answered him oh there are my son but you will gheorrrghe you will the climb was easy at first almost pm and the sun descending steadily towards the misted valley floor betwen mount codrului and the western extremity of the zarandului range but gogosu was confident that theyd reach the ruins before twilight find a place to camp inside a broken wall get a fire going eat and eventually sleep there in the lee of legends i wouldnt do it on my own he admitted picking his way up a stepped ridge towards a chimney in a crumbling buttress of cliff lord no but four of us hale and hearty whats to fear vulpe the last in line paused to translate and look around the others couldnt see it but his expression was puzzled he seemed to recognize this place dйjа vu he let his companions draw away from him armstrong directly behind their guide asked well and what is there to fear he reached back to give laverne a hand where he puffed and panted only ones own imagination said gogosu understanding the question from its modulation for its all too ready to conjure not only warriorghosts out of the past but a whole heap of mundane menaces from the present too aye the mind of mans a powerful force when hes on his own theres plenty of scope up ahead for wild imaginings i can tell you but apart from that in the winter you might observe the occasional wolf wandering down here from the northern carpatii his tone of voice contained a careless shrug theyre safe enough the grey ones except in packs the old hunter paused at the base of the chimney turning to see how the others were progressing where they laboured in his tracks but vulpe had skirted the ridge and was moving along the base of the cliffs to a point where they cut back out of sight around a corner oh the old hunter hailed him and where are you off to then gheorghe the young american looked up and back his face was pale in the shadow of the cliff and his forehead furrowed in a frown of concentration youre making hard work of it my friend he called out his voice echoing from crag to crag why climb when you can walk eh theres an old track here thats simplicity itself to follow the way may be longer but its faster too and a sight kinder to your hands and knees ill meet you where your route and mine come together again halfway up where our routes gogosu was baffled at first then annoyed and not a little sarcastic oh i see he yelled and youve been this way before eh but vulpe had already turned into the reentry and out of sight no his voice came echoing its just instinct i suppose huh gogosu snorted instinct but then as he started in to tackle the chimney he gave a chuckle oh let him go he said hell double back soon enough when the track runs out and the shadows start to creep mark my words it wont be long before hes seeing wolves in every shrub and by god how hell hurry to catch up then but he was wrong an hour later when the way was steeper and the light beginning to fail they reached the broad ledge of a false plateau and found vulpe stretched out chewing on a twig waiting for them hed been there some time it seemed he nodded when he saw them said the rest of the ways easy gogosu scowled and anderson merely returned vulpes nod but laverne was hot and angry taking a bit of a chance there werent you george he growled what if youd got lost vulpe seemed surprised by the testiness in his friends voice lost i i didnt even consider it fact is i seem to be something of a natural at this sort of thing nothing more was said and they all rested for a few minutes then gogosu stood up well he said half an hour more and were there he bowed stiffly to vulpe from the waist and added if youd care to lead the way his sarcasm was wasted vulpe took the lead and made easy going of the final climb they reached the penultimate crest just as the sun sank down behind the western range the view was wonderful bluegrey valleys brimming with mist and the mountains rising out of it and smoke from the villages smudging the sky where the distant peaks faded from gold to grey the four men stood on the rim of a pineclad saddle or shallow fold between marching rows of peaks gogosu pointed along there he said we follow the rising ground through the trees until we hit the gorge there where the mountain is split set back against the cliff the ruins of the ferenczys castle vulpe anticipated him the hunter nodded and just enough light to settle in and get a fire going against the fall of night are we all ready then but george vulpe was already leading the way as they went the eerie cry of a wolf came drifting on the resinladen air gradually fading into mournful ululations damn me gogosu cursed as he stumbled to a halt he cocked his head on one side sniffed at the air listened intently but there was no repeat performance unslinging his rifle from behind his back he said did you hear that and can you credit it its a sure sign of a hard winter to come they say when the wolves are as early as this and turning aside a little from the others he made sure his weapon was loaded finders in the hour before midnight a mist came up that lapped at the castles stones and filled in the gaps between so that the ancient riven walls seemed afloat on a gently undulating sea of milk under a shining bluegrey moon whose features were perfectly distinct george vulpe sat beside the fire and fed it with branches gathered in the twilight watched the occasional spark jump skyward to join the stars and blink out before ever they were reached he had volunteered for first watch having slept through most of the day he would in any case be the obvious choice emil gogosu had insisted there was no real need for anyone to remain awake but at the same time he had not objected when the americans worked out a roster vulpe would be first and take the real weight of it seth armstrong would go from am till and randy laverne would be on till sevenish when hed wake gogosu that suited the old hunter fine it would be dawn then anyway and he didnt believe in lying abed once the sun was up both gogosu and armstrong were now fast asleep the first wrapped in a blanket and wedged in a groove of halfburied stones with his feet pointing at the fire and the last in his sleepingbag using his jacket wadded over a rounded stone as a pillow laverne was awake barely he had eaten too many of the boiled hungarian sausages and too much of the local black bread his indigestion kept burping him awake just as he thought he was going under he lay furthest from the fire in the shadows of the castles wall his sleepingbag tossed down on a bed of living pine twigs stripped from the branches of trees where they encroached on the ruins facing the fire he was drowsily aware of vulpe sitting there his occasional motion as he shoved the end of this or that branch a little deeper into the red and yellow heart of incandescence what he was not aware of was the insidious change coming over his friend the gradual submersion of vulpes mind in strange reverie the pseudomemories which passed before his eyes or limned themselves in the eye of his mind like ghostly pictures superimposed on the flickering flames nor could he know of the hypnotic vampiric influence which even now wheedled and insinuated itself into vulpes conscious and subconscious being but when a branch burned through and fell sputtering into the heart of the fire laverne heard it and started more fully awake he sat up in time to see a dark shadow pass into even greater darkness through a gap in the old wall a shadow that moved with an inexorable zombielike rigidity like a sleepwalker its feet causing eddies in the lap and swirl of creeping mist and he knew that the shadow could only have been george vulpe for his sleepingbag was empty where it lay crumpled against a leaning boulder in the glow of the fire lavernes mind cleared he unzipped himself from his bed sought his climbing shoes and pulled them on with fingers which were still leaden from sleep he drew laces tight and tied fumbling knots still rising up from his halfsleep he nevertheless hurried there had been something in the way george moved not furtive but at the same time silently yes like a sleepwalker hed been that way sort of all day sleeping through the journey not entirely with it even when he was fully awake and the way hed climbed up here like it was something he did every friday morning before breakfast passing close to gogosu and armstrong where they lay laverne thought to wake them then thought again that would all take time and meanwhile george might easily have toppled headfirst into the gorge or brained himself on one of the many low archways in the ranks of tottering walls laverne knew his own strength hed be able to handle george on his own if it came to it he didnt need the others and it would be a shame to rouse them for nothing so hed take care of this himself the only thing he mustnt do if in fact george was sleepwalking was shock him awake careful where he stepped through the inchesdeep ground mist laverne followed vulpes exact route passed through the same gap in the wall and moved deeper into the ruins they were extensive covering almost an acre if one took into account those walls which had fallen or been blasted outwards away from the sleepers and the firelight he switched on a pocket torch and aimed its beam ahead the ground rose up a little here where heaps of tumbled stones stood higher than the lapping mist like islands in some strange white sea in the torch beam caught in the moment before he passed behind a shattered wall george vulpe paused briefly and looked back his eyes seemed huge as lanterns reflecting the electric light georges eyes and the eyes of something else they were there only for a single moment then gone blinking out like lights switched off a pair of eyes low to the ground triangular feral a wolf laverne swung his beam wildly aimed it this way and that crouched down a little and turned in a complete circle he saw nothing just ragged walls mounds of stones empty archways and inky darkness beyond and a little way to the rear the friendly glow of the campfire like a pharos in the night theyd made a wise choice not to start exploring this place in the twilight it was just too big its condition too dangerous and maybe laverne had been mistaken to leave the others sleeping but a wolf or just his imagination a fox more likely this would be the ideal spot for foxes thered be room for dens galore in the caves of these ruins and hadnt gogosu mentioned how the locals wouldnt shoot or hunt the foxes who raided from up here yes he had so thats what it had been then a fox or a wolf laverne had a pocketknife with a threeinch blade he took it out opened it up and weighed it in his hand great for opening letters peeling apples or whittling wood but in any case better than nothing christ why hadnt he shaken the others awake but too late for that now and meanwhile george was getting away from him george he whispered following on george for chrissakes where the hell are you laverne reached the corner of crumbling wall where vulpe had disappeared beyond it lay a large area silvered by moonlight which might once have been a great hall on the far side behind a jumble of broken masonry and shattered roof slates the silhouette of a man stood outlined from the waist up laverne recognized the figure as george vulpe even as he watched it took a step forward and down in that stiff robotic way until only the head and shoulders were showing then another step and the head might be a round boulder atop the pile another and vulpe had vanished from sight into what a hole or halfchoked stairwell where did the idiot think he was going how did he know where he was going george laverne called again a little louder this time and again he went in pursuit beyond the pile of rubble there where a small area of debris had been cleared away down to the original stone flags of the floor a hole gaped blackly descending into the bowels of the place at one end of the hole or stairwell a long narrow pivoting slab had been raised by means of an iron ring and now leaned slightly out of the perpendicular away from the space it had covered laverne flashed his torch into the gap saw stone steps descending carried on a staletasting updraught came a whiff of something burning mingled with musk and less easily identified odours glimpsed in the darkness down below the merest flicker of yellow light immediately disappearing into the unknown depths the paunchy young american paused for a brief moment but the mystery was such that he had to follow it up george he said again his whisper a croak as he squeezed down into the hole after that it was easy to lose track of time direction ones entire orientation moreover the pressure spring in lavernes torch had lost some of its tension battery contact was weak which resulted in a poor beam of light that came and went so that every so often he must give the torch a nervous shake to restore its power the stone steps were narrow and descended spirally winding round a central core which was solid enough in itself but outwards from the spiral all was darkness and echoing space and laverne hated to think how far he might fall if he slipped or stumbled he made sure he did neither but how would george vulpe be faring sleepwalking in a place like this if he was sleepwalking finally a floor was reached with evidence of a fire or explosion on every hand in the shape of scorched and blackened walls and fallen blocks of carved masonry and here a second trapdoor slab then more steps leading down ever down occasionally laverne would see the flaring of a torch a real torch down below at some undetermined depth or smell its smoke drifting up to him but never a sound from vulpe who must know this place extremely well to negotiate its hazards so cleanly and silently how he could possibly know it so well was a different matter but laverne felt his anger rising commensurate to the depths into which he descended surely he and seth armstrong were the victims of a huge joke in which gogosu was possibly a participant no less than vulpe ever since last night when theyd met the old hunter it had been as if this entire venture were preordained worked out in advance by whom and hadnt george been born here hadnt he lived here or if not here exactly then somewhere in romania and finally vulpes descent into the black guts of this place when he thought the others were asleep what little surprise was he planning now and why go to such elaborate lengths anyway if hed known of this place and been here before as a boy perhaps couldnt he have let them in on it it wouldnt have been any the less fascinating for that the castle ferenczy laverne snorted now to himself shit and how many leu had vulpe coughed up he wondered to get old gogosu to play his part in this farce very angry now he stepped down onto a second floor where he paused to call out more loudly yet george what the fuck are you up to eh his cry disturbed the air brought down rills of dust from unseen heights and ceilings as its echoes boomed out and came back distorted and discordant laverne nervously explored the place with the smoky jittery beam of his torch he was in the vaults the place of frescoed walls many archways centuriesblackened oaken racks urns and amphorae festoons of cobwebs and layers of drifted dust and there were footprints in the dust quite a few of them the most recent of these could only be vulpes laverne followed the direction they took and ahead caught a glimpse of flaring torchlight where it lit the curve of an archway before disappearing you bastard laverne thought youd have to be deaf not to know im back here youve got a hell of a lot of explaining to do good buddy and if i dont like what you have to from above and behind on the stone stairs where they wound up into darkness there came the soft pad of feet and a softer whining a pebble disturbed came clattering down the steps then all was silence again shaking like a leaf suddenly cold and clammy laverne aimed his torch up the stairwell jesus he gasped jesus but there was nothing and no one there or perhaps a shadow drawing back out of sight laverne stumbled across the stoneflagged floor of the great room through an archway and into other rooms beyond it his ragged breathing and muffled footfalls seemed to echo thunderously but he made no effort to be silent he must shorten the distance between vulpe and himself right now and find out exactly what the bastard was doing down here the glow of vulpes torch came again and the resinous stench of its burning laverne plunged in that direction through drifts of dust salts and chemicals where they lay spilled on the floor until this room was different from the others he paused under the archway prior to entering cast about with his weakening beam mouldy tapestries on the walls a tiled floor inlaid with a pictorial mosaic which illustrated some strange ancient motif a desk thick with dust laid out with books papers and other writing implements a massive fireplace and chimneybreast and the flickering glow of a naked flame coming down out of that fireplace george vulpe had stepped inside there finding not a little difficulty in breathing laverne gasped george he quickly crossed the room and stooped a little to aim his feeble beam of light up under the low arch of the fireplace in there fixed in a bracket in the rear wall he saw vulpes smoky flaring torch but no vulpe a hand fell on lavernes shoulder jesus god he cried out as adrenalin pumped and he snapped erect the back of his head crunched into collision with the keystone of the arch over the fireplace he reeled away across the room and for a moment vulpe was trapped in his torchs beam the other stood there silent as a ghost his hand still reaching out towards him laverne went to his knees on the floor clutched at the back of his head his hand came away wet with blood sick and dizzy he kneeled there he was lucky he hadnt brained himself but anger quickly replaced his pain he found his orientation again aimed his torch where last hed seen vulpe but vulpe sleepwalker clown asshole or whatever he was wasnt there only a fading flicker of yellow fire from within the chimneybreast laverne staggered to his feet he found his knife lying where hed dropped it close to the chimney he closed it and put it away he wouldnt need a knife for the beating he was going to give gheorghe vulpe and when he was done with him the bastard could find his own way back out of here if he had the strength for it steadier now gritting his teeth laverne went again to the fireplace he ducked inside and at once sawthe rungs in the back wall of the flue from up above he heard sounds the echoing scrape of shoes a low cough and what goes up he thought must come down maybe he should wait right here for the idiot except that was when vulpe screamed laverne had never heard a scream like it it followed close on a nerverending grating sound like massive surfaces of rock sliding together and rose to a vibrating falsetto crescendo before shutting off at highest pitch and as its echoes died away they were followed by a glottal gurgling and gasping vulpe was going ak ak ak ak as if choking a sort of slow deathrattle laverne his hair standing on end didnt actually know what a deathrattle sounded like but he felt that if the sound were suddenly to speed up to akakakak then that would be his friends last gasp oh jeeesus he whined and drove himself clattering up the rungs and through the flue to the place where it curved through ninety degrees to become a passage twenty or twentyfive paces ahead there lay vulpes torch still flickering fitfully and giving off black smoke where it teetered on the rim of a trench cut in the stone floor to the right of the passageway but of vulpe himself no sign only the choking agonized ak ak ak sounds which seemed to be coming from the trench george laverne hurried forward and came to an abrupt halt beyond the guttering brand where neither its light nor his own torch beam could reach triangular eyes floated in the darkness unblinking unyielding unnerving laverne wasnt an especially brave man but he wasnt a coward either whatever the creature was up ahead fox wolf or feral dog it wouldnt much care for fire he lumbered forward and snatched up the smouldering torch and waved it overhead to get it going again a whoosh of flame at once rewarded his efforts and the gathering shadows were driven back likewise the creature along the passageway laverne caught a glimpse of something grey slinking canine before it was swallowed up in gloom he also caught a glimpse of something in the trench something which drove him back against the wall like a blow from a huge fist gasping his shock his horror feeling his blood running cold in his veins laverne tremblingly held out the torch over the trench his disbelieving eyes took in the bed of spikes and the figure of his friend crucified and worse upon them george vulpe squirmed there impaled through his cheek neck shoulders and arms nailed through his back buttocks and thighs issuing blood from each dark gash and puncture which coloured the rusty spikes and flowed in thickly converging streams around and between his twitching feet into the channel and down towards the stone spout mother of god laverne croaked ak ak ak said vulpe the words bursting in bloody bubbles from his pallid lips and along the passageway the great old grey one growled low in his throat and paced slowly stifflegged into full view vulpe was finished that much was plain an army of nurses with a ton of bandages between them couldnt have stopped him bleeding his last not now laverne couldnt save him neither from the bed of spikes nor from the wolf on nerveless legs he backed off shuffling crablike sideways back along the passage back towards the shallow steps leading to the false flue it was all over for george everything was over for him and now laverne must think only of himself and as vulpes blood commenced to gurgle from the carved stone spout into the mouth of the urn so the overweight american backed away faster yet and paused abruptly wobbling like a jelly there in the narrow mould of the passageway in front the wolf its face a snarling mask in the torchlight between the dying man on his torturebed of spikes and now now there was something else behind no longer breathing laverne cranked his head round like a nut on a rusty bolt at first he made little of what he was seeing all the edges were indistinct weirdly mobile the ceiling seemed to have lowered itself the passage to have narrowed the floor to have become heaped with something something furry something that rustled and flopped lavernes eyes bugged as he thrust out his torch in that direction bugged more yet as several small parts of that anomalous furriness detached themselves from the moving walls and darted by him in fluttering swoops and dives bats a colony of bats and more of them clustering to the walls floor and ceiling even as he grimaced his disgust he looked back the other way the wolf had come to a standstill its ears were pointed into the trench its attention centred on the urn cold as death reeling and panting for air laverne looked where it looked he looked saw and knew that he was on the verge of fainting his blood was pooling his senses whirling but he also knew that he dared not faint not in this nightmare place and certainly not now the urn was belching puffs of vapour like small smoke rings were issuing from its obscene mouth black slime bubbling up from within was blistering on the cold rim like congealing tar as vulpes blood was consumed so something was forming and expanding within the urn a catalyst his blood transformed what was within hypnotized by horror laverne could only watch a mottled bluegrey tentacle of slime crimsonveined slopped upwards out of the mouth of the urn and into the stone spout elongating it slid like a snake along the trail of blood to where vulpe lay transfixed sentient it curled round his right leg where it was bent at the knee surged along the impaled thigh and across his belly crept over his palpitating chest he continued to gasp ak ak argh but agony had very nearly inured him numbed him into a mental limbo and loss of his lifes blood was quickly finishing the job somehow summoning up his last ounce of strength from the very roots of his will vulpe managed to lift his face up off the spike which pierced his right cheek and lower jaw and conscious to the last he saw what reared on his chest and even now formed a flat swaying blind cobra head his bloody jaws flew open perhaps in a scream though none came and the leechthing at once drove itself into his yawning mouth and down his straining gullet he convulsed on the spikes his lips split at their corners as his jaws were forced apart and the now corrugated pulsating bulk of the thing thrust into him the urn was empty now steaming and slimed where the tail of the leechcreature had snaked free but still vulpe gagged and frothed and bled from his nostrils as the horror filled him his neck was fat from its passage into him his eyes stood out as if to burst from their sockets his threefingered hands tore free of the spikes and grasped at the monster raping his throat trying to tear it out of him to no avail in another moment the entire creature had entered him and still he tossed on the spikes flopped his head this way and that slopped blood and mucus all around oh jesus oh great god in heaven laverne wailed die for christs sake he instructed vulpe let it go be still and it was as if george vulpe heard him he did let it go he was suddenly still the entire scene stood frozen timeless the great wolf a statue blocking the way forward the bats almost completely choking lavernes single route of exit the drained and hideously refilled body of his friend motionless on its bed of spikes only the flickering torch in lavernes hand had any life of its own and that too was dying in one badly shaking hand the firebrand and in the other his pockettorch randy laverne could never have said how hed hung on to either one of them but now snarling his outrage and terror he turned to the wall of bats and thrust at it with his smoking guttering torch they didnt retreat but clustered to the firebrand smothered it with their scorching crackling bodies put it out a dozen dead or dying bats fell to the floor of the passage were ploughed under by the creeping furry tide of their cousins where they wriggled and flopped forward laverne went a little mad then he screamed hoarsely brokenly he panted gasped and screamed again he lashed out with his arms in the neardarkness and aimed the ailing beam of his electric torch this way and that all around never giving himself a moments time to see anything he did not see george vulpe wrench himself upright free of the spikes in the trench or the way his gashes had stopped bleeding and were mending themselves even now nor did he see him climb up from the trench fondling the old wolfs ears and smiling especially he did not see that smile no his act of dropping the electric torch and sliding semiconscious down the wall to crumple on the floor of the passage was occasioned by none of these things but by vulpes sudden appearance his rising up there directly before him by that and by his redly glaring eyes and his entirely alien phlegmclotted voice saying my friend you came to this place of your own free will and i believe you are bleeding vulpes nostrils opened wide sniffed and his eyes became fiery slits in that preternaturally pale face indeed im sure you are now really someone should see to that wound before something gets into it emil gogosu woke up to find someone kneeling close by it was young gheorghe one hand shaking the hunter awake the other holding a warning finger to his lips shhhr he hushed eh what is it gogosu whispered at once wide awake and peering about in the night the fire was burning low its heart redly reflecting from vulpes eyes dawn already i dont believe it not dawn the other replied also in a whisper however hoarse and urgent something else he stood up come bring your gun gogosu unrolled himself from his blanket reached for his rifle and came lithely to his feet he prided himself that his bones didnt ache come vulpe said again stepping carefully so as not to wake armstrong as they left the campfire and the ruins behind and the darkness began to close in the hunter caught at vulpes arm your face he said is that blood whats been going on gheorghe i didnt hear anything blood yes the other answered i was keeping watch i heard something out here in the trees there and went to see it might have been a dog or fox even a wolf but it attacked me i fought it off i think it may have bitten my face and its still out here it was following me as i came back for you still out here gogosu turned his head this way and that the moon was down a little its grey light coming through hazy clouds the hunter saw nothing but still the young american led the way i thought maybe you could shoot it said vulpe you said youd tried to shoot a wolf up here before i have thats right gogosu answered hurrying to keep up i hit him too for i heard him yelp and saw the trail of blood well said the other and now another chance eh the hunter was puzzled something wasnt quite right here he tried to get a good look at his companion in the pale moonlight whats wrong with your voice gheorghe frog in your throat still shaken up are you thats right said vulpe his voice deeper yet it was something of a shock gogosu came to a halt something was definitely wrong i see no wolf he said the tone of his voice an accusation in itself neither wolf nor fox nor anything oh said the other also pausing then whats that he pointed and something moved silently low to the ground greydappled where moonlight formed pools under the trees it was there then gone but the hunter had seen it as if in confirmation a low growl came back to them out of the night damn me gogosu breathed a grey one he brushed past vulpe crouched low ran forward under the trees vulpe came after caught up with him pointed off at a tangent there he goes he rasped where where god youve the eyes of a wolf yourself this way said vulpe come on they came out of the trees reached the piled scree at the foot of rearing crags the younger figure breathed easy but gogosu was already panting for air lord he gulped and finally admitted it but my legs arent as young as yours what said vulpe halfturning towards him oh but i assure you they are emil gogosu centuries younger in fact eh what there said the other pointing yet again under that tree there the hunter looked brought his rifle up to his shoulder saw nothing under the tree he said but theres nothing there i give me that said vulpe and before the other could argue hed taken the gun aiming at nothing in particular he said emil are you sure you shot a wolf up here that time what the old hunter was outraged how many times do you need telling aye and i damn near got him too you can wager he bears the scar to prove it calm down calm down said the other his voice dark as the night now no need for wagering emil for ive seen that gouge in his flank where your bullet burned his hide oh yes and just as you remember him so he remembers you and as suddenly as that the hunter knew that this wasnt gheorghe vulpe he looked deep into his shadowed face hissed his terror and shrank down and saw the grey one crouched to spring silhouetted on top of a mound of sliding scree it snarled sprang gogosu snatched at his rifle where the other seemed to hold it oh so lightly try snatching an iron bar from the window of a cell the wolf struck and knocked him down away from this awful stranger hed thought a friend its fangs were at his throat slavering there he went to cry out but already those terrible teeth had met through his windpipe turning his scream to a scarlet froth that flew like a brand across a wrinkled grey brow over vengeful yellow eyes you let me sleep late was seth armstrongs first reaction when he found himself prodded awake the moon was down the ground mist gone the fire almost dead are you complaining said the man seated close by who at first glance was george vulpe no armstrong shook his head as much to free it from sleep as in answer i guess i was tuckered must be the altitude good said the other im glad you enjoyed your sleep sleep is a necessity however wasteful why should we sleep when theres a life to be lived eh i shall not sleep again in oh a long time armstrong was almost awake now what he said and sat up he might have jumped up but the barrel of gogosus rifle was prodding him in the chest and a lean grey wolf lying prone on its belly like a dog with paws stretched forward towards him was gazing directly into his eyes one of its ears stood stiffly erect the other twitching lay close to its elongated skull the wolf might be halfgrinning or halfsnarling whichever its quivering muzzle was splashed with scarlet jesus h christ armstrong snatched back his feet which got tangled in the lower half of his sleepingbag be still commanded the one he still believed was vulpe do as youre told and he wont attack you and i wont squeeze this trigger geor geor george armstrong finally found his voice thats a bloody wolf there bloody yes said the other so sh sh shoot the bastard armstrongs face was deathly white in pale blue starshine eh said the seated man cocking his head curiously on one side for all the world as if he hadnt heard right i should shoot him i should reward an old and trusted friend by shooting him no i think not he picked up a dry branch and tossed it onto the bed of hot ashes where small flames lingered still sparks showered up and the flames leaped higher and armstrong saw the bloodied holes in the others clothing his torn rapidly mending face the pits of hell which were his eyes christ christ christ the big gangling man gasped george what the hells happening here be still the other said again his head still tilted at an angle for long moments he stared into armstrongs terrified face studying it perhaps thinking something over and eventually youre a big man and strong and i cannot be alone in the world not now and not for some time i have things to learn places to go things to do i will need instruction i must be taught before i may teach i got something from gheorghes mind you see before he honoured the covenant but not enough perhaps i was too eager it is understandable george armstrong licked his lips which were parched george listen he reached out a trembling hand to the other but the old wolfs muzzle at once cracked open to display jaws like a bone vice he lifted his belly off the earth crept closer i said be still said the one with the rifle lifting it until its foresight pressed against armstrongs bobbing adams apple if the grey one understands my wishes why cant you or perhaps youre a fool in which case im wasting my time is that it am i wasting my time should i be done with it simply squeeze this trigger and make a fresh start ill ill be still armstrong gasped his voice a hoarse whisper cold sweat starting out on his brow ill be still and and dont worry george ill help you god yes whatever bug youve picked up ill help you oh i know you will said this this stranger still staring from his crimson eyes ill do anything you say said armstrong anything at all yes that too said the other nodding and having made up his mind very well and shall we start with something simple look into my eyes seth armstrong he moved the barrel of the rifle aside to lean closer until his terrible mesmeric face was only a foot away look deep seth look under the skin of my eyes into the blood and the brains and the very landscape of my mind the eyes are the windows of the soul my friend did you know that portals on ones dreams and passions and aspirations which is why my eyes are red aye for the soul behind them has been torn asunder arid eaten by a scarlet leech his words conjured seething horror but more than that they inspired awe a creeping paralysis a lassitude of terror armstrong knew what it was hypnotism he could feel his mind going under but vulpe or whoever this was in vulpes body had been right seth armstrong was strong and before his will could be subverted utterly he batted the rifle aside so that it was directed at the wolf and reached for the throat of his tormentor tm going to have me a piece of you george he panted as the texans fingers closed on vulpes windpipe so that facsimile gave a grunting cry and clawed at his face the three fingers of his left hand hooked in the corner of armstrongs lower lip tearing it armstrong howled his pain bit down hard on the smallest of vulpes fingers severed it at the central knuckle in the moment before the other dragged his hand free the rifle went off its flash startling and the crack of its discharge reverberating from the peaks the great wolf knew something about guns unharmed fur bristling still he whined and backed away gurgling and clutching at his damaged hand vulpe had reared to his feet armstrong spat out vulpes little finger which hung from his mouth on a thread of blood and gristle the texan now had possession of the rifle and knew how to use it but even as he tried to turn the weapon on the madman so vulpe recovered and kicked it from his hands somehow armstrong burst free of his sleepingbag but as he lurched to his feet he felt something clinging to his face and moving there and shaking with laughter the mad thing which had been george vulpe pointed at armstrong at his face he pointed with his freakish left hand where all that remained of the third finger was now a bloody stump the texan put up a hand and slapped at the finger on his cheek clawed at it it climbed higher with a life of its own and gouged at the corner of his right eye armstrong howled as it dug in dislodged the eyeball and entered the socket with his eye hanging on his cheek he danced and screamed and clutched at his face but he couldnt dislodge the thing which burrowed like an alien worm into his head jesus god he screamed falling to his knees and tearing at the rim of the empty orbit and jjjesus gggod he gurgled again as he ripped the flopping eye loose and vampire flesh put out exploratory tendrils into his brain on his knees he shuffled spastically blindly towards the fire and shuddered to a halt he coughed and shuddered again and toppled forward like a felled tree but the vulpeanomaly stepped forward caught his collar with its good hand and swung him to one side turning him onto his back ah no seth the thing said standing over him enough is enough for if you burn it will take time in the healing and i would be up and gone from here geooorge the other coughed and gagged no no my friend no more of that said the monster smiling hideously from now on you must call me janos more than five and a half years later the balcony of a hotel room in rhodes overlooking a noisy jostling earlymorning street only a stones throw from the harbour saltysweet air breezing in across the sea from turkey thinning out the clouds of blue exhaust smoke the pungent miasma of the bakeries the many odours of the breakfast bars refuse collectors and humanity in general in this the nervecentre of the ancient greek port it was the middle of may the tourist season only just beginning and already threatening to be a blockbuster and the sun was a ball of fire onethird of the way up the incredibly blue dome of the sky a dome because you couldnt take it in in its entirety but must close your eyes to a squint thus rounding off the corners and turning your periphery of vision to a shadowy curve that was how trevor jordan felt about it anyway having thrown back maybe one or two metaxas too many the night before but it was early yet just after am and he guessed hed recover in a little while though by the same token he knew the town would get a lot noisier too jordan had breakfasted on a boiled egg and single piece of toast and was now into his third cup of coffee the british instant variety not the darkbrown sludge which the greeks drank from thimblesized cups which he calculated was gradually diluting whatever brandy remained in his system the trouble with metaxa as hed discovered was that it was extremely cheap and very very drinkable especially while watching the nonstop bellydancing floorshow in a place called the blue lagoon on trianta bay he groaned and gently fingered his forehead for the fifth or sixth time in a halfhour sunglasses he said to the man who sat with him similarly attired in dressinggown and flipflops i have to buy a pair christ this glare could take your eyes out have mine ken layard told him grinning as he passed a pair of cheap plasticframed shades across their tiny breakfast table and later you can buy me new ones will you order more coffee jordan groaned say a bucketful i thought you were knocking it back a bit last night the other answered why didnt you tell me youd never been to the greek islands before he leaned over the balcony rail called down and attracted the attention of a waiter serving breakfast to other earlyrisers on a terraced lower level then lifted the empty coffee pot and jiggled it suggestively how do you know that said jordan what that this is new to you no one whos been here before drinks metaxa like that or ouzo for that matter ah jordan remembered we started off on ouzo you started off on ouzo layard reminded him i was getting atmosphere local colour you were getting drunk yes but did i enjoy myself layard grinned again shrugged and said well you didnt get us thrown out of anywhere he studied the other in his selfinflicted discomfort an experienced but variable telepath jordan could be forceful when he needed to be usually though he was easygoing transparent an open book it was as if he personally would like to be as readable as other peoples minds were to him as if he were trying to make some sort of physical compensation for his metaphysical talent his face reflected this attitude it was fresh oval open almost boyish with thinning fair hair falling forward above grey eyes and a crooked mouth which straightened out and tightened whenever he was worried or annoyed everyone who knew trevor jordan liked him having the advantage of knowing about it when people didnt like him he simply avoided them but rangylimbed and athletic despite his fortyfour years it was a mistake to misread his sensitivity there was plenty of determination in him too they were old friends these two who went back a long way they could clown with each other now because of their past in which thered been times when there was little or no room for clowning times and events in fact so outrй even in their weird world that theyd receded now to mere phantoms of mind and memory like bad dreams or tragedies best forgotten there was nothing so deadly strange in their current mission though certainly it was serious enough but still jordan realized hed been in error the previous night he put on the sunglasses frowned and sat up straighter in his cane chair i didnt draw attention to us or anything stupid like that lord no said the other and anyway i wouldnt have let you you were just a tourist having himself a good time thats all too much sun during the day and too much booze through the night and what the hell there were plenty of other brits around who made you look positively sober and manolis papastamos jordan was rueful now he must have thought me an idiot papastamos was their local liaison man second in command of the athens narcotics squad who had come across to rhodes by hydrofoil to get to know the pair personally and see if there was anything he could do to simplify their task but hed also proved to be something of a hellraiser even a liability no layard shook his head in fact he was more under the influence than you were he said hed join us on the harbour wall at to see the samothraki dock but i doubt it when we dropped him off at his hotel he looked like hell on the other hand they do have remarkable constitutions these greeks but in any case well be better off without him he knows who we are but not what we are as far as hes concerned were part of customs and excise or maybe new scotland yard it would be hard to concentrate with manolis around making conversation and creating a mental racket i hope to god he stays in bed jordan was looking and feeling a little healthier the sunglasses had helped somewhat fresh coffee arrived and layard poured jordan watched his easy movements and thought just like a big brother he looks after me like i was a snotnosed kid he always has thank god layard was a locator a scryer without a crystal ball he didnt need one a map would do just as well or an inkling of his quarrys location a year older than jordan he stood a blocky seventy inches tall with a square face dark hair and complexion expressive active eyebrows and mouth under a forehead lined from accumulated years of concentration his eyes were very keen and farseeing and so darkly brown as to border on black looking at layard through and in the privacy of dark lenses jordans thoughts went back twelve years to harkley house in devon england where he and the locator had formed their first real partnership and worked as a team for the very first time then as now theyd been members of ebranch that most secret of all the secret services whose work was known only to a handful of top people unlike now however their work on that occasion had been far less mundane indeed there had been nothing at all mundane about the yulian bodescu affair memories deliberately suppressed for more than a decade sprang once more into being fullfleshed and fantastic in jordans espendowed mind once more he held the crossbow in his hand chesthigh and aimed dead ahead as he listened to the hiss of jetting water and the girls voice humming that tuneless melody from beyond the closed door and wondered if this were a trap then he kicked open the door to the shower cubicle and stood riveted to the spot helen lake yulian bodescus cousin was utterly beautiful and quite naked standing sideways on her body gleamed in the streaming water she jerked her head round to stare at jordan her eyes wide in terror where she fell back against the showers wall her knees began to buckle and her eyelids fluttered but this is just a frightened girl he told himself in the moment before her thoughts branded themselves on his telepathic mind come on my sweet she thought ah just touch me hold me just a little closer my sweet then jerking back away from her he saw the carving knife in her hand and the insane glare in her demonic eyes as she drew him effortlessly towards her and lifted her knife in a gleaming arc so he pulled the crossbows trigger it was an automatic thing his life or hers god the bolt nailed her to the tiled wall she screamed like the damned soul she was and jerked herself free of splintering tiles and plaster staggering to and fro in the showers shallow well but she still had the knife and jordan could do nothing but stand there with his eyes bulging mouthing meaningless prayers as she advanced on him yet again until ken layard shouldered him aside layard with his flamethrower whose nozzle he directed into the shower to turn it into a blistering steaming pressurecooker god help us jordan gasped now as hed gasped it then he blotted the unbearable memories out came reeling back to the present in the wake of mental conflict crisis his hangover seemed twice as bad he breathed deeply used the tips of his fingers to massage the top of his head where it felt split and wondered out loud christ what brought that on layards eyes were wide he bent forward across the table and grasped jordans forearm you too he said jordan broke an unspoken rule among ebranch espers he glanced into layards mind receding he felt the echoes of similar memories and at once broke the contact yes me too he said i could tell by your face layard told him ive never seen you look like that since that time maybe its because were working together again weve worked together plenty jordan flopped back in his chair suddenly felt exhausted no i think its just something that was squeezed up in there and had to be out well it took its time but its out now and gone forever i hope me too layard agreed but both of us at the same time and why now we couldnt be in a more different setting from harkley house than we are right now jordan sighed and reached for his coffee his hand trembled a little maybe we picked it up from each other and amplified it you know what they say about great minds thinking alike layard relaxed and nodded especially minds like ours eh he nodded again if a little uncertainly well maybe youre right by the two were down on the northern harbour wall seated on a wooden bench which gave them a splendid view right across the mandraki shallows and harbour to the fort of st nikolas to their left the bank of greece stood on its raised promontory its whitebanded walls and blue windows reflected in the still water while on their right and to the rear of the promenade sprawled rhodes new town mandraki being mainly a shallowwater mooring was not the commercial harbour that lay a quartermile south in the bay of the historic picturesque and crusaderfortified old town beyond the great mole with the fort at its tip but their information was that the drugrunners moored up in mandraki taking on water and some small provisions there before proceeding on to crete italy sardinia and spain a little cannabis resin would be dropped off here by night and likewise in various ports of call along the way but the great mass of the stuff and the main cargo which was cocaine was destined for valencia spain from where eventually a lot of it would find its way to england such had been its route and destination in the past meanwhile the ebranch agents had the task of determining how much of the white powder was aboard and if the amount was small would a preemptive bust simply serve to tip their hands to the drugbarons and where was the stuff kept if it was aboard only a few months ago a boat had been stripped to the bones in larnaca cyprus and nothing had been found but of course that one had been handled by the greekcypriot police whose expertise perhaps lacked that little something extra like coordination or even intelligence this time it would be a combined effort terminating in valencia before the bulk of the stuff could be offloaded and this time too the boat a wallowing wooden roundbottomed barrel of an old greek thing called the samothraki would be stripped not just to her bones but the very marrow and in the interim jordan and layard would shadow her along her route dressed in touristtrade american caps with hugelyprojecting peaks bright opennecked shortsleeved shirts cool slacks and leather sandals and equipped with binoculars they now awaited the arrival of their quarry since they went allegedly incognito their mode of dress might seem almost outlandish but by comparison with the more lurid tourist groups they could easily be too conservative and that was to be avoided they had been silent for some time there was something of a mood on both of them jordan blamed the metaxa and layard said it was bad gut brought on by greasy food whichever it interfered a little with their esp its cloudy jordan complained frowning then he shrugged but you dont know what i mean do you sure i do layard answered we called it mindsmog in the old days remember a kind of dull mental static distorting or blocking the pictures or obscuring them in a sort of well almost in a damp reeking fog when i reach out and search for the samothraki i can feel it there like a welling mist in my mind a dampness a darkness a smog but how to explain it in a place like this its weird and it doesnt come from the boat especially but dont know from everywhere jordan looked at him how long since we came up against other espers in our work you mean just about every time we do an embassy job i suppose what are you getting at you dont think its likely there are other agents on the same job russians maybe or the french its possible it was layards turn to frown the ussrs narcotics problem is growing every day and france has been in the shit for years but i was thinking what if theyre on the other side i mean what if the runners themselves are using espers they could well afford to and thats a fact jordan put his binoculars to his eyes turned his head and scanned the coastline from the fort on the mole all the way to the heart of the old town where it rose behind massive walls have you tried tracking it he said i mean after alls said and done youre the locator but me ive a feeling the source is somewhere in there layards keen eyes followed the aim of jordans binoculars a big white expensivelooking motorcruiser lolled at anchor in mandrakis narrow deepwater channel beyond that a handful of caiques were moored inshore or came and went most of them full to the gunnels with tourists a further quartermile and the old towns markets and streets were a hive literally buzzing where the hill rose in a mass of churches and white and yellow houses burning in the morning sunlight except that all was in motion he might well have been looking at a picture postcard the scene was that perfect layard stared for long moments then snapped his fingers sat back and grinned thats it he finally said you got it first time eh jordan looked at him and of course it would have to be worse for you than for me for i only find things i dont read minds do you want to explain whats to explain layard looked smug your tourists map of the old town is the same as mine except you probably havent read it ok ill put you out of your misery theres an insane asylum on the hill wha jordan started then put down his binoculars and slapped his knee that has to be it he said were getting the echoes of all of those poor sick bastards locked up in that place it looks like it layard nodded so now that we know what it is we should try to screen it out concentrate on the job in hand he looked out to sea through the mouth of the harbour and became serious in a moment especially since it appears the samothrakis just a wee bit on the early side shes out there jordan was immediately attentive five or ten minutes at the most layard nodded i just picked her up and ill give you odds shes in and dropping anchor by quarter past the hour both men now took to watching the entrance to the harbour so missing a sudden burst of activity aboard the big privately owned motorcruiser a canopied caique ferried out a small party from steps in the harbour wall two men went aboard the sleek white ship which soon weighed anchor powerful engines throbbed as she turned almost on her own axis and nosed idly back along the deepwater channel black awnings with fancy scalloped trims gave her foredeck shade where a blackclad figure now lounged in one of several reclining deckchairs a tall man in white stood at the rail looking towards the harbour mouth he wore a black eye patch over his right eye the white leisure craft was very noticeable now but still it hovered on the periphery of the espers vision its screw idling where it waited in the deepwater channel both of them now held binoculars to their eyes and jordan had stood up was leaning forward against the harbour wall as the samothraki came chugging into view around the mole here she comes he breathed right between the old boys legs he sent his telepathic mind reaching across the water seeking out the minds of the captain and crew he wanted to know the location of the cocaine if one of them should be thinking about it right now or about its ultimate destination what old boys legs layards voice came to him distantly even though he was right here beside him such was jordans concentration that hed almost entirely shut out the conscious world the colossus jordan husked helios one of the seven wonders of the ancient world thats where he stood right there straddling that harbour mouth until bc so you did read your map after all breathed layard the old samothraki was coming in the sleek white modern vessel was going out the former was obscured by the latter as they came up alongside each other and dropped their anchors shit said jordan mindsmog again i cant see a damn thing through it i can feel it layard answered jordan swept his glasses along the sleek outline of the white vessel and read off its name from the hull the lazarus shes a beauty he started to say and froze right there centred in his field of view the man in black on the foredeck was seated upright in his chair the back of his head was visible he was looking at the old samothraki but as jordan fixed him in his binoculars so that oddlyproportioned head turned until its unknown owner was staring straight at the esper across one hundred and twenty yards of blue water and even though they were both wearing dark glasses and despite the distance it was as if they stood face to face what a powerful mental voice grunted its astonishment full in jordans mind a thoughtthief a mentalist jordan gasped what the hell did he have here whatever it was it wasnt what hed been looking for he tried to withdraw but the others mind closed on his like a great vice and squeezed he couldnt pull out he flopped there loosely against the harbour wall and looked at the other where he now stood tall enormous to jordan in the shade of the black canopy their eyes were locked on each other and jordan was straining so hard to look away to redirect his thoughts that he was beginning to vibrate it was as if solid bars of steel were shooting out from the others hidden eyes across the water and down the barrels of jordans binoculars into his brain where even now they were hammering at his mind as they drove home their message whoever you are you have entered my mind of your own free will so be it layard was on his feet now anxious and astonished for all that hed experienced little or nothing of the telepaths shock and indeed terror still he could tell by just looking at him that something was terribly wrong with his own mind full of mental smog and crackling buzzing static he reached to take jordans sagging weight in time to guide and lower the telepath to the bench as he collapsed like a jelly unconscious in his arms lazarides that same night the lazarus lay moored to a wharf in the main harbour entirely still and darkly mirrored in water smooth as glass three of the four crewmen had gone ashore leaving only a watchkeeper the boats owner sat at a windowseat upstairs in the most disreputable taverna of the old town looking out and down across the waterfront downstairs a handful of tourists drank cheap brandy or ouzo and ate the execrable food while the local layabouts bums and rejects in general laughed and joked with them in english and german made coarse jokes about them in greek and scrounged drinks there were three or four blowsylooking english girls down there some with greek boyfriends all the worse for wear and all looking for the main chance they danced or staggered to sporadic bursts of recorded bouzouki music and later would dance more frantically gaspingly horizontally to the accompaniment of slapping sweating ouzosmelling flesh upstairs was out of bounds to such as these where the owner of the taverna carried out the occasional shady deal or perhaps drank talked or played cards with some of his many shady friends none of these were around tonight however just the landlord himself and a young greek whore sitting alone in the alcove leading to her business premises a small room with a bed and washbasin and the man who now called himself jianni lazarides occupying his windowseat the fat stubblechinned proprietor called nichos dakaris was here to serve a bottle of good red wine to lazarides and the girl was here because she had a black eye and couldnt ply for trade along the waterfront or rather she wouldnt it was her way of paying dakaris back for the beatings he gave her whenever he was obliged to cough up hushmoney to the local constabulary for the privilege of letting a prostitute use his place if not for the fact that he felt the urge himself now and then he probably wouldnt let her stay here at all but she paid for her room in kind once or twice a week as the mood took dakaris on top of which he got forty per cent of her take or would get it if she only used her room and wouldnt insist on freelancing in rhodian backalleys which was his other reason for beating her as for jianni lazarides he also had his reasons for being here this was the venue for his meeting with the greek captain of the samothraki and a couple of his cohorts when he would look for an explanation as to how and why someone had been selling tickets for their assumed covert drugrunning operation actually he already knew why for hed had it from the mind of trevor jordan but now he wanted to hear it from pavlos themelis himself the samothrakis master before deciding how best to detach himself from the affair for lazarides had put good money into this allegedly safe business and he wanted his money back or payment in kind for money and power were gods here in this era no less than in all the foregone centuries of human avarice of which lazarides had more than an obscure knowledge and indeed there were easier safer more guaranteed ways to make and use money in this vastly complex world ways which would not attract the attention of its lawkeepers or at any rate not too much of it money was very important to lazarides and not just because he was greedy this world hed emerged into was overcrowded and threatening to become even more so and a vampire has his needs in the old times a boyar would be given lands by some puppet prince or other to build a castle there and live in seclusion and preferably and eventually something of anonymity anonymity and longevity had walked hand in hand in the old days you could not have one without the other a famous man must not be seen to live beyond his or any other ordinary creatures span of years but in those days news travelled slowly a man could have sons when he died there would always be one of those ready and waiting to step into his shoes likewise in the here and now except that news and indeed men no longer travelled slowly because of which the world was that much smaller so how then to build an aerie and all unnoticed in these last dozen years of this th century impossible but still a very rich man could purchase obscurity and with it anonymity and so go about his business as of old which begged a second question how to become very rich well janos ferenczy thought he had answered that one more than four hundred years ago but now in the guise of lazarides he wasnt so sure in those days a gemencrusted weapon or large nugget of gold had been instant wealth now too except that now men would want to know the source of such an item in those days a boyars lands and possessions or loot had been his own no questions asked and only let him who dared try to take them away but today such baubles as a jewelled hilt or a solid gold scythian crown were historic treasures and a man might not trade with them without first satisfying a good many far too many queries as to their origin oh janos knew the source of his wealth well enow indeed here it sat in this windowseat overlooking a harbour in the once powerful land of rhodos for the very man who discovered and unearthed these treasures in the here and now was the selfsame one who had buried them deep in the earth more than four hundred years ago how better to prepare for a second coming into the world when one has foreseen a long long period of uttermost dark and having retrieved these several caches these items of provenance put down so long ago surely it would be the very simplest thing to transfer them into land properties of his own the territories and possessions of a wamphyri lord oh true an aerie were out of the question even a castle but an island an island say in the greek sea which had so many ah if only it could have been that easy but places change nature takes her toll earthquakes rumble and the land is split asunder and treasures are buried deeper still where old markers fall or are simply torn down the mapmakers then were not nearly so accurate and even a keen memory the very keenest vampire memory will fade a little in the face of centuries janos sighed and glanced out of the window at the harbour lights and at those measuring the leagues of ocean lighting their ships like luminous inchworms far out on the sea the odious proprietor had gone now back downstairs to serve ouzo and watereddown brandy and count his takings but the bouzouki music still played amidst bursts of coarse laughter the wouldbe lovers still danced and groped and the young whore remained seated in her alcove as before the hour must be ten and janos had said he would contact his american thrall about then well and he would in a while in a while he poured a little wine for himself good and deep and red and watched the way his glass turned to blood aye the blood was the life but not in a place like this he would sup when he would sup and meanwhile the wine could ease his parch what was it after all but the plaguy unending thirst of the vampire which one must either tame or die for or at least tame within certain limits and janos wasnt shrivelled yet the whore had heard the chink of his glass against the bottle now she looked across her surly mouth pouting she too had a glass which was empty janos felt her eyes on him and turned his head across the room she took note of his straightbacked height dark good looks and expensive clothing and wondered at the darktinted spectacles which shielded his eyes but at this distance she could not see how coarse and largepored was his skin how wide and fleshy his mouth or the disproportionate length of his skull ears and threefingered hands she only knew that he looked powerful detached deep and certainly he was not a poor man she smiled however unprettily stood up and stretched which had the desired effect of lifting her pointed breasts and crossed to janoss windowseat he watched her swaying towards him and thought of your own free will will you drink it all she asked him cocking a knowing eyebrow all to yourself all by yourself no he said at once his expression remaining entirely ambivalent i require very little of this perhaps his voice surprised her it was a growl a rumble so deep it made her bones shiver and yet she didnt find it displeasing still its force was sufficient that she took a pace to the rear but as she drew back so he smiled however coldly and indicated the bottle are you thirsty then was he a greek this man he knew the tongue but spoke it like they did in some of the old mountain villages which modern times and ways would never reach or perhaps he wasnt greek after all or maybe he was but many times removed by travel and learning and the exotic dilution of far foreign parts the girl didnt normally ask but now she said may i by all means as i have said my real requirements lie in another direction was that a hint he must know what she was surely should she invite him through the alcove and into her curtained room then as she filled her glass it was as if he had read her mind though of course that wouldnt be too difficult no he said with a slight but definite shake of his great head now you must leave me alone there are matters to occupy my mind and friends will soon be joining me here she threw back her wine and smiling he refilled her glass before repeating now go and that was that the command was irresistible she returned to her bench under the alcove but now she couldnt keep her eyes off him he was aware of it but it didnt seem to bother him if he had not commanded her attention then he might feel concerned anyway it was now time for janos to discover what armstrong was doing he put the girl out of his mind reached out with his vampire senses along the waterfront to the mole and into the shadows there where massive walls reached up out of the still waters no bright lights there just heaps of mended nets lobster pots and the floats and amphoraelike vases with which the fishermen caught the octopus and the ever faithful armstrong of course waiting for his masters commands do you hear me seth tm here where i should be armstrong whispered into the shadows of the mole as if he talked to himself he made no mention of the hunger which janos could feel in his mind like an ache that was good for a masters needs must always come first but at the same time a man should not forget to reward a faithful dog armstrong would receive his reward later now seek out the mentalist the englishman janos briefly explained and him i shall send to you the other english will doubtless accompany him that one is not required for he can only hinder my works one of them can tell us as much as two do you understand armstrong understood well enough and again janos felt the hunger in him so much hunger that this time he commanded you will neither mark him nor take anything from him nor yet give him anything of yourself do you hear me seth i understand good i suggest that he receive a stunning blow say to the back of the neck and that he then falls in the water where it is deep look to it then for if all is well i shall send them to you soon without more ado he then sent his vampire senses creeping amidst the bright lights of the new town searching among the hotels and tavernas in and around the bars fastfood stalls and nightclubs it was not difficult the minds he sought were different possessed some small powers of their own and one of them at least had already been penetrated damaged almost destroyed indeed it was going to be destroyed but not just yet time enough for that when janos knew all that it knew and from the single glimpse he had stolen before crushing down on that mind and driving it to seek sanctuary in oblivion he was certain that it knew a great deal the mind of a mentalist aye a telepath as they called them now but if janos had caught the thoughtthief spying on him how much then had he discovered before he was caught enough to make him dangerous be sure for in the moment of shutting him down janos had sensed that the mindspy knew what he was and that must never be what to be discovered as a vampire here in this modern world oh some might scoff at such a suggestion but others would not this mentalist was just such a one and thered been echoes in his mind which hinted he knew of others an entire nest of them janos detected and seized upon a wave of frightened thoughts he knew the scent of them it was a mind he had encountered before recently which like a familiar face he now recognized terrified cringing thoughts they were bruised and battered to mental submission but rising now once more to consciousness he tracked them like a bloodhound and entering that shuddering mind knew at once that this was the one and hed made no mistake ken layard attended trevor jordan in the latters hotel room their single rooms were side by side with access from a corridor for twelve hours solid the telepath had lain here now six of them as still as a corpse under the influence of a powerful sedative administered by a greek doctor four more in what had seemed a fairly normal sleeping mode and the rest tossing and turning sweating and moaning in the grip of whatever dream it was that bothered him layard had tried to wake him once or twice but his friend hadnt been ready for it the doctor had said hed come out of it in his own good time as for what the trouble was it could have been anything according to the doctor too much sun excitement drink a bug which had got into his system perhaps or a bad migraine but nothing to worry about just yet the tourists were always going down with something or other layard turned away from jordans bed and in the next moment heard his friend say what yes yes i will he spun on his heel saw jordans eyes spring open watched him push himself upright into a seated position there was a jar of water on jordans bedside table layard poured him a glass and offered it to him jordan seemed not to see it his eyes were almost glazed he swung his legs out of the bed reached for his clothes where they were draped over a chair the locator wondered is he sleepwalking trevor he quietly said taking his arm are you what jordan faced him blinked rapidly suddenly looked him full in the face his eyes focussed and layard guessed that he was now fully conscious and apparently capable yes im ok but but layard prompted him while jordan continued to dress himself there was something almost robotic about him the telephone rang as jordan went on dressing layard answered it it was manolis papastamos wanting to know how jordan was doing the greek lawman had come on the scene only seconds after jordans collapse hed helped layard get him back here and called in the doctor trevors fine layard answered his anxious query i think hes getting dressed anyway whats happening your end papastamos spoke english the same way he spoke greek rapidfire were watching the boats both of them but nothing he said if anything has come ashore from the samothraki it couldnt have been very much and certainly not the hard stuff which is about what we expected ive checked out the lazarus too unlikely that theres any connection its owner is one jianni lazarides archaeologist and treasureseeker with good credentials or lets just say he has no record anyway as for the crew of the samothraki the captain and his first mate are ashore they may have brought a very little of the soft stuff with them theyre watching a cabaret at the moment and drinking coffee and brandy but more coffee than brandy obviously they plan on staying sober jordan had meanwhile finished with dressing and was heading for the door he moved like a zombie and his clothes were the same ones he had worn this morning but the nights were still chilly plainly he hadnt so much chosen these light casual clothes as taken them because theyd been handy layard called after him trevor where do you think youre going jordan looked back the harbour he answered automatically st pauls gate then along the mole to the windmills hello hello papastamos was still on the phone what now he says hes going to the windmills on the mole layard told him and im going with him theres something not right here ive known it all day sorry manolis but i have to hang up on you ill see you down there papastamos quickly answered but layard only caught half of it as he was putting the phone down and then he was struggling into his jacket and following jordan where he made his way doggedly downstairs into the lobby then out of the door and into the mediterranean night arent you going to wait for me he called out after him but jordan made no answer he did glance back once and layard saw his eyes staring out of his sicklooking face like holes punched in pasteboard plainly he wasnt going to wait for him or for anyone else for that matter layard almost caught up with his robotic partner as jordan crossed a road heading for the waterfront but then the lights changed engines revved and mopeds and cars started rolling in the scrambling deathwish deviltakethehindmost fashion of greek traffic in that same moment he found himself separated from jordan by bumpertobumper metal and by the time the exhaust fumes had cleared and the lights changed again the telepath had disappeared into milling groups of people where they thronged the streets hurrying after him layard knew hed lost him but at least he knew where he was going jordan felt that he was fighting it for all he was worth every step of the way even knowing it was useless it was like being drunk in a strange place and among strangers when you lie on your back and the room spins it actually seems to spin the corners of the ceiling chasing each other like the spokes of a wheel and theres nothing you can do to stop it because you know it isnt really spinning its your mind thats spinning inside the head on top of your body your bloody head and body but they wont obey you you cant make them do what you want no matter how hard you try and all the time you can hear yourself trapped in your own skull like a fly in a bottle buzzing furiously and banging repeatedly against the glass and saying over and over again oh god let it stop oh god let it stop oh god let it stop its the alcohol the alien in your system which has taken control and fighting it only makes you feel that much worse try lifting your head and shoulders up off the bed and everything spins even faster so fast you can feel the centrifugal force dragging you down again force yourself to your feet and you stagger you turn begin to spin with the room with the entire bloody universe but only lie still stop fighting it close your eyes tight and cling to yourself eventually it will go away the spinning will go away the sickness the buzzing of the fly in the bottle which is your own battered astonished gibbering psyche will go away and youll sleep and its possible the strangers will roll you and rob you blind roll you they could steal your underpants even rape you if they felt inclined and you couldnt stop them wouldnt feel it wouldnt even suspect it was a replay of jordans first violent experience with alcohol that had been when hed started university and got homesick of all bloody things a couple of fellow students college comedians thinking to have a little fun at his expense had spiked his drinks then theyd played a few tricks on him in his room nothing vicious theyd rouged his cheeks given him a cupids bow mouth fitted him up with a garterbelt and stockings and stuck a mickey mouse johnnie on his dick he woke up cold naked ill not knowing what had happened wanting to die but a day or two later when he was sober hed tracked them down one at a time and beaten the living shit out of them since when hed only ever got physical when there was no other way around it but by god he wished he could get physical now with himself with this mind and body which wouldnt obey him with whoever it was that was doing this to him for that was the terrible thing he knew it was someone else doing it to him jerking him about like a puppet on a set of strings and there was still nothing he could do about it stop he kept telling himself get a grip of yourself sit down throw up hold your head in your hands wait for ken do anything but of your own free will but before his runaway body could even begin to obey such instructions ah but it is not free you came spying invaded my mind an ant in a wasps nest so now pay the price go on proceed just as you are go to the windmills that terrible gonging magnetic voice in his head that will which superimposed itself over his will that telepathic hypnotic command of some one or thing as powerful more powerful than anything hed ever imagined before which made a mockery of resistance more surely than any mickey finn jordans legs felt like rubber almost vibrating twanging at the knees as he strained to hold them back as well hold back opposite magnetic poles or a moth from a candle and still he followed the waterfront to the mole and along its rocky neck until the ancient windmills stood visible there against a horizon of dark ocean dressed all in black seth armstrong was waiting crouching in the shadows where the sea wall was shaped like a castles battlements after the style of the old crusaders whose works were still visible all around he let jordan go stumbling by looked back into the darkness of the mole under the winking lights of rhodes old town where it sprawled on the hill he heard footsteps running and a voice panting trevor for christs sake slow down will you where the hell do you th and armstrong struck layard saw something big black gangling step out of the shadows one eye glared at him from a slit in a black balaclava gasping he skidded to a halt spun on his heel to flee and armstrong rabbitpunched him down to the nightshining cobbles of the path out like a light layard lay crumpled at the foot of the sea wall and jordan feeling the strictures on his will slacken a little turned back he saw the large dark mantislike figure of armstrong bent over layards unconscious form saw his friend hoisted aloft on powerful shoulders and ejected through one of the walls embrasures out into thin air a moment more and there came a splash then the chop chop chop of disturbed water gradually settling and finally as the figure in black now turned towards him more running footsteps the beam of a torch cut the night slashing it to left and right like a white knife through black card and manolis papastamoss voice just as sharp slicing the silence trevor ken where are you be careful the alien voice in jordans mind commanded but the order was the merest whisper and no longer directed at him it no longer dominated but merely advised and he knew that his telepathic mind had simply overheard instructions meant for some other meant in fact for the man in black do not allow yourself to be caught or recognized splashing sounds from below the wall and a gurgling cry ken layard was alive but jordan knew for a fact that the locator couldnt swim he forced his legs to carry him to the wall where he could look out through an embrasure and all the while he was aware of his controlling alien confused and furious mewling like a scalded cat in the back of his mind but no longer fully in control papastamos came running a small slim streamlined shape in the night and jordan saw the longlimbed gangling figure in black back off into the shadows man manolis he forced his parched throat to croak look out the greek lawman came to a halt breathlessly called out trevor and flashed his torch beam full in jordans face the shadows erupted and armstrong smashed a blow to papastamoss face the greek rode with it went sprawling his torch fell with him clattering its beam slithering everywhere the man in black was running back along the mole towards the town papastamos cursed in greek snatched at the torch where it rolled past him aimed it after the fleeing figure its beam trapped an elongated human shadow jerking on the sea wall like a giant crab escaping to the sea but papastamos was armed with more than just a torch his beretta model s barked five times in rapid succession slinging a fivespoked fan of lead after the scuttling shadow a wailing cry of pain and a gasped uh uh uh came back but the footsteps didnt stop running mmmanolis jordan hadnt let up on his battle with the clamp on his will kkken is in the sea the greek got up ran to the sea wall from below came a gurgling and gasping the slosh of water windmilled by flailing arms and without a thought for his own safety papastamos climbed up into the embrasure and launched himself feetfirst into the harbour in his windowseat upstairs in the taverna dakaris janos ferenczys threefingered right hand closed on his wineglass and applied pressure until the glass shattered wine and fragments of glass and a little blood too were squeezed out from between his tightly clenched fingers if he felt any pain it didnt show in his gauntgrey face except perhaps in the tic jerking the flesh at one corner of his mouth janos master armstrong spoke to him from a little over three hundred yards away im shot how badly in the shoulder ill be useless to you until i heal a day or two sometimes i think you have always been useless to me go back to the boat try not to be seen i i havent got the telepath know fool i shall see to it myself then be careful the man who shot me was a policeman oh and how do you know that because he shot me his gun ordinary people dont carry them but even without it i guessed what he was as soon as i saw him he was expecting trouble policemen look the same in whatever country you are a veritable mine of information seth the vampires thoughts were scathingly sarcastic but i take your point and since it now seems i may not take this thoughtthief for my own i shall find some other way to examine him his own telepathy shall be his undoing his mind is receptive to the thoughts of others which until now has made him a big fish in a little pond ah but now he has a shark to contend with for i was a mindspy five centuries before he was born im going back to the boat armstrong confirmed good and if any of my crew are ashore be sure to call them back and janos thrust the other out of his mind he returned to jordan where he had staggered to a seat underneath one of the antique windmills and sat there in moon and starlight jordan was exhausted totally drained by the mental battle hed fought with his unknown adversary but not so far gone that he couldnt appreciate what hed come up against the last time jordan had experienced anything like this had been the autumn of at harkley house in devon yulian bodescu and it had taken harry keogh to clear up that mess and was this like that he wondered had he and ken layard sensed the presence of of this thing even before it had become entirely apparent to them or apparent to him anyway all the pieces were starting to fit together now and the picture they were forming was terrible cannabis resin cocaine they were commonplace even harmless compared to this ebranch must be put in the picture at once the thought was like an invocation ebranch that deep seething voice was there inside jordans head again and mental jaws were tightening on his mind what is this ebranch and pinned there by the sheer weight of the vampires telepathic power jordan could only squirm as the monster commenced a minute painful examination of all his most private thoughts janos might have examined jordan all night except he was interrupted looking down out of his window he saw the bearded bigbellied pavlos themelis master of the samothraki making his way across the street towards the taverna dakaris he was a little late coming to meet with the man he called jianni lazarides but coming anyway and janos couldnt continue to dig away at jordans mind and hold a conversation with themelis at the same time this morning he had found himself under the scrutiny of a thoughtthief reached out and delivered a blow to the others mind it had been an instinctive reaction which nevertheless served to give the vampire time to think jordan was strong however and had recovered well and now janos must strike again at that mind a different sort of blow and one from which the english mindspy would not recover not without a deal of help anyway driving his vampire senses deep into jordans psyche janos found the door of sanity locked bolted and barred against all mankinds worst fears and chuckling he turned the key took down the bars threw back the bolts and opened the door that was enough and now he would know just exactly where to find jordan whenever he desired to continue his examination it was done with only moments to spare for already the samothrakis master was coming up the stairs as pavlos themelis and his first mate entered the room they saw the greek prostitute cleaning away janoss broken glass and offering him her own unmoved he accepted it said go now as she made to get by the huge drugrunner themelis grabbed her arm in a fist like a ham caught her round the waist and swung her off her feet he turned her over and her skirts fell down over her furious face themelis sniffed between her legs and roared clean drawers opencrotch too good i may see you later ellie not if i see you first she spat at him as he set her on her feet then she was down the stairs through the taverna and out onto the street from down below nichos dakariss hoarse voice bellowed after her as she went into the night bring em back alive my girl bring em right back here where i can see the colour of their money this was followed by gales of coarse laughter then more bouzouki music as before pavlos themelis took a seat across the table from the man he knew as jianni lazarides the chair groaned as he sat down on it and parked his elbows on the table he wore his peaked captains hat tilted on one side which he imagined gave him an irresistible piratical look it wasnt a bad ploy no one would normally suspect anyone who looked so roguish of being a rogue only one glass jianni he growled prefer to drink alone do you you are late janos had no time for banter themeliss first mate a short squat torpedo of a man had remained at the head of the stairs from where he carefully scanned the room now he called down to dakaris glasses nichos and a bottle of brandy good stuff too parakalo and finally he picked up a chair and carried it to the table by the windowseat seating himself he asked themelis well and has he explained himself behind his dark glasses janos narrowed his eyes oh and is there something i should explain come come jianni themelis chided you were supposed to come aboard us this morning in the harbour not go sliding off in your pretty white ship as if youd been stung in the arse or something wed pull alongside youd come over and see the stuff of which theres a kilo for you if youve the use for it and then wed collect your valuable contribution on behalf of our mutual sponsor a show of good faith on both sides as it were that was the plan to which you were party except it didnt happen his easygoing look suddenly turned sour and his tone hardened and later when ive parked up the old samothraki and im wondering what the bloody fuck i get this message saying well meet here instead tonight so now tell me are you sure theres nothing youd like to explain the explanation is simple janos barked it could not happen the way it was planned because we were being watched by men on the harbour wall with binoculars by policemen themelis and his second in command glanced at each other a moment then turned again to janos policemen jianni themelis raised a bushy eyebrow you know this for a fact yes said janos for in truth he did now know it for a fact hed had it direct from the english thoughtthief yes i am certain i cannot be mistaken and i would remind you that right from the start of this venture i have insisted upon complete anonymity and total isolation from its mechanics i must not be left vulnerable to any sort of investigation or prosecution i thought that was understood themelis narrowed his eyes slanted his mouth in a sneer then turned his bearded face away as nichos dakaris came labouring up the stairs huh themeliss torpedolike comrade grunted as dakaris slammed down glasses and a bottle of brandy on the table what happened nick did you have to send out for it very funny said dakaris over his shoulder as he left but not nearly so amusing when you consider that some of my customers actually pay me friends i can always use but nonpaying customers who also insult me then hed gone back downstairs themelis had taken the opportunity to compose himself now he said its nothing new to be watched by the police everyone is watched by the police you have to keep your nerve thats all and not panic i know how to keep my nerve well enough said janos but unless im mistaken there is aboard the samothraki an amount of cocaine worth ten million british pounds or two billions of drachmae which is to say two hundred billions of leptae i had no idea such monies existed why five hundred years ago a man could buy an entire kingdom with such a sum and still have enough left over to hire an army to guard it and you tell me to keep my nerve and not panic now let me tell you something my fat friend the difference between bravery and cowardice is discretion between a rich man and a cutpurse its not being caught and between freedom and the dungeon its the ability to walk away from illlaid plans as he spoke the frowns on the faces of the others grew deeper confused and far more concerned to be frank the master of the samothraki wondered what on earth he was prattling on about in his younger days themelis had collected coins but the lepta to his knowledge the last of those had been minted in in twenties and fifties denominations only because of their minuscule value to calculate modern sums of money in leptae had to be a sure sign of madness why it would take five hundred to buy one cigarette and as for lazaridess use of the term dungeon in place of jail what was one supposed to make of the man how could anyone look so young and think so archaic themeliss sidekick was thinking much the same things but over and above everything else lazarides had said his final statement of intention stood out in starkest definition something about walking away was he looking for an out no threats jianni or whatever your name is this one now growled were not the type to threaten easily pavlos and me we dont want to hear any more talk about anyone walking away from anything no one walks away from us its hard to walk with broken legs and even harder if its your spine janos had been stroking his glass with the long fingers of his left hand watching themeliss face rather than that of his loudmouth companion but now his threefingered hand stopped its stroking and his head slowly turned until he gazed directly into that ones eyes he seemed to crouch down a little into himself on the low windowseat from fear or was it something else and his left hand slid snakelike from the long narrow table to hang by his side the thug could almost feel the intensity of janoss gaze coming right through those enigmatic dark lenses at him and you accuse me of making threats janos finally answered his voice so quiet and deep that it might simply be a series of bass grunts rather than speech proper you have the audacity to believe that i might find it necessary to threaten such as you and then as if that werent more than enough you in your turn threaten me you dare to threaten me have a care for your bones the other hissed his lips drawing back from yellow teeth as he perched himself on the very rim of his chair tilting it forward to shove his bullethead a little closer you smarttalking ohsoclean highandmighty bastard janoss left arm and hand hung out of sight below the rim of the table but instead of drawing back more yet he too had leaned his face forward and now in a movement so swift and flowing it was quicksilver the vampire shot out his large longfingered hand a distance of fifteen inches under the table and bunched up the others scrotum so deep in his groin that his testicles flopped into his palm twisting and squeezing at the same time janos needed only nip with his chiseltipped nails and tear with his great strength to castrate the other right through his threadbare lightweight trousers yes and the fool knew it his bottom jaw fell open and he snapped upright in his chair crowding the table he squirmed gagging as his eyes flew wide open in his face he was the merest moment away from becoming a eunuch and he could do nothing only let him begin to react violently and janos could finish the job in a split second the vampire increased the pressure drew his arm in under the table and his victim inched himself forward and off his chair reached across the bolteddown table and grasped its rim in both hands to maintain his balance and take the strain off his balls and still janos held him there and still he fixed him with his eyes which were only inches away now but where a moment ago the vampires face had been slategrey with rage now he merely smiled however sardonically gurgling with tears streaming from eyes which were standing out like marbles in his purpling face the agonized thug knew how utterly helpless he was and suddenly it dawned on him that not only was it possible for janos to do the unthinkable but it was also probable n no no he managed to gasp that was what janos had been waiting for he read it in the others mind as well as in his wet rubbery face he recognized and accepted his submission and in one viciously coordinated movement he gave a final twist and a squeeze then released and thrust the man away sending his chair flying the thug crashed over on his back gasping and sobbing he rolled himself into an almost foetal position with his hands down between his thighs and there he remained rocking and moaning in his agony all of which had gone unheard by the people in the taverna down below where zorbas dance and its attendant clapping and stamping had drowned everything out but in any case there hadnt been a lot to hear pavlos themelis was pale now his face twitching behind his great beard at first he hadnt known what was going on and by the time he had known it was over and meanwhile lazarides had scarcely turned a hair but now seeming to flow to his feet as sinuous as a snake he stood up and towered over the table you are a fool themelis he grunted and that one is a bigger fool but a deal is a deal and i have already invested too much in this business to abandon it now and so it seems i must see it through very well but at least let me give you some good advice in future be more careful he made as if to leave and themelis got quickly out of his way gasping but we still need your money or some gold at least to see the job done crossing the floor janos paused he appeared to give it a moments thought then said at three in the morning when all the coastguards and petty law officers are asleep in their beds weigh anchor and meet me three seamiles due east of mandraki we will conclude our business there far out of sight and sound of land is it agreed themelis nodded his adams apple bobbing count on it he said the old samothraki will be there and on the floor his partner continued to writhe and groan and sweat out his gradually easing pain and janos going downstairs didnt even look at him it was after eleven and the streets of the old town near the waterfront were much quieter janos walked in the shadows wherever possible his long stride more a lope as he quickly put distance between himself and the taverna dakaris but he was not unobserved greek policemen in civilian clothes hiding in even deeper shadows saw him go and ignored him they didnt know him he wasnt the reason they were here why would they be interested in him no their quarry was one pavlos themelis who was still inside the taverna their brief had been to follow him check out his contacts see if he was passing any stuff around but not to pull him in or hinder him in any way there was bigger stuff going down and when the axe fell someone up top wanted to make sure it came down not only on the master and crew of the samothraki but the entire organization and came down hard it was perfectly obvious that nichos dakaris was part of it too and his rancid taverna a likely distribution point in short janos ferenczys luck was holding but the lackadaisical greek policemen were not the only ones to see him leave the dakaris ellie touloupa was watching too looking down from a vantage point one level up and a block away where an old stone arch supported a narrow walled alley she saw him take his departure and noted his route towards a small jetty in the main harbour where people came ashore in their tenders from the yachts and pleasurecraft ellie wasnt stupid she had done a little quiet checkingup on this lazarides and knew that the sleek white lazarus was his so where else would he be going perhaps he had a woman aboard but if so what was keeping him ashore drinking on his own in a fleapit like nichos dakariss place maybe he had problems well and ellie had a way with problems anyway she found him exciting and who could say but that there might be some money in it too why she might even end up aboard his boat for the night so her thoughts ran as she put out her cigarette descended to the lower level and hurried through a maze of cobbled alleys to a spot where she might intercept him and intercept him she did at a junction of dark highwalled streets not fifty feet from the jetty janos arriving at the junction was aware of her at once her breathing was still laboured from hurrying and her high heels skittered a little on the cobbles as she came to a halt in the shadows she felt that he could even see her as he slowed his pace and turned his head to look straight in her direction then it was a strange feeling to want him to know that she was there but at the same time almost fearing him knowing it should she stand still hold her breath hope that he would carry on by or but too late you he said taking a step towards the shadows where she stood but this is a lonely place ellie and by now there should be customers for you back at nicks as he stepped in so she stepped a little out of the shadows they stood close halfsilhouettes in the darkness of old stone walls and there and then she knew she would have him the way she always knew it i thought i might come aboard your boat she said breathlessly another pace and he drove her back into the darkness until she leaned against the wall but you may not he answered with a slow shake of his head then ah she drew breath sharply as his hand grasped her narrow waist just above the hip then i think perhaps i would like you to fuck me here right now against this wall he chuckled but without humour and should i pay for something you so obviously desire youve already paid she answered beginning to pant as his free hand opened her blouse your wine you sell yourself cheaply ellie he lifted her skirts moved even closer cheaply she breathed against his neck for you its free again his chuckle free you give yourself freely ah but this world is filled with surprises a whore and yet so innocent she parted her legs and sucked at him and expanded as he slid into her he was massive he surged within her filling her and yet still surging the sensation was one such as shed never known or even imagined before was he some sort of god some fantastic priapus who are you she gasped the words out knowing full well who he was and before he could answer what are you janos was aroused now his hunger if nothing else one hand tugged at her breasts while the other reached behind and under her he continued to surge not thrusting but simply elongating into her and now his fingers had found her anus and they too seemed to be surging ah ah ah she gasped her eyes wide and shining in the darkness and her mouth lolling open and finally grunting he answered her question with one of his own do you know the legend of the vrykoulakas his hand left her breasts and took away the dark glasses from his eyes which burned crimson as coals in his face she inhaled air massively but before she could scream his chasm of a mouth had clamped itself over the entire lower half of her face and his tongue also surged into and down her convulsing throat while in her mind ah i see you do know the legend well and now you know the reality so be it inside her body his vampire protoflesh spread into every cavity putting out filament rootlets which burrowed in her veins and arteries like worms in soil without damaging the structure and even before she had lost full consciousness janos was feeding tomorrow they would find her here and say she had died of massive pernicious anaemia and not even the most minute autopsy would discover anything to the contrary nor would there be anyprogeny of this most delicious fusion no for janos would see to it that nothing of him remained in her to surface later and cause him problems as for the life he was taking what of it it was only one of many hundreds and anyway what had she been but a whore the answer was simple she had been nothing three and a half hours later and three miles due east of rhodes town the samothraki lay as if becalmed on a sea like a millpond quite extraordinarily in the last ten or fifteen minutes a writhing fret had developed quickly thickening to a mist and then to a fog now damp white billows were drifting across the old ships decks and visibility was down to zero the first mate still tender from his brush with janos ferenczy had just brought pavlos themelis up onto the deck to see for himself and themelis was rightly astonished what he said but this is crazy what do you make of it the other shook his head i dont know he answered crazy like you said you might expect it in october but thats six months away they moved to the wheelhouse where a crewman was trying to get the foghorn working forget it themelis told him it doesnt work god this is the aegean foghorn i never once used it the pipes will be full of rust anyway she works off steam and weve precious little up so make yourself useful go take a turn stoking we have to move out of this move said the first mate where to the hell out of this themelis barked where do you think into clear water somewhere where the lazarus isnt likely to come barging up out of nowhere and cut us in half speak of the devil the other growled low in his throat his little pigeyes full of hate where they stared through the condensation on the cabin window at the sleek white shape which even now came ghosting alongside her reversed screws bringing her to a dead halt in the gently lapping water the grey mistwreathed crew of the lazarus tossed hawsers the ships were hauled together port to portside ancient tyres festooning the samothrakis strakes acted as buffers keeping the hulls apart all was achieved by the light of the deck lamps in an eerie silence where even the squealing of the tyres as they were compressed and rubbed between the hulls seemed muted by the fog for all that the lazarus was a modern steelhull as broad as the samothraki but three metres longer still she sat low in the water when her screws were dead or idling the decks of the two ships were more or less level and with little or no swell to mention transfer would be as simple as stepping from one ship to the next and yet the crew of the white ship all eight of them simply lined the rail while her master and his american companion stayed back a little gaunt figures under the awnings of the foredeck the cabin lights blazing white through the fog gave their obscure shapes silvery silhouettes at the port rail of the samothraki themelis and his men grew uneasy there was something very odd here something other than this weird unnatural fog this lazarides bastard themeliss sidekick grunted under his breath bothers me themelis offered a low snort of derision something of an understatement that christos he said but keep your balls out of his way and you should be ok the other ignored the jibe the mist clings to him he continued shivering it almost seems to issue from him lazarides and armstrong had moved to the gate in the rail they stood there leaning forward seeming to examine the samothraki minutely there was nothing to choose between them in height themelis thought but plenty in bearing and style the american shambled a little like an ape and wore a black eyepatch over his right eye in his right hand he carried a smart black briefcase hopefully full of money and lazarides beside him straight as a ramrod in the night and the fog affecting those dark glasses of his even now but silent why were they so silent and what were they waiting for so here we are then jianni themelis shook off the black mood of depression which had so suddenly threatened to envelop him opened his arms expansively glanced around and nodded his satisfaction privacy at last eh in the heart of a bank of fog of all bloody things so welcome aboard the old samothraki and at last lazarides smiled you are inviting me aboard eh said themelis taken aback but certainly how else may we get our business done how indeed said the other with a grim nod and as he crossed between ships so he took off his dark glasses armstrong came with him and the rest of his men too clambering over the rails and the crew of the samothraki backed stumblingly away from them knowing now for a fact that something almost everything was most definitely wrong here for the crew of the lazarus were like flameeyed zombies to a man and their master he was like no man theyd ever seen before pavlos themelis seeing the transformation in the face of the man called lazarides as he stepped aboard the samothraki thought his eyes must be playing him tricks his first mate saw it too and frantically yanked his gun from its underarm holster too late for armstrong towered over him the american used his briefcase to bat the gun aside even as it was brought into view then grabbed the mans gunhand and wrestled the weapon round to point at its owners head bullethead didnt stand a chance armstrong pointed the gun into his ear and said hahr and his victim seeing the americans one eye burning like sulphur and his forked crimson tongue flickering in the gape of his mouth simply gave up the ghost that one said janos to themelis almost casually was a fool which was armstrongs signal to pull the trigger as his head flew apart in crimson ruin christos was tossed like a rag doll over the rail sliding down between the hulls his body was crushed and ground a little before being dumped into the mist lying soft on the sea the hole he made in it quickly sealed itself the echo of the shot which had killed him caught by the fog and tossed back was still ringing holy mother of themelis breathed helpless as his men were rounded up but as janos advanced on him he backed away and again disbelievingly observed the length of his head and jaws the teeth in his monstrous mouth the weird scarlet blaze of his terrible eyes jjjianni the greek finally got his brain working jianni i show me this cocaine janos took hold of his shoulder with a steel hand his fingers biting deep this oh so valuable white powder it its below themeliss answer was a mere breath he could not darent take his eyes from the others face then take me below said janos but first to his men you did well now do as you will i know how hungry you are even below decks themelis could hear the screams of his crew and he thought what christos nixos a fool maybe but at least he didnt know what hit him and he wondered how long before his screams would be joining the rest forty minutes later the lazaruss diesels coughed into life and she drew slowly away from the now silent wallowing samothraki the fog was lifting stars beginning to show through and soon the horizon would light with the first crack of a new day when the lazarus was a quartermile away the doomed samothraki blew apart in a massive explosion and gouting fire bits of her spiralled or fluttered back to the foaming sea and were put out leaving only their drifting smoke she was no more in a few days pieces of her planking might wash ashore maybe a body or two possibly even the bloated fisheaten corpse of pavlos themelis himself harry keogh now exnecroscope harry woke up knowing that something was happening or about to happen he was propped up in the huge old bed where hed nodded off his head against the headboard a fat blackbound book open in his slack hands the book of the vampire a socalled factual treatise which examined the elemental evil of the vampire down through all the ages to modern times it was light reading for the necroscope and many of its wellauthenticated cases little more than grotesque jokes for no one in the world with one possible exception knew more about the legend the source the truth of vampirism than harry keogh that one exception was his son also called harry except that harry jnr didnt count because in fact he wasnt in this world at all but somewhere else harry had been dreaming an old troubled dream one which mingled his life and loves of fifteen years gone by with those of the here and now turning them into a surreal kaleidoscope of eroticism he had dreamed of loving helen his first groping sexual experience and of brenda his first true love and the wife of his youth so that however strange and overlapping these had been sweet and familiar dreams and tender but he had also dreamed of the lady karen and her monstrous aerie in the world of the wamphyri and it seemed likely that this was the dreadful dream which had started him awake but somewhere in there had been dreams of sandra too his new and he hoped lasting love affair which because of its freshness was more vivid real and immediate than the others it had taken the sting of poignancy from some of the dream and the cold clutch of horror from the rest of it that was what he had been dreaming about making love to the women he had known and to one he knew now and also of making love to the lady karen whom mercifully he had never known not in that way but sandra theyd made love before on several occasions no on many occasions though rarely satisfactorily always at her place in edinburgh in the turneddown green glow of her bedside lamp not satisfactory for harry anyway of course he couldnt speak for sandra he suspected though that she loved him dearly he had never let her know about his dissatisfaction not merely because he didnt want to hurt her more especially because it would only serve to highlight his own deficiency a deficiency yes and yet at the same time something of a paradox because by comparison with other men he supposed that to sandra he must seem almost superhuman he could make love to her for an hour sometimes longer before bringing himself to climax but he was not superhuman at least not in that sense it was simply that in bed he couldnt seem to get switched on to her when he came always it was with some other woman in his minds eye any other woman the friend of a friend or some brief chance encounter some cover girl or other even the small girl helen from his childhood or the wife brenda from his early manhood a hell of a thing to admit about the woman you think you love and who youre fairly sure loves you his deficiency obviously for sandra was very beautiful indeed harry should consider himself a lucky man everybody said so maybe it was the cool green subdued lighting of her bedroom that turned him off he didnt really care for green and her eyes were greenish too or a greenyblue anyway thats why her part of this dream had been so different in it they had made love and it had been good he had been close to climax when he woke up when hed come awake knowing that something was about to happen he woke up in his own bed in his own country house near bonnyrig not far out of edinburgh with the book still in his hands and feeling its weight there so maybe thats what had coloured his dreams vampires the wamphyri not surprising really theyd coloured most of his dreams for several years now outside dawn was on the brink faint streamers of light greygreen filtered through the narrow slits of his blinds they tinted the atmosphere of his bedroom with a faint watercolour haze a wash of subdued submarine tints halfreclining there becoming aware coming back to life he felt a tingle start up in his scalp his hair was standing up on end so was his penis still throbbing from the dream he was naked electrically erect and now aware and intent he listened intently to murmuring plumbing sounds as the central heating responded to its timer to the first idiot twitterings of sleepy birds in the garden to a world stretching itself in the strengthening dawn outside rarely sleeping more than an hour or two at a stretch dawn was harrys favourite time normally it was always good to know that the night was safely past a new day underway but this time he felt that something was happening and he gazed intently through the faint green haze turning his eyes to stare at the open bedroom door drugged by sleep his eyes saw everything with soft edges fuzzy and indistinct there was nothing sharp in the entire room except his inexplicable intentness which seemed odd when matched against his blurred vision anyone who ever started awake after a good drunk would know how he felt you halfknow where you are you halfwant to be somewhere special you are halfafraid of not being where you should be and even when you know where you are youre still not quite sure youre there or even that you are you part of the never again syndrome except that harry had not been drinking not that he could remember anyway the other thing that invariably affected him on those occasions when he woke up like this the thing which had used to frighten him a great deal but which hed thought he was used to was his paralysis the fact that he could not move it was only the transition from sleep to waking he knew that but still it was horrible he had to force gradual movement into his limbs usually starting with a hand or a foot he was paralysed now with only his eyes to command of all his various parts he made them stare through the open bedroom door into the shadows beyond something was happening something had awakened him something had robbed him of the satisfaction of spilling himself into sandra and enjoying it for once something was in the house that would account for his tingling scalp his hair standing erect at the back of his neck his wilting hardon a perfume was in the air something moved in the shadows beyond the bedroom door a movement sensed not heard something came closer to the door paused just out of sight in darkness harry wanted to call out whos there but his paralysis wouldnt let him perhaps he gurgled a little a shape emerged partly from the shadows through the submarine haze he saw a navel the lower part of a belly with its dark bush of pubic hair the curve of soft feminine hips and the tops of thighs where they might show above dark stockings she stood just beyond the door her flesh soft in the filtered light as he watched she transferred her weight from one unseen foot to the other her thighs moving her hip jutting above the belly soft in the shadows there would be breasts large and ripe sandra had large breasts it was sandra of course harrys voice still refused to work but he could now move the fingers of his left hand sandra must be able to see him see how she was affecting him his dream was about to become reality the blood coursed in his veins and began to pound once more in the back of his mind faintly he asked himself questions and answered them why had she come obviously for sex how had she got in he must have given her a key he didnt remember doing so why didnt she come forward more clearly into view because she wanted to see him fully aroused first perhaps she had not wished to wake him until she was in bed with him why had she waited so long to show him that she could be sexually aggressive shed taken the initiative before certainly but never to this extent maybe because she sensed his uncertainty feared that he might be having second thoughts or perhaps because she suspected he had never fully enjoyed her well and maybe she was right staring was causing his right eye to jump both eyes to water it was the poor light harry willed his left hand to move stretched it out pulled the cord that closed the window shutters to shut out a little more of the faint greenygrey light that left the room in neardarkness thin dim green stripes on a black velvet background and that was what shed been waiting for now she moved forward olivefleshed she must be wearing stockings a tshirt too rolled up to show her navel sexy dismembered by darkness her thighs belly and navel floated towards him hips moving languidly greenstriped she got onto the bed kneeling her thighs opening and inched forward the dark cleft was visible in her bush of pubic hair she was so silent and so light the bed did not sink in where she crept towards him harry wondered how does she do that she began to lower herself onto him slowly so slowly the dark cleft widening as her body settled to its target he arched his back straining up towards her but why couldnt he feel her knees gripping his hips why was she so weightless then suddenly and without warning his flesh was crawling lust fled him in a moment for somehow instinctively intuitively he knew that this was not sandra and worse he knew that he couldnt rightly say what it was his left hand fumblingly found the light cord pulled it light flooded the room blindingly at the same time the cleft in her bush of pubic hair sprang open like a mechanical thing whitegleaming yawning jaws of salivating needle teeth set in bulging obscenely glistening pink gums shot down from the gaping lips to snap shut on him in a vice of shearing agony harry screamed rammed himself backwards in his bed banged his head savagely on the headboard galvanized his hands stabbed out striking murderously for a face a throat striking instinctively at features which werent there above the navel nothing and below the upper thighs nothing she it was a lower abdomen a disembodied vagina with cannibal teeth which were chomping on him and his blood hot and red and spurting as the thing feasted on his genitals and munched them up like so much slop and a crimson eye that snapped suddenly open glaring at harry from the orbit which he had mistaken for a navel and thats it harry dr david bettley an ebranch empath retired early for the sake of his shaky heart gazed at his visitor from beneath halflowered bushy eyebrows isnt it enough the other answered with some animation christ it was enough for me it scared the living daylights out of me yes even out of me i mean dont think im bragging but thats no easy thing to do its just that this damn dream was so so real we all have nightmares but this onehe shook his head gave an involuntary shudder yes i can see how badly it affected you said bettley concernedly but when i say thats it it isnt to make light of your experience im simply asking was there any more no harry shook his head for thats when i actually came awake but if you mean more reaction to it youd better believe there was look i was weak as a kitten im sure i was in shock i felt physically sick almost threw up also i emptied my bowels and im not ashamed to admit that i only just made it to the toilet i dont mean to be crude but that dream literally scared the shit out of me he paused slumped back in his chair and lost a little of his animation he looked tired bettley thought but eventually he struggled upright again and continued afterwards i prowled the house with all the lights blazing with a meat cleaver in my hand i searched for the thing everywhere for an hour two until full daylight and most of that time i was shaking like a leaf it was only when id stopped shaking that i finally convinced myself it was a dream he suddenly laughed but his laughter was shaky even now hey i nearly called the police can you picture that i mean youre a psychiatrist but how do you think theyd have taken my story eh maybe id have been in to see you a day or two earlier dr bettley steepled his fingers and stared deep into the others eyes harry keogh was maybe fortythree or four but looked five years younger except bettley knew that his mind was in fact five years younger again it was a weird business dealing with even looking at a man like harry keogh for bettley had known this face and body before when it belonged to alec kyle the doctor shook his head and blinked then deliberately avoided harrys eyes it was just that sometimes they could be so very soulful those eyes of his as for the rest of him harrys body had been wellfleshed maybe even a little overweight once with its height however that hadnt mattered a great deal not to alec kyle whose job with ebranch had been in large part sedentary but it had mattered to harry after that business at the chateau bronnitsy his metempsychosis hed trained his new body down got it to a peak of perfection or at least done as best he could with it considering its age thats why it looked only thirtyseven or eight years old but better still if it was only thirtytwo like the mind inside it a very confusing business and the doctor shook his head and blinked again so what do you make of it keogh asked could it be part of my problem your problem bettley repeated him oh im sure it is im sure it could only be part of your problem unless of course you havent put me fully in the picture harry raised an eyebrow about your feelings towards sandra youve mentioned a certain ambivalence a lack of desire even a slackening of potency it could be that youre taking your loss out on her mentally inside your head blaming her for the fact that youre no longer he paused a necroscope harry prompted possibly bettley shrugged but on the other hand you also seem ambivalent towards your loss i have to tell you that sometimes i get the feeling youre glad its gone glad you can no longer talk to to to the dead said harry sourly and well youre halfright sometimes its good to be just normal ordinary lets face it most people would consider me a freak even a monster so youre halfright but youre also halfwrong he lay back in the chair again closed his eyes and stroked his brow bettley went back to studying him grey streaks so evenly spaced as to seem deliberately designed or affected were plentiful in harrys russetbrown naturally wavy hair it wouldnt be too many years before the grey overtook the brown even now it loaned him a certain erudite appearance gave him the look of a scholar ah but in what strange and esoteric subjects and yet harry wasnt like that at all what a black magician a thcentury wizard a necromancer no just a necroscope a man who talked to the dead or used to of course he had other talents too bettley looked at him sitting there so tiredlooking his hand to his brow the places this man had been the means hed used to go there and to return what other man had ever used an obscure mathematical concept as a a spaceship or a timemachine harry opened his eyes and caught bettley staring at him he said nothing merely stared back thats what he was here for to be stared at to be examined and bettley was good at his job and discreet everybody said so he had many admirable qualities must have else intesp would never have taken him on and again harry wondered is he still working for them not that it would matter a great deal for bettley was easy to talk to it was just that harry so hated subterfuge the doctor continued to stare into harrys eyes they were soulful as ever and somehow defensive but at the same time it seemed that harry needed this close contact honeybrown those eyes very wide very intelligent and very innocent genuinely innocent bettley knew harry keogh had not asked to be what he was or to be called upon to do the things hed done bettley forced himself back to the job in hand so im halfwrong he said you would like your talents back to be a freak again your words harry but what will you do with those talents if they do return to you how will you use them harry gave a wry smile his teeth were good and strong not quite white a little uneven they were set in a mouth which was usually sensitive but could tighten becoming caustic and even cruel or perhaps not so much cruel as unyielding singleminded you know i scarcely knew my mother he dreamily answered i was too young just a baby when she died but i got to know her later and i miss her a boys best friend is his mum you know and well i have a lot of friends down there in the ground yes hell we had some good conversations bettley almost shuddered fought it down you miss talking to them they had their problems wanted to air their views wondered how things had gone in the world of the living some of them worried a lot about people theyd left behind i was able to reassure them but most were merely lonely merely but i knew what it was like for them i could feel it it was hell to be that lonely they needed me i was somebody to them and i suppose i miss them needing me but none of this explains your dream the doctor mused maybe it has no explanation except fear youve lost your friends your skills those parts of yourself that made you unique and now youre afraid of losing your manhood harry narrowed his eyes a little and began to pay more attention he looked at bettley more piercingly explain but isnt it obvious a disembodied female thing a dead thing a vampire thing devours your core the parts of you that make you a man she was fear your fear pure but not so simple her vampire nature was straight out of your own past experience you dont like being normal and the more you have to endure it the more afraid of it you get to be its all tied up to your past harry its all the things youve lost until youre afraid of losing anything else you lost your mother when you were a child lost your own wife and child in an unreachable place lost so many friends and even your own body and finally youve lost your talents no more mцbius continuum no more talking to the dead no more necroscope harry was frowning now what you said about vampires made me remember something he said several things in fact he went back to rubbing his brow go on bettley prompted him i have to start some way back harry continued when i was a kid at harden modern boys thats a school i was a necroscope even then but it wasnt something i much liked it used to make me dizzy sick even i mean it came naturally to me but i knew it wasnt i knew it was very unnatural but even before that i used to well see things bettley was an empath now he felt something of what harry felt and the short hairs began to rise at the back of his neck this was going to be important he glanced down at a button on his side of the desk it was still red the tape was still running what sort of things he asked hiding his eagerness i was an infant when my stepfather killed my mother the other answered i wasnt on the scene and even if i had been i wasnt old enough for it to impress me i couldnt possibly have understood what was happening and almost certainly i wouldnt have remembered it and i couldnt have reconstructed it later from overheard conversations because shukshins account of the accident had been accepted there was no question of his having murdered her except from me it was a nightmare i used to have of him holding her there under the ice until she drifted away and i saw the ring on his finger a catseye set in a thick gold band it came off when he drowned her and sank to the bottom of the river and fifteen years later i knew where to go back and dive for it bettley felt a tingling in his spine but you were a necroscope the necroscope and read it out of your dead mothers mind surely harry shook his head no because it was a dream i had from a time long before i first consciously talked to the dead and in it i remembered something i couldnt possibly remember it was a talent id had without even recognizing it you know my mother was a psychic medium and her mother too maybe it was something that came down from them but as my greater talent as a necroscope developed so this other thing was pushed into the background got lost and you think all of this has something to do with this new dream of yours in what way harrys shrug was lighter no longer defeatist you know how when someone goes blind he seems to develop a sixth sense and people handicapped from birth how they seem to make up for their deficiencies in other ways of course the doctor answered some of the greatest musicians the worlds ever seen have been deaf or blind but what and then he snapped his fingers i see so you think that the loss of your other talents has caused this this atrophied one to start growing again is that it maybe harry nodded maybe except im not just seeing things from the past any more but from the future my future but vaguely unformed except as nightmares it was bettleys turn to frown a precog is that what you think youre becoming but what has this to do with vampires harry it was my dream the other answered something id forgotten or hadnt wanted to remember until you brought it back to me but now i remember it clearly i can see it clearly go on its just a little thing harry shrugged again perhaps defensively but best if we have it out in the open right bettley spoke quietly clearing the way for harry without openly urging him on perhaps and in a sudden rush of words i saw red threads the scarlet lifethreads of vampires in your dream bettley shivered as gooseflesh crept on his back and forearms where in your dream in the green stripes where the light came through the blinds harry answered the stripes on her belly and thighs in the moment before that hellish thing fastened on me they were greentinted almost submarine but as my blood began to spurt they turned red red stripes streaming off her body into the dim past and also into the future writhing red threads among the blue lifethreads of humanity vampires the doctor said nothing waited felt the others horror and fascination washing out from him welling into the study like a sick almost tangible flood tide until harry shook his head and cut off the flow then abruptly he stood up and headed a little unsteadily for the door harry bettley called after him at the door harry turned im wasting your time he said as usual lets face it you could be right and im frightened of my own shadow selfpity because im nothing special any more and maybe scared because i know what could be out there waiting for me but probably isnt but what the hell what will be will be we know that and the time is long past when i could do anything about it or change any part of it bettley shook his head in denial it wasnt a waste harry not if we got something out of it and it seems to me we got a lot out of it the other nodded thanks anyway he said and closed the door behind him the doctor got up and moved to his window shortly down below harry left the building and stepped out into princes street in the heart of edinburgh he turned up his coat collar against the squalling rain tucked his chin in and angled his back to the bluster then stepped to the kerb and hailed a taxi a moment later and the car had whirled him away bettley returned to his desk sat down and sighed now he was the one who felt weak but keoghs psychic essence a neartangible echo of his presence was already fading when it had faded into nothing the empath rewound his interview tape and dialled a special number at intesp hq in london he waited until he got a signal then placed the handset into a cradle on the tape machine under his desk at the press of a button harrys interview began playing itself into storage at ebranch along with all of his other interviews in the back of the taxi on the way to bonnyrig harry relaxed and closed his eyes leaned his head against the seat and tried to recall something of that other dream which had bothered him on and off for the last three or four years the one about harry jnr he knew what the dream was in essence what had been done to him how and why but its fine detail eluded him the what and how part was obvious by use of the wamphyri art of fascination hypnotism harry jnr had made his father an exnecroscope at the same time removing or cancelling his ability to enter and manoeuvre in the mцbius continuum as to why hed done it you would destroy me if you could he heard his sons voice again like a record played a hundred times until he knew every word and phrase every mood and emotion or lack of it by heart dont deny it for i can see it in your eyes smell it on your breath read it in your mind i know your mind well father almost as well as you do ive explored every part of it remember and now under his breath harry answered again as hed answered then but if you know that much then you know id never harm you i dont want to destroy you only to cure you as you cured the lady karen and where is she now father it hadnt been an accusation thered been no sarcasm in it no sourness it was just a statement of fact for the lady karen had killed herself which harry jnr knew well enough the thing had taken too strong a hold on her harry had insisted also shed been a peasant a traveller without your understanding she couldnt see what shed gained only what she thought shed lost she didnt have to kill herself maybe she was unbalanced you know she wasnt she was simply wamphyri and you drove her vampire out and killed it you thought it would be like killing a tapeworm like lancing a boil or curing out a cancer but it wasnt you say she couldnt see what shed gained now tell me father what you think the lady karen had gained her freedom harry had cried in desperation and in sudden horror of himself for gods sake dont prove me wrong in what i did im no bloody murderer no youre not but you are a man with an obsession and im afraid of you or if not afraid of you afraid of your goals your ambitions you want a world your worldfree of vampirism an entirely admirable objective but when youve achieved that aim what then will my world be next an obsession yes which seems to be growing in you even as my vampire is growing in me im wamphyri now father and theres nothing so tenacious as a vampire unless its harry keogh himself cant you see how dangerous you are to me you know many of the secret arts of the wamphyri and how to destroy them you can talk to the dead travel in the mцbius continuum even in time itself however ephemerally i ran away from you from your world once but now in this world ive fought for my territories and earned them theyre mine now and ill not desert them ill run no more but i cant take the chance that you wont come after me darent accept the risk that you wont be satisfied im wamphyri ill not suffer your experiments ill not be a guinea pig for any more cures you might come up with and what of me harry had spoken up then even as he now whispered the words to himself how safe will i be im a threat to you youve admitted as much how long before your vampire is ascendant and you come looking for me but that wont happen father im not a peasant i do have knowledge i shall control myself as a clever addict controls his addiction and if it gets out of control you too are a necroscope and in the mцbius continuum theres nothing you cant do nowhere you cant go and always carrying your contamination with you what poor bastard will get your egg son at which harry jnr had sighed heavily and taken off his golden mask his scars from the battle in the garden had healed now there was nothing much to be seen of them his vampire had been busy repairing him moulding his flesh as his father feared it would one day mould his will so you see were at stalemate hed said and his eyes had opened into huge crimson orbs no harry gasped out loud now as hed gasped it then except that then it had been the last thing hed said for quite some time until hed woken up at ebranch hq whereas now whazzat chief his dourfaced driver puzzled and frowning glanced back at him but did ye no say bonnyrig ah surely hope so cos were amost there the real world crashed down on harry he was sitting upright stiff and pale with his bottom jaw hanging slightly open he licked his dry lips and looked out through the taxis windows yes they were almost there and bonnyrig yes of course he mumbled i was i was daydreaming thats all and he directed the other through the village and to his house north london in late april a fairly rundown bottomfloor flat in the otherwise upwardly mobile district of highgate just off hornsey lane two men apparently relaxed talking quietly over drinks in a large sittingroom lined with bookshelves full of books and many small items of foreign mainly european bricabrac very untypical of his race nikolai zharov was slender as a wand pale as milk almost effeminate in his affectations he used a cigarette holder to smoke marlboros with their filters torn off spoke excellent english albeit with a slight lisp and had in general a rather limpwristed air his eyes were dark deepset and heavylidded giving him an almostdrugged appearance which belied the alert and ever calculating nature of his brain his hair was thin and black swept back lacquered down with some antisepticsmelling russian preparation under a thin straight nose his lips were also thin in a toowide mouth a pointed chin completed his lean look he appeared the sort who might easily bend but never break real men might be tempted to look at him askance but they wouldnt push their luck with him out in the citys streets zharov would certainly warrant a second glance following which the observer would very likely look away the russian tended to make people feel uneasy he made wellesley uneasy for a fact though the latter tried hard to conceal it as owner of the flat wellesley was worried someone might have seen his visitor coming here or even followed him which would be one hell of a difficult thing to explain away for wellesley was a player in the intelligence game and so was zharov though ostensibly they worked for different bosses at five feet eight inches tall norman harold wellesley was some five or six inches shorter than the spindly russian he had more meat on him too and more colour in his face too much colour but it wasnt his stature or mildly choleric mottling that put him at a disadvantage his current mental agitation hailed not so much from physical or even cultural disparities of race and type as from fear pure and simple fear of what zharov was asking him to do in answer to which he had just this moment replied but you must know thats plainly out of the question not feasible indeed little short of impossible explosiveseeming words yet uttered quietly coldly even with a measure of calculation a calculated attempt to dissuade zharov from his course or perhaps reroute it a little even knowing that he wasnt the author of the request hed made but merely the delivery boy and the russian had obviously expected as much wrong he answered just as quietly but with something of a cold smile to counter the others flush not only is it entirely possible but imperative if as you have reported harry keogh is on the verge of developing new and hitherto unsuspected talents then he must be stopped it is as simple as that he has been a veritable plague on soviet espionage norman a disaster a mental hurricane a psiclone oh our ebranch survives lives on despite all his efforts but barely zharov shrugged on the other hand perhaps we should be grateful to him his er successes have made us more than ever aware of the power of parapsychology its importance in the field of spying the problem is that as a weapon he gives your side far too much of an edge which is why he has to go if wellesley had been paying any real attention to zharovs argument it hardly showed you will recall he now started to reply mean you have probably been informed that my initial liability was a small one very well i owe your masters a small favour im in their debt lets say but not such a large debt even now and their interest rates are way too high my friend beyond my limited ability to pay im afraid thats my answer nikolai which you must take back with you to moscow zharov sighed put down his drink and leaned back in his chair he stretched his long legs folded his arms across his chest and pursed his lips he allowed his heavy eyelids to droop more yet the pupils of his dark eyes glinted from their cores and for several long moments he studied wellesley where he was seated on the opposite side of a small occasional table wellesleys red hair was receding fast at fortyfive he was perhaps six or seven years the russians senior and looked every day of it a generally unattractive man his one redeeming feature was his mouth it was firm wellshaped and housed an immaculate set of teeth other than that his nose was bulbous and fleshy his watery blue eyes too round and staring and his excess of colouring brought the large freckles of his forehead into glaring yellow prominence zharov concentrated on wellesleys freckles a moment more before straightening up again ah detente he tuttutted glasnost what have they brought us to when we must bargain with debtors why in the good old days we would simply send in the debtcollectors or perhaps the bullyboys but now the gentlemans way out bankruptcy receivership norman im very much afraid youre about to go bankrupt your cover is about to be he formed his mouth into a tube and puffed cigarette smoke through it in a series of perfect rings blown cover wellesleys eyes narrowed suspiciously and his colour deepened more yet i have no cover i am what i appear to be look i made a mistake and i understand i must pay for it fine but im not about to kill for you oh youd like that wouldnt you for me to turn a small debt into a massive great overdraft but its not on nikolai so go ahead comrade drop me in it bankrupt me if thats the threat ill lose my job and maybe my liberty for a while but not forever but if i play your game im a goner id be in even deeper and what will it be next time eh more treachery another murder what youre doing is blackmail and you know it but im not having any so do your worst and kiss any favours i owe you goodbye forever bluff zharov smiled and nicely played too but bluff all the same his smile fell from his face and he stood up very well i call you are a mole a sleeper a sleeper wellesleys fists shook where he held them clenched at his sides well and maybe i was but never activated ive done nothing wrong zharov smiled again but it was more a grimace he gave a small shrug of his thin shoulders and headed for the door that will be your side of it of course wellesley jumped to his feet and got to the door first and where the hell do you think youre going he rasped weve resolved nothing i have said all i had to say said the other coming to a halt and standing perfectly still after a moments pause he carefully reached out and took his overcoat from a peg and now his voice had deepened a little and his thin mouth twitched in one corner now i am leaving he took thin black leather gloves from a pocket of the overcoat and swiftly pulled them on and will you try to stop me norman believe me that would be something of an error wellesley had never been much for the physical side of things he believed the other well enough he backed off a little said so what will happen now i shall report your reticence zharov was forthright i shall say you no longer consider your debt outstanding that you wish it written off and they shall reply no we wish him written off your file will be leaked to someone of responsibility in one of your own intelligence branches and my file wellesleys watery eyes began a rapid nervous blinking a few dirty pictures of me and a whore snapped through oneway glass in a grubby moscow hotel all of twelve years ago why in those days that sort of stuff was tenapenny it was dealt with on a daytoday basis tomorrow i shall go and make a clean breast of that old affair and what will your side do then eh moreover ill name names yours specifically and therell be no more courier jobs for you nikolai zharov gave a small sad shake of his head your file is somewhat thicker than that norman why its quite full of little tidbits of intelligence information youve passed on to us over the years make a clean breast of it oh i should think youll be doing that or at least trying to for quite a few years to come tidbits of wellesley was now almost purple ive given you nothing not a thing what tidbits of zharov watched him shaking like a leaf shaking from a combination of rage and frustration and slowly the russians smile returned know youve given us nothing he said quietly until now we havent asked for anything also know youre innocent more or less but the people who count dont and now finally we are asking for something so you can either pay up or and again his shrug its your life my friend as zharov reached to open the door wellesley caught at his arm i need to think about it he gasped fair enough only dont take too long wellesley nodded gulped dont go out that way go out the back he led the way through the flat how did you come here anyway christ if anyone saw you i no one saw me norman and anyway im not much known over here i was at a casino in the cromwell road i came by taxi and let him drop me off a few blocks away i walked now i shall walk again and eventually get another cab wellesley let him out the back door and went with him down the dark garden path to the gate before pulling the gate to behind him zharov took out a manila envelope from his overcoat pocket and handed it over some photographs you havent seen before he said just a reminder that you shouldnt take too long making up your mind norman were in a bit of a hurry as you see and dont try to contact me i shall be in touch with you meanwhile ill have a night or two to kill i might even find myself a nice clean whore he chuckled dryly and if your lot take any pictures of me with her why ill just keep them as souvenirs when hed gone wellesley went shakily back indoors he freshened up his drink and sat down then took out the photographs from their envelope to anyone who didnt know better theyd seem to be blowups of simple snapshots but wellesley knew better and so would just about any agent or officer of british intelligence or of any of the worlds intelligence agencies for that matter the pictures were of wellesley and a much older man they wore overcoats and russian fur hats walked together chatted in a scene where the spiral cupolas of red square were prominent over redtiled rooftops drank vodka seated on the steps of a dacha halfadozen shots in all and it would seem they were bosom pals wellesleys older friend would be in his midsixties he was grey at the temples with a central stripe of jetblack hair swept back from a high muchwrinkled brow he had small eyes under bushy black eyebrows lots of laughter lines in the corners of his eyes and lips and a hard mouth in a face which was otherwise quite jolly well and he had been a jolly sort of chap in his way and jolly murderous in other ways wellesleys lips silently formed his name borowitz then spoke it out loud comrade general gregor borowitz you old bastard god what a fool i was one picture was especially interesting if only for its scenery wellesley and borowitz standing in the courtyard of an old mansion or chateau a place of debased heritage and mixed architectural antecedents it had twin minarets jutting upwards like rotting phallus mushrooms from steeplygabled end walls their flaking spiral decorations and sagging parapets added to a general sense of decay and dereliction but in fact the chateau had been anything but derelict wellesley had never been inside the place hadnt even known what it housed not then but he knew well enough now it was the chateau bronnitsy soviet mindspy hq an infamous place until harry keogh had blown it to hell it was a pity he hadnt done it just a couple of years earlier thats all the next morning darcy clarke was late for work a bad traffic accident on the north circular trafficlight failure in the centre of town and finally some dumb bastards rustbucket parked in darcys space hed been about to let the air out of the offenders tyres when he turned up said fuck you to clarkes raving and drove off still fuming clarke used the elevator discreetly placed at the rear of an otherwise perfectly normallooking upmarket hotel to climb up to the top floor which in its soundproof burglarproof mundane mechanical and metaphysicsproofed entirety housed ebranch also known as intesp as he let himself in and shrugged out of his coat last nights duty officer was just leaving for home abel angstrom gave clarke the onceover and said morning darcy all hot and bothered are you you will be clarke grimaced and hung up his coat nothing can go wrong that hasnt already he grunted whats up the boss angstrom told him thats whats up hes been up since locked in his office with the keogh file drinking coffee by the gallon hes watching the clock too been gripping each and every guy whos come in after am he wants you so if i were you id wear my flakjacket clarke groaned said thanks for the warning went to the gents and tidied himself up a little straightening his tie in a mirror suddenly everything boiled over to himself he rasped what the bloody hell why do i bother dogsbloodybody clarke and himself wants to see me does he shit and damnation its like being in the bloody army he deliberately unstraightened his tie mussed his hair looked at himself again there that was better and come to think of it what did he have to fear anyway answer nothing for clarke had a psitalent no one had positively tagged yet it kept him out of trouble protecting him as a mother protects her child he wasnt quite a deflector fire a gun at him and your bullets wouldnt swerve youd simply miss him or the firingpin would come down on duds or hed somehow stumble at just the right moment he was the opposite of accidentprone he could walk through a minefield and come out unscathed and yet he still switched off the current to change a lightbulb except this morning he wasnt in the mood for switching off anything let it all hang out he thought heading for the sanctum sanctorum when he knocked on the door a surly voice said who arrogant bastard he thought darcy clarke come in clarke and as he passed inside where the hell have you been i mean do you work here or not and before he could answer sit down but clarke remained standing he didnt need this hed had it taken all he could take of his new boss in the six months the man had been the head of ebranch hell there were other jobs he didnt have to work for this overbearing bastard and where was the continuity sir keenan gormley had been a gentleman alec kyle a friend under clarke himself the branch had been efficient and friendly to its friends anyway but this bloke was hell a boor gauche a primitive certainly as far as internal relationships man management were concerned as for talents so what was the guy a scryer telepath deflector locator no his talent was simply that his mind was impenetrable telepaths couldnt touch him some would say that made him the ideal man for the job maybe it did but it would be nice if he was human too after serving under such men as gormley and kyle working for someone like norman harold wellesley was wellesley was seated at his desk without looking up he sighed took a deep breath and said i said thats right i heard you clarke cut him short good morning to you too now wellesley looked up and clarke saw that he was his usual florid self he also saw the file on harry keogh spread every which way across the surface of wellesleys desk and for the first time he wondered what was going on wellesley saw clarkes attitude at once knew it wouldnt be wise to try riding roughshod over him this morning also he knew there was a powerstruggle coming up that it had been in the wind ever since he took over here but that was something he didnt need not right now anyway all right darcy he said tempering his tone a little so weve both been having a bad time youre the second in command i know that and you believe youre due some respect fine but when things go wrong and while were all running round being nice and respectful im the one who carries the can however you feel about it i still have to run this place and with this kind of job who needs an excuse to be illmannered thats my story so how come you got out of the wrong side of bed this morning clarice thought what when did he last call me darcy is he actually trying to be reasonable for christs sake he allowed himself to be mollified partly and sat down the traffic was hell and some clown stole my parking space he finally answered thats just for starters im also expecting a call from rhodes from trevor jordan and ken layard on that drugs job customs and excise and new scotland yard will want to know how things are progressing add to that about a dozen unanswered requests from our minister responsible for esper support on unsolved major crimes routine office admin the russian embassy job im supposed to be supervising and well you can skip the embassy job for one wellesley was quick to break in its routine unimportant a few extra ivans in the country a russian delegation so what christ weve more on our plate than mundane snooping but even without all that yes i can see youre up to your neck damn right said clarke and sinking fast so you see i wouldnt think you rude in fact id probably thank you if you simply told me to piss off and get on with my job except i dont suppose youd have called me in here if there wasnt something on your mind well no one could ever accuse you of not getting straight to the point could they said wellesley and for once his round eyes were unblinking and less than hostile where they searched the other out what he saw was this for all his weird talent clarke wasnt much to look at no one would suppose that hed ever been the boss of anything let alone head of the most secret branch of the british secret services he was mr nondescript the worlds most average man well maybe not that indistinct but getting on that way certainly middleheight mouseyhaired with something of a slight stoop and a small paunch and middleaged to boot clarke was just about middle of the range in every way he had hazel eyes in a face not much given to laughter an intense mouth and generally downcast air and the rest of him including his wardrobe was medium but he had run ebranch hed been around through some pretty hairy stuff hed known harry keogh keogh said wellesley the name coming off his lips like it tasted sour thats whats on my mind that as if keogh were some kind of contraption or thing and not a person at all clarke raised an eyebrow something new on harry wellesley had been monitoring bettleys reports himself and keeping whatever they contained to himself maybe and maybe not wellesley answered and rapidly so as not to allow clarke time to think do you know what would happen if he got his talents back sure and even though clarke did have time to think he said it anyway youd be out of a job unexpectedly wellesley smiled but it quickly faded from his face its always good to know where one stands he said so you think hed take over ebranch right with his talents he could be ebranch clarke answered and suddenly his face lit up are you saying hes got them back for a moment wellesley didnt answer then you were his friend werent you his friend clarke frowned chewed his bottom lip began to look a little worried no he couldnt honestly say hed ever been a friend of harrys or even that hed wanted to be thered been a time though when hed seen some of harrys friends in action and he still had nightmares about it but at last he answered we were acquainted thats all see most of harrys real friends were sort of well dead he gave a shrug thats what qualified them sort of wellesley stared harder at him and he actually did what these documents credit him with doing talked to the dead called corpses out of their graves i mean ill grant you telepathy ive seen it working in our test cubicles and in all the criminal cases the branch has dealt with in the last six months even your own peculiar talent darcy which is well documented even if i havent yet seen it in action but this he wrinkled his bulbous nose a damned necromancer clarke shook his head a necroscope harry wouldnt like you to call him a necromancer if youve been through his file youll know about dragosani he was a necromancer the dead were frightened of him they loathed him but they loved harry yes he talked to them and called them up out of their graves when that was the only way to do what he had to do but there was no pressure involved just for them to know he was in dire straits was often sufficient wellesley was aware that clarkes voice had gone very quiet and that the man himself was now quite pale but still he pressed on you were there in hartlepool at the end of the bodescu affair you actually saw this thing clarke shuddered i saw many things i smelled them too he shook his head as if to clear it of unbearable memories and pulled himself together so whats your problem norman ok so during your time here weve mainly been dealing with mundane stuff well that is what we deal with mainly as for what harry keogh gormley kyle and all the others came up against that time just hope and pray its all done with thats all still wellesley seemed unconvinced it couldnt have been mass hypnotism mass illusion some kind of trick or fraud again clarke shook his head i have this defencemechanism thing remember you might be able to fool me but not it it only gets scared when theres something there to be scared of it doesnt run away from harmless illusions only from real dangers but it sure as hell propels me away from dead people and undead people and things that would chew my fucking head off for a moment wellesley seemed lost for an answer to that eventually he said would it surprise you to know that i was totally unaware of my own talent all ray life i mean until i applied for a job here i mean how does one know when one has a negative talent if it was common everyday practice for people to read other peoples minds then id be a freak the odd man out who couldnt do it and couldnt have it done to him but it isnt common practice and so i had no measure for it i only knew or thought that i had an interest in parapsychology the metaphysical which is why i mistakenly put in for a transfer here and then you people checked me out for suitability and discovered i kept my mind in a safe clarke looked puzzled what are you trying to say im not sure myself i suppose im trying to explain why as the head of ebranch i have so much difficulty believing in what were doing and when you confront me with the reality of someone like harry keogh well i mean parapsychology is one thing but this is supernatural clarke grinned one of his rare grins so youre human after all he said did you think you were alone in your confusion why theres not a man or woman ever worked here who hasnt known the same doubts if i had a pound for every time ive thought about it its ambiguities inconsistencies and headon contradictions hell id be rich what an outfit as weird as this is robots and romantics superscience and the supernatural telemetry and telepathy computerized probability patterns and precognition spysatellites and scryers of course youre confused who isnt but thats what its all about gadgets and ghosts wellesley was a little happier hed managed to get clarke on his side for once and with what he had in mind thats where he had to have him and teleportation he said was that one of keoghs talents too clarke nodded thats what wed call it he said but it wasnt like that to harry he simply used doors no one else knew were there hed step in a door here and come out somewhere else just about anywhere else when i wanted to recruit him in on the perchorsk business i went up to edinburgh to see him he said ok hed take a chance if i would that is if he was going up against the unknown he wanted me to taste a little of it too and he brought me back here through a thing he calls the mцbius continuum it was quite something but nothing id ever want to do again wellesley sighed again and said i think youre right if he got his talents back wed have to offer him my job youd like that right clarke shrugged dont be coy darcy wellesley nodded knowingly its plain as day youd rather have him or anyone as your boss than me but what you dont seem to realize is that im all for it i dont understand you or the people who work here and i dont suppose i ever will i want out but i know our minister responsible wont let me go until theres someone to replace me you no because that would make it look like they made a mistake replacing you in the first place but harry keogh harrys had the best help we can give him clarke said weve hypnotized him psychoanalysed him damn near brainwashed him but its gone so what can you do for him its more what we can do for him darcy goon last night i had a long talk with the markham girl up in edinburgh and if theres one part of this that i really hate clarke heatedly cut in its that weve done this to him and she advised me to speak to david bettley wellesley continued unperturbed because shes worried about keogh can you understand that she does have genuine feelings for him it may be just a job but she is worried about him or maybe you think hed be better off on his own well whichever she satisfies two needs one in keogh and one in us the need to know whats on his mind the tender art of the mindspy clarke snorted so i took her advice and spoke to bettley i got him out of bed to answer his telephone i would have contacted him anyway about some of his most recent reports and recordings because in them hes given me cause to believe that keogh is about to develop some strange new talent or hes on the point of cracking up anyway in the course of our conversation bettley mentioned how keogh first discovered this er mцbius thing the mцbius continuum correct hed apparently been on the verge of it but needed a spur which came when the east german grepo found him talking to mцbius in a leipzig graveyard that did it triggered his mathematical genius he teleported or used the continuum to escape from them thats why i have his file here i wanted to check that i had it right and its also why im doublechecking with you so the way i see it wellesley continued keoghs like a computer thats suffered a power failure the information he requires and which ebranch wants to use is no longer accessible to him oh its probably still in there but its jammed in limbo and so far we havent been able to shake it loose what do you propose well im still working on it but the way i see it if we apply just the right spur with a bit of luck it could be leipzig all over again you see keogh has been having some bad dreams lately and if what you say of him is true oh i dont doubt it but nevertheless if then any dream awful enough to frighten him must be really bad but perhaps not quite bad enough eh you want to scare him silly i want to scare him almost to death so close to death that he escapes into the mцbius continuum clarke sat still and silent for long moments until eventually wellesley leaned forward and quietly said well what do you think my honest opinion of course i think it stinks also i think that if you plan to fool with keogh youd better take out extra insurance and finally i think that it had better work because if it doesnt im up and gone when this is finished no matter how it works out i wont be able to work with you any longer wellesley smiled thinly but you do want me out of here right and so you wont hinder me no in fact i insist on being part of it that way i can be sure that if harry has any breaks coming hell get them wellesley continued to smile oh hell get his breaks all right he thought broken all the way through in fact and he was one of only a handful of men in the entire world who could think such things especially here in ebranch hq and be certain that no one could hear him doing it sandra sandra markham was twentyseven possessed a beautiful face and figure and was a neophyte telepath as yet her talent was a fiftyfifty thing she had very little control over it it came and went but where harry keogh was concerned that might be just as well sometimes in harrys mind shed read things she was sure had no right to be there or in any sane mind for that matter she and harry had made love only an hour ago and afterwards he had at once fallen asleep sandra had come to know harrys habits well enough hed stay asleep for three or four hours which for him would serve as a full nights rest as for sandra she would have to sleep tomorrow at her own place in edinburgh making up the nights deficiency staring right into harrys pale relaxed almost littleboyish face she saw no sign as yet of the rapid eye movements which would tell her that he was dreaming so for now she too could relax it was harrys dreams which most interested her that was what she tried to keep telling herself anyway she worked for ebranch sometimes she wished she didnt but she did that was how she earned her daily bread so she really shouldnt complain and in fact there hadnt been too much to complain about until harry came along at first hed been just another job a new friend to get close to learn about and try to understand but then shed got in deeper it had just happened and afterwards shed wanted it to happen again and again until in a little while he wasnt just a job but more a way of life not only on her mind as it were but under her skin as well and finally shed started to suppose and still did that she was in love with him certainly working on harrys case had been more interesting than being a human divining rod on cases the police couldnt solve that was how ebranch used her usually to eavesdrop criminal minds the minds of prisoners in their cells too tough for the law to crack looking for those damning clues which more orthodox methods couldnt turn up which would be satisfying enough work in itself if only she didnt actually have to go in there because minds like those were often cesspools which frequently left her knowing how sewers smell and sometimes especially if it was a brutal murder or rape the smell could linger for a long long time which was probably the reason shed fallen in love with harry keogh because his mind was a field of daisies most of the time in fact he had the gentlest mind shed ever come across not soft no way not even naive though there was something of that in him too but just just gentle harry wouldnt much like hurting anything or anybody with sandras looks it would be strange if there had been no men there had been men a few but her talent wasnt something she could just switch on and off indeed that was its one big drawback without so much as a by your leave it came and went tonight a man would wine and dine you take you home and kiss your hand on your doorstep and ask to see you again and as you were about to say yes his mind would open like a book and you would see him in there like some great rutting satyr and youd be in there with him not all men no but enough but that wasnt all there was also the deceit the fact that people lie like the neighbour in the flat next door who smiles and says good morning to you on the stairs when shes actually thinking piss off and die you ugly bitch or the hairdresser who makes small talk while he does your hair and you suddenly hear him thinking god they pay me nine pounds an hour for this she must have more money than sense the stupid cow oh there had been men all right the goodlooking ones who only worried how they looked and the notsogood lookers whose minds seethed with jealousy if anyone else even smiled at you and then having got safely through an entire week of evenings with a perfect companion to have him make love to you and lie there beside you in your bed wondering if hell have time for another and still catch the last bus home it was life and sandra knew it and shed learned to live with it ever since her middle teens when the thing had first started to develop in her but it hadnt left much room for love not until harry anyway he was such an anomaly shed read his file as well as his mind he had killed men a great many thats what it said in his file but it didnt say he remembered and regretted almost every one of them or how every now and then hed get the urge to go back and tell them he was sorry but really hed had no choice it didnt say he still had nightmares about some of the things hed seen and done and anyway sandra really couldnt believe half of the things credited to him her own talent was paranormal yes but what harry could do what hed used to do was supernatural and hed used his powers the best way he knew how he had killed many men with them but hed never murdered a one sandra knew how murderers thought and they didnt think like harry keogh their thoughts were deep and dark as red wine but tumbled as a rough sea and full of shoals and eddies while his were clear spring water over rounded pebbles oh his mind could be sharp too there were plenty of daggers in there if you gave him cause to whet them but they were clearly visible at all times not hidden away neither afraid of themselves nor of detection no there were no dark corners or mean streets in harrys mind or if there were he wasnt the one to dwell on or in them and in that same moment lying there beside him sandra knew how shed defined him he was could only be one of two things either completely amoral or naturally innocent and since she knew there was no lack of morality that made him an innocent a bloody innocent but nevertheless blameless a child with blood on his hands and on his conscience and in his nightmares which he had chosen to keep to himself except when they were unbearable when he went to bettley well she wasnt sure what that made bettley a judaspriest a father confessor who told but she couldnt be happy with what it made her and the most terrible thing of all she believed he halfsuspected which would explain why he was never completely at his ease with her and why he couldnt seem to enjoy her the way she wanted him to the way she enjoyed him christ to have found a man like harry only to discover that of all men he was the one she probably couldnt have not the way she wanted him anyway suddenly angry with herself wanting to throw off all the covers and leap out of bed but caring enough that she wouldnt disturb him she carefully removed his hand from where it lay draped diagonally across her and slid sideways out from between the sheets and naked she went to the bathroom she was neither warm nor cold nor thirsty but she felt she had to do something something ordinary to herself to change herself physically and that way perhaps to change her mood too in the daytime it would be the simplest thing she would walk to the park and watch the smallest children at play and know that something of their worlds of faerie would soon find its way into her own far less elysian existence and when that thought came she knew for certain that for someone who was usually so positive she must now be feeling pretty damned negative that she should need someone elses innocence to balance the weight of her own guilt she drank a glass of water splashed cold water up under her arms and breasts where their lovemaking had made her perspire towelled her flesh dry and examined herself critically in the long bathroom mirror unlike harry there was little or no naivetй in sandra there might be except for her telepathy but its hard to be naive or innocent in a world where peoples minds are wont to flutter open like pages in a book and you dont have the power to look away but must read whats written there the other ebranch telepaths people like trevor jordan were luckier in this respect they were obliged to apply channel their talent it didnt just come and go for them like a badlytuned radio station angry again sandra shook her head there she went again great waves of selfpity what pity for herself for this beautiful creature in the mirror and how often had she heard it broadcast from so many of those stations out there god but what id give to be like her ah if only they knew but how much worse if shed been ugly she had large greenyblue penetrating eyes over a small tilted nose a mouth shed trained to be soft and uncynical small ears almost lost in the burnish of copper hair and high cheekbones curving down delicately to a rounded rather selfconscious chin of course she was conscious of herself other people were and so she had to be her right eyebrow a slightly upwardtilted line of bronze was questioning almost challenging as if she were saying go on think it and sometimes she was her smile was bright rewarding involuntary on those occasions when she detected complimentary thoughts or she might darken her high brow and narrow her eyes to knifepoint at some of the other things she heard at a glance then sandras face might well be mistaken for the face on the cover of any number of glossy popular ladies magazines but on closer inspection it would be seen that there were boundless tracts of character there too her twentyseven years had not left her unblemished there were laughter lines in the corners of her eyes yes but other faint lines lay parallel and horizontal on her brow speaking volumes for the number of times shed frowned she was grateful that the latter didnt detract from her looks overall as for the rest of her but for two personal criticisms sandras body would be nearperfect or as close as she would wish it to be she was too large up top which gave her a bouncing elasticity she was afraid might typecast her and her legs were far too long well you might find those things a disadvantage harrys voice came back to her from a previous time but im all for it he liked it when in their lovemaking shed wrap her legs right round him or when she let her breasts dangle in his face inviting his attentions her large nipples asymmetrical as most nipples are seemed a constant fascination to him at least on those occasions when he was all there but far too often hed be somewhere else entirely and now another truth dawned on her too often shed used her sex to trap him in the here and now as if she were afraid that if she released him hed fly somewhere else suddenly cold she put out the bathroom light and went back to the bedroom harry lay just as shed left him on his side facing left his right arm draped in the hollow shed occupied and still his breathing was deep and steady his eyelids unmoving a brief telepathic glimpse unbidden denned endless empty vaults of dream through which he drifted looking for a door it came and went and sandra sighed there were always doors in harrys dreams revenant perhaps of the mцbius doors hed once called up mathematically out of thin air hed once told her now that its over i sometimes get this feeling it was all a dream or a story read in a book of fantasy unreal something i made up or maybe an outofbody experience but that brings back all too clearly what it was really like to be incorporeal and i know that it happened for a fact how can i explain it have you ever dreamed you could fly that you actually knew how to fly yes shed answered in her mildly edinburghian scottish accent often and very vividly i used to run down a steeply sloping field to take off and soar up over the pentland hills over the village where i was born it was sometimes frightening but i remember knowing exactly how it was done harry had been excited thats right and waking up you tried to hang on to it you were reluctant to let the secret vanish with the dream and it vexed you when you were completely awake to learn that you were earthbound again well thats pretty much how it sometimes is for me like something i had in a long series of childhood dreams but burned out of me now and gone forever better for you harry shed thought that world was a dangerous place youre safe now but not much good for ebranch and definitely not why she was here on the contrary they wanted his powers restored and didnt much care how and she was supposed to be part of the restoration team she slipped into bed with him as much for his warmth as for anything and his free hand automatically cupped her breast his body was lean and hard welltrained he insisted on keeping it that way its years older than me hed once told her without an ounce of humour and so i have to look after it as if it wasnt his but something he was caretaking hard to believe thered been a time when it really wasnt his but she hadnt known him or it then and was glad for that ummm he murmured now as she moulded herself to him nothing she whispered in the darkness of the room shh ummm he said again and instinctively drew her closer he was warm and he was harry shed never felt so safe with anyone before him with all his hangups and yet when she was with him like this it was like clinging to a rock she stroked his chest but gently so as not to awaken or arouse him and tried to will him into deeper sleep and like a fool willed herself there instead haaarry harrys ma mary keogh called to him from her watery grave and couldnt get through to him she never could these days and knew why but it didnt stop her from trying harry theres someone whos trying very hard to talk to you he says you were friends and that what he has to say is very important harry could hear her but he couldnt answer he knew that he must not answer for talking to the dead had been forbidden to him if he should try it or ever consider trying it then once more hed hear that irresistible voice in his mind reinforcing those commands by means of which his necroscope powers had been made worthless under penalty of pain you may not harry aye great pain such torture that the voices of the teeming dead would be distorted beyond recognition such mental agony that you would never dare try again ive no desire to be cruel father but its for your own protection as well as mine faethor ferenczy thibor and yulian bodescu they might well have been the last or they might not the wamphyri have powers father and if there are more of them hidden in your world how long before they seek you out and find you before you can find them but they will only seek you out if they have reason to fear you which is why i now remove such reason utterly do you understand to which harry had answered you do it for yourself not because you fear for me but for you you fear that ill come back one day discover you in your aerie and destroy you ive told you i could never do that obviously my word isnt good enough people change harry you could change too im your son but im also a vampire i cant chance it that youll not come looking for me one day with sword and stake and fire ive said it before as a necroscope youre dangerous but without the dead youre impotent without them no more mцbius continuum you cant come back here nor seek me in the other places and yes this is another reason why i place these strictures upon you then you doom me to torture its inescapable the dead love me they will talk to me they may try but you will neither hear nor answer them not consciously i hereby deny you that talent but im a necroscope i talk to the dead out of habit and what about when i grow old if i ramble to the dead when im an old man what then am i still bound to suffer all my days habits are for breaking harry i say it one last time and then if you doubt me you may try it for yourself you may not consciously speak to the dead and if they speak to you you must strike their words immediately from memory or suffer the consequences so be it and all the maths mцbius taught me am i to forget that too you have already forgotten it that is my most immediate stricture for i wont be invaded in my own territory now be done with arguing for its over it is done at which harry had felt a terrible wrenching in his mind which made him cry out followed by darkness followed by his return to consciousness in london at ebranch hq that had been four years ago he had told ebranch all he could helped them complete and close their files on him and all his works he was no longer a necroscope he could no longer impose his metaphysical will on the physical universe the branch should have no further use for him now but even after theyd tried and discarded every means at their disposal to return his paranormal powers to him still hed been certain they wouldnt let it rest there as a necroscope hed been too great an asset theyd never forget him and if they could get him back they would and so would his millions of friends the teeming dead oh harrys actual friends his real comrades among the great majority numbered around one hundred only but the rest knew of him to them he would always be the one light in their eternal darkness and now one of them by far the most important one to harry was trying to speak to him again harry oh my poor little harry why wont you answer me son he had always been her little harry because i cant he wanted to tell her but dare not not even asleep and dreaming for hed tried once before down at the riverbank and now remembered it only too well hed gone there within the hour of his return to his home near bonnyrig the house which she had owned before him and viktor shukshin in between shukshin had drowned her under the ice and left her body to float to this bight in the frozen river there shed settled to the bottom to become one with the mud the weeds and the silt and there shed stayed until the night harry called her up again to take her revenge since when shed lain here in peace or been gradually washed away in pieces but her spirit was here still and it had been here when like so many times before hed gone to sit on the riverbank and look down at the water where it was untroubled and deep and dark in that slowly swirling backwater of reeds and crumbling clay bank it had been daylight brambles and weeds growing across the old disused paths by the river birdsong in the shady willows and spiky blackthorns there were three other houses there beside his own two of them detached and standing well apart in large walled gardens extending almost to the river these two were empty and rapidly falling into disrepair the third next door had been up for sale for several years now every so often people would come to look at it and go away shaking their heads these were not desirable residences no it was a lonely place which was why harry liked it he and his ma had used to talk in private here and hed never had to fear that someone might see him sitting here on his own apparently mouthing nonsense to himself he hadnt known what to expect that time he only knew that conversation was forbidden and that thered be a penalty to pay if he tried to break the strictures placed on his espers mind the acid test was the one thing ebranch hadnt attempted mainly because hed refused to go so far darcy clarke had been in charge then and darcys talent had warned him away from pushing harry and harrys friends too far but there on the river harrys mother the spirit of the innocent girl she had been had not been able to resist talking to her son again at first there had been only the solitude the slow gurgle of the river the birdsong but in a little while harrys singular presence had been noted and harry she had come breathlessly awake in his mind harry is that you son oh i know it is youve come home again harry that was all shed said to him but it had been enough ma dont hed cried out staggering to his feet and running as someone ignited a roman candle in his skull to shoot off its fireballs into the soft tissues of his brain and only then had he known what the dweller harry jnr had really done to him such mental agony that you will never dare try again that was what his vampire son had promised and it was what hed delivered not the dweller himself but the posthypnotic commands hed left behind sealed in harrys mind and nightfall had found harry in the long grasses by the rivers edge painfully regaining consciousness in a world where he now knew beyond any doubt that he was a necroscope no more he could no longer communicate with the dead or at least not consciously but asleep and dreaming haaarry his mothers voice called to him again echoing through the endlessly labyrinthine vaults of his otherwise empty dream im here harry here and before he knew it hed turned off and passed through a door and stood once again on the riverbank this time in streaming moonlight and is that you harry her hushed mental voice told him that she scarcely dared to believe it have you really come to me i cant answer you ma he wanted to say but could only remain silent but you have answered me harry was her reply and he knew it was so for the dead dont require the spoken word sufficient to think at them if you have the talent harry crumpled to the riverbank adopted a foetal position hugged his head with his arms and hands and waited for the pain which didnt come oh harry harry she said at once did you think that after that first time id deliberately hurt you or cause you to hurt yourself ma i dont understand yes you do son she tuttutted of course you do its just that youve forgotten you forget every time harry forgotten forgotten what ma what do i forget every time you forget that youve been here before in dreams and that what my grandson did to you doesnt count here thats what youve forgotten and you do it every time now call me up harry so that i can talk to you properly and walk with you a little way was that right that he could talk to her in dreams he had used to in the old days waking and dreaming alike but it wasnt like that now but it is like it now son its just that you need reminding each time and then another voice not his mothers echoing more in the caverns of his memory than his sleeping mind proper you may not consciously speak to the dead and if they speak to you then you must strike their words immediately from memory or suffer the consequences my sons voice he sighed as understanding came at last so how many times have we talked ma i mean since it started to hurt me in the last four years say and even as she began to answer him he called her up so that she rose from the water reached out and took his hand and was drawn up onto the bank a young woman again as shed been on the day she died a dozen twenty fifty times its hard to say harry for always its more difficult to get through to you and oh how weve missed you harry we he took her hand and they walked along the dark river path together under a full moon riding high through a cloudwispy sky me and all your friends the teeming dead a hundred there are all eager to hear your gentle voice again son a million more who would ask what you said and all the rest to inquire how youre doing and whats become of you and as for me why im like an oracle for they know that im the one you speak to most of all or used to you make me feel like ive forsaken some olden trust he told her but there never was one and anyway it isnt so i cant help it that i can no longer talk to you or that i cant remember the times when i do and how has it become difficult to get through to me you called me and i came was that so difficult but you dont always come harry sometimes i can feel you there and i call out to you and you shy away and each time the waiting grows longer between visits as if you no longer cared or had forgotten us or as if perhaps wed become a habit which you now desire to break none of that is true harry burst out but he knew that it was not a habit which he would break no but one which was being broken for him by his fear by his terror of the mental torture which talking to the dead would bring down on him or if it is true he said more quietly now then its not my fault my mind would be no good to you burned out ma and thats what will happen if i push my luck well then something must be done about it about your situation i mean for theres trouble brewing son and the dead lie uneasy in their graves do you remember i told you harry there was someone who wanted to talk to you and how what he had to say was important yes i remember who is he ma and what is it thats so important he wouldnt say and his voice came from far far away but its strange when the dead feel pain harry for death usually puts them beyond it harry felt his blood run cold he remembered only too well how the dead in certain circumstances felt pain sir keenan gormley murdered by soviet mindspies had been examined by boris dragosani a necromancer and dead as he had been he had felt the pain is it like that he asked his mother now holding his breath until she answered dont know how it is she turned to him and looked him straight in the eye for this is something ive never known before but harry i fear for you and before he could even attempt to reassure her oh son son my poor little harry i fear so very very much for you is it like that you ask and i say will it be can it ever be like that again and how if youre no longer a necroscope and then i pray that it cant be so you see son how im torn two ways i miss you and all the dead miss you but if it puts you in danger then we can do without it he sensed that she was avoiding something ma are you sure you dont know who he is this one who tried to contact me are you sure you dont know where he is right now she let go his hand turned away avoided his eyes who he is no she said but his voice his mental voice harry crying out like that oh yes i know where he is and all the dead know it too hes in hell frowning he took her shoulders gently turned her until she faced him again and said in hell she looked at him opened her mouth and nothing but a gurgle came out she coughed chokingly spat blood then straightened up swelled out wrenched herself free of his suddenly feeble grasp he saw something in her mouth forked and flickering which wasnt a human tongue her skin sagged and grew old becoming wormy as centuried parchment in a moment flesh sloughed from her bones revealed her skull smoked into dust as it fell from her like a rotting shroud she cried out her horror turned and fled away from him along the riverbank paused a moment over the bight and looked back a rancid disintegrating skeleton she laughed at him even as she toppled into the water and he saw that her eyes glowed crimson in the moonlight and that the teeth in her skull were sharp curving fangs nailed to the spot fearfrozen there harry could only cry out after her maaaa but it wasnt his mother who heard and answered him haaarry the voice came from a long way away but still harry whirled on the riverbank staring this way and that in the moonsilvered night there was no one there haaarry it came again but clearer in his mind haaarry keeeooogh and it was just as his mother had described it a voice full of hells own torment still stunned by his mothers metamorphosis which he knew could only be some sort of dire warning for it was nothing she would ever deliberately engineer harry was at first unable to answer but he recognized the voices despair its anguish its hopelessness as it continued to call to him harry for gods sake if youre out there please answer me i know you shouldnt i know you darent but you must its happening again harry its happening again the voice was fading its signal weakening its telepathic potency waning if harry was ever to get to the bottom of this he must do so now who are you he said what do you want of me haaarry harry keogh help us its owner hadnt heard him the voice was tailing away beginning to merge with a wind sprung up along the riverbank how he shouted back how can i help you i dont even know who you are but he suspected that he did it was a rare thing for the dead to speak to him without rapport first being established by some form of introduction usually he had sought them out following which they would normally be able to find him again which made him suspect that hed known this one before probably in life haaarry for gods sake find us and make an end of it how can i find you harry shouted into the night wanting to cry from the sheer frustration of it and whats the point of it i wont even remember not when im awake and then the merest whisper fading into nothing and yet powerful enough to call up a wind that howled along the riverbank and snatched at harry causing him to lean into it there came that final exhortation which chilled the exnecroscopes blood to icewater sent gooseflesh creeping on his spine and wrenched him back into the waking world find us and put us down the unknown voice implored put an end to these scarlet threads right now before they can grow you know the way harry sharp steel the wooden stake the cleansing fire do it harry please do it harry sprang awake sandra was clinging to him trying to hold him down he was drenched in cold sweat shaking like a leaf and she was frightened too her eyes wide from it her mouth forming a frozen o harry harry she lay sprawled half across him she let go his shoulders hugged his neck felt his heart pounding against her breast its all right its all right it was a bad dream a nightmare thats all eyes wide and darting shivering and panting for breath he stared all around the room and let its familiarity wash over him sandra had put on the light the moment his shouting had brought her awake what he said his hands trembling where they clutched her what its all right she insisted a dream thats all a dream her words sank in and something of the gaunt vacancy went out of his eyes he gently pushed her away began to sit up then drew air in a gasp and started bolt upright no he blurted it was more than just a dream much more and christ i have to remember but too late already it was receding draining back to the roots of his subconsciousness it was about about he desperately shook his head and sent a spray of sweat flying my mother no not about her but she was in it it was a warning yes a warning and something else but that was all it was gone driven out against his will by the will of some other the will or legacy of his son by the posthypnotic commands hed planted there in harrys mind shit harry whispered damp and shivering where he sat on the edge of the bed that had been at am harry had had maybe three and a half hours sleep sandra an hour less when hed finally calmed down and put on his dressinggown then she had made a pot of coffee and as he sat there shivering and sipping at his drink so she had tried to bring his dream back to mind had urged him to remember it all the while cursing herself inside that shed slept right through it for if she had stayed awake she might just have caught a glimpse of the terrible thing hed experienced whatever it had been that was her job help him sort out his mind and get back what hed lost whether he wanted it or not and whether or not it was good for him but no use hed shaken his head after long minutes of patient questioning its gone and probably best that its gone i have to be careful sandra had been tired she hadnt asked why he must be careful because she knew but she should have asked because she wasnt supposed to know and when shed looked at him again his soulful eyes had been steady on her his tousled head tilted a little on one side perhaps questioningly whats your interest anyway hed wanted to know only that if you get it off your chest youll feel better about it at least her lie had the ring of logic to it once a nightmare is told its not so frightening oh and thats your understanding of nightmares is it i was trying to be helpful but i keep telling you i cant remember and you keep prodding away at me it was just a dream and no one tries that hard to winkle someone elses dreams out of them not without a damn good reason anyway theres something not right here sandra and i think ive known it for some time old bettley says its my fault that what we have isnt exactly right for me but now im not so sure there was no answer to that and so shed kept quiet acted hurt drawn apart from him but in fact shed known that he was the one who was hurt and that was the last thing she wanted and when he finally got back into bed and she joined him there then it had become obvious how cold he was how stiff and silent and thoughtful where he lay with his back to her a little over an hour later she was awake again a call of nature harry slept on heavy in the bed dead to the world that thought made her shiver a little as she rejoined him but of course he wasnt dead just exhausted mentally if not physically his limbs were leaden his eyes still his breathing deep slow and regular no more dreams dawn was maybe threequarters of an hour away lying beside him still sandra felt distanced from him their relationship she felt was like fancy knitting which was something shed never been any good at one slip of the needle and the whole thing comes undone and that was a shame their lovemaking last night had been very very good for both of them she knew to reinforce delicious liquid memories of him inside her she reached across him and down taking him in her hand and a moment later she was rewarded when he stiffened and pulsed in the tube of her fingers an animal reaction she knew but she was grateful for it anyway her loyalties were rapidly breaking down splitting apart and she knew that too ebranch paid the bills but there had to be more to life than fat pay cheques harry was what she wanted he wasnt just a job any more hadnt been for a long time and the time was ever drawing closer when she must make the break say to hell with the branch and tell him the whole thing damn it hed probably guessed it by now anyway drifting her thoughts began to run in pointless circles before falling asleep again she was aware of noises in the garden where the property fronted the river slow noises shuffling sluggish a badger she wasnt sure if there were any badgers up here hedgehogs then not burglars anyway not in a district as rundown as this no money here badgers hedgehogs a grating of stones on the gravel of the garden paths something doggedly busy in the garden sandra slept in a fashion but the noises were still on her mind conscious of them she hovered on the verge of true sleep and wouldnt let herself be drawn down but as dawn began to filter its first feeble rays of pale light through the blinds of harrys room the garden sounds gradually faded away she heard the familiar creak of the old archedover gate at the bottom of the garden and what might have been a slow series of shuffling footsteps and then no more shortly after that the birds were singing and harry came up the stairs in his dressinggown with a steaming pot of coffee and biscuits on a tray breakfast he said simply and we had a rough night did we she sat up up and down a bit he shrugged he was still pale but less wearylooking now and she thought she detected a new look in his eyes wariness reluctant realization resolution hard to tell with harry but resolution what had he resolved to do to say she must get to him before he got to her i love you she said putting down her cup on a small bedside table forget anything else and just remember that i cant help it and dont want to but i just love you i i dont know he said but looking at her sitting up in his bed like that still pink from sleep and with her nipples achingly stiff it was hard not to want her she knew the look in his eyes reached out and tugged at the cord of his dressinggown and he was hard under there and moving with a life of his own then they were clinging and she curled herself onto him and her breasts were warm soft and pliant against him and he touched her in those places where he knew she liked him to and stroked her at the wet mobile junction of their flesh it was the best it had ever been and their coffee went cold later downstairs with a fresh pot beginning to bubble he said and now i could face a decent breakfast eggs and bacon out on the patio she thought that maybe the worst was over shed be able to break it to him now without fearing it would destroy everything will it be warm enough out there middle of may harry shrugged maybe its not so hot at that but the suns up and the sky is clear so lets call it invigorating rather than chilly all right she turned towards the fridge but he caught her arm ill do it if you like he said i think id enjoy making breakfast for you fine she smiled and went through the old house to the front it was the back really but facing the river like that she always thought of it as the front opening large patio windows where they overlooked the highwalled garden the first thing she noticed was the gate under its stone archway hanging ajar on rusting scroll hinges and she remembered hearing it creaking just as dawn was breaking a puff of wind maybe though she couldnt remember the night as being especially breezy she walked down across the crazypaving patio with its weathered garden furniture the garden was a suntrap seeming to gather all of the earlymorning may sunlight right into itself already the wall of the house was warm basking in the glow it wouldnt at all be a bad place to live she thought if harry would only get it fixed up he had in fact done a little work on the house and grounds in the last four or five years hed had the central heating put in for one thing and had at least made an effort to sort out the garden she crossed the patio to the lawn and made her way down the gravel path which divided it centrally the grass was longer than it should be but still manageable barely at the bottom of the lawned area the garden had been terraced on one side with a shallow drystone wall holding back the soil this was the alleged vegetable garden though the only vegetation here now consisted of large areas of stinging nettles brambles run wild and a huge patch of rhubarb she saw that several of the stones were missing from the top tier of the wall and at once remembered the grating sounds shed heard when she lay halfasleep if a section of the wall had simply fallen perhaps pushed over by an expansion of dew or rainsodden soil then its debris would be lying here at the foot of the wall but there was nothing just a missing top tier and for her life she couldnt see someone sneaking in here just to steal stones perhaps harry would know something about it she carried on down to the gate and looked out across the reedy bank to the river whose surface was inches deep in undulating mist it was a calm scene but very eerie the mist lying there like cream on milk turning the river to a twining white ribbon for as far as the eye could see shed never seen anything quite like it before but maybe it augured well for a warm day then closing the gate and wedging it with a halfbrick she paused and sniffed at the morning air just for a moment then she had thought to smell something gone off yes gone entirely off in fact but just as quickly the smell had disappeared so maybe that was what last nights snuffling and shuffling had been about local nocturnal creatures sniffing at the body of some poor dead thing or other where it lay in the reeds there at the rivers rim which might also explain the maggots squirming in a tangle on the overgrown path just outside the gate maggots ugh loathsome things and there were robins on the high garden wall too watching her and the maggots both speculatively she thought if she went away the redbreasts would likely make short work of the horrid things bon appetit she wasnt a bit envious and then frowning turning back from the gate and looking up the path towards the house at last she saw where the stones from the wall had gone obviously it had been harrys doing after all hed been laying them out as stepping stones on the gentle slope of the lawned area and on some whim or other hed caused them to form letters before she could connect the letters up to see if they had any meaning harry appeared at the patio windows with a steaming jug of coffee cups milk and sugar on a tray breakfast in five minutes he called down to her by the time youve poured ill be back with the eats and so she forgot the business with the stones and went back up the path to where hed left the coffee on the garden table but halfway through breakfast she remembered and asked whats this thing with the stones hmm harry raised an eyebrow stones in the garden on the lawn yes he agreed nodding there are stones surrounding the lawn what about it no she insisted on the lawn stones forming letters she smiled and teased what is this harry are you sending secret messages to the jumbo pilots flying into edinburgh airport or something on the lawn he paused with a forkful of food halfway to his mouth messages to the he put his fork down and frowning now asked where on the lawn why just there she pointed go and see for yourself he did and she could see from the expression on his face that he knew nothing about it she got up and joined him there and together they stared at the peculiar stony legend it was simple enough looked unfinished made no sense whatsoever kenl tjor rh and messages harry said again thoughtfully almost to himself for a moment longer he stared then nervously licked his lips and glanced quickly all around the garden peering intently here and there sandra wondered what he was looking for he was suddenly quiet very pale again obviously seriously concerned about something harry she said is there something he sensed more than heard her worried tone of voice eh he looked at her no nothing some kids must have been in so they moved a few stones around so what he laughed but there was no life in it harry she began again i anyway you were right he abruptly cut her short its too damned cold out here lets get inside but as they gathered up the breakfast things she saw him sniff at the air saw fresh lines of concern of realization even of understanding gather on his brow something dead she said and he actually started what in the reeds down by the river some dead thing there are maggots on the path the birds are eating them her words were innocent enough in themselves but now harry looked positively haggard eating them he repeated her and now he couldnt wait to be out of the garden and into the house she took the breakfast things from him and carried them through to the kitchen then returned to his study he was pacing the floor pausing every now and then to look out of the patio windows and into the garden but as she entered he came to some decision or other and tried to adopt a less hagridden look so whats your schedule for today he inquired will you be drawing what have you got on the board right now eh just a few words but they told her a lot sandra was a fashion designer ostensibly in fact she did design fashionable womens clothes and had enjoyed several small successes but mainly it was a front for her work within ebranch last night she had told harry that she wasnt doing anything today she had thought they might spend it together but now for reasons of his own he obviously wanted her out of here you want me to go she couldnt keep the disappointment out of her voice sandra he gave up his weak attempt at subterfuge sighed and looked away i need to be alone to do some thinking can you understand that and ill be in the way yes i can understand that but her tone said she couldnt and before he could answer harry this thing about the stones in the garden i look he grated i dont know about the stones for all i know theyre only a small part of of oh whatever part of what harry surely he must hear how concerned she was but it seemed he didnt i dont know his voice was still harsh he shook his head then shot her an inquiring almost vindictive glance maybe i should ask you eh i mean maybe its possible you know more about whats going on here than i do right she made no answer but began to collect up her things when this whatever it was had blown over then thered be time enough to try to explain about her connections with ebranch and it would be a good time too to quit the branch entirely and make a clean start with harry if hed have her he threw some clothes on and was waiting for her in the car when she was ready they drove along the service road from the old houses crossed the stone bridge and joined the major road into bonnyrig from the village she could get a bus into edinburgh shed done it before and it was no great chore she hadnt meant to speak to him again right now but getting out of the car she found herself saying will i see you tonight should i come up here no he shook his head and as she turned away sandra she looked back into his pale troubled face but he could only shrug helplessly and say i dont know i mean i really dont will you call me yes he nodded and even managed a smile and sandra its ok i mean i know youre ok that took a big lead weight off her heart something only harry keogh could do as easily as that yes she leaned down and kissed him through the open car window were ok harry i know were ok in edinburgh darcy clarke and norman wellesley were waiting in the road outside the sweeping terraced facade of georgian houses where sandra had her flat they were in the back of wellesleys car parked up with two other branch men but as she came into view round a corner they got out of the car and met her at the door of the house she had the groundfloor flat without speaking she ushered them inside nice to see you again miss markham wellesley nodded taking a seat clarke was less formal how are things sandra he forced a smile she caught a brief glimpse of his mind and it was all worry and uncertainty but nothing specific harry was in it somewhere though be sure of course he was why else would these two be here she said coffee and without waiting for their answer went into her kitchen alcove let them do the talking we have time for a coffee yes said wellesley in that ohverywell isupposeishallhavetoaccept way of his as if it were his damned right but actually were pretty busy and wont prolong our visit too much so if we can get right to it did you have plans to see keogh tonight just like that and keogh not harry will you be in his bed or he in yours wellesley was asking humping again tonight are you there was something about this man that got sandras back up and the fact that his mind was a complete blank not even radiating the faintest glow was only a small part of it she glanced back at him from the alcove with eyes that were cold where they met his he said he might call me she answered unemotionally its just that wed prefer it if you dont see him tonight sandra clarke hurriedly put in before wellesley could use that blunt instrument he called a tongue again i mean we plan on seeing him ourselves and wed like to avoid you know any embarrassing confrontations she didnt know really but she brought them their coffee anyway and gave darcy a smile shed always liked him she didnt like to see him uncomfortable in the presence of his boss their boss though not for much longer not if things worked out as she hoped they would i see she said so whats happening no need for you to concern yourself wellesley was quick off the mark just routine stuff and im afraid confidential and suddenly she was afraid too for harry more complications something to interfere with her own plans which she hoped would be the best for him it was on the tip of her tongue to tell them about the new developments what she knew of them but she held it back there was that in their attitude wellesleys anyway which warned that now wasnt a good time and anyway it would all go in her endofmonth report along with her resignation they all three finished their coffees in silence and finally thats it then said wellesley standing up we wont be seeing you his idea of a smart remark he nodded offered her a twitchy halfsmile and headed for the door she saw them out and wellesleys parting shot was so if he does er call you do put him off wont you she might have answered him in kind right there and then but clarke gave her arm a reassuring squeeze just above the elbow as if saying its ok ill be there but why should darcy be acting so concerned shed rarely seen him looking so on edge deadspeak after dropping sandra off in bonnyrig and during the short drive home harry stopped at a newsagents and bought himself a pack of twenty cigarettes he looked at his change but didnt try to check it it wouldnt make any sense to him anyway they could rip him off every time and he just wouldnt know it that was the other thing harry jnr had done to him he was now innumerate no way he could use the mцbius continuum if he couldnt even calculate the change from a pack of cigarettes sandra saw to it that his bills were paid or hed probably get that wrong too what price his instinctive mathematics now eh the mцbius equations what the hell were they what had they looked like and again harry wondered was it a dream was that all it had been a fantasy a figment of his own imagination oh he remembered how it had been all right but as hed tried to explain to sandra it was the way you remember a dream or a book you read in childhood fast fading now had he really really done all of those things and if he had did he really really want to be able to do them again to talk to the teeming dead and step through doors no one else guessed existed to travel swift as thought in the metaphysical mцbius continuum want it perhaps not but what was there without it what was he without it answer harry keogh nowhere man back home he went into the garden and looked at the stones again kenl tjor rh they meant nothing to him but still he fixed their meaningless legend in his mind then he brought the wheelbarrow loaded it up and wheeled the stones back to the wall where he paused a moment and stood frowning before wheeling them back up to the lawn again and there he left them in the wheelbarrow for if just if someone was trying to tell him something well why make things harder for them indoors again harry climbed stairs and then ladders to the attic room which no one else suspected was there that large dusty room with its sloping rear window naked lightbulb hanging from a roof timber and its rows and rows of bookshelves which was now a shrine to his obsession if the word shrine were at all applicable and of course the books themselves all the facts and the fictions were here all the myths and legends all the conclusive condemnations and indisputable evidences for or against proving disproving or standing in the middle ground of harrys studies the history the lore the very nature of the vampire which was in itself a grim joke for how could anyone ever fully understand the nature of the vampire and yet if any man could then it was harry keogh but he hadnt come here today to look again at his books or delve a little deeper into the miasma of times lands and legends long past no for he believed that time itself was well past for those things for study and vain attempts at understanding his dreams of red threads among the blue were immediate things now things and if hed learned nothing else in his weird life it was to trust in his dreams the wamphyri have powers father an echo a whisper the scurry of mice or a memory how long before they seek you out and find you no he wasnt here to look at his books this time the time to study an enemys tactics is before the onslaught too late if hes already come aknocking at your door well he hadnt not yet but harry had dreamed things and he trusted his dreams he took down a piece of modern weaponry from the wall and carried it to a table where he laid it down on newspapers preparatory to cleaning oiling and generally servicing the thing there was this and in the corner there a sickle whose semicircular blade gleamed like a razor and that was all strange weapons these against a force for blight and plague and devastation potentially greater than any of mans thermonuclear toys but right now they were the only weapons harry had better tend to them the afternoon passed without incident why shouldnt it years had passed without incident within the parameters of the harry keogh mentality and identity he spent most of the time considering his position and ways in which he might improve that position and recover his talents before they atrophied utterly it was possible barely harry supposed considering his innumeracy that if he could speak to mцbius then mцbius might be able to stabilize whatever mathematical gyro was now out of kilter in his head except first he must be able to speak to him which was likewise out of the question for of course mцbius had been dead for well over a hundred years and harry was forbidden to speak to the dead on penalty of mental agony he could not speak to the dead but the dead might even now be looking at ways in which they could communicate with him he suspected no he more than suspected was sure that he spoke to them in his dreams even though he was forbidden to remember or act upon what they had told him but still he was aware that warnings had been passed even if he didnt know what those warnings were about one thing was certain however he knew that within himself and within every man woman and child on the surface of the globe a blue thread unwound from the past and was even now spinning into the future of humanity and that he had dreamed or been warned of red threads amidst the blue and apart from that this inescapable mood or sensation of something impending something terrible the rest of it was a chinese puzzle with no solution a maze with no exit the square root of minus one whose value may only be expressed in the abstract harry knew the latter for a fact even if he no longer knew what it meant and it was a puzzle hed examined almost to distraction a maze hed explored to exhaustion and an equation he hadnt even attempted because like all mathematical concepts it simply wouldnt read in the evening he sat and watched television mainly for relaxation hed considered calling sandra and then hadnt there was something on her mind too he knew and anyway what right had he to draw her into whatever this was or whatever it might turn out to be none so it went evening drew towards night harry prepared for bed only to sit dozing in his chair the dish in his garden collected signals and unscrambled their pictures onto his screen he started awake at the sound of applause and discovered an american chatshow host talking to a fat lady who had the most human appealing eyes harry could imagine the show was called interesting people or some such and harry had watched it before usually it was anything but interesting but now he caught the word extrasensory and sat up a little straighter naturally enough he found esp in all its forms entirely fascinating so lets get this right the skeletally thin host said to the fat lady you went deaf when you were eighteen months old and so never learned how to speak right thats right the fat lady answered but i do have this incredible memory and obviously id heard a great many human conversations before i went deaf anyway speech never developed in me so i wasnt only deaf but dumb too then three years ago i got married my husband is a technician in a recording studio he took me in one day and i watched him working and i suddenly made the connection between the oscillating sensors on his machinery and the voices and instrument sounds of the group he was recording suddenly you got the idea of sound right thats correct the fat lady smiled and continued now i had of course learned signlanguage or dactylology which in my mind id called dumbspeak and i also knew that some deaf people could carry on perfectly normal conversations which i termed deafspeak but i hadnt tried it myself simply because i hadnt understood sound you see my deafness was total absolute sound didnt exist except in my memory and so you saw this hypnotist indeed i did it was hard but he was patient and of course it mightnt have been possible at all except he was able to use dumbspeak so he hypnotized me and brought back all the conversations id heard as a baby and when i woke up you could speak exactly as you hear me now yes the hell you say not only fully articulate but almost entirely without accent mrs zdzienicki thats a most fascinating story and you really are one of the most interrrresting people weve ever had on this show the camera stayed on his thin smiling face and he nodded his head in frenetic affirmation yessiree and now lets move on to but harry had already moved to switch off the set and as the screen blinked out he saw how dark it had grown almost midnight and the house temperature already falling as the timer cut power to the central heating system it was time he was in bed or maybe hed watch just one more interview with one of these interrrrresting people he didnt remember switching the set on again but as its picture formed he was drawn in through the screen where he found jack garrulous or whatever his name was adrift in the mцbius continuum welcome to the show harry said jack and we just know were going to find you verrry interesting now ive been sort of admiring this er place youve got here what did you say it was called he held out his microphone for harry to speak into this is the mцbius continuum jack said harry a little nervously and im not really supposed to be here the hell you say but on this show anything goes harry youre on primetime son so dont be shy time harry said but all time is prime jack is time what youre interested in well in that case take a look in here and grabbing garrulous by the elbow he guided him through a futuretime door interrrresting the other approved as side by side they shot into the future towards that far faint haze of blue which was the expansion of humanity through the three mundane dimensions of the spacetime universe and what are these myriad blue threads harry the lifethreads of the human race harry explained see over there that one just this moment bursting into being such a pure shining blue that its almost blinding thats a newborn baby with a long long way to go and this one here gradually fading and getting ready to blink out he lowered his voice in respect well thats an old man about to die the hell you say said jack garrulous awed but of course youd know all about that now wouldnt you harry i mean about death and such for after all arent you the one they call a necrowhatsit a necroscope yes harry nodded or at least i was and hows that for a talent folks garrulous beamed with teeth like piano keys for harry keoghs the man who talks to the dead and hes the only one theyll talk back to but in the nicest possible way see they kind of love him so what do you call that sort of conversation harry i mean when youre talking to dead folks see a little while ago we were speaking to this mrs zdzienicki who told us all about dumbspeak and deafspeak and deadspeak harry cut him short deadspeak really the hell you say well if you havent been one of the most interrrr and he paused squinting over harrys shoulder um said harry one last question son said garrulous urgently his narrowing eyes fixed on something just outside harrys sphere of vision i mean you told us about the blue lifethreads sure enough but what in all getouts the meaning of a red one eh harrys head snapped round wideeyed he stared and saw a scarlet thread even now angling in towards him and vampire he yelled rolling out of his armchair into the darkness of the room and framed in the doorway leading back into the rest of the house he saw the silhouette of what could only be one thing that which hed known was coming for him there was a small table beside his chair which harry had knocked flying groping in the darkness his fingers found two things a tablelamp thrown to the floor and the weapon hed worked on earlier in the day the latter was loaded switching on the lamp harry went into a crouch behind his chair and brought up his gleaming metal crossbow into view and saw that his worst nightmare had advanced into the room there was no denying the thing the slategrey colour of its flesh its gaping jaws and what they contained its pointed ears and the highcollared cape which gave its skull and menacing features definition it was a vampire of the comicbook variety but even realizing that this wasnt the real thing still harrys finger had tightened on the trigger it was all reaction this body hed trained to a peak of perfection was working just as hed programmed it to work in a hundred simulations of this very situation and despite the fact that hed come immediately awake and that he knew this thing in his room with him was a fraud still his adrenalin was flowing and his heart pounding and his weapons fifteeninch hardwood bolt already in flight it was only in the last split second that hed tried to avert disaster by elevating the crossbows tiller up towards the ceiling but that had been enough barely wellesley seeing the crossbow in harrys hand had blown froth through his plastic teeth in a gasp of terror and tried to back off the bolt missed his right ear by a hairs breadth struck through the collar of his costume cape and snatched him back against the wall it buried itself deep in plaster and old brick and pinned him there he spat out his teeth and yelled jesus christ you idiot its me but this was as much for the benefit of darcy clarke back there somewhere in the dark house as for harry keogh for even as he was shouting wellesleys right hand reached inside the coat under his cape and grasped the grip of his issue mm browning this was his main chance keogh had attacked him just as hed hoped he would it was selfdefence thats all harry taking no chances had nocked his bow snatched the auxiliary bolt from its clips under the tiller of his weapon and placed it in the breech in a sort of slowmotion born of the speed of his own actions he saw wellesleys arm straightening and coming up into the firing position but he couldnt believe the man would shoot him why for what reason or perhaps wellesley feared he was going to use the crossbow again that must be it yes he dropped his weapon into the armchairs well and threw up his arms but now wellesleys aim was unwavering his eyes glinting his knuckle turning white in the triggerguard of the automatic and he actually grinned as he shouted keogh you madman no nor then three things happening almost simultaneously one darcy clarkes voice which harry recognized immediately shouting wellesley get out of there get the fuck out of there and his footsteps coming clattering down the corridor and his cursing as he collided with a plantpot and stand and knocked them over two harry throwing himself over backwards behind the armchair as finally wellesleys intention became clear and hearing the angry whirrr of the bullet as the first shot went wide by an inch and levering himself up to make a grab for the crossbow again just in time to see the look on wellesleys face turn from a mixture of incomprehensible rage and murderous intent to one of sheerest horror as his eyes were drawn to something behind harry which caused them to flash wide and disbelieving in a moment three the crash of shattering glass and snapping of thin wooden mullions inwards as something wet and heavy and clumsy came plunging through the locked patio doors into the room something which drew wellesleys fire from harry to itself jesus jesus jesus the head of ebranch screamed emptying his gun over harrys head which hed now turned towards the shattered glass door and there staggering from the impact of the shots but somehow managing to keep its feet harry saw something indeed someone though who exactly it would be hard to tell which hed thought never to see again and even though he didnt know this one still he knew him or it for a friend for in the old days all of the dead had been harrys friends this one was bloated wet intact not long dead but long enough to smell very badly and behind it came a second corpse dusty withered almost mummified stepping through the frame of the shattered door they were in their crumbling burial sheets and each of them carried a stone advancing on wellesley where he stood pinned to the wall still yanking on the trigger of his empty gun and harry could only crouch there watching mouthing silent denials as they drew close to the frenzied maddened boss of ebranch and began to raise their stones that was when the corridor light came on and darcy clarke stumbled into the room his talent for survival unfelt except by darcy himself was shrieking at him to get the hell out of here almost physically driving him back but somehow he fought it and after all the hostility of the dead wasnt directed at him but at his boss harry he yelled when he saw what was happening in the room for gods sake call them off i cant harry yelled back you know i cant but at least he could put himself between them he did that now jumped forward and somehow got between the dead things and wellesley where he gibbered and frothed and there they stood with their stones upraised and the soggy one seeking to put harry gently to one side he might have too but suddenly suicidal harry cried out no go back where you belong its a mistake or at least he tried to but he only got as far as go back where for he was forbidden to speak to the dead but fortunately for wellesley the dead werent forbidden to heed him as harry clapped his hands to his head and cried out jerking like a spastic puppet as he crumpled up so the dead men let fall their stones and turned away and went out again into the night strangled until now wellesley found his voice again but it was a deranged voice if ever darcy clarke heard one did you see did you see wellesley gibbered i didnt believe it but now ive seen for myself he called them up against me hes a monster by god a monster but its the end of you harry keogh hed freed the spent magazine from his gun and dropped it to the carpeted floor and was in the process of bringing a fully loaded one out of his pocket when clarke hit him with all the force he could muster gun and magazine went flying and wellesley hung there in his makeup suspended from the crossbow bolt then there were more running footsteps and in the next moment the twoman backup team was there wondering what the hell was going on and darcy was down on the floor with harry holding him in his arms as the agonized man clutched at his head and gasped out his unbearable pain and slid down into the deep dark well of merciful oblivion a great deal occurred in the nine hours it took harry to sleep it off a securityscreened doctor was called in to look at him also to give wellesley a shot that would keep him down a while clarke got in touch with sandra because he reckoned she should be in on this and should have been from the start and as dawn came and went and both harry and wellesley were beginning to show signs of regaining consciousness so a call came through from the duty officer at ebranch hq darcy had of course already put hq in the picture hed contacted the do right after the excitement had died down to report everything that had happened and what hed done and at the same time to tender his resignation to the minister responsible also hed suggested that someone might like to start thinking about a replacement for wellesley who was obviously several kinds of flake and looking back on wellesleys plan to scare harry keogh into using the mцbius continuum which he darcy clarke had gone along with darcy reckoned he might be just a little on the flaky side himself sandra when shed arrived looking worried as hell and after hed explained things to her had said as much in no uncertain terms and probably would have said a lot more except she could see that darcy was taking it badly enough already she didnt feel the need to blame him because he was so obviously blaming himself so instead of ranting and raving and generally going to pieces shed simply sat with harry through what was left of the night and into the morning and just a few minutes ago when everyone was into his third cup of coffee that was when the telephone rang and it was hq asking to speak to darcy clarke he took the call which was a long one and when he was through had to sit down a minute and think about it theyd stretched wellesley out on harrys bed upstairs with one of the men from ebranch watching him harry himself had a leather couch downstairs in the study where everything had happened and where theyd draped a blanket over the broken patio doors to keep out the night chill sandra darcy and the other ebranch operative were all there with him with nothing to do now except wait for him to wake up except that now following this telephone call darcy had quite a bit more to do and the speed with which circumstances had changed had left him breathless but sandra had seen the full range of rapidly changing expressions on his face as hed talked into the telephone and now catching a glimpse of the confusion in his mind and the relief and something of the shock too she felt prompted to inquire what was that all about darcy looked at her and his bleary eyes slowly focussed then he turned to the other agent and said eddy go up and keep joe company eh and when wellesley wakes up tell him hes under arrest what the other looked at him incredulously darcy nodded that was the do on the blower and he had our minister right there with him it seems our pal norman harold wellesley has been fooling around a little with a suspicious character from the russian embassy hes suspended forthwith and were to deliver him to mis asap which puts me right back in the chair for now anyway as eddy left to go upstairs darcy told sandra yes but thats just part of it it never rains but it pours we have a big problem we she said shaking her head no for im out of it whatever it is and i thought you were too well your resignation may have been turned down but not mine im through with the branch as of now i understand that he said and i meant have a problem rather than we its not only business but personal too and im afraid i cant quit until its sorted out but you dont want to hear about it right hearing wont hurt she said its ken layard and trevor jordan he began to explain they were out in the aegean rhodes keeping tabs on a load of drugs being run through the med and now it seems theyve come unstuck badly how badly sandra had met the two men in fact jordan the telepath had been her sponsor and she knew something of their talents and outstanding reputations very badly darcy shook his head and its weird something im going to have to look into myself these were two of my closest friends weird she repeated him were he nodded over the last few days trevors had a couple of minor problems they thought it was overeating or drinking or something now apparently hes a raving madman or would be if he wasnt under sedation in a rhodes asylum and the night before last no the one before that when im tired like this my bodyclock goes out of whack ken layard was fished out of the harbour halffull of water and with a bump on his head where hed collided with something concussion thats all except as yet theres no sign of a normal recovery all of which smells very fishy to me what said harry keogh fumbling the word out of a mouth that tasted highly toxic as he tried to sit up they sprang to his side darcy supporting him and sandra hugging his head are you all right harry she stroked his hair kissed his forehead he freed himself licked his lips and said be a love and make me a cup of coffee and as she left the room he focussed on darcy names he said eh you mentioned the names of some people harry said again seeming to find some difficulty in getting his tongue round the words people ive heard of and met in ebranch he pulled a face god my mouth tastes vile and then suddenly remembering his eyes went wide that idiot was trying to shoot me and then abruptly he struggled upright his eyes searching every corner of the room all that was last night harry darcy told him knowing what he was looking for and theyve gone now they went when you told them to some of the anxiety went out of harrys face replaced by the bitter look of a man betrayed you were here he accused with wellesley darcy didnt deny it yes he said i was but for the last time i was following orders or trying to but thats no excuse i was here and shouldnt have been but from here on in i have one more job to do and then im out of ebranch for good i dont think spyings my style harry and i sure as hell know that shitting on my friends isnt as for wellesley i dont think hell be much trouble from now on what harry went deathly pale in a moment dont tell me they darcy shook his head no they didnt hurt him you told them to go and they went and then you folded up sandra was back with harrys coffee whats this about names she said harry took a mouthful of hot coffee gave his head a tentative shake and said ow god my head she took pills from her bag and gave them to him he accepted them and washed them down and names yes he said yet again the names of people in ebranch you were talking about them as i came to darcy told him about layard and jordan and as he talked so harrys face grew drawn even haggard finally when darcy was done harry glanced at sandra well she shrugged looked mystified what are you getting at harry tell him about the stones harry said in the garden and seeing his meaning at once she gasped ken l and t jor now it was darcys turn to look dumb do you want to let me in on it he said harry stood up swayed a little then headed for the patio doors he was still in his pyjamas be careful darcy cautioned him theres still a lot of glass there we didnt do much of a job of tidying up im afraid harry avoided the glass and took down the blanket and they followed him into the garden in his bare feet he crossed the lawn pointed to a fresh series of stones where theyd been laid out on the grass there he said thats what they were doing when wellesley jumped me which incidentally you might like to try explaining sometime when youve a week or two to spare this was directed at both of them harry sandra was quick to protest i had nothing to do with it but you do work for the branch not any more she said and then because she was afraid of losing him she let it all out in a breathless rush try to understand harry at first you were just a job but different from any other they ever gave me also what i was doing was for your benefit thats what they told me but they didnt plan and i didnt plan on my falling in love with you that just happened and now they can stuff their job harry smiled in his wan way then staggered a little she at once caught him held him up you shouldnt even be on your feet you look terrible harry im still a bit dizzy thats all he answered anyway what you were saying i heard all that too when i was waking up and what the hell i think ive always known that you were one of theirs you and old man bettley so what so was i once and lets face it i can use all the help i can get right darcy was still looking at the stones his forehead creased in a frown does this mean what i think it means he asked they all looked at the incomplete word rhodf rhodes said harry nodding they didnt have time to finish the e and the s thats all and now it all adds up but to what sandra and darcy said together harry looked at them and made no attempt to hide his fear to something ive been praying wouldnt happen and yet halfexpecting ever since i returned from starside he said then he shivered and added lets get inside and for the moment that was all he would say about it when wellesley woke up and darcy told him it looked like he was in big trouble at first he was full of bluster but then he had to face down harry too and that was when he caved in he knew how lucky he was that he wasnt a murderer knew too that harry hadnt let his dead friends kill him even though hed had the right and couldnt have been blamed for it whats more he knew what it had cost harry to call them off and so he told everything the whole story how hed been recruited by gregor borowitz because of his negative talent and how hed been a sleeper until they tried to activate him harry had been their chief interest though doubtless they would have got around to the rest of ebranch too when they were satisfied that he was no longer a player and so wellesley had been feeding them details of his progress but when it had seemed that harry might be on the verge of new things then theyd wanted rid of him harry with his old powers returned to him or maybe new talents they hadnt even heard of would be just too dangerous then darcy had given his men their orders to take the exhead of the branch back to london and hand him over and finally hed spent a long session on the telephone talking to the minister responsible one subject had been nikolai zharov wellesleys russian contact he was still loose somewhere and alas would stay loose for the time being diplomatically immune they couldnt even pick him up eventually a protest would be made to the soviet embassy requiring zharovs expulsion for the usual activities inconsistent with etc by the time darcy was through harry had a lot more coffee inside him and a bite of brunch and was looking more his usual self not doleful darcy thought just sort of placid and not entirely with it he reminded him of nothing so much as a powerful hand torch minus its batteries fully charged he could really shine but right now there wasnt even a spark or maybe there was when are you going to rhodes harry asked him now as soon as i can get a flight out id be out of here right now but i wanted to be sure you were ok first i reckoned i owed you that at least and probably a lot more but i want to arrange to get trevor and ken out of there if they can be moved also i have to see if i can discover what they came up against their greek liaison man is still out there and might be able to help me on that he looked at harry speculatively and i had hopes that you might be able to help me too harry what with these messages youve been getting and all harry nodded i have my suspicions he said but wed all better pray im wrong see i know the dead wouldnt harm me they wouldnt deliberately risk hurting me and yet this thing is so important to them or to me that its almost as if theyve been tempting me into conversation but my son did a hell of a good job on me i dont remember my dreams in any detail not the ones which they send me anyway and i cant try to clarify them and as for the mцbius continuum god i cant add two and two without it comes out five darcy clarke had personal experience of the mцbius continuum harry had taken him there once taken him through it from here this very house to ebranch hq in london over three hundred miles away and that had been a trip darcy would never forget and he hoped never repeat all the days of his life even now these years later it was printed on his memory in vivid detail there had been darkness on the mцbius strip the primal darkness itself as it was before the universe began a place of negativity yes where darkness lay upon the face of the deep and darcy had thought that this could well be that region from which god had commanded let there be light and caused the physical universe to split off from the metaphysical void there had been no air but neither had there been time so that darcy didnt need to breathe and without time there was likewise no space both of these essentials of a universe of matter had been absent but darcy hadnt ruptured and flown apart because thered been nowhere to fly to harry had been darcys single anchor on sanity and being and humanity he couldnt see him for there was no light but he could feel the pressure of his hand and perhaps because darcy was himself psychically endowed hed felt he had some small understanding of the place for instance he knew it was real because he was here and with harry beside him hed known he need not fear it because his talent hadnt prevented him from coming here and so even in the confusion of his nearpanic hed been able to explore his feelings about it lacking space it was literally nowhere but by the same token lacking time it was everywhere and when it was core and boundary both interior and exterior where nothing ever changed except by force of will but there was no will except it was brought here by someone like harry keogh harry was only a man and yet the things he could do through the mцbius continuum were godlike and what if god should come here and again darcy had thought of the god who wrought a great change out of a formless void and willed a universe and then the thought had also occurred we arent meant to be here this isnt our place i understand how you feel harry had told him then for ive felt it too but dont be afraid just let it happen and accept it cant you feel the magic of it doesnt it thrill you to your soul and darcy had had to admit it thrilled him but it scared him witless too then so as not to prolong it harry had taken him to the threshold of a futuretime door looking out theyd seen a chaos of millions no billions of threads of pure blue light etched against an eternity of black velvet like an incredible meteor shower except the tracks didnt dim but remained printed on the sky indeed printed on time and the most awesome thing was this that two of these twining twisting streamers of blue light had issued from darcy and harry themselves extruding from them and racing away into the future the blue lifethreads of humanity of all mankind spreading out and away through space and time but then harry had closed that door and opened another a door on the past the myriad neon lifethreads had been there as before but this time instead of expanding into a misted distance theyd contracted and narrowed down targeting on a faraway dazzling blue core of origin and in the main that was what had most seared itself on darcys memory the fact that hed seen the very birthlight of mankind anyway harrys voice decisive now brought him back to the present im coming with you to rhodes i mean you might need my advice darcy gazed at him in astonishment he hadnt seen or heard him so positive in how long youre coming with theyre my friends too harry blurted oh maybe i dont know them like you do but i trusted in them once and they trusted in me in what i was doing they were in on that bodescu business they have their talents and they have invaluable experience of things also well it seems to me the dead want me to go and lastly we really cant afford to have anything happen to people like those two not now we cant afford it what we harry and suddenly darcy was very tense waiting for harrys answer you me the world is it that bad it could be so im coming with you sandra looked at them both and said so am i darcy shook his head not if its like he thinks it might be youre not but im a telepath she protested i might be able to help with trevor jordan he and i used to be able to read each other like books hes my friend too remember harry took her arm didnt you hear what darcy said trevors a madman his mind has gone she pulled a face and tuttutted what does that mean harry minds dont just go you of all people should know that it hasnt gone anywhere just gone wrong thats all i might be able to look in there and see whats wrong were wasting time darcy was growing anxious ok so its decided were all three going how long will it take you to get ready im ready harry answered at once five minutes to pack a few things ill need to pick up my passport on our way through edinburgh sandra shrugged thats all anything else i need ill buy out there right said darcy you phone a taxi and ill help harry pack if we have time i can always put hq in the picture from the airport so lets go and in their graves the teeming dead relaxed a little for the moment anyway harry because he thought hed heard their massed sighing gave a small shudder it wasnt terror or dread or anything like that it was just the frisson of knowing but of course his friends his living friends knew nothing at all of that unbeknown to the three nikolai zharov was at edinburgh airport to see them off he had also been across the river with a pair of kgbissue nitelite binoculars when wellesley broke into harrys house in bonnyrig and hed seen what had left the garden to plod back to their riven plots in a cemetery half a mile away hed seen and known what they were and still looked haggard from knowing it but that didnt stop zharov coding a message and phoning it through to the kgb cell at the embassy so that in a very short time indeed the soviet intelligence agencies knew that harry keogh was en route to the mediterranean it was pm local time at rhodes airport when manolis papastamos met them off their flight during the taxi ride into the historic town he told them in his frenetic fashion all he knew of what had transpired but seeing no connection he made no mention of jianni lazarides what of ken layard now darcy wanted to know papastamos was small slender all sinew and suntan and shinyblack wavy hair handsome in a fashion and usually full of zest now he looked harassed and hagridden i dont know what it is he gave a series of questioning desperate shrugs held out his hands palms up i dont know and blame myself because i dont know but they are not easy to understand those two policemen strange policemen they seemed to know so much to be so sure of certain things but never explained to me how they knew theyre very special darcy agreed but what about ken he couldnt swim had a bump on his head i dragged him out of the harbour onto some rocks got the salt water out of him went for help jordan was no use to me he just sat on the mole under the old windmills babbling to himself he was suddenly crazy and hes stayed that way but layard he was ok i swear it just a bump on the head and now now said harry now they say he may die papastamos looked like he might cry i did all i could i swear it dont blame yourself manolis darcy told him whatever happened wasnt your fault but can we see him of course we go to the hospital now you can see trevor too if you wish it but and again he shrugged you wont get much out of that one my god i am so sorry the hospital was off papalouca one of the new towns main roads it was a big sprawling place with a frontage all of a hundred yards long one section a ward clinic and dispensary is reserved mainly for the treatment of the tourists papastamos explained as their taxi took them in through the gates its not much in use now but in july and august the work doesnt stop the broken bones bad sunburns heatstroke stings cuts and bruises ken layard has a room of his own he told their driver to wait led the way into a side wing where a receptionist sat in her booth clipping her fingernails as soon as she saw papastamos she sprang to her feet and spoke to him in breathless very much subdued greek papastamos at once gasped and went pale my friends you are too late he said he is dead he looked at sandra darcy and harry in turn and shook his head there is nothing i can say they were too dumbstruck to answer for a moment until harry said can we see him anyway harry looked cool in a pale blue jacket white shirt and slacks he and the others had slept on the plane catching up on a lot of lost sleep and despite his travails of the night before he seemed to have come through it better than them his face was calm resigned unlike sandras and darcys papastamos saw no sorrow in it and the greek thought a coldblooded one this harry keogh but he was wrong it was simply that harry had learned to view death differently ken layard might be finished here finished physically materially in the corporeal world but he wasnt all dead not all of him why for all harry knew ken might be seeking him out right now desperate to engage him in deadspeak except harry was forbidden to hear him and forbidden to answer even if he did see him papastamos answered of course you can but the girl tells me that first the doctor wishes to see us his office is this way and he led them down a cool corridor where the light came slanting in through high narrow windows they found the doctor a small bald man with thicklensed spectacles perched on the end of his hook of a nose in his tiny office room signing and stamping papers when papastamos introduced them to him dr sakellarakis was at once the soul of concern displaying his very genuine dismay at the loss of their friend speaking halfdecent english and shaking his head sadly he told them this bump on the layards head i fraid is much more than the simple bump gentlemen lady there is perhaps the damage inside this is not certain until the autopsy naturally but i thinks this one is causing the death the damage the blood clot something again he shook his head gave a sad shrug can we see him harry asked again and as the doctor led the way when is the autopsy again the greeks shrug one days two as soon as it can be arranged but soon until then i am having him removed to the morgue and when did he die exactly harry was relentless exactly to the minute is not known one hour i thinks about ah hours six oclock local time said sandra we were on the plane does there have to be an autopsy harry hated the thought of it he knew the effect necromancy had on the dead how much they feared it dragosani had been a necromancer and oh how the dead had loathed and feared him of course this wouldnt be the same layard would feel nothing at the hands of a pathologist whose skills would be those of the surgeon as opposed to the torturer but still harry didnt like it sakellarakis held up his hands it is the law layards room was small white clean and pungently antiseptic he lay full length on a trolley covered head to toe by a sheet the bed hed used had been made up again and the window closed to keep out flies darcy carefully laid back the sheet to show layards face and drew back at once wincing sandra too layards face wasnt in repose is the spasm sakellarakis informed nodding the muscles a contraction the mortician is putting this one right then layard he is doing the correct sleeping harry hadnt drawn back instead he stood over layard looking down at him the esper was grey claycold frozen in rigor mortis but his face was fixed in something rather more than that his jaws were open in a scream and his upper lip at the left had lifted up and away from the teeth leaving them visible and shining his entire face seemed pulled to the left in a sort of rictus as if he screamed his denial of something unbelievable unbearable his eyes were closed but in the eyelids under the brows harry saw twin slits in the membranous skin they were fine but dark and plainly visible against the overall pallor hes been cut harry glanced at the greek doctor the spasm the other nodded the eyes come open it can happen i make the small cuts in the muscles no problem harry licked his lips frowned peered intently at the large blue lump showing on layards forehead and continuing into his hair the shiny skin was broken in the centre a small abrasion where flesh white as fishbelly showed through harry looked at the lump reached out a hand as if to touch it then turned away and that look on his face he said under his breath no muscular spasm that but sheer terror darcy clarke for his part had taken one look at layard and drawn back first one pace then another but he hadnt stopped drawing back and was now out in the corridor his face was drawn eyes staring into the room at the figure on the trolley sandra joined him harry too darcy what is it sandras voice was hushed darcy only shook his head i dont know he gulped but whatever it is its not right it was his talent working looking out for him papastamos put back the sheet over layards face he and sakellarakis came out of the room into the corridor not the spasm you say the doctor looked at harry and cocked his head on one side you are knowing about these things i know some things about the dead yes harry nodded harrys an expert darcy had himself under control now ah said sakellarakis a doctor listen harry took him by the arm spoke earnestly to him the autopsy must be tonight and then he must be burned burned you are meaning cremated yes cremated reduced to ashes tomorrow at the latest my god manolis papastamos burst out and ken layard was your friend such friends i dont need i thought you were the cold one but you are not merely cold you are as dead as he is cold sweat was beading harrys forehead now and he was beginning to look sick but thats just the point he said i dont think he is dead you dont dr sakellarakiss jaw fell open but i know this thing for sure the gentleman he is certain dead undead harry was swaying now sandras eyes flew wide so this was really it but harry had been caught off guard he was shocked saying too much its an english expression she quickly cut in undead not dead but merely departed old friends simply pass on thats what he meant kens not dead but in the hands of god or the devil harry thought but he was steadier now and glad that shed come to his rescue darcys mind was also working overtime its layards religion he said which requires that hes burned cremated within a day of his dying harry only wants to be sure it will be the way he would want it ah manolis papastamos still wasnt sure but he thought that at least he was beginning to understand then i have to apologize i am sorry harry thats ok said harry can we see trevor jordan now well go right now papastamos nodded the asylum is in the old town inside the old crusader walls its off pythagoras street the nuns run it they used the taxi again and reached their destination in a little over twenty minutes by now the sun was setting and a cool breeze off the sea brought relief from the heat of the day during the journey darcy asked papastamos incidentally can you fix us up with somewhere to stay a decent hotel better than that said the other the tourist season is just starting many of the villas are still empty i found you a place as soon as i knew you were coming after you have seen poor trevor then i take you there at the asylum they had to wait until a sister of rhodos could be spared from her duties to take them to jordans cell he was strait jacketed seated in a deep highsided leather chair with his feet inches off the ground in this position he could do himself no harm but in any case he seemed asleep with papastamos to translate the sister explained that they were administering a mild sedative at regular intervals it wasnt that jordan was violent more that he seemed desperately afraid of something tell her she can leave us with him harry told the greek we wont stay long and we know the way out and when papastamos had complied and the sister left and you too manolis if you please eh darcy laid a hand on his arm be a good fellow manolis and wait for us outside he told him believe me we know what were doing the other shrugged however sourly and left darcy and harry looked at sandra do you feel up to it darcy said she was nervous but it should be easy she answered at last were two of a kind ive had plenty of practice with trevor and know the way in but it was as if she spoke more to convince herself than anyone else and as she took up a position behind jordan with her hands on the back of his chair so the last rays of the sun began to fade in the tiny high recessed stainedglass windows of the cell sandra closed her eyes and the silence grew jordan sat locked in his chair his chest rising and falling his eyelids fluttering as he dreamed or thought whatever thoughts they were that troubled him his left hand fluttering a little too where it was strapped down by his thigh harry and darcy stood watching aware now of the gathering dusk the fading light and without warning sandra was in she looked saw gave a strangled little cry and stumbled back away from jordans chair until she crashed into the wall jordans eyes snapped open they were terrified his head swivelled left and right and he saw the two espers standing before him and just for a moment he knew them darcy harry he croaked and as simply and suddenly as that harry knew who had come to him in his dreams at bonnyrig to beg his help but in the next moment jordans white face began to twitch and shake in dreadful spasms of effort and agony he tried to say something butwas denied the chance the shuddering stopped his fevered eyes closed and his head lolled and he slumped down again but even as he returned to his monstrous dreams so he managed one last word hahahaarrryr they rushed to sandra where she stood halffainting against the wall and when she stopped gasping for air and was able to hold them off what was it harry asked her did you see i saw she nodded swallowing rapidly hes not mad harry just trapped trapped in his own mind yes like some innocent cringing terrified victim locked in a dungeon a victim of what darcy wanted to know slackjawed as he gaped at her trembling in harrys arms oh god oh god she whispered her trembling threatening to shake harry too as her eyes went fearfully back to trevor jordan lolling there unconscious in his chair and darcy felt his blood stiffen to ice in the haunted light of her eyes as finally she answered of the monster whos in there with him of that thing whos in there right now talking to him questioning him about us undead night was already drawing in the earlybreak tourists promenading in their evening finery and the towns lights beginning to come on as the taxi sped the three to their villa but in the front of the car with the driver manolis papastamos was very quiet darcy supposed that the greek felt out of things and probably considered hed been snubbed and he wondered how best to make up for it there was still a lot papastamos could do for them indeed without his cooperation they might find the going very difficult the villa stood in its own highwalled gardens of lemon almond and olive trees overlooking the sea on the akti canari promenade towards the airport it was square and flatroofed had shuttered windows squealing wroughtiron gates and a pebbled path to the main door where a dim lamp glowed under the roof of a pine porch the lamp had already attracted a cloud of moths and they in their turn had lured several small green geckoes which scattered across the wall as papastamos turned the key gratingly in the door and while the stubblejawed chain smoking taxi driver patiently waited so the greek policeman showed his three very odd foreign visitors around the place it wasnt the best but it was private and gave easy access to the town there were cooking facilities but the three would be well advised to eat at any one of the halfdozen excellent tavernas which stood within a stones throw and there was a telephone which came with a typed list of useful local numbers kept clean in a plastic folder downstairs were two bedrooms both equipped with two single beds bedside tables reading lamps and builtin wardrobes there was also a spacious sitting or readingroom with glass doors to a patio under a striped winddown canvas awning and lastly a small toilet and bathroom no bath as such but a tiled shower recess and all the rest of the amenities upstairs didnt matter when papastamos was through he automatically assumed he wouldnt be needed any more that night but when he went back out to the taxi darcy followed him saying manolis we really dont know how to thank you i mean how do we pay for all of this oh we can pay of course we can but youll have to tell us how and how much and et cetera the other shrugged its on the greek government thats very kind darcy said we really would have been lost without you especially at a time like this with so much on our minds for layard and jordan they really are or were two of our very closest friends at last papastamos turned to him my friends too he said with a lot of feeling i only knew them for a day or two but they were nice people and i tell you not everyone i meet is so nice then you must understand how we feel darcy answered who knew them a long time papastamos was quiet a moment then shrugged again perhaps apologetically and nodded yes of course i understand is there anything else i can do oh indeed there is darcy knew it was all right between them now like i said wed be lost without you and that still goes wed like you to exert whatever pressure you can to get that autopsy over and done with and then to have poor ken layard cremated as soon as possible and thats just for starters youll also need to keep tabs on this gang of drugsmugglers for right now youre the only one who knows anything about them we will eventually have some more people flying out and youll also be required to brief them and finally if its at all possible do you think you could arrange a car for us no problem said the other expansive as ever it will be here tomorrow morning then thats about it for now darcy smiled well just trust you to see to your end of this thing for after all thats whats most important and you must trust us to do the things we have to do were all experts in our different ways manolis papastamos scribbled a number on a scrap of paper you can get me here any time he said or if not youll get someone who knows where i am darcy thanked him again and said good night and as the taxi drew away he went back in through the squeaking gates the three went out to eat and to talk but why out darcy wanted to know after theyd found a taverna fronting on a quiet street with small stairways to private tables on internal balconies out of earshot of other patrons and when they were seated in just such privacy i mean wasnt the villa private enough it could have been too private harry told him too private sandra was still a little shaky from the brief mental contact shed made with something unthinkable in the mind of trevor jordan there are people here harry tried to explain something he wasnt himself sure of other minds other thoughts a background blanket of mental activity you two should understand that better than i do i dont want us to be found out thats all you think you espers are clever well and so you are but the wamphyri have powers too wamphyri it was a word darcy clarke couldnt hear without remembering the yulian bodescu affair and he felt a familiar shiver down his spine as he asked and you believe thats what were up against right another like bodescu worse than that harry answered bodescu was an open book compared to this he didnt know what was happening to him he wasnt an innocent himself hadnt even been innocent from a time before he was born but he was an innocent in the ways of the wamphyri he was a beginner a child learning how to run before he could walk and he made mistakes kept falling down until one of his falls was fatal but this one isnt like that harry said sandra how do you know these things how do you know what were up against yes i sensed a mind in there with trevors a powerful totally evil mind but couldnt it have been another telepath they were on a drugs job ken and trevor what if the bigleague criminals have set up their own espunits it could happen couldnt it i doubt it harry answered from what ive seen of espers they dont work for other people what darcy was surprised but we all do ken trevor sandra myself and you once upon a time worked for a cause said harry for an idea a country for revenge not for the gain of other people would you if you were as powerful as the one sandra sensed would you sell your talent to a gang of thugs whod destroy you the moment they began to fear you which they would eventually but what about ivan gerenko who a madman a megalomaniac harry cut him off no even the necromancer dragosani was working for an ideal the resurrection of old wallachia at least until his vampire took control listen how many people know you have your talent darcy and sandra how many people know youre a telepath ive only known it myself for a few hours you didnt go around advertising it did you take it from me the ones who do tell all are the fakes mediums and spoonbenders mystics and gurus fakes every one darcy snorted his derision so youre saying that all of us espers are good guys right no such thing harry shook his head no for theres plenty of wickedness in the world even among all you espers but think about it if youre evil and youve mastered a special talent why would you want to sell it to someone else wouldnt you use it in secret to make yourself mighty the fact is said darcy ive often wondered why they dont the people in ebranch i mean ive no doubt that some do said harry no im not talking about ebranch but others people we know nothing about there must be many talents loose in the world how do we know that socalled business acumen isnt just another talent did this man make a million because he has a knack for wheeling and dealing or was it because theres a special something guiding his hand something which he himself might not even know about is the war hero really as brave as we believe him to be or has he like you darcy or even like gerenko got a guardian angel watching over him did you know that the casinos have a list of people they wont let in professional gamblers who have the winning knack and that an awful lot of them are rich as croesus thats all very well said darcy reasonably but still you have no proof that this one is a vampire proof not yet harry answered but evidence plenty circumstantial but still its there such as said sandra perhaps exasperated he turned to her sandra the closest youve been to a vampire is in reading my case file i take it you have read it its a standard text in ebranch as a guard against the next time but i do know what im talking about and so does darcy so while i dont want to be hurtful still i think youd best just sit still and listen especially you for we dont yet know that when you saw him whoever he is in trevors mind he didnt see you she gasped and sat up straighter and harry reached across to pat her hand im sorry but now maybe you can see whats worrying me some of it anyway me ive been here before or at least in a similar position but you god i dont want anything to happen to you darcy said but you did mention evidence before harry could answer a waiter came to take their order darcy ordered a full meal sandra a salad and sweet but harry only asked for a portion of chicken and plenty of coffee a full stomach always makes me sleepy he explained and alcohol is worse still and i intend that you understand how deadly serious i am about this thing but if you really want to drink that brandy just go ahead darcy darcy looked at his brandy glass and the large measure of golden liquid it contained and put it aside evidence then said harry for more than four years the dead havent attempted to contact me or if they have i havent been aware of it oh my mother may well have come to me in my dreams in fact im sure she has for thats her nature and yet now suddenly theyve placed me in jeopardy all right the fact of them attacking wellesley was circumstantial they just happened to be there when hed planned to murder me but they were there delivering a message and they were doing it possibly for my mother or for themselves out of their concern for me or for ken and trevor who had been trying to reach me in my dreams darcy frowned theyd been trying to reach you telepathically i didnt know that neither did i until ken layard woke up and saw us and spoke a mental voice sounds just like the real thing to me darcy and back in scotland id been dreaming that people were trying to reach me but i didnt know who they were as soon as i heard kens real voice then i recognized it as to how they did it kens a locator he found me and trevors a telepath he helped send the message why me because im the socalled expert on what they both knew they were dealing with and so they should know because they too were in on the bodescu affair darcy nodded licked his dry lips he lifted his brandy and took the merest sip dampening his mouth with it all right what other evidence the evidence of my own senses said harry which like yours number more than five not any longer sandra pointed out and at once bit her tongue hoping he wouldnt take it the wrong way harry didnt smiling however wryly he said i dont have to be able to talk to the dead to know the difference between a corpse and a live man again darcy frowned so what does that mean he asked the same goes for any one of us have you ever walked down a silent empty alley at night harry asked him and all of a sudden youre certain someone is there and sure enough you see the flare of a match in a dark corner where someone is lighting a cigarette have you ever played hideandseek where youre it and when youre searching for the other kids you get this feeling right between the shoulder blades that someone is watching you and when you look round again one of them is there i mean not the sixth sense which you already know you possess but just a sort of gut feeling darcy nodded and harry continued well just as you sense the presence of living people so i sense the dead i know when im in the company of dead men which is why i can tell you definitely that ken layard isnt even if i could still speak to the dead i couldnt have spoken to ken for hes not dead oh hes not alive either but something in between hes undead in thrall to some other and hell rise up again as a vampire unless we make sure hes put down forever thats what he was saying to me in my dream what he was begging me to do find him finish him put him down again darcy nodded and when he and trevor couldnt get through to you the real dead relayed their message right right said harry they tried to spell it out for me in stone right there in my garden sandra shuddered god but i just might have defied wellesley harry i might have been there with you when he came after you also when they came after him she shook her head i dont think i could bear it to have seen those things he reached out to clasp her hand across the table theyre not just things he said they were living people once and now theyre dead people why most of the soil and sand and sky and sea oh or covering this entire planet was alive one time or another its the nature of things and lifes a stage we go through but the dead think enough of me to transcend the natural order of things and transcending the natural makes them supernatural this from darcy i suppose it does said harry turning his soulful eyes on him but didnt we think of vampires as being supernatural once upon a time and at last he allowed himself a genuine smile however wan you know darcy for the head of ebranch youre hellish sceptical i mean isnt this what its always been about gadgets and ghosts the physical and the metaphysical the natural and the supernatural im not sceptical said darcy for ive seen too much for that its just that i like things sorted out thats all and have i sorted things out for you i suppose you have so where do we go from here we go nowhere we examine what we know take a stab at what we dont know and we try to prepare for whats coming but frankly if i were you two id simply back right out of it what darcy wondered if his hearing was all right you and sandra you should climb right aboard the next flight for home go back to ebranch and utilize whatever powers are available to you from that end we should play it like we played the bodescu business lowkey until we know what were dealing with darcy shook his head were in it together i can get the branch jackedup from right here maybe id better remind you falling in harms way isnt a habit of mine my guardian angel and anyway what can you do on your own sandra was right harry youre an exnecroscope you dont have it any more where talents are concerned you no longer figure and as you yourself pointed out what happened in bonnyrig was entirely coincidental the dead wont be there to help you out every time so lets face it of the three of us youre the weakest it isnt that you dont need us more that we dont need you harry stared at him you need my expertise he said and ive already stated the possible danger to sandra she really shouldnt be anywhere near me and and abruptly he paused but too late for the damage was done he never had been much good at subterfuge near you she said what does that mean harry it was her turn to trap his hand he sighed looked away finally said look we have a vampire here possibly of the old guard but in any case not too far removed from the original strain the wamphyri themselves and like i keep telling you if only youd listen the wamphyri have powers sandra you looked in jordans head and there was this thing in there torturing him questioning him specifically about us by now he probably knows all there is to know about ebranch and how we dealt with what thibor ferenczy left behind and yulian bodescu and hell anything he wants to know but more especially hell know about me if not now soon and then hell come for me he cant afford not to for hell know his covers blown im harry keogh the necroscope and im dangerous ive killed vampires ive caused vampire sources to be rooted out and destroyed and locked away in my brain somewhere i have the secrets of dead speak and the mцbius continuum of course hell come for me and for you two if youre with me now darcy ok you have your talent which protects you but youre still a man flesh and blood you were born and you can die and remember this thing knows about your talent if theres a way to dispose of you or even better to use you hell find it but surely thats my big advantage darcy argued i already know how to kill him oh said harry and how will you find him and if and when you do do you think hell lie still for you to stake him out man he wont wait for you to find him hell come looking for you for us look ill say it again compared to this yulian bodescu was a bumbling amateur then ill call in all the help i can get from ebranch i can have ten of our best out here by tomorrow noon call them in to be slaughtered harrys frustration was growing turning to anger with people as special and intelligent as these two still he had to explain these things as if they were children for compared to the wamphryi they were children and just as innocent but cant you see darcy he tried again they dont know him they dont know who or where he is sandra spoke up displaying all of her innocence and lack of experience for anyone to see then its a game of hideandseek she said well keep our heads down and let him make his play or close him in through a system of elimination or we can use our locators darcy cut in like we did with bodescu and he paused abruptly and his scalp tingled and jesus he said giving a nervous start as something of the enormity of the problem and something of its true horror suddenly hit him and our locators he said again so that now sandra too caught on oh my god she said harry nodded and allowed himself to flop slowly back in his chair i see were starting to think he said almost without sarcasm locators a terrific idea darcy except our enemy has fixed it so he may soon have a locator of his own yes and ken layards one of the best there is the food arrived gloomy and thoughtful darcy and sandra only toyed with theirs harry tucked his away in short order lit one of his very rare cigarettes started on the coffee darcy silent for some time said if it comes to it we may have to burn ken ourselves harry nodded you can see why i was in a hurry im a fool sandra said suddenly i feel such a fool some of the utterly stupid things ive said no youre not a fool harry shook his head dont put yourself down youre just loyal brave and human you could no more think like a vampire than you could think like a cockroach thats what it boils down to being as devious as they are but dont think thats a bonus believe me it isnt you can make yourself sick trying to think like they do anyway said darcy i agree with you sandra has to get out of this yes harry nodded and never should have been in except there was no way we could know until we got here he turned to her you must be able to see love how hampered wed be oh darcy will get by ok he always has but i wouldnt even be able to think straight with you around id be forever worrying about what you might bump into sandra thought its the first time hes called me love in a day or two it felt like a long time anyway but the wait had been worth it and what would i do she said sit around back home and hope for the best darcy shook his head no youd coordinate ebranchs efforts in my absence with wellesley out of the picture and me over here things are bound to be tight but you have firsthand knowledge of our situation so youll be invaluable as our liaison man or woman also youll be kept fully in the picture day to day on whats happening in fact youll probably have so much on your plate that there wont be time to worry about harry and harry said hes right you know she looked at them then looked away well ill say one thing for it at least i wont have to worry about things like like burning poor ken darcy looked at harry how about it how long do we have before it will only come to that dealing with it ourselves if the local authorities dont get a move on harry answered but out here because of the heat and such i should think theyre normally pretty smart off the mark darcy frowned but is there no official deadline god what a pun i mean before things start to get problematic you mean when does he get up and walk right harry shook his head no theres no official deadline how long did it take george lake yulian bodescus uncle three days and nights darcy answered at once they had just enough time to bury him before he was digging his way out again oh dont said sandra her eyes bright with horror harry looked at her felt sorry for her but had to continue anyway lake was textbook he said but i dont think there are any strict rules none id trust anyway he sat up straighter and looked around but you know i was just thinking for tourists we must look pretty miserable anyway this place is filling up now i suggest we get back to the villa lets face it i could be wrong about the value of crowds we could be just as safe there as we are here and whichever we still have to make our plans and make the villa secure on their way back they were mainly silent this far out from the centre of rhodes and this early in the season things werent so busy there was plenty of traffic on the roads heading for the bright lights but the sidewalks were almost empty with the sea flat and shining on their right beyond the promenade and the milky way strewn like the dust of diamonds across the sky it might have been very romantic in other circumstances but as they walked the pebble path to their door even the plaintive repetitive molten silver calling of small greek owls couldnt lift their mood as soon as they were inside darcy went upstairs to check the windows while harry tended to the downstairs windows and back door both doors were solid with strong locks and good bolts all the windows were fitted with shutters externally and thief locks internally couldnt be better said darcy as they got together again around a table in the sittingroom oh it could be harry contradicted him remind me tomorrow to buy some garlic of course darcy nodded you know id forgotten that entirely its so much a part of the fiction that it slipped my mind its also part of the fact garlic harry repeated yes on sunside the travellers call it kneblasch thats the root of its name in earths languages too its the german knoblauch and the gypsy gnarblez he grinned tiredly and without humour another piece of useless information useless said sandra i think its as well if you give us all the useless information you can harry shrugged you can get a lot of it out of darcys fiction but if thats what you want and he shrugged again but warned except you must always remember nothing is certain not with a vampire and no one myself included knows everything there is to know about them what everything i dont know a tenth of it but i do know that the closer you get to the source to the original wamphyri stock the more effective the various poisons become garlic sickens them its stink offends as ordure offends us even makes them ill on starside lardis lidesci smears his weapons with oil of garlic a vampire struck with a weapon treated that way arrow knife or sword whatever will suffer hideously often the infected member must be shed and another grown in its place darcy and sandra looked at each other aghast but they said nothing then theres silver harry continued poison to them like mercury or lead is to us which reminds me we should be on the lookout for a couple of these fancy greek paperknives in silver or silverplate darcy you saw those bolts i packed with my crossbow theyre of hardwood rubbed with garlic oil tipped with silver and please dont ask me if im serious on starside the travellers swear by these things and stay alive by them starside darcy thought staring at harry the alien parallel world of the vampires hes seen it been there and returned hes had all that and now he sits here entirely human and vulnerable and tries to explain these things to us and somehow he doesnt get angry with us and somehow he doesnt crack up and rant and rave and he never quits vampires said sandra and felt herself thrilling to the word even knowing she loathed it tell us about them harry oh i know its all in the files back at ebranch hq in london but its different coming from you you know so much about them and yet you say you know so little ill tell you the several sure things i know about them said harry theyre devious beyond the imagination of human beings theyre liars each and every one who on almost every occasion would rather lie than tell the truth unless theres something of substantial value in it for them theyre expert in confusing any argument adept at ambiguous and frustrating riddles wordgames puzzles and paradoxes false similes and parallels theyre insanely jealous secretive proud possessive and as for their grip on life or undeath they are the most tenacious creatures in or out of creation their source lies in the vampire swamps east and west of the central mountain range that divides starside from sunside the legend is that at times they emerge as monstrous slugs or leeches to fasten on men and beasts as to what degree of intelligence they possess at that stage who can say but their tenacity is there from square one they live on the blood of the host and form a horrific symbiosis with him the host is changed materially and mentally sexless the vampire adopts the sex of its host and it fosters in him or in her that lust for blood which eventually will sustain both of them i said that the host is altered materially thats true a vampires flesh is different from ours it has within itself the power of regeneration lose a finger an arm or leg and given time the vampire will replace them thats not as weird as it sounds a starfish does it even better cut a starfish up and throw it back in the sea each part will grow a whole new animal likewise a gecko losing its tail or the segmented cestode or tapeworm of men but a vampire is no cestode worm lesk the glut an insane wamphyri lord lost an eye in battle and caused another to grow on his shoulder as the vampire matures within its host so that hosts strength and endurance increase enormously likewise his emotions except for love whose concept is alien to the wamphyri all other passions become a rage hate lust the urge to war to rape to torture and destroy all peers or opponents but such evils as these are tempered by the vampires desire for secrecy anonymity for he knows that if he is discovered men wont rest until hes destroyed that last applies specifically in this world of course for in their own they are or were the lords they were until the dweller and i brought their reign to ruin but even before that there were certain traveller tribes who would kill them if and when they could my son and i we didnt destroy them all sometimes i wish we had so when did they first come here how and where did they arrive the first of them in this world who knows there have been vampires in all mans legends where is far easier in ancient dacia in romani and moldova in wallachia which is all one and the same romania to you on or close to the danube theres a gate there a tunnel between dimensions but mercifully inaccessible or very nearly so i used it when i went to starside but that was before harry jnr stripped me of my talents harry sat back and sighed time and its events were catching up with him he looked very tired now but nevertheless asked what else however morbid sandra couldnt resist the fascination of harrys subject what of their lifecycles their longevity when i read the ebranch files it all seemed so fantastic and you say their origin is the swamps but what about before that how did they get there in the first place thats like asking what came first the chicken or the egg said harry the swamps are their place thats all why are there aborigines in australia how come we only find komodo lizards in komodo as for their lifecycles they start in the swamps as great leeches thats how i understand it anyway they transfer to men or beasts usually wolves and incidentally its a theory of mine that the werewolf of myth is in fact a vampire why not it lives on raw red flesh and its bite can create another werewolf cant it of course for the bite is the passing of the egg which carries the codes of both wolf and vampire suddenly harrys haunted look became more haunted yet my god he whispered shaking his head in wonderment and every time i think of that i cant help thinking of my son where is he now i wonder still on starside a vampire lord what is he now that child of brenda and me for harrys vampire came from a wolf for long moments his soulful eyes were fogged distant lost but then he blinked stirred himself came back to the present point in space and time and their lifecycles he cleared his throat and continued very well so far weve traced the cycle from a swampleech to a parasite in a human or animal host but i called the partnership a symbiosis and as youll appreciate that calls for give and take on both sides well the parasite gets his keep and learns from the mind of his host and the host gets the vampires healing powers his protoflesh his skills for survival and of course his longevity eventually the vampire will weld itself to its hosts interior it will become part of him utterly inseparable the two parts even the brains will slowly merge and become one but in the early days the parasite retains a certain individuality if an immature vampire senses extreme inescapable danger to its host it may even attempt to flee him dragosanis vampire did just that when i destroyed him but to no avail i destroyed it too a tremor had entered harrys softspoken voice and the gauntness was back in his face it was a hagridden expression and hard to define at least until he continued or again an immature vampire may be driven out from its host if you know the way but always with with disastrous results to the host and now they knew he was talking about the lady karen and understood his mood he saw the looks on their faces and moved quickly on where was i oh yes the lifecycle well you might be tempted to think that the rest of it is the weirdest of all but is it really have a look at the amphibia the frogs and newts or moths and butterflies or if youre happy to stick with parasites how about the liver fluke theres a horror if ever there was but what makes the vampire worse is his evil intelligence and the fact that in the end his will is ascendant dominant stronger than that of his host so you see it isnt really give and take at all but total submission and then theres the egg faethor ferenczy passed on his egg to thibor the wallach by way of a kiss he hooked the thing up out of his throat onto his forked tongue and thrust it down thibors throat and from that moment forward thibor warrior that he was was doomed staked and chained and buried undead for five hundred years thibor put forth a protoflesh tendril and dropped his egg on the back of dragosanis neck the thing entered like quicksilver passed through dragosanis flesh and fastened to his spine without even leaving a mark and so dragosani too was doomed now faethor was wamphyri he gave thibor his egg and so he became wamphyri yes and so would dragosani be wamphyri if i hadnt put an end to him the egg then carries the true wamphyri strain only the egg and it may be passed on through a kiss through intercourse or simply hurled at its target host so dragosani was informed by thibor ferenczy himself the old thing in the ground except thibor like all vampires was a liar why the old devil barely touched the undeveloped foetus of yulian bodescu and the child was corrupted and vampirized before he was even born and he had all the stigmata of the wamphyri every sign and symptom yes including the ultimate vampire skill of shapechanging yulian was wamphyri but would he have developed an egg of his own i dont know its entirely paradoxical which is only what youd expect of them and harry fell silent sandra and darcy had sat and listened in a sort of stupefaction to all of this but now when it seemed harry was done darcy took it up their varieties are equally baffling he said it seems bodescu infected his mother with a small piece of himself we dont know what sort of piece or how but hell i cant say im sorry about that he grew something monstrous in the cellars of harkley house an unbelievable thing that murdered one of our espers and he grew it from one of his own wisdom teeth this mindless protoflesh thing he used it to infect his uncle his aunt and cousin it seems he vampirized all of them in as many different ways even his damned dog harry nodded slowly and said yes all of that and its still not the half of it darcy the wamphyri of starside had skills which the vampires of earth our earth seem to have forgotten thank god they could take flesh traveller flesh trog flesh and given time shape it to their will ive talked about or mentioned gasbeasts which they breed for the methane they produce but they make warriors too which you wouldnt believe even if you saw one ive seen one darcy reminded him on film said harry yes but you havent seen one falling towards you out of the sky every inch of it armoured and lethally equipped and you havent seen the bony cartilage creatures they design specifically for the skins ligaments and skeletons with which they extend and provision their aeries and god youve neither seen nor could imagine their siphoneers sandra closed her eyes held up her hand and gasped no shed read about the things called siphoneers in the keogh files and this was something she really didnt want to hear from harry she knew about the great placid flaccid things in the heights of the vampire towers how their living veins hung down through hundreds of yards of hollow bone pipes to siphon up water from the wells and she knew too how all of these creatures and beasts had once been human before vampire metamorphosis and no she said again yes said darcy sandras right and perhaps this was the wrong time to go through all of this anyway god knows i shant sleep harry nodded i rarely sleep he answered peacefully and as if they had already agreed it though in fact it hadnt been mentioned they carried three single beds out of the bedrooms into the large livingroom and set them up there around the central table and prepared to sleep in the same room together it might not be entirely civilized but it was safest harry brought out his crossbow from a holdall assembled it and fitted a bolt he placed the loaded weapon between his and darcys bed on the floor close to the table where they werent likely to step on it then while the others used the bathroom to prepare for bed in their turn he stretched out in an armchair and drew a blanket up over himself if he became uncomfortable later he could always stretch out on his bed then and in the darkness and quiet of the room where only a haze of grey light came in through the louvres darcy yawned and asked what plans for tomorrow harry to see to ken layard harry answered without hesitation to get sandra on a plane for home and to see what can be done for trevor jordan we should try to get him out of here as soon as possible to distance him from the vampire should be to lessen the things influence again i suppose its up to the local authorities and what they say but lets deal with all that in the morning right now i think ill be happy just to make it through the night oh im sure we will said darcy you feel easy then easy hardly that but there doesnt seem to be anything bothering me especially good said harry and youre a very handy man to have around darcy clarke sandra said nothing already she was asleep harry did in fact sleep he caught brief troubled snatches of sleep in a series of short naps never more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time for the first few hours anyway but in the wee small hours his exhaustion caught up with him and his sleep grew deeper and now the dead no longer able to communicate with his conscious mind could at least try to get through to him the first was his mother whose voice came to him from far away faint as a whisper in the winds of dream haaarry are you sleeping son why dont you answer me harry i i cant ma he gasped expecting to feel his brain squeezed in a moment and acid poured on the nerves of his mind you know that if i try to talk to you hes going to hurt me not him but what he did to me but you are speaking to me son its just that youve forgotten again thats all its only when youre awake that we cant speak but nothing to stop us when youre only dreaming youve nothing to fear from me harry you know id never hurt you not deliberately i i remember now said harry still not quite sure but whats the use anyway i wont remember what you tell me when i wake up i never do im forbidden to ah but ive found ways round that before harry and i can try to do it again i dont quite know how for i sense youre a long way away from me but i can always try or if not me perhaps some of your other friends ma he was fearful now you have to tell them to stop that youve no idea the pain they can cause me the trouble they can get me in and i have enough problems right now without adding to them oh i know you have son i know she answered but there are problems and there are problems and the solution is sometimes different we dont want you to go solving them in the wrong way thats all do you understand but in his sleep he didnt understand only that he was dreaming and that someone who loved him was trying her best to help him however mistakenly however misguided ma he said suddenly angry with her and with all of them i really wish youd try to understand you have to get it through your head that youre putting me in danger you and the rest of the dead all of you its like you were trying to kill me oh harry she gasped harry i and he knew she was ashamed of him now how can you say a thing like that son kill you heavens no were trying to keep you alive ma i haaarry she was fading away again going back where she belonged as faint and distant as a forgotten name on the tip of your tongue which wont shape itself no matter how hard you try but then in another moment her deadspeak signal strengthened and he focussed on her again and you see son she said we dont worry too much about you that way any more its no longer so painful to us to think that one day you might die we know you will for it comes to us all and through you weve come to understand that death isnt really as black as its painted but between life and death theres another state harry and weve been warned that youre straying too close undeath it was his turn to gasp as suddenly his dream turned sharp as reality warned by whom oh she answered there are many talents among the dead son there are those you can speak to and trust without fearing their words and others you should never ever speak to at times youve moved without caution harry but this time one evil lost to dark as forever her deadspeak was breaking up fading dissolving but what shed been saying was important he was sure ma he called after her into the gathering mists of dream ma haaaaarrry her answer was the faintest echo diminishing and gone then something touched harrys face he started and sat up a little in his armchair and wha he gasped as he came halfawake was that a fluttering just then had something disturbed the air of the room shhh sandra mumbled from her bed somewhere in the darkness you were dreaming about your mother again harry remembered where he was and what he was doing here and listened for a moment to the rooms darkness and silence and in a little while he asked are you awake no she answered do you want me to be he shook his head before realizing she couldnt see him then whispered no go to sleep and as he himself sank down again in dreams once more he felt that faint fanning of the air but sleep had already claimed him and he ignored it this time the voice came from the heart of a fog which rolled up out of harrys dreams as dank and clinging as any fog hed known in the waking world it was clear that voice however distant its signal was fixed and true but it was dark too and deep and grinding and sepulchral as the bells of hell it came out of the fog and seemed to surround harry pressing in on his necroscope mind from all sides ahhh beloved of the dead it said and harry recognized it at once and so i have found you despite the misguided efforts of those who would protect you from a very old very dead very harmless thing faethor harry answered faethor ferenczy and haaarry keeooogh crooned the other his voice seething but you do me honour harry with this stress which you place upon my name is this awe which i sense in you do you tremble before the power i once represented or is it something else fear perhaps but how so what fear in one who was always so fearless now tell me what has changed you my son no son of yours faethor harry at once answered with something of his old spirit my name is clean dont try to taint it ahhh smiled the gurgling hissing monstrous thing in his mind but thats better so much better to be on familiar termsss what is it you want faethor harry was suspicious careful is it that youve heard the dead whispering of my fix and so youve come to taunt me your fix faethor feigned surprise but not so much as to disguise his oozing sarcasm you are in a fix but is it possible with so many friends with all the teeming dead to advise and guide you even dreaming harry was well versed in the ways of vampires even the harmless expired variety faethor he said im sure you know well enough the problem but since youve asked ill state it anyway im necroscope no longer except in my dreams so enjoy my predicament all you can for awake its a pleasure youll never know such bitterness said faethor and there i thought we were friends you and i friends harry felt inclined to laughter but controlled it better not to antagonize one of these unduly not even one as surely dead and gone forever as faethor in what way friends the dead are my friends as youve pointed out and to them youre an abomination and so you deny me said the other and the cock not yet crowed three times that is a great blasphemy harry cried and he sensed faethors vile yawning grin but of course it is for i am a great blasphemy haaarry in the eyes of some in the eyes of all said harry in the eyes of sanity itself faethor and with finality now leave me if youve done with mocking there must be better things to dream your memory is short the other now snarled when you sought advice you came to me and did i turn you away who was it destroyed your enemy in the mountains of the khorvaty you aided me because to do so suited your own ends and for no other reason you assisted me in order to strike at thibor and so avenge yourself a second time even from the grave you tossed down ivan gerenko from the cliffs guarding your castle because he had caused it to be destroyed you did nothing for me in fact and as i see it now you used me more than i used you so faethor snapped not quite the fool i thought little wonder you prevailed harry keogh but even if what you say is true still you must admit that the advantage was mutual and now harry knew that the old vampire wasnt here simply to mock no there was more to it than that that much was made perfectly obvious by faethors manner of expression his use of the words mutual and advantage and harry wondered would their conversation now prove mutually advantageous what did the monster want and perhaps more importantly what was he willing to exchange for it only one way to find out out with it faethor said harry what is it you want from me shame on you said the other you know how i like a good argument the persuasion of unassailable logic the deft manipulation of words the skilful haggling before a bargain is struck would you deny me these simple pleasures spit it out faethor said harry tell me what you want and also what its worth to you and only then if i can deliver and still live with myself only then lets talk about bargains bah the other answered but was equally quick to follow up very well and without more ado have heard it from the dead that you are come upon hard times yes i admit it i knew that you had been stripped of your powers oh its true i am a pariah among the dead but sometimes when they talk it pleases me to overhear what is saidmuch has been said about you harry keogh and i have overheard it not only are you forbidden to deadspeak but you no longer command the facility of instantaneous transportation this is all true yes so now i know nothing of this teleportation and so in that sphere may not help you it involves numbers i believe the simultaneous resolution of myriad complicated equations and in that i admit to a failing i am out of touch by a thousand years and even in my heyday was never much of a mathematician but as for the question of deadspeak there we might come to some agreement harry tried not to show his eagerness an agreement you think you can return it to me you dont know what youre saying experts have handled my case in my waking hours i can no more speak to the dead than pour acid in my ears that is i can but the result would be the same i know for ive tried it once and also because it was forced upon me once so said faethor again and i have also heard it whispered by the dead that this mischief was worked upon you by your own son in a world other than this world astonishing so you found your way there did you aye and suffered the consequences faethor said harry get to the point the point is simple only the wamphyri could so interfere with your mind and even then only one of their most powerful it was the art of fascination hypnotism as used by a great master of that art which crippled you harry keogh ah and i pride myself that i too was just such a master youre saying that you can cure me faethor chuckled darkly for he knew as well as harry himself that the exnecroscope was hooked what is written may be erased he said as you now appreciate but just as surely what is set askew may be put to rights only put yourself in my hands and it shall be done harry shrank back put myself in your hands let you into my mind as dragosani once let thibor into his do you think im mad think you are desperate faethor i now listen to me the longextinct vampire interrupted have spoken of mutual advantage and of the dead whispering in their tombs but some of them do more than merely whisper in the mountains of the metalici and zarundului there are those who cry out in their very terror of that which is risen up for not even the centuriesdead not even their bones and their dust are safe from this one aye and i know his name and i deem myself responsible and now harry was hooked more surely than ever but like a fish on a line he intended to give the vampire a good run for his money faethor he said youre saying that one of the wamphyri has come among us but i already knew this wheres the advantage in that was i supposed to deliver my mind into your hands for such a scrap as this you do think im mad no i think you are dedicated to the eradication of what you term a foulness you would destroy it before it destroys you you would do it for the safety and sanity of your world and i would do it solely for my satisfaction for i hated this one even as i hated thibor who was he harry shot the question hoping against hope to catch the other out and read the answer in his startled mind but faethor only tuttutted and harry sensed a saddened disappointed shake of his head no need for that my son he said oh so quietly for ill gladly tell you his name why not for you wont remember it when you awaken his name his most hated despised name was janos and such was the venom in his voice that harry knew it was true your son he sighed nodding your second son after thibor janos ferenczy so now at least i know who im up against if not what the who of it is janos said faethor and without my help the what of it will destroy you utterly then tell me about him harry answered tell me all you can of him and ill try to do the rest youve bargained well i cant refuse you again faethor chuckled and indeed your memory is short he said it will last only as long as your dream harry saw that it was true and his frustration turned to anger then what has been the point did you only come to mock me after all not at all i came to seal a bargain and it is sealed you will come to me where you know i lie and we shall speak again but the next time youll remember but i wont even remember this time harry cried out ah but you will you will faethors fading voice came echoing out of the rolling fog youll remember something of it at least for ive seen to it harry ive seen to it haaarry keeooogh harry someone stood beside him bent over him harry sandras urgent hand was on his arm and darcy clarke hurrying to answer a banging at the door where manolis papastamos was shouting to be let in and a feeble dawn light struggling to find cracks in the louvres harry leaped awake lurched upright like a drunkard and almost overturned his chair but sandra was there to support him he held her close and in another moment darcy and manolis were in the room a terrible thing a terrible thing manolis kept repeating as darcy opened a window and shutters to let in the pale light of a newly dawning day but as the room sprang to life so manoliss jaw fell open and he pointed a trembling hand at a huge greek tapestry covering the better part of one entire wall the tapestry was moving god almighty darcy gasped as sandra clung to harry more tightly yet the tapestry was a panorama of banded blue sky over brown mountains and white villages but printed on the sky in letters eighteen inches high was a name faethor and it was printed in fur that crawled already harrys dream was forgotten but he would never in a lifetime forget his waking conversations with this father of vampires faethor he gasped the word out loud and as if it were some word of power the name at once broke up the legend written on the tapestry into a hundred individual bats no bigger than winged mice they released their hold on the fabric and whirled around the room once before escaping through the open window and so its true said manolis papastamos white and trembling the first to regain command of his senses it all comes together i had thought ken layard and trevor jordan were the strange policemen and you three stranger still but of course because you hunt the strange criminal sandra caught a telepathic glimpse of his mind and knew that he knew you should have told me from the beginning he said flopping down into a chair i am a greek and some of us understand these things do you manolis said darcy do you oh yes said the other nodding your criminal your murderer he is the vrykoulakas he is the vampire cat and mouse i understand why you didnt trust me said papastamos but you should have what you think the greeks are ignorant of these things greeks of all people listen i was a boy in phaestos on the island of crete born and lived there until i was thirteen then i went to my sister in athens but i never forgot the myths of the islands and i never forgot what i saw and heard there did you know that there are places in greece even now where they put the silver coins on the eyes of the dead to keep them closed hah those slits in the eyes of layard he kept opening his eyes darcy said to him manolis how could we know if you took a hundred people and told them you were hunting a vampire how many do you think would believe you here in greece in the greek islands ten or twenty the other answered not the young peoples no but the old ones who remember and up in the mountains in the mountain villages of karpathos for example or crete or better still in santorin maybe seventyfive out of a hundred because the old ways die hard in such places dont you know where you are just look at a map six hundred miles away is romania and do you think the romanian peoples dont know the vrykoulakas the vampire no no we are not the innocent childrens my friends very well said harry lets waste no more time you know you understand you believe we accept that but still we warn you that myths and legends can be very different from the real thing im not so sure manolis shook his head and in any case i have had the experience of the real thing when i was a boy thirty years ago there was a sickness the children were growing weak an old priest had lived on the island in a remote place in the stony hills he had lived there all alone for many years he said he was alone for his sins and dared not surround himself with the people recently he had been found dead in his place and they had buried him there but now the village priest went there with the people with the fathers of the sick children and dug him up they found him fat and red and smiling and how did they deal with him i heard it later with a wooden spear through the heart i cannot be sure no but that night there was a big bonfire in the hills and its light was seen for miles around i think we should tell manolis everything said sandra we will harry nodded but first he came here to tell us something ah manolis gave a start and stood up my god but now this vampire you hunt there are two of them harry groaned ken layard of course the poor ken this morning one hour ago i get the call it is the morgue they have found the naked body of a mortician he is dead with a broken neck and ken layards body has disappeared and then he spoke directly to harry then i remember what you say about layard being undead and that you want him burned very quickly and then i know but this is not all go on manolis darcy prompted him the samothraki has been absent from the harbour since the night of the trouble under the old windmills when i saved layard from the sea this morning the fishermen have brought in many pieces of burned wreckage it is it was the samothraki and still there is more a girl a prostitute died on the streets three four nights ago she has been examined the doctor says it could have been anything not eating the how do you say malnutrition or perhaps she fainted and lay in the alley all night and so died of the exposure but most likely it is the anaemia hah you know this anaemia no blood in the body my god anaemia like a plague harry groaned she must be burned too she will be manolis promised today believe me i will see to it sandra said and still were no closer to discovering who the vampire is or what hes done to ken and i for one would like to know how those bats got in here harry indicated a domed woodburning fireplace where its flue went up into a brick wall at least theres no great mystery there he said as to layard hes now in thrall to this thing and depending how strong his will is serving it faithfully and the vampires identity well theres a clue i can follow up i think i may know someone who has the answer what clue manolis faced him any clue all clues are for me no more secrets also i want to know about that word the bats made on the wall what did it mean thats the clue said harry faethor fixed it so that i couldnt mistake his meaning he wants me to go and see him frowning manolis looked from face to face this faethor who fixes such things and in such a way he is what no more secrets said harry wrily and manolis even if we had an entire day to waste still we couldnt tell you everything and even you wouldnt believe it all if we did try me manolis answered but in the car first you dress and i take you to breakfast then to the police station in town i think is the safest place and meanwhile you tell me everything very well we will darcy agreed but we must be allowed to get on with this thing in our own way and manolis we have to be sure that all of this will go no further than you anything you say the other nodded and anything i can help you with i will you are the experts but please we are wasting the time hurry now they got dressed as quickly as they could by midmorning their plans were finalized and by noon manolis papastamos had set them in action once hed known what was to be done he wasted little time doing it harry keogh was now the owner of a suitably worn and wellthumbed greek passport stamped with a visa for romania ostensibly its bearer was an international dealer in antiques one hari kiokis a name which shouldnt give him too much trouble sandra had been fixed up with a flight to gatwick london leaving rhodes at that night and darcy would stay here and work with manolis ebranch had been put as completely in the picture as possible but for now darcy hadnt called in any esper help first he must ascertain the size of the problem and after that hed call on help as required and available directly through sandra harrys flight to bucharest via athens was at with an hour to spare he and the others had lunch on the high balcony of a taverna overlooking mandraki harbour and it was there that one of the local policemen found them with information for papastamos the man was fat and sweaty scarred and bowlegged if he hadnt been a policeman then he wouldve had to be a brigand he arrived in the road below their balcony on a tiny moped which his huge backside almost entirely obscured hey papastamos he shouted waving a fat arm hey manolis come on up manolis called down to him have a beer cool down you wont feel so cool in a minute inspector the other called back entering the taverna and panting his way upstairs when he arrived manolis offered him a chair said what is it the other got his breath back and in wheezing greek told his story down at the mortuary at the hospital he began we were recording statements about the missing corpse he glanced at manoliss company and quickly shrugged his apologies in the greek fashion i mean about the circumstances in the case of your dead english friend we took statements from everybody like you said there was this girl a receptionist who was on duty the night you saved his life she said in her statement that someone went to see him in the early hours of the morning it was her description of this one that i found interesting here read it yourself he took a crumpled sweatstained official statement form from his shirt pocket and handed it over manolis quickly translated what hed been told then read the statement he read it a second time more thoroughly and his forehead creased into a frown and listen to this he said reading aloud it must have been about sixthirty in the morning when this man came in he said he was a captain and one of his crew had gone missing hed heard how someone had been rescued from the sea and wondered if it was his man i took him to see mr layard in his room where he was sedated the captain said ah no this one is not mine i have troubled you for nothing i began to turn away but he didnt follow me when i looked back he was standing with his hand on the bump on layards head and he said this poor man such an ugly wound still i am glad he is not one of mine i said he must not touch the patient and showed him out it was strange although he had said he was sorry for layard still he was smiling a very peculiar smile harry had slowly straightened up in his chair as he listened to this and now he asked and the description manolis read it out and mused a seacaptain very tall slim strange and wearing dark glasses even in the dawn light i think i think i know this one the fat policeman nodded i think so too he said and when we were watching that fleapit the dakaris we saw him come out of there hah manolis thumped the table the dakaris its a spit away from where they found that poor whore and at once im sorry sandra who is he harry demanded eh manolis looked at him who oh ill do even better than that and show you where there he is and he pointed out across the harbour the sleek white motorcruiser was slicing her way out of the harbour through the deepwater channel but the distance wasnt so great that harrys keen eyes couldnt read her name the lazarus he breathed and the name of the owner the same almost said manolis jianni lazarides jianni harrys face was suddenly drawn lined grey johnny manolis shrugged john harry echoed him and in the back of his mind another voice or the memory of one said janos ahhhr harry clasped his head as pain lanced through his skull it was sharp but short nothing so bad as a fullscale attack a mere warning but it confirmed his worst suspicions for janos could only be a name hed learned from the dead perhaps from faethor himself with whom conversation had been forbidden he unscrewed his eyes and let in the cruel sunlight and the concerned expressions of his friends and i know him he said when he could speak and now i know im right to go and see faethor but why if we already know our man darcy asked because we dont know him well enough harry told him as the pain quickly subsided and since faethor spawned him hes the one most likely to know how to deal with him nothing has changed said harry as they drove into the airport in the car manolis had provided everything stands i go to ploiesti to see if i can learn anything from faethor ill spend the entire night there even sleep in the ruins of his place if i have to its the only sure way i can think of to contact him sandra goes back home tonight definitely now that this lazarides janos ferenczy controls ken layard he can locate anyone he wants to anyone associated with me will be in danger and more especially so here in the vampires own territory he paused and looked into each face in turn then continued darcy you stay here with manolis dig up everything you can on lazarides his crew and the lazarus go right back to the start of it when they first appeared on the scene manolis can be of real assistance there since janos has chosen himself a greek identity it shouldnt be too hard for the greek authorities to fill in his origins and background ah said manolis looking at harry in his driving mirror one other thing he has dual nationality this one greek yes and romanian oh my god sandra gasped at once and harry he can travel freely where you may only go with extreme caution harry pursed his lips thought about it for a moment and said well and maybe i should have expected as much but that doesnt change anything either by the time he knows im there and if he tries to come after me ill be out again anyway ive no choice god i feel so helpless manolis complained as he parked the car and they all climbed out inside a voice says arrest this monster aboard his ship but i know that this is impossible i understand we must not alert him until we know all about him also ken is in his hands and save it about ken harry cut in heading for the departure lounge theres nothing anyone can do for him he turned his haunted eyes on manolis except destroy him which would be a mercy and even then dont expect him to thank you for it thank you god no hell have your heart out first anyway darcy told manolis youre absolutely right that we cant touch him yet weve told you about yulian bodescu he was an innocent a child by comparison with lazarides harry thinks so anyway but once he knew we were onto him we each of us lived in fear of hell until he was finally dead is all academic manolis shrugged what i should go to the government and say send our gunboats to sink a vampire in his ship no quite impossible but when the lazarus puts in to port again i think i may be tempted to take out her crew one by one if you could isolate them positively identify them as vampires and had a good backup team who knew what to do and werent frightened to do it yes said harry but again this might be to tip lazaridess hand which in turn might precipitate something you couldnt even hope to control guiding harry and the others to the passenger control desk manolis answered dont worry about it i do nothing until i get your goahead is frustrating thats all harry had only fifteen minutes to wait before being called forward at the last minute sandra said if wed thought of it i could have gone on with you to athens and flown home from there but things have happened so quickly i i dont like seeing you go off like this on your own harry he held her very close and kissed her then turned to darcy and manolis listen im coming back i promise you but if i should be delayed go ahead and finish things as best you can and good luck thats my middle name darcy told him take care of yourself harry sandra hugged him again and then he stood back nodded turned and followed the crowd out onto the dusty concourse towards the landing strip among the many people there to see friends off a man in flipflops bright bermuda shorts and an opennecked white shirt watched harrys plane take off he was a greek who ran the occasional errand for the russians now all he had to do was discover harrys destination and pass it on not too difficult his brother worked at the passenger information desk harry made his athens connection and landed in bucharest at the airport and its perimeter were thick with lightly armed soldiers in greygreen shirts drab olive trousers and scuffed boots but their presence seemed pointless and the men themselves aimless this was a duty of long standing out of which nothing had ever come they didnt expect anything to come out of it and in all honesty werent much interested they were there because theyd been told to be as harry passed through customs the official stamping passports scarcely looked at him all eyes were turned towards the three or four members of some foreign delegation or other who were being given redcarpet treatment through the airport and out into the freedom of romania harry reckoned he was lucky manolis had fixed him up with one hundred and fifty american dollars which hed sworn were good as gold he caught a taxi dumped his holdall on the back seat and told the driver ploiesti please eh ploiesti right you english no greek but i dont speak your language and god i hope you dont speak greek hah is funny we are both speaking english yes the man was unkempt and his breath was bad but he seemed amiable enough yes said harry its funny er do you take dollars american he showed him some green eh eh the dollars his eyes stood out sure by gosh i take it ploiesti is i dont know sixty kilometres is er ten dollars are you asking is ten dollars he grinned shrugged fine harry handed over the money now i sleep he said leaning back and closing his eyes he didnt intend to sleep but neither did he want to talk the romanian countryside was boring even in springtime merging with summer there wasnt anything much of green to be seen plenty of browns and greys piles of sand and cement cheap breezeblocks and bricks enough building going on to rival all the coastal regions of spain turkey and the greek islands put together except that this had nothing to do with tourism for there was plenty of wrecking too the grotesque inhuman mechanics of ceausescus agroindustrial policy save money by cramming more and more people under one roof like cattle in pens goodbye to peasant autonomy the picturesque settlements and village life hello to the ugly rearing tower blocks and all the while the reins of political control drawn tighter through eyes threequarters shuttered harry scanned the land as it sped by beyond the windows of the car the roadside en route from bucharest to ploiesti looked like a landscape in the aftermath of war bulldozers worked in teams in the poisonous blue haze of their rumbling exhausts erasing small farming communities wholesale to fashion empty muddy acres in their place while other machines stood idle or exhausted alongside huge iron diggers with their bucket heads lifted and stretching forward almost as if watching and where once there were villages now there was only earth and rubble and desolation more than ten thousand villages in old romania harrys driver perhaps sensing that he was still awake told him out of the corner of his mouth but old president nicholae reckons thats about five thousand too many what a madman why hed flatten the very mountains if someone would tell him how to go about it harry made no answer continued to nod but he wondered and what of faethors place on the outskirts of ploiesti will ceausescu flatten that too has he perhaps already flattened it if so then how might harry find it again the last time he was here hed come via the mцbius continuum homing in on faethors telepathic voice faethor had spoken to him and harry had tracked him down now was different he would only recognize faethors place know it for sure when he got there as to its precise location he knew only that the birds didnt sing there and that the trees and bushes and brambles grew no flowers developed no fruit for the bees wouldnt go near them the place was in itself faethors tombstone bearing his epitaph which read this creature was death his very existence was a refutation of life wherefore he now lies here where life itself refuses to acknowledge him as the taxi passed a signpost stating that ploiesti lay ten kilometres ahead harry shook himself yawned and pretended to come more properly awake he looked at his driver there were some rich old houses once on the outskirts of ploiesti the homes of the old aristocracy do you know where i mean old houses the man squinted at him aristocracy then the war came and they were bombed harry continued reduced to so much rubble the authorities never touched the place it was left as a sort of memorial until now anyway ah i know it or used to but not on this road no on the old road where it bends now tell me quick is that where you want to go yes someone i know used to live there used to still does as far as i know harry corrected himself hold on said the other hauling his steering wheel hard right they bumped off the road onto a cobbled avenue that wound away at a tangent under huge chestnuts its along here said harrys driver another minute and id passed it and would need to turn around and come back old houses the old aristocracy aye i know it but you came at the right time another year and its gone your friend too they just knock em flat these old places and whoever lives there moves on or gets knocked down with em oh the bulldozers will be here soon enough wait and see half a mile down the road and harry knew that this was it the shells of old buildings began rising left and right behind the chestnuts dilapidated places mainly though a few of the chimneys still smoked and you can drop me here he said getting out of the taxi and picking up his holdall he asked how about buses i mean if i stay with my friend overnight how will i go about getting back into town tomorrow morning walk back to the main road towards bucuresti the other told him cross over onto the right and keep walking every kilometre or so theres a bus stop you cant miss em except dont go offering dollars here youve got some change coming banis my greek friend banis and leu else people will wonder whats up and waving he drove off in a cloud of dust the rest of it was instinct harry just followed his nose he would soon discover hed been a mile or so off target but time and distance were passing quickly enough and he sensed he was walking in the right direction he saw few signs of humanity smoke from distant chimneystacks and an old peasant couple who passed him going in the opposite direction they looked weary to the bone and pushed a cart piled high with sticks of furniture and personal belongings without knowing them or their circumstances still harry felt sorry for them pretty soon he felt hungry and remembering a pack of salami sandwiches and a bottle of german beer in his holdall he left the road through a gate into an ancient cemetery the graveyard didnt bother him on the contrary he felt at home there it was as extensive as it was rundown that old burial ground harry walked through the ranks of leaning untended lichencrusted slabs until he reached the back wall well away from the road the old wall was two feet thick but crumbling in places harry climbed it where its stones had tumbled into steps and found himself a comfortable place to sit the sunlight slanted onto him through the trees reminding him that in just another hour the sun would be down before then he must be at faethors place still he wasnt worried he felt that he must be pretty close eating his sandwiches and draining the sweet lager he looked out over the sea of leaning slabs thered been a time when the occupants of this place wouldnt have given him a minutes peace and when he wouldnt have expected it hed have been among friends here all of them bursting to tell him what theyd been thinking all these years and it wouldnt matter at all that they were romanian for deadspeak like its twin telepathy is universal harry would have understood them perfectly well and to a man theyd understand him ah well that was then and this was now and now he was forbidden to speak with them except he must find a way to speak to faethor as that name crossed his mind so a cloud passed over the sun and the graveyard fell into shade harry shivered and for the first time turned and looked behind him out of the cemetery there were empty fields back there crisscrossed with bramblegrown tracks and paths where the land was humped in places and spotted with ruins and the overgrown scars of old craters were still plainly visible closer to the main road a halfmile away the ground had been made swampy where the bulldozers had been at work interfering with the natural drainage harry scanned the land with the eye of memory superimposing the current scene and the scene remembered and slowly the two pictures merged into one and he knew that the taxi driver had been right another year maybe only a month and he would be too late for one of these crumbling piles was surely faethors and pretty soon the bulldozers would level it too into the earth forever harry shivered again got down from the wall on the other side and made his way from ruin to ruin searching for the right one and as evening turned to twilight he found and knew the place at once just from its feel the birds kept their distance singing their muted evening songs in trees and bushes hundreds of yards away so that they scarcely reached here at all there were no bees or flying insects and the foliage bore neither flower nor fruit even the common spiders kept well clear of faethors last place in all the world it seemed a singular warning and yet one which harry must ignore the place was not exactly as he remembered it the absence of adequate drainage had threaded it with small stagnant streams where every slightest hollow had become a pool a veritable swamp normally it would be alive with mosquitoes but of course it was not at least harry neednt worry about being bitten while he slept but that was a thought he could well do without in the deepening twilight he took out a sleepingbag from his holdall and made down his bed on a grassy hump within low ivyclad walls before settling he answered the call of nature behind a crumbling mound of rubble some little way apart and returning to his place saw that he wasnt entirely alone here at least the small romanian bats werent afraid of this place they flitted silently overhead then swept away to do their hunting elsewhere perhaps in their way they paid homage to the ancient evil thing which had died here harry smoked one of his rare cigarettes then tossed away the stub like a tiny meteorite in the night to sizzle out in a small pool of water finally he pulled up the zipper on his sleepingbag and made himself as comfortable as possible and prepared to face whatever his dreams would conjure harry the monstrous gurgling voice was there at once touching upon his sleeping mind without preamble so and it would seem that you have come it sounded as close and vibrant as ifa living person spoke to him and harry sensed no small measure of satisfaction in it but in his dream try as he may he couldnt remember what he was doing here oh he knew faethors mental voice well enough but not why the vampire had chosen to seek him out unless it was to torment him and so he kept silent for the one thing he did remember was that he was forbidden to speak to the dead what all of that again faethor was impatient now listen to me harry keogh i didnt seek you out but the other way around it is you who visits me here in romania and as for being forbidden to speak to me or to the dead in general surely that is why you are here so that i may undo what has been done to you but if i speak to you harry paused and waited for the pain to strike him down which it did not theres this pain that comes and and has it come no because you are asleep and dreaming conscious you may not converse with me but you are not conscious now tell me pray may we get on now harry remembered asleep his deadspeak couldnt hurt him oh yes he remembered that now and more than that i came to find out about janos ferenczy indeed faethor answered that is one of the reasons why you are here but it is not the only one before we consider all of that however first answer me this did you come here of your own free will im here out of necessity said harry because there are vampires in my world again but did you come as a free man as you yourself willed it or were you compelled by force cajoled or coerced against your own natural desires by now harry was fully awake in his dream and more surely aware of the vampires wiles moreover hed grown as skilled in their wordgames as the wamphyri themselves and knew that they were only a form of verbal manoeuvring compelled he said well no one pushed me coerced on the contrary my friends would have kept me back but cajoled only by you old devil only by you by me faethor played the innocent how so you have a problem and i have the answer someone reached inside your head grabbed up your brains and tied a knot in them i can perhaps untie it if i feel inclined which i may not so long as you create obstacles and make these accusations so tell me quickly now how have i cajoled you in what way the way i understand it said harry the word cajole has several meanings to coax or persuade with flattery to wheedle to make delusive promises it is to allure or inveigle so as to derive a point of personal gain these are the meanings of the word ah but when a vampire cajoles then the object of the exercise is far less clear and the consequences frequently dire hah harry sensed faethors exasperation and his astonishment that a mere human being should attempt to try him with one of his own games but he also sensed the vampires shrug of indifference and perhaps of finality and well said faethor that says it all you do not trust me so be it your journey is wasted wake up and get yourself gone i had thought we were friends but i was mistaken in which case what care i that there are vampires in your world to hell with your world and with you harry keogh harry wasnt about to fall for that one he was supposed to plead now for faethors audience but faethor would never have called him here just to dismiss him so casually it was simply the way of vampires that was all a ploy to gain the upper hand but just as some dreams are brilliantly clear and real as life so this one was developing within it harrys wits were grown razor sharp lets have it out in the open faethor he said abruptly for it suddenly dawns on me that while weve talked now and then you and i weve never actually met face to face and i feel certain that if i could only see your earnest honest face why then id be that much more at ease in your presence and not need to stay so firm on guard oh said the other as if surprised and are you still here but i could swear our conversation was at an end or perhaps you didnt understand me then let me make myself plain go away harrys turn to shrug very well and no great loss for lets face it i could never have relied on anything you said anyway what now faethor was furious and how many times have i assisted you harry keogh and how often have i borne you up when could and should have let you founder weve had this conversation before said harry unperturbed must we play it out again if my memory serves me well we agreed in a previous time that former liaisons had been to our mutual advantage neither one of us gained more than the other so come down off your high horse and tell me truly why now do you insist on this sinister ritual that i should come to you of my own free will and if i admit as much under what obligation will i place myself eh ahhh sighed faethor after a moment and if only it could have been you harry keogh instead of bloodcrazed thibor or that scheming devious lout janos if only i had chosen my sons more carefully eh why such as you and i could have ruled the world together but too late now for thibor got my egg and janos was my bloodson and now theres neither spark nor spunk left of me to form another if i thought for a moment there was faethor and even dreaming harry shivered then believe me i wouldnt be here but you are here and so i beg of you observe the formalities that ancient ritual of which you speak so harshly and suspiciously so now you beg of me said harry and still i ask myself whats in it for you aye and weve had that conversation before too faethor cried well then if i must repeat myself that bloodspawn of mine that child of my human side janos walks in the world of men again and i cannot bear it when thibor was desperate to be up and about who was it came to your aid in keeping him down eh i did for i loathed the dog and now its the turn of janos whats in it for me you ask well when you destroy him you might remember to tell him how his father helped you and even now lies laughing in his grave that will be profit enough what said harry speaking slowly and very carefully but surely that would be a lie for nothing at all of you lies in any grave you burned up in the fire that destroyed your house didnt you but you know i did the other cried but still i am here in a manner of speaking for how else could i talk to you it is my ghost my spirit the echo of a voice long vanished that you hear it is your talent your ability to speak with the dead which in itself should be evidence enough of my extinction harry was silent a while he knew that it was tit for tat this for that and that hed get nothing without first giving something faethor was eager indeed insistent that his rules should apply in any exchange here and in the end it was plain the vampire would have his way for harrys cause was doomed without him he thought these things but yet contrived to hide such thoughts from faethor ahha and now i see it the other finally burst out you are afraid of me harry keogh of me a longdead thing burned up and melted away in a holocaust but why now what is different now we are not strangers this is not the first time weve come together for a common cause no said harry but its certainly the first time ive bedded down with you ive been here before yes but when i was awake and other than that ive only ever spoken to you across great distances again via deadspeak when there was no possible danger to me and if theres one thing ive learned about vampires faethor its that when they seem at their most vulnerable thats when theyre most dangerous were arguing at odds getting nowhere said the vampire almost despairingly but for all the fatigue he displayed still harry guessed that faethor wouldnt be moved from his stand in this matter which meant there remained only one way to break the deadlock very well he said and so one of us must give way perhaps im a fool but yes i came of my own free will good the vampire grunted at once and harry could almost sense him smacking his lips a most wise and agreeable decision and why not for if im to observe your manners and customs why should not you observe mine eh they loved to win these creatures even in so small a thing as a contest of words perhaps that was all to the good for now faethor might find room to give way in other matters and as if he had read harrys thoughts and now we may face each other on equal terms you desired to speak to me face to face so be it until now the dream had been blank and grey and unyielding a place without substance except in the exchange of thoughts but now the grey took on a gently swirling motion and rapidly dissolved down to a thickly misted plain under a slender horned moon harry sat on a ruined wall with his feet dangling in the ground mist where it lapped at his ankles and faethor seated upon a heap of rubble was a dark figure in a shrouding robe whose hood cast his face in shadows only his eyes burned in that hollow darkness and they were like tiny scarlet lamps and is this more to your liking harry keogh i know this place said harry of course you do for it is the same place but perceived as it shall be some small distance in the future oh yes for that was one of my talents too to see a little way into the future alas it was unreliable else id not have been here that night they dropped their bombs i see that the bulldozers have been at work harry looked all around this place of yours seems the only place left for the moment aye faethor answered a ruin on a low plain surrounded by mud and debris soon to become an industrial complex and even if there were ears to hear me who would listen to me then what through all of that hubbub and mechanical chaos how are the mighty fallen harry keogh that i am reduced to this and perhaps now you can understand why thibor was made to suffer and in the end destroyed and why janos must go the same way they could have had it all everything and instead chose to defy me and should i haunt this place alone unloved and unremembered while one of them is returned to the world perhaps to become a power perhaps the power no i shall not rest until i know that janos is as little or even less than i am which is nothing and im to be your instrument is it not what you want do not our objectives coincide yes harry agreed except i want it for the safety of a world and you want it for your own selfish spite they were your sons thibor and janos whatever it is in them which you hate they got it from you its a strange father wholl murder his own sons because they take too well after him faethor gloomed on him and his voice turned sly and insinuating is it harry is it and youre the expert are you ah but of course certainly you would understand such things for ive heard it that you have a son too harry was silent he had no answer perhaps he would destroy his son if he could or at least change him but hadnt he also tried to change the lady karen faethor took his silence as something else a sign that perhaps he went too far now he was quick to change his tone but there the circumstances are different and anyway you are a man and i am wamphyri there can be no meeting point except in our dual purpose so lets make an end of criticisms and accusations and such for theres work to be done harry was pleased to change the subject these are the simple facts he said we both want janos put down again permanently neither one of us can do it on his own for you it is absolutely impossible likewise for me without my gift of deadspeak you say you can return that talent to me that since it was taken from me by a vampire only a vampire can return it very well i believe you what will it entail faethor sighed and seemed to slump down a little where he sat he turned his redglowing eyes away and looked out over the plain of mist and we are come to that part from which i know you will shy most violently and yet it is unavoidable say it said harry the trouble lies in your head a creature other than yourself has visited the labyrinth caves of your mind and wrought certain changes there let us say that within your house the furniture has been rearranged now another must go in and put the place in order you want me to let you into my mind you must invite me in said faethor and i must enter of my own free will harry recalled to mind all he knew about vampires and said when thibor entered dragosanis mind he tried to steer it his way he interfered in dragosanis affairs when he touched the living foetus which would become yulian bodescu that was sufficient to alter the child entirely and turn him into a monster and again thibor was in yulians mind able to communicate with him and guide or direct him even over great distances at this very moment a friend of mine on the island of rhodes has a vampire your bloodson janos in his mind or at least controlling it and my friend exists in a hell of terror and torment and you want me to let you into my mind said you would shy from it if i let it happen this once how may i be sure it wont happen when i dont want it would remind you distance removed dragosani from danger even if what you suggest were possible do you intend to stay here in romania forever no for you have your own way to go which will put you far beyond my reach i would further remind you thibor was an undead thing in the ground he was real solid intact in all his parts while i am but a wraith dead and gone forever a ghost aye empty immaterial incorporeal and of no consequence whatsoever except to a necroscope except to you faethors shade nodded its agreement the man who talks to and befriends the dead or used to so how do we go about it harry asked im no telepath with a mind like a book to be read but in a way you are faethor told him is it not a form of telepathy to be able to talk to the dead also when you too were without body did you not speak to the living that was a strange time harry agreed it was my deadspeak it worked in reverse being incorporeal i had no voice and so i could talk to the living to those who had body in the same way i talked to the dead again faethors nod theres more to your mind than even you suspect harry keogh and i say i can be into it even as thibor was into dragosanis but without the complications harry sensed faethors eagerness he was far too eager but there was no way round it what do i have to do nothing simply relax sleep a dreamless sleep and i shall visit within your mind harry felt faethors beguilement his hypnotism working on him and resisted it wait three things i want and if your mindtricks work perhaps a fourth later name them first that you undo the mischief done to my mind and return my deadspeak as agreed second that you give me some sort of defence against janoss telepathy for ive seen what he can do to minds such as mine third that you look and see if theres any way i can regain access to the mцbius continuum its the ultimate weapon against janos and would surely tilt the odds in my favour and the fourth when if i have my deadspeak back ill be able to find you again no matter where i am and then hopefully for the last time i may ask for your help again to free the mind of my friend trevor jordan which janos holds enthralled as for this last thing the vampire answered if it can be done then it shall be done in due course but alas access to this device of yours teleportation we shall see what we shall see however i doubt it it was not an art of mine i know nothing of it how may i unriddle something in a language i cannot speak the language of mathematics is a stranger to me on the other hand your deadspeak is something i can surely put back to rights for i understand it even when they were dead many hundred years still my szgany answered my call and got up from their graves lastly you ask for some sort of defence against janoss mindspells well that is no simple thing its not any sort of gift i can will or bestow upon you but later i shall describe to you how to fight fire with fire which may help if you can stand the heat of it faethor harry was almost completely resigned to his fate now i wonder will i thank you for this when its done will there ever be thanks enough or will i curse you for all eternity and will there ever be curses enough even now you could be plotting to destroy me as youve destroyed everything else you ever touched and yet it seems ive no choice these things are not entirely true harry faethor answered destroyed things aye ive done that and brought a few into being too nor are you without choice indeed it seems to me the very simplest matter trust me now as an ally tried and true or begone from here and wait for janos to seek you out and when the time is come go up against him like a child naked and innocent of all his ways and wiles weve talked enough said harry and we both know theres only one course open to me lets waste no more time and sleep said faethor his mental voice deep and dark as a bottomless pool of blood sleep a dreamless sleep harry keogh leaving all the doors of your mind standing open to me sleep and let me see inside ah but even though you may will it freely still i shall find certain doors closed to me and closed to you these are the ones which i must unlock for beyond them lie all your talents which your son has hidden from you sleep harry we are the betrayed you and i by our own flesh and blood we have this much in common at least nay more than this for weve both been powers in our time and you shall be a power again haaarry keeooogh the mist on the plain swirled as faethor flowed to his feet and approached harry where he slumped on the broken wall the long dead vampire reached out a hand towards harrys face and the hand was white and skeletal projecting from the fretted sleeve of his robe like a bundle of thin sticks the bony fingers touched harrys pale brow and melted into his skull and as the scarlet fires dimmed in the sockets of faethors eyes so their light was transferred beneath harrys lowered lids like red candles behind frosted glass following which the vampire was privy to harrys most secret things his thoughts and memories and passions his very mind until after what might have been moments or millennia wake up said faethor harry came out of the dream with a sneeze and a second sneeze even as he realized he was truly awake he rolled his head a little in the hood of his sleepingbag and something made a soft bursting sound close by in the faint dawn light he saw a ring of small black mushrooms or puffballs where theyd grown up beside his bed in the night already they were rotting bursting open at the slightest movement releasing their spores in peppery clouds harry sneezed again and sat up for a moment his dream was there in his mind but already fading as most dreams do he strove to remember it and it was gone he knew hed conversed with the spirit of faethor ferenczy but that was all if anything had passed between them harry couldnt say what it had been certainly he felt no different from when he went to sleep oh said faethor and are you sure of that harry keogh jesus harry jumped a foot who he looked all about saw no one and did you think i would fail you said faethor deadspeak harry whispered it is returned to you there see now how faethor ferenczy keeps his word harry had unzipped his sleepingbag and scrambled to his feet in the dispersing morning mist now he sat down again with something of a bump there was no pain in his head no one squirted acid in his mind his talent seemed returned to him in full measure all that remained was to try it out and faethor he said still wincing inside and expecting to be struck down was it difficult difficult enough aye the dead vampires voice sounded tired what had been done to you was the work of an expert all night i laboured to rid your house of his infestation harry you may now gauge for yourself the measure of my success harry stood up again with his heart in his mouth he attempted to conjure a mцbius door to no avail the equations evolving mutating and multiplying with awesome acceleration on the computer screens of his mind were completely alien to him he couldnt fathom them individually let alone as a total concept or entity he sighed and said well im grateful to you indeed youll never know just how grateful i am but you werent entirely successful faethors answer with his bodiless shrug sensed superimposed upon it was halfapologetic warned you it might be so oh i found the region of the trouble be sure and even managed to unlock several of its doors but beyond them yes there was nothing no time no space nothing at all very frightening places harry and strange to think that they exist right there in your mind in your entirely human mind i felt that to take one single step over those thresholds would mean being sucked in and lost forever beyond the boundaries of the universe needless to say i took no such step and in any case no sooner had i opened these doors than they slammed themselves shut in my face for which i was not ungrateful harry nodded you looked in on the mцbius continuum he said and when ive finished here i must try to find him mцbius i mean for just as youre the expert in your field so hes the one true authority in his useless to seek him out until now for without deadspeak i couldnt talk to him will you do it now at once faethor was fascinated am interested in genius there is a kinship in all true geniuses harry for however far removed their various talents into whichever spheres still the obsession remains the same they seek to eliminate all imperfections where this mцbius has approached the very limits of pure numbers i myself have searched for purest pure evil we stand on the opposite sides of a great gulf but still we are brothers of a sort yes and it would be fascinating to meet such a one no harry automatically shook his head and knew that faethor would sense it i wont look for him now eventually but not now after ive practised a while and when ive convinced myself that my deadspeak is as good as it used to be maybe then as you wish and for the moment do you go now to seek out janos harry rolled up his sleepingbag and stuffed it into his holdall that too eventually he answered but first ill return to my friends in rhodes and see how theyre faring and before any of that there are still things you must tell me i still want to know all about janos the better a man knows his enemy the easier it is to defeat him also i need to know how to defend myself against him of course said faethor indeed i had forgotten there was work still to be done but only see how eager i am that you should be on your way ah but i go too fast and certainly you are right you must have every possible weapon at your disposal if youre to defeat him as to how you may best defend yourself thats not easy this sort of thing is inherent in the wamphyri but difficult to teach even the keenest instinct would not suffice for this is something borne in the blood if we had an entire week together no again harry shook his head out of the question cant you break it down into its simplest terms for me if im not too stupid i might just catch on can but try said faethor harry lit a cigarette sat down on his stuffed holdall and said go ahead again faethors shrug and he at once commenced janos is without doubt the finest telepath which is to say beguiler enchanter fascinator i have ever known wherefore he will first attempt an invasion of your mind now as ive hinted and as is surely selfevident your mind is extraordinary harry well of course it is for you are the necroscope but where you have practised only good janos like myself in my time has practised only evil and because you know he is evil so you fear him and what he may do to you do you understand of course none of this is new to me to anyone less well versed in the ways of the wamphyri such is the awe the sheer terror janos would inspire that his victim would be paralysed but you are not ignorant of our ways indeed you are an expert in your own right do you know the saying that the best form of defence is attack ive heard it yes suspect that in this instance it would be true i should attack him with my mind instead of shrinking back from him when you sense him near seek him out he would enter your mind enter his he will expect you to be afraid be bold he will threaten brush all such threats aside and strike but above all else do not let his evil weaken you when he yawns his great jaws at you go in through them for hes softer on the inside is that all if say more i fear it would only confuse you and who knows you may learn more about janos from his story than from any measures of mine to forearm you moreover im weary from a long nights work ask me what has been by all means but not what is yet to be true i have been an observer of times but as my current situation is surely witness i was far too often in error harry thought about what hed learned faethors advice about how to deal with a mindattack from janos some might consider it suicidal to act in accordance with such instructions the necroscope wasnt so sure in any case it seemed very little to go on but patently it was all he was going to get dawning daylight had apparently dampened the vampires enthusiasm harry stood up stretched and looked all around the mist had thinned to nothing a handful of gaunt houses stood beyond a hedge half a mile away in the other direction the silhouettes of diggers and bulldozers were like dinosaurs frozen on a grey horizon another hour and theyd roar into destructive mechanical life as if the sun had warmed their joints to clanking motion harry looked at the ground where he stood the spot where faethor had died on the night ladislau giresci cut off his head in the ruins of a bombblasted burning house he saw the now liquescent mushrooms there their spores like red stains on the grass and soil and in the eye of his mind he saw faethor too the skeletal shrouded thing hed been in his dream are you up to telling me janoss story he asked apparently of no one that will be no effort at all but a pleasure the other answered at once it was my pleasure to spawn him and it gave me the most exquisite pleasure to put him down again but first do you remember the story of thibor in his early days how he robbed me of my castle in the khorvaty and how i most sorely injured fled westwards let me remind you then this was how it was bloodson thibor the wallach that cursed ingrate to whom i had given my egg name and banner and into whose hands i had bequeathed my castle lands and wamphyri powers had injured me sorely thrown down burning from the walls of my castle i experienced the ultimate agonies a myriad minion bats fluttered to me as i fell were scorched and died for their troubles but dampened my flames not at all i crashed through trees and shrubs and pinwheeled aflame down the sides of the gorge to the very bottom but my fall had been broken in part by the foliage and i came to rest in a shallow pool which alone saved my melting wamphyri flesh as close to true death as a vampire might come and remain undead i put out a desperate call to my faithful gypsies where they camped in the valley they came lifted my body from the still salving water and cared for it and carried me west over the mountains into hungary protecting me from jars and jolts hiding me from potential enemies keeping me safe from the suns searing rays at last they brought me to a place of rest aye and it was a long rest a time of enforced retirement for recuperation for the reshaping of my broken body a long long rest indeed for how thibor had hurt me all bones broken back and neck skull and limbs chest caved in heart and lungs amangle skin flayed by boulders and sharp branches and seared with fire even the vampire in me was burned bruised and battered a month in the healing a year nay an hundred years my long convalescence was spent in an inaccessible mountain retreat and all the while my szgany tended me and their sons and their sons aye and their sweet firmbreasted daughters too slowly the vampire in me healed itself and then healed me wamphyri i walked again practised my arts made myself wiser stronger more awesome than ever before and eventually i went abroad from my aerie and made plans for my lifes adventure ah but it was a terrible world in which i emerged with wars everywhere great suffering famines pestilence terrible aye but the stuff of life to me for i was wamphyri i found myself the ruins of a keep in the border with wallachia and used the tumbled stones to build a small castle there almost impregnable within its walls i set myself up as a boyar of some means i led a mixed body of szgany hungarians and local wallachs housed them and paid them good wages was soon accepted as a landowner and leader and so i became a small power in the land as for wallachia i avoided venturing there mainly for there was one in wallachia whose strength and cruelties were already renowned a mercenary voevod named thibor who fought for the wallach princelings i did not wish to meet this one not yet for in the event of my seeing him i might not be able to contain myself which could well prove fatal for he was now grown to a far greater power than i myself no my revenge must wait what is time to the wamphyri eh time in the tumult of its passing where an entire day is like the single tick of a great clock it is nothing but when each vastly extended tick is precisely the same as the one gone before and when they begin to fall like thunderclaps upon the earah but then one discovers times restrictions from which only boredom and uttermost ennui may ensue and that is everything i was restless confined pent up there was i lusty strong something of a power and nowhere to channel my energies the time was coming when i must go further abroad in the roiling world but then in the year a diversion over a period of some few years id been hearing tales of a szgany woman who was a true observer of times which is to say she had the power of precognition eventually my curiosity was piqued and i determined to see her she was not of my own band of gypsies and so i must wait for her to venture into those mountainous regions within my control meanwhile i sent out messengers to direct her wanderings aright describing how when she and her band came within my spheres they would be offered every hospitality treated with utmost respect and paid in gold for whichever services they might render unto me and in the interim while i waited on the advent of this alleged oracle i determined to practise what small talent i possessed in casting a few weirds of my own i mixed certain herbs and burned them fell asleep breathing their incense and sought by oneiromancy to divine the way it would be between myself and this doubtless fraudulent witch this marilena aye for in those days i had good reason to be interested in talented folk and to seek them out whenever the opportunity arose my son thibor had been abroad for several human lifetimes now and might have spawned all manner of curiosities in the land and so i sought out all such anomalies and in so doing prided myself with the discovery of charlatans but if i should come across a genuine talent then he or she was a goner for while to a creature such as i the blood is or was the life the sweetest nectar of all may only be sipped from the undead font of another vampire a font aye for such a sip is surely holy to one such as i am at least but only picture my astonishment when finally my oneiromancy produced results and i dreamed of this dark angel where i had thought to discover a hag what she was a child i saw her in my dreams a lovely child aye and innocent i thought she came to me naked all curves creamy and brown unblemished dark in her eyes and in her shining hair the lips of her face red as cherries and those of her oyster when i opened it the hue of freshly slaughtered meat to stand before me unashamed two centuries gone by since thibor destroyed my castle in the khorvaty and raped my vampire women and put them down between then and now i had tasted my share of soft szgany flesh spilling myself into such gypsy odalisques as pleased me nothing of love in it mind you that word was only applicable to others never to myself but now it was the human side of me of course which from time to time held sway in my dreams i gazed upon this sweet sensuous princess of the travelling folk through eyes fogged by human weakness the shuddering of my loins was the love of a man but never the raging lust of the wamphyri and to my shame my dreams were wet and i came in my blankets like a trembling lad stroking the teats of his first girl but the trouble with oneiromancy was always this had it been a true and accurate prediction of the future or was it just a dream thereafter in order to reinforce my findings night after night would find me burning my herbs and willing myself into divinatory dreams and always they were the same except that the better we got to know each other marilena and i the more pleasurable our loveplay became and myself ever more enamoured until i knew that instead of a mere dream i must have the real thing or go mad which was when she came to me as it were in the flesh she was of the camp of grigor zirra called king zirra indeed marilena was grigors daughter and so i had been right she was a princess of the travelling folk it was winter when they came the end of january and never so biting cold in all the years of my memory my own szgany stationed their caravans and carts in clusters close to my walls banked them in with huge bricks of snow smoothed to ice pitched their tents within the clusters and tethered their beasts inside with them for their warmth ah they had known it would be a hard winter these wise ones in the caves all around they had worked long and hard storing fodder for their animals even so men and beasts alike would be hard put to see it through that winter without they relied on the patronage of the boyar in his castle i kept all my doors unbarred to them and my halls warm with fires everywhere my good grogs and coarse red wines were made available for the asking likewise grain to make their bread it cost me nothing these things belonged to the szgany anyway for in better seasons theyd given them all to me who had no need of them one midmorning a man came to me he had been hunting in the mountains which were my mountains i did not deny the gypsies this privilege if they shot three pigs or woodcocks one was mine and so on and he told me of the szgany zirra that they were caught in a pass close by where an avalanche had carried their caravans away only a handful survived he said scattered in the tumbled drifts i knew his report was true last night i had dreamed again my herbal dreams but this time devoid of carnal delights and filled instead with blizzards and the screams of those swept away and dying and because i had not dreamed of my marilena i wondered was she one of them then i called for my szgany chief and told him there is a girl trapped in the snows this man knows where she is she and her people are szgany go find them dig them out and bring them here and hurry for if you are too late and she is dead the house of the ferenczy may feel that its hospitality is wasted on such as you and yours is this understood it was and he went in all haste in the afternoon my chief and his men returned he made report of the szgany zirra which had numbered as many as fifty he had found only grigor zirra himself and a dozen of his band alive three of the survivors were broken but would mend two more were old women and might not and of the rest one was grigors daughter called marilena an observer of times i commanded him have your women tend them feed them give them whatsoever they need spare nothing to make them welcome comfortable at ease in this place i take it they have nothing nothing of extra clothing no carts or coverings so without me they are destitute very well quarter them within the castles walls find them warm rooms within easy reach of my own where they may stay apart and seeing a puzzled look in his eyes well your own people might think it strange master he said that you treat the strangers so well that we make way for them who owe you no allegiance you are forthright and i like you for it i told him i too shall be forthright i have heard it said of the woman marilena zirra that she is comely if this is true it may be that i shall want her for you gipsies are not the only ones who feel the cold of a night wherefore treat her people with respect especially her father and family if such as these survived i do not wish that they should find me a cold and cruel man what you master he said with no trace of emotion in his voice his face utterly blank cold cruel who would ever believe it i regarded him a while finally saying forthright is one thing and forward another entirely do you seek to be familiar with me i tell you honestly i cannot believe you would enjoy such familiarity wherefore when you say certain things to me and in such a way it should always please you to smile i stared at him and rumbled a little deep in my throat until he grew uncomfortable master he said beginning to tremble i meant no hush i quieted him you are safe my mood is a good one now heed me well later when the zirras are recovered return and take me among them where they are quartered until then begone but when i went among them i was not pleased it wasnt that my instructions had not been followed they had to the letter it was simply that the ordeal of these people had been such that they were mazed and vacant it would take a little time in the healing meanwhile they sat in their rags and trembled and spoke only when they were spoken to as for the supposed princess of my dreams where was she one filthy bundle huddled to the fire looked much like the next to me it annoyed me that my dreams had lied to me i felt that i had failed in my oneiromancy i hated failure especially in myself so i stood and gloomed over these dregs a while and finally asked which one of you is grigor zirra he stood up a nothing a wisp pale from the snow and his suffering the loss of his people he was not old but neither did he look young there had been strength in his leanness once but now it looked washed out of him unlike myself he was entirely human and he had lost much i am the ferenczy i told him this is my castle the people about are my people szgany like yourself for the time being it pleases me to give you shelter but i have heard there is an observer of times among you and it also pleases me to contemplate such mysteries where is this witch or wizard your hospitality is vast as your legend he answered alas that in my sorrow i cannot more fully declare my appreciation for something of me died this day she was my wife swept from the cliff now i have only a daughter a child who reads the future in the stars in the palm of your hand and in her dreams she is no witch lord but a true observer of times my marilena of whom you have heard and where is she he looked at me and there was fear in his eyes but i felt a tug at the sleeve of my robe and started that someone dared touch me none of my own had laid finger on me unbidden since the day i rose up from my sickbed i looked and saw one of the rag bundles risen to its feet to stand beside me its eyes were huge dark beneath a fur hood its hair was all black ringlets spilling about a heartshaped face its lips were the colour of cherries bright as blood and upon my arm her tiny hand whose fingers numbered only three as i had seen them in my dreams i am marilena lord she said forgive my father for he loves and fears for me there are some in the land distrustful of mysteries they cannot fathom and unkind to certain women whom they term witches my heart felt staggered she could be none other i knew the voice i saw through all her clothes to the very princess of my dreams knowing that what was in there was a wonder and i know you i said my voice choked and i you lord i have seen you in my future often you are in no wise a stranger i had no words or if i had they were stuck in my throat but i was the ferenczy should i dance laugh out loud pick her up and whirl her all about oh i wanted to but i could not reveal my emotions i stood there thunderstruck like a great fool frozen until she came to my rescue if you would have me read for you lord then take me aside from here here my concentration suffers for there is much sadness aye and various comings and goings and likewise much fuss and todo oh and many small matters to interfere with my scrying a private place would be to some advantage oh indeed it would come with me i said lord her father stopped us she is innocent the last word was spoken on a rising note of pleading perhaps my nature was not unknown among the szgany but didnt he know his own daughter it was in my mind to say to him lying gypsy dog what this one innocent man she has licked my entire body clean as if bathed i have fired my fluids into her throat every night for a month from the coaxing of her tongue and tiny threefingered hands innocent if she is innocent then so am i ah but how could i say these things for the fact of it was that i had only ever dreamed my love affair with marilena again she rescued me father she rebuked him before i could more than pierce him with my eyes i have seen what will be for me the future is father and i have read no harm in it not at the hands of the ferenczy he had seen my look however and knew how far he strained my hospitality forgive me lord he said lowering his head instead of speaking as a man sorely in your debt i spoke only as a father my daughter is only seventeen and we are fallen among strangers the zirras have lost enough this day ah ah i meant nothing by that but do you see i trip over my own tongue even now it is the grief my mind is stricken i meant nothing it is the grief and sobbing he collapsed i stooped a little and put my hand on his head be at your ease he who harms you or yours in the house of the ferenczy answers to me and then i led her to my quarters once there alone where none dared disturb i lifted off her coat of furs until she stood in a peasant dress now she looked even more like the princess i knew but not enough my eyes burned on her burned for the sight of her and she knew it how can this be she said full of wonder i truly know you never were my dreams more potent you are right i said we are not strangers we have shared the same dreams you have great scars she said here on your arm and here in your side and even i the ferenczy trembled where she touched me and you i told her have a tiny red mole like a single tear of blood in the centre of your back beside my fire which roared into a great chimney there stood a stone trough for bathing over the fire a mighty cauldron of water added steam to the smoke she went to the tripod and turned the gear pouring water into the trough she knew how to do it from her dreams i am unclean from the journey she explained and rough from the snows she stripped and i bathed her and then she bathed me and how is this for a private reading i chuckled but as i opened her and went to slip inside ah she gasped but our mutual dreams took no account of my inexperience my father told the truth lord the future is closing fast be sure but i am still a virgin ah i answered her moan for moan the while gentling my way inside but werent we all once upon a time how my vampire raged within me then but i held him back and loved her only as a man else the first time were surely her last now let me make it plain what had happened was this as much out of idle curiosity as for any other reason in my oneiromantic dreams i had sought marilena out become enamoured of her and seduced her or we had seduced each other but how could she a child inexperienced seduce me and i will answer because dreams are safe whatever happens in ones dreams nothing is changed upon awakening she could indulge all her sexual fantasies without reaping the reward of such indulgence and how could i faethor ferenczy even asleep and dreaming be anything less than wamphyri ah but i was a dreamer long before i became a vampire indeed i was once a mere man the things which had troubled me in my youth still occasionally troubled me in my sleep the old fears the old emotions and passions i am sure my meaning is not lost all of us know that long after an experience has waned to insignificance in the waking world we may still review it afresh in our dreams with as much apprehension or excitement as we did when it was new in my dreams for example i was still wont to remember the time of my own conversion when i had received my fathers egg and so been made a vampire aye and such dreams as those still horrified me but in the cold light of day that horror was quickly forgotten lost in the grey mist of time where it belonged and i was no stripling lad but the ferenczy again the meeting of marilenas dreams with mine had been more than mere chance however i had sought her out and found her and once insinuated into her dreams i had dreamed of knowing her carnally and again i say these were not simple dreams i had wamphyri powers and she was a prognosticator these were talents akin to telepathy we had in fact shared each others dreams and through them known each others bodies all of our fumbling and fondling and later our more energetic far more diverse lovemaking had been done in another world of the mind where there had been no obligation to spare anything so that when we came together at last it was very much as lovers of long standing except that in reality marilena was innocent and her flesh untried by any man for a while anyway now i understood these things but she did not she thought that her talent alone had shown her the future her future without outside interference she did not know that i had guided her in those dreams with a vampires magnetism and beguilement and oh with all those arts so long instinct in me she thought we were natural lovers who can say perhaps we would have been anyway but i was not so foolish as to tell her and take a chance on her disillusionment now it might also cross your mind to wonder how she a gorgeous young girl round and firm as an apple freshminded and bodied could find any sort of waking satisfaction in a scarred and ancient undead thing like me savage and cruel and filled with horror i would be surprised if it did not but then you would doubtless recollect what you know of a vampires powers of hypnotism and perhaps believe that you had fathomed the mystery you would say she was his plaything not of her own free will well ill make no bones of it before marilena this had always been the way of it but it was not the way of it with her to begin with i was not so grotesque as you might imagine wamphyri my many hundreds of years didnt show except perhaps occasionally in my eyes or when i wanted it to show indeed with a small effort i could appear as old or as young as it pleased me to appear which in marilenas case was always young no more than forty even without my vampire i would be tall and strong and i had all those centuries of charm wit and wisdom and folly in me to draw on at will scarred oh i was and badly but i had retained these gouges out of vanity and to remind me of the one who had put most of them there i could have let the vampire in me repair such disfigurements entirely but so long as thibor lived i would not do so no i wore those scars like spurs against my own flanks to goad me if ever i should find my hatred flagging but if you doubt that i was so handsome only think on how ladislau giresci described me the night he took my head ah and you see ancient as i was still i was quite the man eh there you must excuse me it is my vanity the wamphyri were ever vain also i beg your indulgence that i have dwelled so long upon marilena but it pleased me so to do for who else is there with whom i might share such memories none but a necroscope can ever know them you know of course that i am janoss father by now you have probably guessed it too that marilena was his mother he was my bloodson born of the love and the lust between a man and a woman of blood in its fiery fusion and in the passing of a single germ of life from the one to the other to pierce her egg and bring life to the chick within my bloodson aye my natural son with nothing of the vampire in him that was the way it was to have been i did not know if it could be done but would try it anyway to bring life into the world independent of wamphyri influence i would do it for marilena so that she could be a natural mother and if i should fail and the child grow to be a vampire well anyway he would still be my son and i would teach him the ways of the wamphyri so that when i went out into the world he would stay behind and keep my castle and my mountains safe from all enemies oh oh hah you will remember that in an earlier time i held just such high expectations of that ingrate wallach thibor ah well it is the nature of all great men i suppose to try and try again and never count the cost in their striving for perfection except and as i have stated i was never the one to suffer failure lightly janos when he was born seemed natural he was born out of wedlock which dismayed grigor his grandfather somewhat but meant nothing at all to me his hands were threefingered as were grigors and marilenas before him but this was a mere freakishness a trait passed down to him with nothing sinister in it as he grew however it became clear that i had failed my sperm which i had tried by force of will to keep free of crimson influences had been tainted however lightly it had been a foolish experiment at best can an eagle beget a sparrow or the grey wolf a squealing pink piglet how much harder then for a vampire whose very touch is a taint to beget an innocent child no janos was not a true vampire but he had the bad blood of a vampire aye and all my vices twofold but with little of my flexibility and nothing of my caution still id been headstrong myself when i was young i was his father and it fell to me to show him the way of things i did show him and if and when a heavy hand was required to stop him dead in his tracks or simply steer him aright i was not slow to apply that too but still he grew up wrongheaded prideful obstinate and cruel beyond his needs his one good point in which he kept faithfully to my teachings was the way he held sway over the gypsies not only the szgany zirra his mothers people who were on the increase again but also my own szgany ferengi i thought that they loved him even better than they loved me all of them and perhaps it soured me and i was a little jealous of him because of it and it could be that i was harder on him too for the same reason anyway i will say one more thing in his favour and then no more he loved his mother a point to stand any child in good stead while he is still a child aye but not necessarily when he becomes a man for theres love and theres love you will understand my meaning meanwhile other troubles had brewed up boiled over and were still scalding in the world all of ten years ago saladin had crushed the prankish crusader kingdoms the sinister mercenary thibor was now fighting on the far borders of wallachia a voevod for the gold of puppet princelings in turkeyland beyond the greek sea the mongols were rising up like a forest fire with the wind at its back wars raged close to the hungarian borders and another innocent the third had recently been elected pope aieee the storm lightnings flashed red from the many clouds boiling up over all the worlds horizons and where pray was faethor ferenczy in the great scheme of things in his dotage some must have thought tending his castle in the mountains teaching manners to his bastard son while his oncetrue szgany guards drank too much and slept late abed and chuckled behind his back more time passed unremarkably enough for me but then one morning i woke up shook my head and looked all about i felt dazed mazed astonished twenty years in all gone by almost in a flash without my noticing but now i realized it well enough it had been a sort of lethargy a malaise some weird spell id been under a thing which commoner men call love aye and it had reduced me accordingly for where was my mystery now what i was no more than a miserable boyar obscure baron over a wasteland no one else wanted master of a piddling stone house in the crags i went to marilena and she read my future for me i was to embark upon a great and bloody crusade she said and she would not stand in my way i could make neither head nor tail of it not stand in my way why she couldnt bear to be apart from me what crusade was she speaking of but she only shook her head shed seen no more but that i would fight in some terrible holy war and after that all her augury palmistry and astrology had seemingly forsaken her ah how could i know that shed read her own future too only to discover she did not have one but a great and bloody crusade shed said i thought about it and decided she could well be right news travelled slowly in those days and sometimes reached me not at all i began to feel penned in with all my old frustrations returning upon me with a vengeance enough of that it was time i was up and about well janos was almost twenty he was a man now i charged him with the keeping of my house and went down incognito into szeged to see what i would see and make whichever plans were appropriate it was a timely move the city was abustle with news zara so recently taken by hungary would soon be under siege from prankish crusaders a great fleet of franks and venetians was under sail even now and riders had been sent out at the kings command to all the boyars around with orders that they gather their men to them and take up arms marilena had read my future aright there were men of mine in the countryside around szgany i found them easily enough during my return to the mountainous borders meet me i told them when i come down again from my castle i gather a small army of the very best we go to zara aye and far beyond zara you who have been poor shall be rich fight under my banner and ill make all of you boyars to a man or fail me and im done with you and in one hundred years i shall still be here and mighty and you shall be dust and your names forgotten and so i returned home but travelling in the manner of the wamphyri at least by night i had made good time and i had lingered not at all in szeged being apart these few days from marilena all of my instincts had sharpened and my wits were made keen in anticipation of the holy bloodfeast which was my future in the mountains my szgany retainers had grown fat and lazy but i knew ways to wake them up again they would not be expecting me back so soon but they would know when they saw me that i was the ferenczy as of old in that last night soaring home on wings of thick membrane i reached out in the dark with my vampires mind and called to all the young bloods of the szgany ferengi wherever they were scattered and told them to meet me in the approaches to zara and i knew that they heard me in their dreams and that they would be there and having shaken off twenty years of sloth so i floated on an updraught between the moon and the mountains setting all the wolves to howling in the silvered peaks before finally gentling to the battlements of my house where i shrank back into a man then i sought out my woman and my son aye and i found them together but there i have gone too fast let me pause and retrace my steps a while i have said that nothing of the wamphyri was in janos well so i thought but oh how i was wrong it was in him not in his body but in his mind he had the mind of a true vampire inherited from me and he had inherited something of his parents powers too something of them he was a power telepathy how often through the years had i tried to read his mind and failed still nothing very remarkable in that there are men a handful who are naturally resistant their minds are closed guarded from talents such as mine and fascination or hypnotism on occasion when he was obstinate i had tried to hypnotize him to my will wasted efforts all for my eyes could not see into his couldnt penetrate behind them so that in the end i no longer tried but in fact the reason for my failure in these endeavours was not that janos was unresponsive but that his strength was such as to defy all such wouldbe intrusions and close him off from me i had likened it to a tugowar where my opponents rope was wedged in a tree root immovable but no it was not so complicated as that he was simply stronger whats more he had also inherited his mothers skill at foretokening he could see the future or something of it anyway except that in this last our talents were more evenly balanced else i should never have caught him for the futures he saw were faint and fardistant like the memories of some history which time has made obscure but now let me return to that night i have said my instincts were sharper than at any time in the previous twenty years they were and as i passed through the castle so i sensed that things were not as they should be i formed a bats convoluted snout to sniff the air of the place no enemy was here and there seemed nothing of physical danger to me but something was strange i went with more caution moved silent as a shadow and willed it that i should be unseen unheard but no need for that janos was too engrossed the dog and his mother too mazed to even know what he was about except when he made some command of her again i go ahead of myself i did not know that it was him not at first indeed i thought the man must be szgany and was astonished what a gypsy one of my own and in my womans bedroom at dead of night a fearless man indeed i must make known to him how much i admired his bravery while choking him with his own entrails these were my thoughts when as i came to marilenas rooms my wamphyri senses told me that she was not alone following which it took my every effort to stop the teeth in my jaws from forming scythes and shearing my gums to pulp indeed i felt the nails of my fingers involuntarily elongating into chitin knives and this too was a reaction i could scarce control the room had an exterior door a small antechamber and a second door to the bedroom proper gently soundlessly i tried the outer door and found it barred never since she came to me had this door been barred my worst suspicions were now fully aroused also my hot blood oh i could break the door down certainly except to come upon them that way would be to alert them too soon and i wanted to see with my own eyes no amount of screeched or gasped or bloodtinged frothed denial may eradicate a scene seared upon the very skin of ones eyeballs i went out onto a balcony formed my hands and forearms into webbed discs like the suckers of some grotesque octopus and made my way to marilenas window the window was large arched and cut through a wall six feet thick inside across the opening in the inner wall curtains had been drawn i climbed in and inched to the curtains which i drew fractionally apart to form a crack inside the room a floating wick in a bowl of oil gave light enough to see not that i had need of it for i saw in the dark as surely as other men see in full daylight and even better and what i saw was this marilena naked as a whore flat on her back across a wooden table her legs were wrapped around a man who stood upright straining between her thighs until his buttocks were clenched like fists driving into her as if he were hammering home a wedge and indeed he was a fat wedge of flesh and in a moment more i would drive that same wedge down his throat but then through the pounding of my blood and the mad thundering of my brain and through all the roaring of my outraged emotions i heard her voice gasping ah faethor more more fill me my vampire love as only you can but let me pause the memory enrages me even now when all i am is a voice from beyond the grave let me pause a moment and make explanation it strikes me ive made little mention of myself during the twenty years of marilena and her bastard son i shall do so now but quickly the fact that i had taken a woman for my own had not made me any less the vampire i had had women before be sure it is the vampires nature to have women just as it is the nature of the female of the species to have men but i had never before been so fond of any one creature so for all that i had not deliberately enthralled or vampirized marilena i was nonetheless wamphyri in all my thoughts moods and activities but having determined not to partake of her blood and likewise that as little of my flesh as possible should be allowed to enter her it had fallen upon me to find my sustenance elsewhere i did not have to drink blood so long as i could control the craving commoner fare would suffice but blood is as much true life to the vampire as opium is sure death to the addict and they are both hard habits to break in the case of the wamphyri the creature within ensures that the habit will not be broken i could go for long periods then without taking myself apart from marilena but occasionally the craving would overpower me and then in the night i would rise up change my shape and glide from my castles walls to find my pleasure my lady of course was no dimwit she had long since divined the true nature of her lover it was in any case common knowledge among the gypsies that the szgany ferengi served a vampire master and she was jealous of them with whom i visited from time to time waking up as i left our bed she would cry faethor are you deserting me in the night do you fly to some lover why do you treat me so badly is my body not enough for you take it and use it as you will but do not leave me here alone and weeping and i would say i seek me a man for his blood what and do you say im unfaithful all through the seasons night upon night i lie with you abed and you have what you will of me and have i ever flagged in my duties but the blood is the life marilena or would you have me shrivel to a mummy in my sheets so that when you wake with the morning and reach out for me i crumble into dust beneath your touch and then she would shriek you go with women what you seek a man for his blood no you seek a woman for her round backside pointy breasts and hot steaming core and am i a simpleton shrivel to a mummy indeed why youve the strength of ten men and their stamina are you so full of a mans seed faethor that you must spill it or burst then give it to me come let me suck it out of you and all your flightiness evaporate how does one deal with it one may not argue with a woman in such a mood i had only ever struck her the once and then was so filled with remorse that i could never strike her again i was so fond of her and so when she would catch me that way then i would make love to her to prove to her that no other had attracted me aye and shed keep me at it all through the night just to be sure id stay abed which only served to increase my fondness but there were times when i must be up and about and then i would employ a certain draught which taken with wine would serve to keep her still or i might stroke her and hypnotize her into a deep sleep so that i could be off into the night and of course marilena was right i lied to her i had only rarely sought out men for their lifeforce oh blood is blood be it the blood of bird or beast or even the nectar of another vampire when one such may be had but other than that sweet rarity manblood is superior or rather the blood of women once thibor had said to me you can do more to a girl than just eat her ah and the wallach was right but it was not so much that i myself would be unfaithful to marilena rather that the vampire within me demanded it or so i beg to excuse myself i did not go to szgany women even before marilena i had only ever gone to them for comfort never because i was hungry no for they were my own and i would not break their trust but i did have a liking for the ladies of certain foppish boyars there were a good many castles and rich houses in those days and often as not the men of such estates would be away on kings business there were wars in the world as i have said i remember one such lady of mine was a personage with royal connections a bathory called elspa aye and my evil was made manifest in the bathorys down all the centuries there was one born in called elisabeth who was married as a child to the count nadasdy as coincidence would have it his first name was ferencz oh haha i know what you are thinking well and why not incest is also the way of the vampire incest of the body and of the spirit and of the blood but if you are right what a delight eh to be wedded to my own tentimesgreatgranddaughter ah the bathorys and elisabeth the blood countess herself at least she is a legend even if i myself am nothing and so i am brought back to janos by incest and by the vile incest with which he first betrayed me where was i ah yes there he was in her to the hilt moaning like a bull and dripping sweat and semen and the bedroom all a shambles with clothing and bedclothes tossed here and there and other signs that their fornication had not been confined to a tabletop and her soft breasts red from his furious fondling while her thighs squeezed him further in this was what i saw from behind those curtains but more than what i saw what i heard my marilena calling her own son by my name faethor in that moment i might have torn down the curtains started forward and struck them both dead oh i wanted to be sure but why had she called him faethor then as he lifted her up from the table and staggered to and fro with her clinging to him still and jerking herself up and down upon his pole i saw her face how vacant it was despite the apparently animal lust her eyes round as saucers set in the paleness of flesh which should at least be flushed from her efforts and i knew at once that she was mazed hypnotized deeply then for the first time i knew how treacherous he was and how utterly he had fooled me i understood why my wamphyri powers had not worked on him because he had powers of his own which all this time hed kept hidden from me i understood too marilenas reluctance to let me go on those nights when i must fuel myself things she had said to me which made no sense at the time how she dreamed bad things when i was apart from her and could never remember what they were and how she bruised herself alone in her bed and woke up aching and worn out as from strenuous work aye strenuous all right for he had worked and used her on those occasions the while causing her to believe that was her lusty lover he imitated me to perpetrate his mothers rape and the thought that drove me most mad how often had he done it bursting into the room i took the curtains with me in a tangle upon my shoulders crossed swords were fixed upon a wall i tore them down and sprang upon janos with one of them raised high i went to split him down the middle but he saw me and turned his mother into the blow her skull was split in two with the brains leaking out even as she slumped in his embrace my fury evaporated in a moment and as janos grimaced and tossed my marilena from him i caught her up and cradled her in my arms he ran gibbering from the room leaving me alone with her grotesque corpse how long i sat there and rocked her who was no more i cannot say many mad schemes crossed my mind i would put something of my vampire into her enough to grow strong in her and heal her wound she was dead now but need not stay dead she could be undead except that then she would be changed my marilena no more but a wispy thrall to come ghosting whenever i called a vampire no i could not bear the thought of her like that when she would have no will but my will or i could open her up and perform an act of necromancy and learn all about my bastard sons infamy for even though she had been mazed to forget his handling of her her spirit would know of it her flesh would remember but i could not for i knew that even the dead feel the agony of the necromancers touch and i would cause her no more pain ah if only i had been a necroscope eh but at that time even the concept was unknown to me and so i sat there long and long until her blood and brains had dried upon me and she was grown stiff in my arms and as my despair waned a little so i commenced to think again and likewise my fury to wax i would kill janos of course inch by agonizing inch but before i could kill him i must first find him i composed myself called in unto me grigor zirra and others of my szgany chiefs some of them slept in the lower quarters of my castle where in softer times i had let them take up an almost permanent residence an end of that however for harder times were coming starting now i showed marilenas corpse to grigor and said your grandson did this whose zirra blood was impure henceforward the szgany zirra are accursed you are no longer welcome in the house of ferenczy take yourself and all of them who are yours and get you gone from here and from this time forward never let me find you in all the lands around when he had gone i turned to that chief of mine who upon a time had been forward with me familiar and loosetongued and how could things have come so far i demanded of him in my absence did you not keep guard over what was mine but my lord he answered it was your son you ordered to keep watch over your house and estates and he shrugged indifferently i thought i have not known your confidence or favours for many a year are you not szgany i grunted as wamphyri teeth sprouted in my skull and my talons grew into knives and am i not the ferenczy since when must i make request of that which is my birthright or make command of that which was ever your duty in my manner of speaking i was very quiet all of them in the room with me backed off a little except the one i questioned whom i had taken hold of by the shoulder then he pulled out a knife and made as if to stab me but i only smiled at him in my grim fashion and held him with my eyes and trembling he let the knife fall saying i i have betrayed your trust banish me also lord and let me go with the zirras i showed him my teeth in torn and bleeding gums and yawned to let him see the gape of my jaws he knew that i could close those jaws on his face and tear it off but i merely drew him towards the high window banish you i repeated him and is there a place of your liking anywhere he gasped anywhere at all lord out there out there i said glancing out the window so be it and before he could speak again i gathered him up and hurled him out and down he screamed once before his bones were broken on the rocks and then no more by then the lesser chiefs might have flown but i cautioned them against it only flee and i shall seek you out one by one and eat your hearts and when they were still go now and find my son find him and take me to him where i may deal with him and after that gather to me for i would speak with you of important things we shall make a great crusade you and i together faethor ferenczy will rise up and be a power in the world again and all of you shall earn your fortunes aye but it will be mans work and you shall earn them harrys friends and others a distant clanking momentarily distracted harry from the extinct vampires story excusing himself from listening he scanned across the wasteland of churned boggy earth and decaying partly demolished houses to a gaunt horizon even the sun falling warmly on his neck and drawing up vapour wraiths from the stagnant pools could not dispel the cheerlessness of the scene a handful of metal dinosaurs on the move strange silhouettes obscuring themselves in clouds of dust and blue exhaust smoke unlikely that the bulldozers would head this way but the sight of them working brought home to harry something of the hour it would be about nine oclock he still had to get back to bucharest his return flight to athens was booked for harry said faethor his mental voice faint as a sigh can feel the sun on the earth and it weakens me should i continue or shall we postpone it until another time harry thought about it hed already learned quite a lot about janos a vampire with enormous mental powers and yet according to faethor his son had not been a vampire in the fullest sense of the word not at that time almost eight hundred years ago so this wasnt simply an opportunity to learn more about him but also about vampires in general harry knew that he was already an authority but he felt there could never be a surfeit of knowledge about creatures such as these not when his life and the lives of others might very well depend upon it quite right said faethor very well let me continue i shall be brief as possible my szgany found the dog shivering in a cave high in the crags i went up to him and called him out he came to the entrance which opened onto a ledge in the face of a sheer cliff janos though young was big and very strong as big as thibor in his youth even as big as myself he was afraid but not craven he had cut himself a branch and sharpened it to a stake come no closer father he warned or ill pierce your vampire heart ah my son i told him with nothing of animosity but you have already done that what i thought you loved me indeed i knew it and i knew you loved your mother too though not how well you loved her and yet what in fact do i know about you except that you are my son very little it now appears and i moved a single pace forward into the cave at least you know i will kill you he gasped backing off if you should try to punish me punish you i let my shoulders slump shook my head in a sad fashion no i seek only an explanation you are of my flesh janos what and shall i punish my own son now of all times when of all creatures i am surely the most lonely oh i was angry be sure but is that so hard to understand and what did my rage get me eh your mother is dead now and gone from us and we are both without her whom we loved so dearly and now there is no more anger left in me you dont hate me he said hate you my own son again i shook my head it is simply that i do not understand i desire to understand you janos explain this thing you have done so that i may know you better and i stepped a little deeper inside the cave he backed off more yet but held his spear steady on me and now as if a dam had been broken the words flooded out of him i have hated you he said for you were cruel to me cold often indifferent and always different i was like you and yet unlike you i wanted so much to be like you in my entirety but could not often ive watched you become a blanket of flesh to soar like a curling leaf on the air but when i tried i always fell i wanted to inspire your fear in the hearts of men with a glance a word a thought but i was not a vampire and knew that if i tried they would only kill me like any common enemy so instead i must befriend them whom i despised get into their minds make them love me in order to gain their obedience in myself i looked a little like you but i could never be you and so i have hated you you desired to be me i repeated him yes because you have the power you have powers enough of your own i said great powers fantastic powers for which you must thank me and yet you hid them from me all these years i did not hide them he said scornfully i demonstrated them i used them to keep you out of my mind and will and even fullblown they remained secret you thought my mind was inferior incapable of knowing your talents and therefore unassailable by them that i was such a blank indeed a void no stylus could ever impress me so that when you discovered that you couldnt force yourself upon my mind you did not say ho he is strong but hah he is weak that was your ego father which is vast but not infallible aye i nodded thoughtfully when he was done much more to you than i suspected janos you do have certain powers but not your power he said you are a changing thing mysterious always different and i am always the same well and there you have it i told him with a shrug i am wamphyri and i desired to be he said but was only a strange man a halfling but does this excuse you i asked him is this reason enough that you should use your own mother as a whore to hate me for your own deficiencies was one error but to compound it by cleaving unto yes he cut me short it was my reason i wanted to be like you and could not and so hated you wherefore i would defile or suborn all that you most treasured first the szgany whom i would cause to love me if not above you then at least as your equal and then your woman who knew you better than anyone else in the world and in ways which only a lover could know you now i backed away from him and he followed after towards the mouth of the cave in your desire to be like me i said you determined to do the things i did and to know the things i knew even to the extent of knowing your own mother carnally i thought she might teach me things what i almost laughed but not quite the ways of the flesh janos a fathers task that surely i wanted nothing of you except to be you could you not try to be more affectionate towards me and so engender my affection his turn to laugh almost what as well seek sweetness in a lump of salt you are hard i told him lowvoiced perhaps we are not so far apart after all and so youd be wamphyri eh ah but youve much to learn before that day dawns what he said a look of incredulity crossing his face like a shadow and again in a whisper what are you saying that ah i held up a cautionary hand for now that he was fascinated i was in a position to cut him off aye not so very far apart at all and ill tell you something my oh so stupid jealous impatient son what you did was no rare thing neither vile nor even strange not to my thinking or the thinking of others like me what incest why the wamphyri have ever fucked their own and in more ways than one i tell you janos only be glad that you were born a man and mainly human for if you were another vampire oh id know how best to serve you aye and then youd know well enow the real meaning of rape my words should have warned him that i was not so forgiving as i seemed but they did not i had made him a halfpromise and he wanted the other half now you said did you mean can you teach me to be wamphyri something like that i answered and his spear was wavering now where he pointed it at me how would you do it not so fast i said first you must tell me how far youve progressed you have said you desire to be like me exactly like me which is to say wamphyri very well but meanwhile you have practised am i right so and what have you achieved he was sly ask me instead the things which i have not achieved all else is mine very well what eludes you i cannot alter my flesh change my shape fly that is a matter of the will over the flesh but only if it is wamphyri flesh yours is not still there are ways to change that what else you are a crafty necromancer once when a lone traveller passed this way you murdered him hidden in a secret place i saw you open his body and tease the various parts of him for all of his knowledge of the outside world you inhaled the gasses of his gut to learn from them you sucked his eyes to see what they had seen you rubbed the blood of his ruptured ears into your own to hear what they had heard later when a party of strange szgany passed by i stole away a girl child from them and used her in the same way as you had done so did i but i learned nothing and was very ill the wamphyri excel in necromancy i told him aye and its a rare art but even this may be taught had i been allowed into your mind i could have instructed you in this you thwarted yourself janos is there anything else your great strength he said i saw you chastise a man you picked him up and hurled him away like a small log and i have watched you in bed when others would have flagged your energy was boundless i used to think she had some secret marilena some ointment or trick to keep you hard another reason why i went to her i desired to know all of your secrets and in my turn there was something i too had to know did she ever suspect i asked him then he shook his head not once my eyes held her entirely in thrall she knew only what i wanted her to know did only as i instructed her to do and you caused her to think that you were me i growled so that she would hold nothing back and i went to grab him in that same moment the dog had read my mind until then i had kept it shielded from him but as the thought of him and marilena together returned to plague me all grip was lost he saw my thoughts my intentions avoided my grasp and lunged at me with his spear i was on the rim of the cliff i ducked to one side and his weapon tore my robe and grazed my shoulder i wrenched it from him and knocked him in the face with it his mouth was torn and his teeth broken in also he jerked away from me and slammed his head against the caves ceiling and as he collapsed i caught him up dazed he could do nothing as i carried him to the sheer rim his head lolled a little but his eyes were open watching me as i gave way to the vampire within to let its fury shape and reshape my face and form so i grunted then meshing my teeth where they came bursting through the ripped ridges of my jaws so and you would be wamphyri i showed him my hand which was changed to the talon of a primal beast you would be as i am but i would have you know janos that the only reason you are human at all is because of your mother i wanted her to have a child and gave her a monster but you called yourself a halfling and you are right you are neither one thing nor the other and no use to man nor beast you desire flesh you can mould to suit yourself so be it and i gathered up a gob of phlegm froth and blood onto my forked tongue and hurled it into his gaping mouth and massaged his throat until it was down he gagged and choked until his eyes stood out in his face but there was nothing he could do there i laughed at him madly let that grow in you and form the stretchy flesh you so desire and make your own flesh like unto itself aye for youll need something of the vampire in you if only to mend all your broken bones and without more ado i hurled him from the cliff janos was sorely broken all his bones as i had guaranteed and his flesh all torn on the rocks a man he would have died but there had always been something of me in him and now there was even more what i had spat into him spread faster than a cancer except that unlike a cancer it spared indeed saved his miserable life he would mend and live to serve my purpose before i went down into hungary and headed for zara i commanded those szgany i left behind me tend him well and when he is mended give him my instructions he is to stay here and guard my castle and lands so that when i return there will be a welcome for me until then he is the master here and his will be done so let it be then i went to join the great crusade the substance and outcome of which you already know as faethors voice tailed away harry looked up and all around and saw that the bulldozers were toiling now only two hundred yards away an old raddled relic of a house went down in dust and shuddering debris and harry fancied he felt the earth shake a little faethor felt it too will they get this far today do you think the necroscope shook his head i shouldnt think so in any case they seem to be working at random and dont appear to be in too much of a hurry will it affect you mean when they level this place theres not much of it left to level anyway affect me no nothing can do that for im no more but it may make it damned hard to eavesdrop upon the dead with all that rumble going on and harry sensed the extinct monsters hideous grin as the monster in turn sensed the inevitability of a concrete tomb probably in the heart of a bustling factory complex a grin yes for faethor would not accept harrys concern wouldnt even acknowledge it pointless therefore to say well i hope youll be ok but the necroscope said it anyway and quickly before his embarrassment could show through but now i have to get on my way ive learned a lot from you i think and of course im grateful for the power of deadspeak which youve returned to me if i may ill contact you again however by night of course and probably from afar so that you can finish your story for i know that after the fourth crusade you came back to wallachia and put an end to thibor and there must have been more between you and janos too since he is only recently risen i know someone must have put him down you faethor i would suspect he sensed the vampires grim nod well what was done once may be done a second time with your assistance you are welcome harry any time for after all that is our dual purpose to return him to dust and now be on your way i would like to rest a while in whatever peace is left to me while i may but as harry took up his holdall so his feet squelched in the slime of the rotting toadstools their scent reached him in a single poisonous waft and ugh he couldnt hold back the exclamation of detestation and faethor picked it up and perhaps saw in his mind something of the cause what he said mushrooms his mental voice was a little sharp harry thought and suddenly nervous perhaps the finality of his situation was affecting him after all the necroscope shrugged mushrooms toadstools fungi anyway the sun is steaming them away he felt faethors shudder and could have bitten off his tongue his last sentence had been thoughtlessly cruel but what the hell why should anyone feel sorry about the fate of a longdead morbid and totally evil thing like a vampire goodbye he said heading out of faethors ruined house back towards the graveyard and the dusty road beyond farewell that unquiet spirit answered him and harry dont linger over what you must do but seek to make a quick end of it time may well be of the essence harry waited a moment more but faethor didnt elaborate as harry climbed the rear wall of the old cemetery and stepped down among the plots and leaning slabs someone very close to him said harry harry keogh he jumped a foot and glanced all around but no one there of course not for it was deadspeak at work without the terrible mental agony hed come to associate with it hed been denied the use of his macabre talent for so long that it would take a little time to get used to it again did i startle you asked the voice of some dead soul im sorry but we heard you talking to that dead thing who listens and we knew it must be you harry keogh the necroscope for who else among the living could it be talking to the dead and who else would even want to talk to or befriend such a thing as that only you harry who have no enemies among the great majority oh ive a few harry eventually hesitantly answered but mainly i get on with the teeming dead well enough yes now the entire graveyard came as it were to life before there had been a hush an aching void to camouflage a pentup something but now that something burst its banks like a river in flood and a hundred voices suddenly required harrys attention they were full of the usual queries of the dead how were those theyd left behind doing in the world of the living what was happening in that bustling world of corporeal being where minds were housed in flesh would it be possible for harry to deliver a message to this oh so wellremembered and loved father or mother or sister or lover and so on why he could spend a lifetime simply answering the questions and running the many errands of the inhabitants of this one cemetery but no sooner had he issued that thought than they knew and recognized its truth and the mental babble quickly died down it isnt that i dont want to he tried to explain but that i cant you see to the living youre dead and gone forever and apart from a handful of colleagues im the only one who knows youre still here but changed do you think it would help if all your still living friends and loved ones knew that you too remained extant it wouldnt it would only serve to make their grief that much worse theyd think of you as being in some vast and terrible prison camp beyond the body well its bad enough i know but not that bad especially now that youve learned to communicate among yourselves but we cant tell that to the living you left behind you for if we did those whove stopped mourning and returned to whats left of their own lives why theyd start all over again and im afraid there would always be fake necroscopes to take advantage of them youre right of course harry their spokesman answered then its just that its such a rare indeed unique treat to speak with a member of the living i mean but we can sense your urgency and we certainly didnt intend to hold you up harry wandered amidst the plots some ancient and others quite new and inquired how will it affect you when they get through levelling whats left around here i mean youll still be here i know that no matter what happens but wont it bother you that your graves have been disturbed but they wont be harry an area planning council member late of ploiesti spoke up for this cemetery has a preservation order on it oh its true a lot of graveyards have been reduced to rubble but this one at least escapes ceausescus madness and i pride myself that i was in part instrumental but i had to be why members of my family the bercius have been buried here for centuries and families should stick together right radu berciu chuckled however wrily ah but i never thought that id benefit personally or at least not so soon for just nine days after i brought that preservation order into being why i myself died of a heart attack harry was thoughtful enough to enquire are there any more here only recently dead for he knew from past experience that theyd be the ones hardest hit not yet recovered from the trauma of death at least he could find the time to speak to them before moving on and eventually a pair of voices sad young and very lost found strength to answer him oh yes harry said one were the zaharia brothers ion and alexandru said the other we were killed in an accident working on the new road a tanker crashed and spilled its fuel where we were brewing tea on a brazier we burned and both of us with new wives if only there were some way to let them know that we felt nothing that there was no pain but there must have been harry couldnt disguise his astonishment yes one of the zaharias answered but wed like them to believe there wasnt otherwise they could stay awake every night for the rest of their lives listening to us scream as we burned wed like to spare them that at least harry was moved but there was nothing he could do for them not yet anyway listen he said it could be that i may be able to help not now but at some time in the future soon i hope if and when that time comes ill let you know right now though i cant promise you any more than that harry they tried to tell him in unison their voices overlapping thats more than enough youve given us hope in that we now know we have a friend in a place otherwise beyond our reach all of the teeming dead should be so lucky and indeed they are lucky that youre the one with the power he moved on out of the cemetery and into the dusty road turning right in the direction of bucharest behind him the excited graveyard voices gradually faded talking among themselves now of him rather than to him and he knew hed made a lot of new friends a mile down the road however he met two who were not his friends on the contrary the black car passed him heading where hed just been but hearing the sudden squeal of its brakes he looked back and saw it make a rocking uturn and from that moment he felt he was in trouble then as the car drew up alongside and stopped and as its occupants jumped out he knew he was in trouble they werent in uniform but still harry would know their sort anywhere hed met them before not these two in particular but others exactly like them which wasnt strange for they were all very much of a kind in their dark grey suits and felt hats with soft rims which might have been borrowed right out of the thirties they were the romanian equivalent of russias kgb the securitatea one was small thin ferretfaced the other tall wooden and lurching their faces were almost expressionless hidden in the shade of their hats identity card the small one growled holding out a hand and snapping his fingers work ticket said the other more slowly papers documents authorization they had both spoken english but harry was so badly taken by surprise that he fell straight into their simple trap i i have only my passport he said also in english and reached for it in his inside jacket pocket before he could produce his forged greek passport the small thin one thrust an ugly automatic pistol into his side carefully if you please mr harry keogh he rasped and as harrys hand came back slowly into view so the document was snatched from him and passed to the larger of the two then while the small one expertly frisked him the wooden one opened up his passport and studied it after a moment he held it out where his comrade could glance at it without looking away from harry they both grinned coldly and without humour and harry thought how well they imitated sharks but he also knew they had him and for now there was nothing he could do about it the last time anything like this had happened to him was when hed first gone to speak with mцbius in a leipzig cemetery on that occasion he had made his escape through the mцbius continuum also hed made use of an expert and practical knowledge of the martial arts taught to him by several dead masters well and he was still an expert with many years of practice behind him but at that earlier time hed been a far younger man less experienced and wont to panic he was much calmer now and with every reason in the years flown between harry had faced terrors such as these two thugs could scarcely imagine and so we are mistaken the wooden one said his command of english slightly guttural but still very good especially in its sarcastic inflection you are not this harry keogh after all but a greek gentleman named hari kiokis ah a dealer in antiques i see but a greek who speaks only english the one with the ferrets face was more direct where did you stay last night harry he prodded the snout of his pistol deep into harrys ribs what traitor gave you shelter eh mr spy i i stayed with no one harry answered which wasnt entirely true he indicated his holdall i slept in the open my sleepingbag is in here the tall one took the holdall from him and opened it and pulled out the sleepingbag it had a little mud on it and a few stains from the grass and now the special policemans face wasnt so wooden if anything he looked bewildered but only for a moment ah i see he said then your contact didnt show up and so youve had to make the best of things very well then perhaps youll tell us who was supposed to meet you eh no one said harry as an idea began to form in his head its just that sleeping out is cheap and i enjoy a little fresh air thats all and in any case what business is it of yours youve seen my passport and know who i am but who the hell are you if youre policemen id like to see some sort of identification and while they stared at him and at each other in something of astonishment so he reached out with his deadspeak to the minds of his new friends in the graveyard half a mile away he spoke to ion and alexandru zaharia and his message was simple and to the point im under threat from two men your countrymen im afraid securitatea without your help im done for harry got so much out and only so much before the small one kicked him in the groin he saw it coming and managed to deflect most of it but still he collapsed rolling in feigned agony in the dust of the road there now said the wooden one his voice cold and empty of emotion you see you see youve angered corneliu you really must try harry keogh to be more cooperative our patience is by no means infinite he went to the back of the car opened it and threw harrys things in but he placed the forged passport in his own pocket but what can we do harry ion zaharias anxious voice came to him where he huddled on his side playing for time we could try to but no for youre too far away wed never get to you in time no harry answered you stay right where you are only dig yourselves out thats all you and anyone else who well whos still in shape and who wants to help but dont go wasting yourselves trying to come to me for i think i know how to bring these bastards to you jacket the small thin one corneliu snapped quickly harry sat up halfshrugged out of his jacket before it was snatched from his back all very disappointing really said the other one who wasnt so much wooden now as disdainful superior we fully expected that we would have to shoot you such things they told us about you such problems youve caused our friends across the border and yet you dont seem very desperate to me harry keogh perhaps your reputation is undeserved harry had given up all thoughts of trying to bluff it out they knew well enough who he was if not what that was all a long time ago he said when i was younger im not so foolish now i know when the game is up an openbacked truck rumbled by heading for bucharest in the back seated on benches along the sides twin rows of men and women mainly aging peasants faced each other their eyes were uniformly empty of hope they scarcely glanced at harry where he kneeled in the dirt with a pair of thugs standing over him they had troubles of their own they were the destitute the homeless ones their lives blighted by ceausescus blind uncaring agroindustrial policy well the game is most certainly up for you my friend the tall one continued youll know of course that they want you for espionage and sabotage and murder oh a great deal of the latter apparently he took out handcuffs so much in fact that i think well just immobilize you a little one can never be too careful you look harmless enough and youre unarmed but he put the cuffs on locking harrys hands together return air tickets to rhodos cigarettes and matches and a lot of american dollars thats all and to harry get up he was bundled into the back of the car with the small one beside him holding his gun on him the tall lurching one got into the drivers seat and so you were heading for the airport the latter said well we shall give you a lift we have a small room there where we can wait for the flight from moscow and after that you are out of our hands he started the car and headed for bucharest i dont get it said harry genuinely puzzled since when have the securitatea been big friends with the kgb i would have thought the ussrs glasnost and perestroika were totally at odds with what ceausescu is doing or perhaps you two as a team are a twoedged sword eh is that it are you working for two bosses mr er shut up the ferret scraped his gun down harrys ribs no let him talk their driver merely shrugged it amuses me to discover how little they know in the west he glanced over his shoulder and how much of what they do know is based on guesswork mr keogh you may call me eugen and why not since our acquaintance will be so short but does it surprise you that russia has friends in romania when romania has been a satellite and neighbour of the ussr for so very long why next youll be telling me that there are no russian agents in england or france or america no i cant believe youre that naive youre kgb harry frowned no were securitatea when it suits us to be but you see compared to the leu the rouble has always been so very strong and stable and we all must look to our futures eh we all must retire sooner or later he glanced back smiled at harry and gradually let the smile slide from his face in your case sooner so these two were in the pockets of the kgb who in turn would have a section working with harrys old friends at the soviet ebranch hq in moscow it was the russian espers who were raising their ugly head again they remembered bronnitsy too well and desired to pay harry back for it yes and they must fear him mightily first wellesleys crazy plot in bonnyrig and now this he would be smuggled quietly out of romania and into the ussr handed over to soviet ebranch and simply disappear or at least that was the scenario as they had worked it out but it told harry quite a lot if he was to be smuggled out of romania then patently the actual romanian authorities didnt know about him at all to them he was simply what his passport said he was hari kiokis a perfectly legitimate businessman from greece it made sense the kgb had contacted their own in romania men who could be trusted to expedite the job because to try to arrange any other kind of extradition would only prove to be lengthy and frustrating so maybe there was something to be said for ceausescus way of running the show after all er eugen he said it seems to me that your main task was simply to pick me up so why didnt you do it yesterday at the airport because you needed to avoid publicity that was one reason the tall one answered over his shoulder also we thought to kill two birds with one stone tail you and discover your contact you must have come here to see someone after all so we simply followed your taxi but alas a puncture these things happen later we picked up your taxi driver and he showed us where hed dropped you off also he said youd be catching a bus back into the city in the morning now that was frustrating all that driving up and down since dawn waiting for you to put in an appearance as a last resort of course we would be obliged to return to bucharest and wait for you at the airport there is only one flight to athens today as it happened however that wasnt necessary there was no contact harry suddenly blurted it out i was just just supposed to leave certain instructions and pick up certain information he was taking a chance they knew almost nothing about him except that he was to be detained for their russian bosses also time was getting shorter by now his friends in the cemetery back there should be very nearly ready for him eugen applied the brakes slowed the car to a halt you left instructions theres a drop back there yes harry lied and the information you picked up where is that it wasnt there thats why i waited all night to collect it this morning but it still wasnt there eugen turned around in his seat and stared at harry with narrowed eyes you are being very open my friend i take it this all has to do with our peasant fifthcolumnists right harry tried to look frightened which wasnt at all hard he knew nothing about romanias peasant fifthcolumnists but he did understand something of the psychology of thugs such as these something like that he said but you said you have a room at the airport well i think id rather tell you everything now than have comrade corneliu here beat it out of me in private later a great shame corneliu grunted and shrugged still i might beat you anyway eugen said you will show us this letter drop if it will make life easier for me yes harry answered hah scoffed corneliu this one tough and to harry are they all girls your british spies harry shrugged in fact he knew very little about standard british spies only about espers mindspies eugen turned the car around and backtracked there was no more conversation until harry called a halt at the entrance to the graveyard its in here he said then the letter drop they all got out of the car and corneliu used his gun to prod harry on ahead as he went he sent his deadspeak before him were here one of them at least has a gun trained on me in the moment that he sees you hell be distracted thats when i plan to disarm him is everything ok were ok harry the zaharias answered at once and there are several others who wouldnt be dissuaded we dont know if theyll be much good but strength in numbers eh i dont see you harry looked worriedly all about are you in hiding the others are just under the soil harry ion zaharia told him and were out of our boxes in our sarcophagus harry remembered the zaharias had been buried in the same plot and had a joint sarcophagus its heavy beautifully veined lid standing some eighteen inches above the surrounding marble chips of their plot they hadnt seemed to mind him sitting there for a few moments while he was talking to them so they were waiting under the lid eh well and that should come in very handy move keogh corneliu growled shoving him forward down an aisle between rows of leaning headstones where is this drop anyway right there harry pointed ahead he moved to the huge tomb and stood looking down at its massive lid i had to lever it to one side but together we should slide it easily enough once we lift it from its groove he hoped that the thugs hadnt noticed how ripe the air was and how much worse the smell was growing from second to second but this was something he dare not ask oh eugen grinned mirthlessly desecration too eh why you should be ashamed of yourself harry keogh posting letters to the dead they cant answer you you know and to corneliu you hold your gun on him while i give him a hand how wrong you are harry thought as he and the tall agent strained at the lid which suddenly and very easily slid to one side the necroscope had expected that certainly and held his breath but corneliu and eugen had not and didnt nor were they expecting what happened next in the moment after the tombs trapped gasses whooshed out god eugen staggered back his hands flying to his nose and mouth but corneliu standing back a little simply gasped and bugged his eyes and the weapon in his hand seemed to automatically transfer its aim from harrys back to what was first sitting up then standing and finally reaching out from the shadowy mouth of the tomb before he could squeeze the trigger if indeed sufficient strength remained for that harry broke his wrist with a kick he seemed to have been saving for years the gun went flying and so did corneliu directly into the burned and blistered blue and tombgrey hands of the zaharias the brothers grabbed and held him stared at him with their dead bubble eyes and threatened him with blackened bone teeth in straining scorched cartilage jaws the other agent eugen gibbering as he crashed through the ancient bramblegrown plots towards the graveyards exit didnt even pause to look back until he ran into what was waiting for him those others of whom the zaharias had reported they wouldnt be dissuaded and for all that they were mainly fragmentary or possibly because thats what they were these crumbling crawling spastically kicking parts of corpses stopped eugen dead in his tracks one of them was a woman whose legs and life had been lost in a terrible accident longburied her breasts were rotting onto her belly sloughing away from her in grotesque lumps but still she stood upright on her stumps and found a supernatural strength to cling to eugens shuddering thighs where he danced and screamed to heaven for mercy and tried to push her face away from his midriff finally he succeeded and the vertebrae of her neck parted her entire head flopped over backwards like that of a broken doll as if it were hinged exposing maggots where they seethed in her throat and fed on ravaged flesh and torn tendons with a series of frenzied leaps and kicks born of the sheer terror of his situation at last eugen freed himself from the dead womans crumbling torso and reached inside his jacket he brought out an automatic pistol and cocked it turning it upon others of these impossibly animated parts where they came crawling or jerking towards him harry didnt want that gun to go off eugens screams were bad enough gunshots might easily attract investigators the dead picked up harrys concern as surely as any spoken word and moved to dispel it the pile of loathsomeness which was the legless woman struggled upright and toppled itself against eugens weapon and her mouldy hands drew its barrel into the trembling jelly cavity of her neck with her trunk she deadened the sound of eugens first shot while harry saw to it that there wouldnt be a second one coming upon the agent from behind and clenching his manacled hands he rabbitpunched him unconscious and as he fell kicked the gun from his hand collapsing eugen saw harrys face fading slowly into darkness and wondered why nothing of horror was written in his strange soulful eyes regaining consciousness a few minutes later the tall awkward secret policeman was sure that what hed experienced had been a vivid and especially terrifying nightmare until he actually opened his eyes and looked around then my god oh my god he burst out for a moment his eyes bulged and then he closed them again tightly dont faint harry warned him ive only so much time left and there are things i want to know if i dont get the answers i need these dead people will probably be angry with you eugen kept his eyes closed harry harry keogh he finally gasped but these people theyre dead i just said they were harry told him you see thats where your friends across the border made their mistake they told you who i am but not what i am they didnt tell you how many friends i have or that theyre all dead the other mumbled something in romanian began to gibber hysterically calm down harry told him at once and speak english forget that the people holding you are dead just think of them as my friends wholl do anything they have to in order to protect me god i can smell them eugen wailed and harry suspected that he wasnt getting through to him he hardened look you were going to hand me over to the kgb who in turn would have tortured me for things they want to know then killed me so why should i go easy on you now you can get a grip on yourself and start answering my questions or i give up on you get out of it and leave you here with them eugen struggled a little then sat very still as the movements hed made stirred up fresh waves of tombstink he could feel dead rubbery fingers holding his arms his eyes were still tightly closed just tell me one thing he said am i mad god i cant breathe thats another thing harry told him the longer youre here with my friends the more chances youre taking with your health diseases proliferate in the dead eugen youre not only smelling them but youre breathing them too eugens head lolled and harry thought he was about to pass out the necroscope slapped him twice hard frontand backhanded the agents eyes snapped open glared then swivelled left and right as his situation reimpressed itself upon his mind and his momentary rage shrank down again the zaharias held him they were kneeling inside their exposed tomb reaching out of it to pinion his arms and hold him down where he was seated with his back to their sarcophagus and they looked at him with their glazed dead fish eyes the romanian agent at once turned his gaze away from them looked straight ahead at harry the necroscope was down on one knee in front of eugen staring hard at him and behind keogh other dead things formed a halfcircle amidst the rank grasses brambles and tombstones some of these were mummied fragments sere and shrivelled dry as paper but others were wet and all of them moved trembled threatened however mutely the friends of harry keogh a group of them were gathered about the prone form of corneliu who had fainted from a combination of shock and the agony of his broken wrist all of this eugen took in and at last the trapped terrified agent asked are they going to kill me not if you tell me what i have to know then ask it first you can get these off me said harry and he held out his hands with eugens handcuffs still in place the dead are great at taking hold and refusing to let go but not much for fumbling about with things theyre not as nimble as the living eugen stared at him and wondered who was the more frightening the dead or harry keogh the necroscope was so matteroffact about things ion zaharia reluctantly released eugens hand so that he could get the key out of his pocket but alexandru ions brother was taking no chances he gripped the agents neck in his elbow and clung that much tighter finally harry was free of the cuffs and rubbing his wrists he stood up youre not leaving me here eugens face was white with eyes like holes punched in papiermache harry shrugged thats up to you first answer my questions and then well see whats to be done with you and your unpleasant little friend here he crossed to corneliu and recovered his air ticket cigarettes and matches then came back kneeled down again and took back his passport from eugen and the first thing i want to know he said is will i still be able to use this or will there be people looking for me at the airport what im saying is were you two alone on this or do others of the securitatea work for the kgb they might do i dont know eugen answered but we were on our own on this one they got in touch with us a telephone call its easy and told us what plane youd be on from athens we were to pick you up hold you until someone came to collect you theres a flight due in from moscow at pm so i should be able to go on back into bucharest and simply board my plane eugen looked surly said nothing until ion pushed his hideous face very close and held up a warning finger and yes for gods sake eugen gasped god said harry reaching into the agents pocket for the keys to his car harry wasnt sure he still believed in god and he certainly couldnt understand why the dead should not in the heaven which they had been granted but they did as hed discovered in several conversations god was hope he supposed but while harry wouldnt personally describe as a blasphemy the mere fact of the deitys spoken name still it set his teeth on edge hearing it as an exclamation from one such as eugen and you know all about him do you what said the other as harry stood up again about who it was as harry had expected eugen knew nothing about him well im going now said harry but im afraid youre staying right here you and corneliu because i know i cant let you walk not just yet anyway so youll remain the honoured guests of my friends until im well out of it but once im safely airborne then ill let these people know they can release you and themselves youll let them know eugen had started shuddering and couldnt control it how will you let ill shout said harry with a mirthless grin dont worry theyll hear me but what if he starts shouting first ion zaharia asked as harry walked out of the graveyard then stop him harry answered and but try not to kill them lifes precious as you know well enough so let them live what they have left and anyway theyre not worthy to be in here with such as you harry drove very carefully back to bucharest parked the car in the airport car park and locked it and pressed the keys into the soil of a large flowerpot in the booking lounge then just five minutes past his actual reporting time he handed in his ticket and luggage it was the same as when hed come in no one looked at him twice the olympia airlines plane took off just eleven minutes late at as it turned its nose south for bulgaria and the aegean harry was rewarded by the sight of an aeroflot jet going in for a landing there would be a brighteyed couple of lads on board just dying to get their hands on him well so let them die forty minutes later with the aegean just swimming up into view through the circular windows harry reached out with his deadspeak to the cemetery outside ploiesti how are things alls well harry no ones been in here and these two havent been a problem the big one did faint eventually his small friend came to took one look and passed out again harry said ion alexandru all of you dont have the words to thank you you dont need any can we just leave these two where they are now and dig ourselves in again harrys nod was reflex as he reclined his seat and lay back a little the dead in the romanian graveyard picked it up anyway and began to disperse back to their resting places thanks again harry told them withdrawing his thoughts and allowing himself some small relaxation for the first time in well in a day at least dont mention it was their response harry tried to get faethor if he could contact the others as easily as that communication with the longdead father of vampires should be no problem after a few seconds of concentration he got through harry i see you are safe ah but youre the resourceful one harry keogh you knew i was in trouble as ive told you before i sometimes overhear things did you want something it seemed to me we might save ourselves some time harry answered have nothing to do right now and in a little while my head will be full of the clutter of friends and the atmosphere of a friendly place not that im complaining so i thought maybe now would be a good time for you to tell me the rest of janoss story theres not much more to tell but if you wish it i wish it and very well my son faethor sighed so be it as has been told i was away for three hundred years three centuries of blood the great crusade was only the start of it later i served genghis khan and then his grandson batu in i assisted and delighted in the taking of kiev and in burning it to ashes eventually it was time for me to die and return as fereng the black son of the fereng then under hulegu in i helped bring down baghdad ah such years of bloodshed pillage and rape but the mongols were on the wane and by the turn of the century i had forsaken them in order to fight for islam oh yes i was an ottoman me a turk a moslem ghazi ah what it is to be a mercenary eh and with the turks for one and a half centuries more i revelled in blood and death and the sheer glut of war in the end however i had lived with them too long and so was obliged to desert their cause ah well and it was crumbling anyway and so finally i returned and put thibor down then took me off into the unchanged and unchanging mountains to seek out janos and see how well he had kept house for me in the interim however i had kept my ears open wamphyri ears are delicate instruments be sure and miss very little aye and they had always been alert for news of my sons thibor and janos well of the former we know and of the latter where thibor had been greedy for blood janos had been simply greedy in my time abroad he had had many interests but mainly hed been a thief a pirate a corsair does it surprise you it should not for the barbary pirates had their origin in petty princelings who rose up during the christianmoslem conflicts of the crusades that then had been janoss chiefest business during the time of my absence a grand thief on the broad bosom of the mediterranean to loot them who had looted others and now hes a sailor again eh well and why not oh he knows the sea well enough that one who now for a profession brings up treasure from the ocean and digs for it in the islands around hah and who pray would know better where to find it since he was the one who laid it down more than five hundred years ago and what was that all about you may wonder that great squirreling for nuts as if some fearsome winter were about to descend but it was it was aye just such a winter for janos had worked hard at his art to look well into the future and had not liked what he saw there for one thing he had doubtless seen my return and he did not need to look to know how i would deal with him and so he had made provision for another time far beyond the hour of my revenge this present time of course when he is up again and about in the world of men but my revenge for what the loss of marilena was three to four hundred years in my wake and i could have killed him then for that so what now i will tell you first for his desertion from my cause to go apirating he must first vacate my house second for his treatment of my szgany for in the early years of my absence he had kicked out the szgany ferengi and reinstated the filthy zirra whom i had cursed third and last but not least for the way in which he greeted me when at last i was returned on my way i had gathered faithful gypsies to me who had remembered me through all the years of my exile not the originals no for they were dust but the sons of their sons ah they remember legends the szgany but when i went up to my castle i went alone by night for a task force would be too obvious and could only appear threatening alas when i was come there i saw the place a ruin well perhaps not quite so bad but near enough the battlements were broken earthworks without were untended the repair in general was bad left to fend for itself through much of my absence the place had suffered but janos done with pirating now and returned to other pursuits was to house and just as i had tried to follow his career so he had followed mine he knew i was coming guards were out with clear instructions i was challenged and upon identifying myself was set upon they had sharpened hardwood staves they had crossbows with wooden bolts they carried the curved long knives of the turks silver they had too on their weapons and garlic in which to steep them and each party of men they had casks of oil and torches with which to fire itto burn what i ask you i fled them up into the crags and for many a mile in the high places i limped scurried cried out in some great pain kept barely ahead of my pursuers they knew i was injured and that they would have me janos sent out his entire household to hunt me down but i merely lured them what faethor ferenczy with his tail between his legs running from zirra scum aha for while they were out chasing me my own small but faithful szgany army were up and into my house into all of its stations and down behind its earthworks and high in the peaks i turned on my trackers laughed and slew a few then launched myself into the night and glided down to my castle as of old and there i discovered janos trapped and brought him to his knees the zirras when they came straggling home were met by mine who slew them out of hand some escaped the slaughter and word went out in a little while no more came the survivors had fled into the night and the countryside around to become travellers once more as of old and it was then i discovered janoss several subsidiary interests with which he had occupied himself while i had been away then too i saw how severely i had underestimated him my castle had been built upon the foundations of another earlier house whose basements janos had uncovered and he had seen to it that these were extended outwards into the roots of the crags around down into the rock of the mountain itself to what end there lay the measure of my underestimation janos had told me he desired to be wamphyri ah but how he had desired it now in those days necromancy was an art certain common men had discovered the way of it they practised it much as a vampire might but without his natural instinct for it janos knew i was a crafty necromancer and would emulate me but i had declined to teach him my techniques wherefore he had determined to discover methods of his own doubtless hed consulted with many necromancers to learn their ways the extensive cellars of the castle were mazy and secret whose stairs and passageways were known only to janos and a handful of his men all of whom were now either fled or dead but i went down with him to see what he had been about and there discovered tombloot from all wallachia and transylvania and the lands around no not treasure as such but tombloot do you know that in prehistory it was the way of men to burn their dead and bury their ashes in vases of course you do for the habit has survived why theres as much burning as burying even to the present day but the thracians they had entombed a great many of their dead in this fashion and janos had been busy digging them up again and once more you will ask to what end to inquire of them their secrets to fetch the dead to life and torment them for their histories to invest their very ashes with flesh which he could torture for the thracians were heavy in gold and as i have said janos was greedy nothing is new eh an hundred two hundred even three hundred years later necromancers were still calling up spirits in order to discover their treasures your own edward kelly and john dee were two such but fakers both of them i consulted with them in my time and know this for a fact as for janoss method it was simplicity in itself first remove a burial urn to his castle vaults where by use of those arts he had mastered its salts might be reconstituted chain the poor wretch so obtained and torture him for knowledge of his kith and kin the locations of their graves etcetera and their hoards in turn and so forth in the pursuit of which policy janos had amassed a veritable graveyard of despoiled pots and urns and lekythoi such as to fill several large rooms intrigued i demanded a demonstration of his art and janos knowing i had still to deal with him and seeking to please me proceeded he tipped out salts upon the floor and by use of strange words in an invocation of power lo and behold conjured from these cinders a thracian woman of exceeding beauty her language was archaic in the extreme but not beyond understanding certainly it was not beyond my understanding for i was wamphyri and expert in tongues moreover she knew she was dead and that this was a great blasphemy and begged of janos that he not use her again from which i knew that this bastard son of mine not only called up the dead into former semblance but had more uses for some of them than simply to question them as to the whereabouts of buried treasure how grand my excitement was such that i had her before allowing him to reduce her back to ashes you must teach me this thing i told him that is the least you can do to atone for your many sins against me he agreed and showed me how to mix certain chemicals and human salts together then carefully inscribed two sets of words upon a stretched skin the first set alongside an ascending arrow thus was the invocation as such and the second marked was the devolution bravo i cried then when i had the thing i must put it to the test as you see he indicated all his many jars and urns you have a wide choice indeed i have i answered gravely and stroked my chin and before he knew what i was about i drew out a wooden stake from beneath my cloak and pinned him this did not serve to kill him no for he had a vampire in him it merely immobilized him then i called down some trusted men of mine from the castle and burned janos to ashes even while he frothed and moaned and eventually screamed a little aye and when these ashes of his these essential salts were cool i had them sifted applied his several chemical powders and used his own magic to have him up again and did he scream then you may believe he did the heat of the fire a mercifully short travail had been nothing compared to the unendurable agony of the fact that he was now and eternally and utterly in my power so i thought but alas his screaming was not borne of this knowledge but of a wrenching a tearing a division of being which i shall explain in a moment but oh to see those clouds of smoke puff up from his dry dusty remains a great upheaval of smoke and fumes from which stumbled janos naked and screaming but a miracle he was not alone there with him but entirely apart was his vampire my spittle grown to a live thing but a creature with little or nothing of its own intelligence it was leech snail serpent a great blind slug and all unused to going on its own it too mewled though i know not how but i did know the answer to the riddle in burning janos i had burned two creatures and raising him up again i had also revitalized two but in their separate parts then i had me a thought i brought forward my cowering men and commanded them that they take janos and hold him down and so you would be wamphyri eh i said approaching him with my sword and so you shall be this creature here is a vampire but has very little of a brain it shall have yours he screamed again once before i took his head and splitting his skull i took out from it his living dripping brain you can guess the rest im sure using janoss own process and keeping his body apart i devolved his head and vampire both into one heap of ashes which i placed in an urn among the others and then i laughed and laughed till i cried for if by any fluke he should be brought back now it would be as as what a clever slug an intelligent leech why it would amuse me to call him up again and see but alas that was not to be for in the end hed thwarted me the skin upon which hed written his runes had been resurrected skin flayed from a victim i had directed my runes of catabolism through the very skin from which i read them and so when id sent janos down the skin too had crumbled into dust well the words of power were tricky and i had not learned them except the single name of an ancient dark god of the outer spheres however i still had my bastard sons body so i burned that too aye a second time and sent pinches of it out to the four corners of the earth and there dispersed them on the winds that was the end of it i had done with janos and now i have done with my story first and second blood as faethor finished so there came a cabin announcement the plane was now descending towards athens harry said faethor in another ten to fifteen minutes ill be on the ground and into the bustle of the airport ive noticed that youve been growing weaker your voice and put it down to distance and the sun full on the ruins of your house soon ill be on my way to rhodes which is more distant yet so this is probably my last chance to say a few things you have something to say first i owe you my thanks harry told him but second i cant help but remind myself that without you in the first place none of this thibor dragosani yulian bodescu and now janos would ever have happened ok so im in your debt but at the same time i know you for the blackhearted thing you have been and for the monsters youve spawned in my world and id be a liar if i didnt tell you that in my opinion youre the biggest monster of them all i consider it a compliment faethor answered without hesitation is there anything else you require to know a few things yes said harry if you destroyed janos so utterly how come hes back i mean what trick did he work what dark magic did he leave behind him to bring him back into the world and why did he wait so long why now is it not obvious faethor sounded genuinely surprised by harrys naivet he had seen the far future and laid his plans accordingly he had known would put him down that time when i returned to the mountains yes and he knew that if he came back in my time i would find a way to do it again and so he must wait until i was gone from the world time is but a small thing to the wamphyri harry as to how he worked this clever trick it was those accursed zirras aye and i know it was them for ive had it from my own faithful few who mutter in their graves much like other men ill tell you how it was long after me and mine were gone from the castle on the heights certain of janoss own returned and placed his vampire ashes in a secret place which hed prepared against just such an eventuality for hed learned other magicks in my three hundred years absence of which this was one hed had zirra women in his time that bastard of mine and sown his seed far and wide the threefingered son of a son of his would one day feel his allure and go up to the old castle in the mountains but it would be janos who came down from it so he planned it and so it has come to pass and all the treasure hed looted from ancient tombs did you never find it harry pressed didnt you search the place your own castle i searched a little faethor answered but have you not listened the treasure was elsewhere buried again or sunken in the sea until this later time when he could have it up of course harry nodded id forgotten as for searching the place in its entirety no i did not not every hole the dog had digged i no longer felt that it was mine but that he had fouled it i could smell him even taste him everywhere the castle had his mark on it where his despicable sigil was carved into the very stone the redeyed bat rising from its urn he had used the place and made it his own and i wanted no more of it shortly i moved on as for my own history after that time that does not concern you so the castle still stands harry mused in a little while and in its roots what does anything remain of janoss tombloot his experiments with necromancy i wonder for after all it appears thats where he came from in this most recent resurgence and faethor knew that harry was thinking of another castle in the carpathians but on the russian side in a region once called the khorvaty and still called by some bukovina for that had been faethors home too upon a time and what had been done there and left there to scream and fester in the earth had been monstrous so that harry knew there was a grave peril in certain ruins i can understand your concern the vampire told him but i think it is unfounded for my place in the heights over old halmagiu and virfurilio is no more it was swept away all in a magnificent thunder in the october of the year yes i remember that harry answered heard it from ladislau giresci apparently it was some sort of explosion possibly of methane gas accumulated in the cellars which if they were as extensive as you say seems feasible but if janoss remains came through it who is to say there werent other survivals but as i have explained said faethor janos had made provision whatever else perished when that house went down he did not perhaps his szgany had taken his ashes from there to some other place only returning them later when the house lay in ruins i dont know possibly they did it when the castle became the property of another again i cannot say what other said harry faethor sighed but eventually there was one other aye he finally said listen and ill tell you about him during the th th and th centuries and even to the th the supposed civilized world had grown more aware of socalled witches and the black arts witches necromancers demons vampires and all such creatures real and imagined guilty or innocent were harried by relentless witchfinders proved by torture and destroyed now the true vampire was ever aware of his mortality and of the one great enemy of all his kind called prominence and the th century especially was not a good time for a person to be found too old or different or reclusive or even noticeable in short while anonymity among the wamphyri has ever been a synonym for longevity it was never more so than in those dark and doomful th and th centuries now in the middle and to the end of the th century the witchfinders were active in america and from a place called salem was driven a man called edward hutchinson he obtained a lease on my old house in the mountains and dwelled there far too long he was a diabolist a necromancer and possibly a vampire perhaps even wamphyri but as i have hinted he was imprudent he lived too long in the one place and made himself prominent he studied the history of the house and took for his own several grand pseudonyms as well as edward he was wont to call himself baron or janos aye and even faethor and finally he settled for baron ferenczy now this as might well be imagined was what brought him to my attention it offended me likewise his occupancy of the castle for i had thought me that one day i might return there myself when things were different and janoss taint faded a little with the years the wamphyri are territorial as you know and so i vowed that at a time of my choosing and as chance permitted then id square these things with this hutchinson but chance never did permit no for i had my own existence to look to and the world was ever abustle and full of change and so for two hundred years and more this foreign man lived in the castle i had builded while i in my turn lived alone in my house in ploiesti as i have said he made himself prominent in some way perhaps in several certainly he would soon have been summoned to bucuresti to make account of himself if not for that titan explosion which finished him and his works forever but as for janos i can only assume he lay in his jar or urn in a secret place and waited for his time and a certain threefingered son of the szgany to find and rescue him myself i went back there once in i think do not ask me why perhaps i desired to see what remained of the place i might even have lived there again if it was habitable but no janoss touch was still on the stone his taint in the mortar his hated memory in the very air of the ruins of course it was for janos himself was still there but i did not know that but do you know i believe that in the end janos had been closer to his wamphyri sources than i might ever have imagined for however cursory my exploration of those ruins that time in nevertheless i found evidence of works which but enough we are both tired and you are not giving me your best attention still nothing will waste you know the bulk of it the rest will keep until another time youre right said harry am tired nervous exhaustion i suppose and he made himself a promise that between athens and rhodes hed sleep and he did but coming awake just before the landing and as harry stepped down from the plane into the blasting sunlight and made his way with the other passengers towards customs he could feel inside that something was very much amiss and his heart speeded up a little when beyond the barriers in the arrivals area he saw manolis papastamos and darcy clarke waiting for him for it was written in their faces too that something was wrong for all the sunshine and warmth still they looked cold pale sick he looked at the two of them where they waited searched their faces for an answer and almost snatched back his forged passport when it was handed to him then he hurried to them thinking theres a face missing sandras but thats only right for shell be in london now wont she is it sandra he said when they were face to face they looked at him then looked away and tell me about it he said curiously calm now for all that he felt very very ill and so they told him about it twentyone hours earlier darcy had escorted sandra to the airport outside rhodes and stayed with her until she was called forward for her london flight almost but at the last moment he had been obliged to answer a call of nature the toilets were a little distant from the boarding gates so that coming out he had to run the length of the terminal in order to wave her goodbye by the time hed found a vantage point the last of the passengers were already climbing the gantry steps to the aircrafts door but he waved anyway thinking that perhaps she would see him from her window after the plane left he drove back to the villa and began packing his things only to be interrupted by a telephone call from manolis at the police station it had been manoliss idea that when sandra was out of it darcy shouldnt stay on his own the greek policeman had rooms in an hotel in the centre of town darcy would be welcome to stay there but before driving out to the villa to act as darcys guide to his new lodgings and because it happened now and then that flights were late manolis had thought to call the airport first and ensure that sandra was safely away and hed discovered that she wasnt away at all but had missed her flight what darcy couldnt believe it but i was there i mean i was in the yes shit darcy gasped as the truth hit him you were in the shit no in the bloody toilets darcy groaned which in this case amounts to much the same thing manolis dont you see it was my talent working for me or against me against that poor girl anyway your talent my guardian angel the thing that keeps me out of trouble it isnt something i can control it works in different ways this time it saw danger around the corner and and i had to go to the damned toilet now manolis understood and knew the worst of it theyve taken her he hissed the lazarides creature and his vampires they have drawn the first blood god yes darcy answered i cant think of any other explanation in his native greek manolis said a long stream of things then curses darcy supposed and look stay where you are and ill be right there no darcy answered no meet me at that place where we ate the other night christ i need a drink very well said papastamos fifteen minutes darcy was into his third large metaxa when manolis arrived will you get drunk he said it wont help no darcy answered i just needed a stiffener thats all and do you know what i keep thinking what will i tell harry thats what it isnt your fault manolis commiserated and you must stop thinking about it harry is back tomorrow we must let him take the lead meanwhile every policeman on the island is looking for lazarides his crew and his boat and sandra of course i made the call and gave the orders before i came here also i should have the complete background information on this this vrykoulakas pig by morning not only from athens but also america lazaridess righthand man called armstrong is an american darcy looked at manolis and thought christ i thank you for this man darcy wasnt a secret agent nor even a policeman hed been with ebranch all these years not because his talent was indispensable to them but simply because it was a talent and all such weird and esoteric powers had interested them but he couldnt use it as the telepaths and locators used theirs and it was useless except in special circumstances indeed on several occasions it had seemed to darcy that his talent used him certainly it had caused him grief now and then as during the bodescu affair for example when it had kept him safe and sound only at the expense of another esper and darcy still hadnt forgiven himself for that now there was this without papastamos to take control and actually physically do something darcy didnt know what he would have done what do you suggest we do now he said what can we do the other answered until we have word of them until we know where lazarides and the girl are we can do nothing and even then i will need authorization to move on this creature unless i could always claim i had the strong suspicions of the drugrunning and close in on him even without authorization but it will help when we know all about him tomorrow morning and harry keogh might have the ideas too so for now he shrugged but heavily and with obvious frustration nothing but there are no buts we can only wait he stood up come on lets get your things they drove to the villa where darcy found himself oddly reluctant to get out of the car do you know he said i feel completely done in knackered in common parlance i suppose its emotional i suppose its the metaxa manolis answered drily but as they approached the door of the place down the garden path suddenly darcy knew that it was neither he grabbed the greeks arm and whispered hoarsely manolis someone is in there what manolis looked at him glanced back towards the villa but how do you know i know because i dont want to go in its my guardian angel acting up my talent someones waiting in there for us for me anyway my own fault i was in such a state when i came out that i left the door open and now youre sure someone is in there right manoliss voice was a mere breath of air as he brought out his pistol and fitted a silencer to the barrel then cocked it god yes darcy in turn breathed im sure all right its like someone was trying to turn me around and boot me the hell out of it first i didnt want to get out of the car and now with every step i take it gets stronger and believe me whoever it is in there hes deadly then hes mine said manolis showing darcy his gun for this too is quite deadly he reached out and touched the door which swung silently open follow me in and he turned sideways crouched down a very little and stepped inside darcys every instinct each fibre of his being screamed run but he followed manolis inside he wouldnt let it make a coward of him this time there were two too many people on his conscience already it was time he showed this fucking thing who was boss and manolis put on the light the main livingroom was empty looked just as darcy had left it manolis looked at darcy cocked his head on one side inquiringly and gave a small questioning shrug where his whisper was so quiet as to be a mere shaping of the lips darcy looked around the room at the beds grouped in the centre of the floor the tapestry on the wall a pair of ornamental oil lamps on a shelf a suitcase of harrys under the bed hed never used and the doors closed leading to the bedrooms which likewise hadnt been used until now then his eyes went back to harrys suitcase and narrowed well manolis shaped his mouth again darcy held a finger to his lips crossed to the beds and slid harrys suitcase fully into view the lid was open he lifted it took out the crossbow and loaded it and stood up manolis nodded his approval darcy crossed to the bedroom doors and reached out a hand to touch the first one his trembling fingertips told him nothing except that he was scared half to death he commanded his feet to carry him to the second door and went to touch that too but no that was as brave as his talent would let him be no something screamed at him for fucks sake no gooseflesh crawled on his arms as he halfturned towards manolis to say in here but he never said it the door was hurled open knocking darcy aside and seth armstrong stood framed in the opening just looking at him apish threatening no one could have mistaken his alienness the fact that he was less or more than a mere man in the subdued lighting of the room his left eye was yellow huge expanded in its orbit and a black eyepatch hid the right eye from view manolis shouted stay where you are stand still but armstrong merely smiled grimly and came loping towards him shoot him darcy shouted scrabbling on his hands and knees for christs sake shoot him manolis had no choice for armstrong was almost upon him and hed opened his mouth to display teeth and jaws which the greek simply didnt believe he fired twice almost pointblank the first into armstrongs shoulder which served to snap the big american upright and the second into his belly which bent him down again and pushed him back a little but that was all then he came on again grasped manolis by the shoulder and hurled him against the wall and manolis knew where hed felt such strength before but knowing it didnt help him now his gun had been sent flying and armstrong and armstrongs teeth were coming for him again hey you darcy shouted fucking vampire armstrong was dragging manolis to his feet lowering his awful face towards him he turned to face darcy and darcy aiming at his heart pulled the trigger of his crossbow that did it as the bolt went in the american released manolis and smashed back against the wall gagging and choking he sought to grasp the bolt and draw it out but he couldnt it was too close to his heart that most vital of organs his heart pumped his vampire blood and that was the source of his hideous strength he gurgled coughed staggered to and fro and spat blood and his left eye glared like a blob of sulphur seared into his face manolis was on his feet again as darcy fumbled frantically to reload his crossbow so the greek tried a second time and pumped four carefully aimed shots into the stricken vampire but now the bullets had more effect each one drove armstrong like a piledriver backwards across the floor and the last one hurled him against a window which shattered outwards showering glass broken louvre boards and armstrong himself into the night garden darcy had loaded up he stumbled out into the garden with manolis right behind him armstrong lay flat on his back in the remains of the window alternating between flailing his arms and tugging at the hardwood bolt where it transfixed his chest but he saw darcy approaching and somehow sat up darcy took no chances from no more than four feet away he sent the second bolt crashing through the vampires heart which not only served to stretch him out again but pinned him down and kept him still manolis his mouth hanging open came forward is he is he finished look at him darcy panted does he look finished you may believe in them manolis but you dont know them like i do hes not finished yet armstrong was mainly still but his fingers twitched his jaws chomped and his burning yellow eye followed them where they moved about him his eyepatch had been dislodged and an empty socket gaped black in the light from the wrecked window darcy said watch him and hurried back inside a moment later he was back with a heavy razorhoned longbladed cleaver also from harrys suitcase manolis saw its silvery gleam and said what his upper lip at the left drew back from his teeth in a nervous grimace the stake the sword and the fire darcy answered decapitation and right now his vampire is already healing him see no blood in an ordinary man your bullets any one of them might have killed him with shock let alone damage but hes taken six and he isnt even bleeding two bolts in him one right through the heart and his hands are still working his eyes too and his ears he was right armstrong had heard their conversation and the loathsome orb of his left eye had swivelled to gaze upon the cleaver in darcys hand he began gurgling anew his body vibrating against the earth the heel of his right foot hammering robotically into the dry soil of the garden darcy got down on one knee beside him and armstrong tried to take hold of him with a spastic right hand but he couldnt reach him couldnt make his limbs work properly froth phlegm and blood welled up in the vampires throat his right hand scuttled a little way towards darcy like a spider until the arm it dragged got too heavy for it he tried a third time then abruptly fell back and lay still darcy gritted his teeth raised the cleaver and the membrane in the back of the cavity of armstrongs right eye bulged and erupted and a finger bluegrey and pulsating wriggled out onto his cheek jesus darcy fell back almost fainted and manolis took over he fired at armstrongs face pulling the trigger of his silenced gun until the nightmare finger and face both were so much pulp and when his magazine was empty then he took the cleaver from darcys rigid fingers and took armstrongs head too darcy had turned away and was throwing up but between each bout he gasped now we we have to burn the the ugly bastard manolis was up to that too the lamps in the villa werent just ornamental after all they contained oil and there was a spare can of fuel in the kitchen by the time darcy could take control of his heaving stomach the remains of armstrong were burning manolis stood watching until darcy got hold of his arm and took him off to a safe distance you can never tell he said wiping his mouth with a handkerchief there might be a lot more in him than just that godawful finger but there wasnt i hope you didnt leave it like that said harry the oil couldnt have burned all of him manolis got a bodybag darcy explained we took him to an incinerator in the industrial part of town said he was a mangy dog that crawled into the garden to die the heat of that incinerator would calcine his bones down to powder manolis added so we took second blood harry growled but with such uncharacteristic savagery that the others glanced at him in surprise he saw their looks and turned his face away but not before darcy noted that his eyes were more soulful or soulless than ever and of course he knew why harry about sandra he started to explain yet again but harry cut him off it wasnt your fault he said if anyones it was my fault i should have made sure personally that she was out of this but we cant think about her now and i mustnt think about her not if i want to be able to think about anything else manolis did the information you were waiting for come in a great deal of information said the other almost everything except that which is the most important manolis was driving his car with harry and darcy in the back seat they were approaching the centre of rhodes new town where manolis was quartered it wasnt yet pm but already some tourists were out in their evening finery look at them said harry his voice cold theyre happy they laugh and dress up theyve had a blue sky all day and a blue sea to swim in and the world looks fine they dont know there are scarlet threads among all that blue and they wouldnt believe it if you told them and to manolis abruptly tell me everything youve learned lazarides is a very successful archaeologist manolis began he came into prominence oh four years ago with several important finds on crete lesbos and skiros before that we dont have much on him but he does have greek nationality and romanian this is very odd if not unique the authorities in athens are looking into it but he shrugged this is greece everything takes time and this lazarides he has the friends in high places perhaps he purchased his nationality eh certainly he would have the monies for it if the rumours are correct rumours they abound it is said that he keeps or sells to unscrupulous collectors at least half of the treasures he excavates also that he is the how do you say the midas everything he touches turns to gold he only has to look at an island to know if any treasure is hidden there why even now men of his are digging in an old crusader castle on halki harry nodded i understand all of that and ill tell you about it later go on manolis turned left off a busy street into an alley then left again into a tiny private car park behind his hotel well talk inside he said he had good spacious rooms apparently the proprietor owed the local police a few favours and manolis was collecting as he talked he prepared cool drinks but low in alcohol for a greek he was sweating profusely darcy mentioned it and again manolis shrugged i am the criminals he explained pardon a criminal i am a murderer and it concerns me armstrong said harry you never performed a more worthy act in your entire life still i did it and i am hiding it and it bothers me forget it harry insisted you may be doing it again and sooner than you think tell me more about lazarides manolis nodded he is purchasing an island well a rock in the dodecanese off sirna amazing i mean what is that for an island one small beach and a fang of rock jutting from the sea but he plans a house there on a great ledge on the rock again there was once a crusader tower there a pharos what he will do there is anybodys guesses there is no water everything will have to be brought in by boat he will be one very lonely creature up there an aerie said harry or the next best thing he still desires to be wamphyri eh forget it goon again manoliss shrug he keeps a small private aeroplane a skyvan on karpathos there is a runway there now he uses the plane for trips to athens crete elsewhere maybe even to romania eh which means that sometimes his boat may be found off karpathos dont worry i have a man on it every day tourists fly out to karpathos from rhodes they too use a skyvan it is the flying matchbox but very very safe the pilot will look for lazaridess boat i expect his call any time anything else harry was still very cool very pale he didnt seem to have been touched by the sun about armstrong said manolis five and a half years ago he and some american friends went on a trip somewhere in europe thats all i know about it somewhere in europe there was an accident a fall in the mountains or some such and some people were killed armstrong survived but he didnt go back to america instead he ended up here in greece and applied for the greek citizenship the next thing we know hes working for lazarides and thats it harrys gaunt almost vacant expression hadnt changed thats it said manolis and oh one other thing i now have the authorization to chase this vrykoulakas dog to hell if i can find him darcy nodded we didnt sleep much last night manolis spent a lot of time phoning athens we pushed the drugs side of this thing just as hard as we could so now we can use all the force thats necessary to apprehend and search lazarides and his lot if we can find them harry echoed manolis well two or three of them we can find for sure said the greek on halki where theyre digging in those ruins again harrys nod that will be as good a place as any to start yes id like to see this fang of rock in the dodecanese too all right and now ill tell you what ive discovered and youll see for yourselves how it all fits together but i warn you now its an incredible story he told it all and they sat fascinated to the end and so now i have my deadspeak back he finished off which is one step in the right direction at least you are the cool one manolis told him i thought so the first time i met you you talk about steps in the right direction and all this time sandra your lover manolis harry stopped him no man has lost more than i have no im not being a martyr im just stating a fact it started when i was a kid and it hasnt stopped yet ive lost just about every person i ever loved ive even lost my son in another world to another creed this same damned creed vampirism and the more you lose the more hardened you get to it ask any habitual gambler they dont play to win but to lose they used to play to win but now when they win they just go right on back to the tables harry darcy took his arm ease up but harry shook him off let me finish and he turned back to manolis well i used to play to win too but its a hell of a game where all the cards are stacked against you you want me to cry over sandra maybe i will later you want me to go to pieces to show that im a good guy but what good will i be in all of this if i go to pieces i loved sandra yes i think but already its too late to do anything about it shes just one more thing that ive lost its the only way i can look at it and still go on except now i may be starting to win again we may be starting to win again not sandra no for shes dead and if she isnt then shed be better off i know this janos ferenczy now and i know what im talking about you call me cold but you dont know how im burning up inside now ill ask you to do me a favour stop worrying about how you see things stop worrying about sandra its too late this is a war and she was a casualty what we have to do now is start hitting back while we still have a chance for long moments manolis said nothing then my friend he said very softly you are wound up very tight you bear a great weight on your shoulders and i am a great fool i cannot hope to know what it is like for you or even anything about you you are not the ordinary man and i had no right to speak the way i did or think the things i have thought harry sat very still just looking at the greek and slowly manolis watched the necroscopes soulful eyes turn to liquid before they could spill over harry stood up and kicked his chair away and went unsteadily to the bathroom later what i hate especially about this said harry is that hes laughing at us at all of us at mankind and perhaps at me in particular its his vampire ego he calls himself lazarides after the biblical lazarus raised up from the dead by christ depending on your beliefs thats a blasphemy in itself but he doesnt stop there just to rub it in and make his point he calls his boat by the same name he dares us to discover him yells hey look im back he breaks the first rule of vampires and makes himself prominent in several ways and i think he does it deliberately but why said darcy because he can afford to harry answered because people no longer believe in vampires no i dont mean us but people in general in this day and age he can afford to be prominent because to a point hes safe from the masses but he also does it because he knows that the people who do believe and they are the ones hes chiefly interested in the dangerous ones you me ebranch and any other friends will go up against him you mean he he wants a showdown oh yes for hes seen the future thats the thing he was best at and its how he thwarted faethor he knows we have to have a showdown so hes guiding events his way to give himself every advantage hell use my own devices against me and against anyone who is with me he has ken layard and so can locate any one of us more or less at will he crippled trevor jordan so that hed be no use to us and hes taken sandra not out of spite or greed or lust but the better to know me because then hell not only know my strengths but also my weaknesses as for last night he sent his thrall armstrong to test you and possibly destroy you so as to deny me the use of one of my last crutches but if he can see the future wouldnt he know wed get armstrong manolis used his policemans logic in which case why simply sacrifice him like that a test harry answered like i said he wouldnt see it as a sacrifice vampires have no friends only thralls and anyway armstrong was only one of janoss players he has plenty more ken layard for example who can do anything armstrong could do and a lot more but i understand your question why provoke a skirmish you cant win right right harry shook his head the future isnt like that he said it isnt easily read never safely and theres no way to avoid it and it must always be remembered nothing is certain until it has happened there was a man a russian esper called igor vlady i met him once in the mцbius continuum in life hed been a prognosticator he read the future and when he was dead he kept right on doing it eventually to become a master of future and past time where all space was an open book to mцbius all time was vladys playground incorporeal he wandered the timestream forever vlady told me that in life he had always held his own future inviolable he wouldnt read it felt that to do so would be to tempt fate he didnt want to know how or when his time would come for he knew that hed only worry about it as it loomed ever closer eventually in a moment of uncertainty and fear he broke his own rule and forecast his own death he believed he knew from which quarter it was coming and fled to avoid it but he was wrong and fled into it he was like a man crossing railway tracks who sees a train coming and jumps to avoid it into the path of another train darcy said you mean janos cant trust what he reads of the future he can trust it only to a point he sees only the wide scheme of things not the fine details and whatever he sees he knows he cant avoid it for example he knew faethor would destroy him but saw beyond it to a time when hed be back he couldnt stop faethor and didnt really try to for the inevitable was by definition inescapable but he could and did make certain of his return manolis had kept up with all of this as best he could but now he began to feel something of the hopelessness of it and he asked but how can you even think to beat this creature he would seem to me invincible harry smiled a strange grim smile invincible im not so sure about that but im sure he wants us to think he is ask yourself this if hes invincible why does he concern himself with us and why is he so worried about me no igor vlady was right the future is never certain and only time can tell and anyway what difference does it make if i dont seek him out hell only come looking for me he nodded a showdown yes its coming and for now janos is pulling the strings we can only hope that in his manipulations hell overstep himself and make the same mistake igor vlady made and step in front of a train at pm the call manolis was expecting from the pilot of the rhodeskarpathos skyvan materialized it transpired that jianni lazaridess aircraft piloted by a man in his employ had taken off at am from the karpathos airstrip destination unknown with lazarides himself aboard accompanied by a man and woman answering sandras and ken layards descriptions harry had steeled himself to expect something of the sort and wasnt so badly shocked but he was puzzled how do you mean destination unknown wouldnt the aircraft require some sort of clearance didnt he log himself out go through customs or whatever they have to do manolis gave a snort i say again this is greece and karpathos is a small island the airport is a shack it has only existed for a year or two and wouldnt be there at all if not for the tourists but did you say customs hah someone to stamp your passport if youre a foreigner coming in maybe but not if youre greek and going out and at in the morning why it amazes me that anyone has even bothered to remember the time so precisely stymied said darcy he could have gone anywhere harry shook his head no i can find him the problem is it may not be so easy for me to go where hes gone well jump that one when we reach it meanwhile i have to speak to armstrong that caught both manolis and darcy off balance for a moment darcy was the first to recover for hed seen the necroscope at work before you want us to take you to him yes and right now not that i think time is any longer of the essence for i dont wheels have been set in motion and everything will eventually come to a head im sure but if all i had to do was sit twiddling my thumbs i think id go mad manolis had caught up are you saying youre going to speak to a dead man harry nodded yes at the incinerator thats where he is and where hell always be from now on and and hell talk to you it doesnt trouble the dead to talk to me said harry armstrongs no longer in thrall to janos he might even be eager to square things and later tonight then theres someone else i must try to reach mцbius darcy wondered the same harry nodded a vampire tangled my mind and took away my deadspeak and it took another vampire to put the mess to rights but the one who caused the damage was also a great mathematician my son who inherited his talents from me and while he was in my mind he also closed certain doors so that now im innumerate well if faethor could do what he did maybe mцbius can restore that other talent of mine if so then janos gets a real run for his money the incinerator was still working a young greek labourer on overtime shovelled timber waste into the red and yellow maw of a glaring roaring beast while overhead smoke shot with dying sparks billowed blackly from a high chimney darcy and manolis stood to one side watching the stoker at work and harry sat on a crate a little apart from them his strange eyes staring and almost vacant his mind however was anything but vacant and the necroscopes every instinct assured him that seth armstrongs spirit was here indeed he could hear its moaning cries armstrong harry said but softly youre out of it now youve been released why all the sorrow the moaning and sobbing stopped at once and in another moment harry keogh armstrongs dead voice was full of astonishment and disbelief youd talk to me oh ive talked to a lot worse than you seth harry told him and anyway its my guess you were just another victim like so many others i dont think you could help what youd become i couldnt oh i couldnt the other answered with obvious relief for five and a half long years i was just aa fly in his web he was my master i was in thrall to him nothing i did was of my own free will i know harry told him but they like to pretend it is i suppose that even knowing its a lie still its the one salve to their conscience that you are theirs of your own free will conscience armstrongs spirit was bitter dont make me laugh harry creatures such as janos ferenczy never suffered such common complaints youre glad to be free of him then so why the remorse youre as one with the teeming dead now which as so many of them have told me isnt as bad as you might think oh said armstrong and do you honestly believe the dead will wish anything to do with me harry thought about it a moment then said two of them at least that i can think of and probably more what of your parents seth he sensed the others nod dead some time ago yes but do you think i think that when youve got yourself together it might be a good idea to try and reach them said harry as for the great majority who can say maybe they wont come down on you as hard as you think certainly i can put in a good word for you and youd do that why dont you ask the dead about me said harry when the time comes i think theyll tell you im not such a bad sort but until then theres a favour you could do for me armstrongs thoughts turned bitter again nothing for nothing eh even here no youve got it all wrong seth said harry turn me down it will make no difference ill still ask them to go easy on you youre dead and burned away and as all the rest of them know you cant be any more punished than that what is it you want to know janos has gone now harry told him out of rhodes probably out of the islands and he took the woman i suppose youd say my woman with him i want to know where he is shes the bait in his trap i suppose you know that oh yes i know but id go after him anyway then go to romania harry groaned it was the worst possible scenario ive just been to romania he said it wont be so easy a second time nevertheless thats where he is his castle in the mountain heights over halmagiu he said you were his only living enemy and the greatest possible enemy and that when he met you it must be there on his terms and in his territory he read it that way and thats how hell play it but harry i hope you didnt love that girl dont harry gritted his teeth shook his head rejected the unthinkable pictures armstrongs words had conjured instinctive reactions to something hed hoped would not be mentioned dont tell me about that armstrong was silent but the necroscope could sense his sympathy and even his remorse and suddenly harry knew hed suspected it might be so but had tried to keep it out of his mind until now it was you who took her for him right armstrong was sobbing again it changes everything doesnt it he said but it was a statement of fact not a question yes he got into her mind and i took her to him harry didnt rave didnt curse but simply stood up and walked away with his head down darcy and manolis came after him looked at him and at each other and asked no questions behind them the incinerators furnace hissed and roared and a man sobbed rackingly but only harry keogh could hear him and despite his promises harry didnt care later back at the hotel where harry had arranged for a room of his own he tried to contact mцbius he reached out his necroscopes awareness to a place he knew well indeed the graveyard in leipzig where august ferdinand mцbiuss mortal remains had lain buried for one hundred and twenty years but from which his mathematicians and astronomers immortal mind had gone out to explore the universe and sir said harry showing his usual respect august its me harry keogh i know its been some time since i was in touch but id hoped i could talk to you again he waited but there was no response just an aching void it was about what hed expected the man who had taught him how to venture into and use an otherwise entirely conjectural fifth dimension was out there even now doing his own thing along the mцbius way harry couldnt tell how long hed been away or even hazard a guess as to when he was likely to be back if he would be back but if harry was ever to achieve a balance of power with janos mцbius was his one hope and so he kept trying for an hour then two until finally darcy came knocking at his door any luck he said when the necroscope opened the door for him harry shook his head and perhaps surprisingly in the circumstances im hungry he said they all three ate out at a taverna of manoliss recommendation and there during the course of their meal harry outlined a possible course of action as he saw it manolis he said i need to get into hungary budapest initially and from there to halmagiu across the border thats a distance of about one hundred and fifty miles once im in i can travel by road or rail ill be a tourist of course as for getting across the border into romania im not sure i can work on that when i get there how long will it take to fix me up with documentation manolis shrugged you dont need any your english passport says youre an author it has a greek entry stamp quite obviously you are the genuine tourist or perhaps the author doing his research you can simply fly to budapest via athens tomorrow if you wish it no problem as simple as that hungary is not romania the restrictions are less severe in fact romanians are fleeing to hungary every day when will you go three or four days harry answered as soon as were finished up here but as ive said before where janos is concerned time is no longer of the essence i believe hell simply hole up in the transylvanian mountains and wait for me he knows ill come eventually manolis looked at him and looked away time not of the essence the greek mumbled shaking his head a little all right said harry at once a harsh unaccustomed edge to his voice and i know whats bothering you look ill try to explain as simply as possible and then for christs sake and mine both lets drop it either janos has already vampirized sandra or he hasnt if he hasnt then hes keeping her as his ace in the hole in case i come up with something unexpected in which case shell be a bargaining point but thats only the way i hope it is not the way i think it is and if he has changed her then given only half a chance ill do my level best to kill her for her sake but right now if i concentrate on sandra to the exclusion of everything else then obviously i wont be able to think straight and we all of us need to think straight now i know you think im a cold one manolis but is everything understood manolis shook his head not cold he said just very strong i simply needed reminding thats all you see harry some of us are not so strong harry sighed and nodded i think youll do he said he picked up his glass of rich red wine darcy said so three or four days before you head for hungary right and between times you think its time we took on the rest of them right thats exactly what i think harry answered janos has men or vampires at his dig in halki its possible there are others on his island and theres also the crew of his boat which makes quite a few of them and we dont yet know how dangerous they are i mean if theyre all vampires then theyre all dangerous but there are vampires and vampires janos is one hell of a vampire by comparison the rest of them wont be too hard to handle no harder than armstrong was anyway jesus said manolis crossing himself you dont think the american was hard enough oh yes i do said harry i was just thinking out loud remembering some of the things i saw on starside but right here and now manolis youve seen how effective a crossbow firing hardwood bolts can be so what can rhodes supply in the way of special weaponry crossbows i dont think so next best thing spearguns harry started to shake his head then stopped and narrowed his eyes with steel spears right steel harpoons yes manolis nodded and he wondered what harry was thinking the necroscope didnt keep him in suspense do we have silverplating facilities a factory or plant that can put a sheath of silver on a handful of harpoons manoliss eyes opened wide certainly he beamed very well lets buy ourselves two or three highperformance spearguns can we leave that to you tomorrow morning first thing i am the spearfisherman and know these guns the best model is called champion italian manufacture with single or double rubbers using a single barb with a metal flap that opens on making a strike they will be quite as effective as your crossbow rubbers darcy clarke wasnt much for water sports harry explained these guns use rubber hurlers for propulsion theyre pretty deadly slow to load though so well need single powerful rubbers manolis better make it half a dozen guns and darcy i think its time you called in extra help i dont think it will be too difficult to find three or four volunteers from your lot back in london ebranch darcy answered theyre just waiting for the word ill bring in the blokes from the bodescu job i can get on it just as soon as were finished here good harry nodded but it might be a good idea to get it started even before they get out here i think our first priority has to be halki we know there are only a couple of janoss creatures there and actually we dont yet know that they are creatures they could be men pure and simple dupes in his pay who dont know what theyre working for well ill only have to see them to know them manolis how long will it take to get those spears er harpoons silvered up by tomorrow night and how long to halki in a fast boat manolis shrugged two hours two and a half at most it sits in the sea only a few miles from the island of rhodes but fifty miles down the coast from rhodes town where we are now halkis only a little place a big rock in the sea one village with a couple of little tavernas one short road some mountains and one crusader castle tomorrows wednesday said harry if you can fix us up with a boat and a pilot by thursday morning we can easily be there before midday so thats what well aim for between times is there any chance of taking a look at this fang of rock that janos is buying in the dodecanese manolis shook his head that would take the best part of a day i suggest we do halki thursday morning and go straight on to have a look at karpathos and this bay close to the airport where the lazarus is laid up incidentally both halki and karpathos lie in what used to be called the carpathian sea this vampire he likes to feel at home eh harry nodded i fancy its a coincidence a funny one but a coincidence anyway but i agree with you on the rest of what you said and in any case we should have reinforcements from ebranch by thursday evening friday will be soon enough to take a look at janoss thcentury aerie harrys large steak rare without vegetables must surely be cold by now he hadnt yet touched it and the others had long since finished eating he shrugged and ate anyway it was a long time since hed tasted meat so rare and bloody in fact he couldnt remember the time and the deep red wine was good too and to himself wrily if you cant beat em join em maybe manolis was right and he was a cold one after all a message was waiting for them back at the hotel a sister at the asylum has requested that inspector papastamos call her back manolis did so immediately he spoke on the phone in his usual rapidfire greek with long pauses between each burst while harry and darcy watched his face going through a variety of expressions from wary and inquiring to astonishment then disbelief and finally sheer delight and at last he was able to translate the message back to them trevor jordan is much improved he almost shouted his face a huge smile he is conscious talking making sense or at least he was they made him take food then gave him a shot to put him down for the night but before he slept he said he wanted to see you harry they say you can see him first thing in the morning darcy and harry looked wonderingly at each other and darcy said what do you make of it for a moment harry was bewildered he frowned and scratched his chin maybe maybe distance has put him beyond janoss reach i had thought his condition was permanent that his mind had been tampered with like mine but maybe janos isnt up to that maybe he isnt that good hell who cares whatever it is it sounds like good news to me well just have to wait until the morning to find out first contact the challenge thralls before he went to sleep harry tried again to contact mцbius it was useless his deadspeak went out to mцbiuss grave in leipzig but no one answered one of the reasons harry had delayed pursuing janos was that hed hoped to regain his numeracy and through it access to the mцbius continuum this had been his plan but it was fading now possibly into oblivion still worrying about it eventually he slept but his obsession of the moment was carried over into his dreams where separated from the lesser problems and diversions of the waking world harry continued to transmit his thoughts across that great dark gulf which men called death many of the teeming dead in their graves heard him would answer or comfort him but dared not none of them was the one he sought communication for its own sake would be pointless they knew that their commiserations even their inevitable approbations would only constitute obstructions in harrys path for the necroscope had never been able to refuse conversation with the dead whose suffering of solitude he alone of all living men understood there was one among the dead however who for all that she loved him more than the rest stood much less in awe of him indeed on a good many occasions she had chided him the mothers of men are like that harry her deadspeak touched him can you hear me son he sighed and abandoned his search for mцbius there had been that in her tone which commanded his attention what is it ma what is it is that how you speak to me harry ma he sighed again and tried to explain ive been busy and what im doing is important you dont know how important do you think so she answered do you really think i dont know but who knows you better than me harry well i know this much anyway that youre wasting your time harrys dreaming mind played with her words and found no explanation for them nor would he unless she was willing to supply one she picked that up at once and flew at him in the closest shed ever come to a rage what and would you take that attitude would you take your impatience out on me well the dead might prize you but they dont know you like i do and harry you are a trouble mai you you you always you and are you the only one who is this t youre always mentioning harry and why is it you never speak of we why must you always think youre alone of all men you are not alone for a million years men have died and lain silent in the dark thinking their thoughts and following their solitary designs each separate from the next but joined in the belief that death was an airless lightless but relentless prison until a small bright light named harry keogh came along and said why dont you talk to me ill listen and then you might like to try talking to each other ahhh a revelation harry remained silent didnt know how to answer was she praising or chastising him he had never heard her like this not even when he was awake she had never been so angry and his ma picked that up too why am i angry i dont believe it for years you couldnt speak to me if you wanted to not without killing yourself for it and finally when you can speak to me now he believed he understood and knew that she was right and hoped he also knew how to deal with it ma he said the others need to know about me need to be reassured that theres more than just loneliness in death and they need to know that theres safety in it too from such as dragosani and the ferenczys and others of their sort but there are so many of the dead i have so many good friends amongst them that i cant ever hope to speak to them all not until im one of them anyway but you dont need to know these things because you already know yes and youve always known that i love you too ma she was silent so if theres ever a time i dont contact you its because something very very important is getting in the way and ma thats the way its always going to be ma she was full to the top which was why she wasnt answering but at least she wasnt crying harry hoped not anyway and eventually she said oh i know that son its just that i i worry about you so and the dead they ask after you yes and because they love you they go out of their way for you too dont you know that cant you understand that we all want to helpand dont you know that there are experts among us in every field whose talents youre wasting what wasted talents the dead wanted to help him but didnt they always what had she been up to whats that ma he said about the dead and what did you mean im wasting my time in trying to contact mцbius thats what i mean she immediately answered if only youd stay in touch youd know why weve been trying to get hold of mцbius for you ever since you got your deadspeak back you what but how mцbius isnt here hes out there somewhere he could be anywhere literally anywhere we know that she answered and also that anywheres a big place we havent found him yet but if and when we do hell get your message and we hope get back to you meanwhile you neednt concern yourself about it you can get on with other things ma said harry you dont understand listen mцbius is probably in the mцbius continuum the deadeven the massed thoughts of all the dead couldnt possibly reach him there its a place that isnt of this universe so you see its not so much that im wasting my time but that you are wasting yours he could sense her shaking her head and son she said when harry jnr took away your deadspeak and your mathematical intuition did he also addle your brains eh when you use the mцbius continuum how much time do you actually spend in it and he at once saw that she was right and wondered is logic linked with numeracy in the human mind has my son diluted my powers of reason too no time he said its instantaneous mцbius wasnt in the mцbius continuum he merely used it to get wherever he was going exactly so why waste your time aiming deadspeak thoughts at his grave in leipzig eh its like you said hes out there somewhere an astronomer in life death hasnt changed him so right now there are an awful lot of us directing our thoughts outwards to the stars and if hes there well find him eventually harry had to give in to her ma what would i do without you i was only putting you straight harry telling you that between times you should get on with other things such as harry you have access to the most extensive library in the world books which not only hold knowledge but can also impart it the minds of the dead are like books for you to read and their talents are all there to be learned just as you learned from mцbius so you can learn from the rest of us but that was something harry had long ago considered and long since turned down dragosani had learned from the dead too thibor ferenczy had instructed him in evil likewise as a necromancer dragosani had stolen the talents of max batu and the secrets of the soviet ebranch from gregor borowitz and yet none of these things had helped him in the end indeed batus evil eye had assisted in his destruction no there were certain things like the future which harry preferred not to know and these thoughts of his were deadspeak which of course his mother read at once maybe youre right she said but still you should keep it in mind there are talents here harry and if and when you need them theyre yours for the asking her voice was fading now dwindling away into dreams but at least this time harry would remember their conversation and at last weary now in mind and body both he relaxed let go sank down even deeper into dream and lay suspended there simply sleeping for a little while until haaarry it was mцbius harry would know his deadspeak anywhere but even by dreaming standards mobiuss voice was dreamy for this was a very different mцbius a changed mцbius august ferdinand is that you ive been looking for you i mean a great many of us have been searching for you everywhere i know harry i was out there but you were right and they were wrong i was in the continuum for as long as i could bear it anyway the thoughts of your dead friends reached me as i emerged harry didnt understand whats to bear he asked the mцbius continuum is what it is is it mцbiuss voice was still mazed and wandering like that of a sleepwalker or a man in some sort of trance is it harry or is it much more than it appears to be but its strange my boy so strange i would have talked to you about it i wanted to but youve been away so long haaarry that wasnt my fault harry told him couldnt keep in touch wasnt able to something had happened to me to my deadspeak and i was cut off from everyone and thats one of the reasons why i had to contact you now you see its not just that id lost my deadspeak but also my ability to use the mцbius continuum and i need it like i never needed it before the continuum need it still mцbius wasnt entirely himself far from it oh we all need it harry indeed without it theres nothing it is everything and and and im sorry harry but i have to go back there thats all right harry desperately answered feeling mцbiuss deadspeak sliding off at a tangent and i swear i wouldnt be troubling you if it wasnt absolutely necessary but it it talks to me mцbiuss voice was an awestruck whisper drifting fading as his attention transferred itself elsewhere and i think i know what it is the only thing it can be i have to go now haaarry another moment and he had gone disappeared and not even an echo remaining so that harry knew mцbius had returned to the one place above all others which was now forbidden to him into the mцbius continuum finally harry was left alone to sleep out a night which for all that it was dreamless was nevertheless uneasy the next morning on their way in manoliss car to see trevor jordan something which had been bothering harry suddenly surfaced manolis he said im an idiot i should have thought of it before the greek glanced at him thought of what harry the kgb knew i was going to romania they knew it almost before i did i mean they were waiting for me when i landed goons of theirs anyway so someone must have told them someone here on rhodes for a moment manolis looked blank but then he grinned and slapped his thigh harry he said you are the very strange person with the extremely weird powers but i think you will never make the policeman yesterday when you told us your story i thought it was understood that i must arrive at this selfsame conclusion and of course i did my next step was to ask myself who knew you were going other than your immediate circle answer no one except the booking clerk at the airport itself the local police are looking into it right now if there is an answer they will find it good said harry but the point im making is this the last thing i want is that someone should be waiting for me in hungary too i mean if it works out that i must go there manolis nodded i understand your concern lets just hope the local boys turn something up neither manolis harry nor darcy had any way of knowing that at that very moment the police were at the airport talking to a man who worked on the passenger information desk to him and to his brother against whom theyd long entertained certain grudges and suspicions of their own talking to them and not much caring for the answers they were getting but sure that eventually theyd get the right ones at the asylum a sister met the three and took them to jordans room he had a room now as opposed to a cell a small place with high barred windows and a door with a peephole the door was locked from the outside obviously the doctors were still a little wary the sister looked through the peephole and smiled and beckoned harry forward he followed her example and looked into the room jordan was striding to and fro in the confined space his hands clasped behind his back harry knocked and the other at once stopped pacing and looked up his face was alive now alert and expectant harry he called out is that you yes it is harry answered just give us a moment the sister unlocked the door and the three went in she waited outside inside jordan took darcys hand and shook it he slapped manolis on the back then stood stock still and slowly smiled harry a greeting so he said and we have the necroscope back on our team eh for a while harry answered returning his smile and you scared us trevor we thought hed wrecked your mind darcy clarke after the initial handshake had backed off a little but unobtrusively now he mumbled will you excuse me a moment he went back out into the corridor with manolis following quickly on behind in the corridor darcy was standing beside the sister or rather he was leaning against the wall and his face was white what is it manolis hissed ive seen that look on your face before call harry out of there darcy whispered quickly the sister was beginning to look alarmed but darcy cautioned her with a ringer to his lips harry manoliss voice was casual as he leaned back into the room would you come out here a moment do you mind harry lifted an eyebrow glanced at jordan not at all the other shook his head and smiled strangely knowingly harry went out to the others what is it darcy closed the door and turned the key he looked at harry and his adams apple was working its all wrong he said theres something not right with him in fact nothings right with him harrys soulful eyes studied his drawn trembling face your talent yes that doesnt feel like trevor it looks like him but it doesnt feel like him not to my guardian angel my talent wouldnt let me stay in there harry came jordans voice from beyond the door whats the delay look i have something to tell you but only you cant we talk you and i face to face manolis was quick off the mark he showed the sister his police identification again warned her to silence as darcy had done with a finger to his lips took out his beretta and gave that to harry and leave the door ajar behind you and well stay right here he said but said darcy his voice wobbly will that stop him he indicated the gun in harrys hand harry nodded hes not a vampire he said he put the gun into an inside pocket of his jacket unlocked the door and went through it inside the room jordan had sat down in an armchair there was another chair facing him and he beckoned harry to take it harry sat down but carefully warily never taking his eyes off the man opposite well he finally said and here i am so whats the big mystery trevor all of a sudden said the other still smiling his weird knowing smile youre not so concerned about me and harry noticed how he formed his words slowly carefully making sure he got them right right there and then the necroscope guessed what jordans trouble was and decided to put it to the test oh im concerned about you all right he forced a smile onto his face in fact you wouldnt believe just how concerned i am trevor do you remember what you people at ebranch used to call harry jnr when you looked after him that time the strange almost insinuating expression slid from jordans face his features went slack and gaunt his eyes blank but just for a moment or two then animation returned and he said oh of course the boss thats what we called him thats right harry nodded and reached for the gun in his pocket but you were much too slow in remembering and you were the one who was always especially fond of him its not something youd need time to think about or enquire about if you were you as his gun started to come into view so jordan moved previously the mans movements had seemed slow to match his speech but so are the movements of a chameleon before its tongue flickers into deadly life and janoss grip was strong on jordans mind he moved like lightning his left hand grabbing harrys throat and his right bearing down on his gun hand ramming it back inside his jacket the necroscopes reflexes took over as jordan straightened up from his chair harry kicked him hard between the legs useless for the mind which controlled jordans body simply turned the pain aside in return jordan released harrys throat and backhanded him with a clenched fist hard as iron before his eyes could focus from that jordan had lifted him half out of his chair and tried to butt him in the face in the last moment harry saw it coming and managed to turn his face aside but even so the crushing hammer force of the mans head against his temple dazed and shook him before he could recover jordan let him fall back into his chair and dragged his gun hand into view then the door burst open and manolis hurled himself into the room darcy was right behind him defying his leery talents every effort to turn him back grunting his frustration jordan tried one last time without effect to wrench harrys gun out of his hand before manolis hit him and the compact greek policeman knew exactly how to hit he shouldered jordan back from harry dropkicked him and knocked him down then scrabbled his hands out from under him where he tried to push himself to his feet then harry was between them pointing his gun directly at jordans forehead dont make me he shouted at the possessed man his words sharp as gravel chips jordan sat up and snarled at him at all three of them i was not the one to threaten he growled his voice no longer that of the jordan they had known you threatened me thats right harry answered you havent threatened me personally not yet but you would sooner or later janos ferenczy he made motions with his gun indicating that the other should stand up janos in jordans body did so and stood glowering at the three who ringed him in and well then harry keogh he finally grunted and so you know me now very well all subterfuge aside we meet at last but i wanted to know you and i wanted you to know something of my power you see how easily i have occupied this mind telepathy hah trevor jordan was the veriest amateur your powers dont impress me harry lied the stench from a dead pig is likewise strong you you dare the other took a pace forward harry gritted his teeth and carefully aimed the gun right between jordans eyes and smiling crookedly the possessed man came to a grudging halt then he staggered harry narrowed his eyes what i i have pushed this weaklings flabby body too far janos ferenczy grunted from jordans throat allow me to sit down sit harry told him and as the other flopped into his chair and sat there reeling the necroscope once more seated himself opposite now out with it janos he said why did you want to see me to kill me kill you janos laughed a baying laugh if i were so desperate to have you dead believe me you would be dead but no i want you alive wait manolis came closer harry are you saying that this is janos ferenczy is this really the vrykoulakas janosjordan scowled at him greek you are a fool manolis moved closer still but darcy took his arm its his mind he said his telepathy controlling trevors body kill him now manolis said at once thats just it harry answered i wouldnt be killing him but poor jordan janos laughed again you are helpless he said why i could walk out of here you are like small children then he stopped laughing and scowled at harry and so you are the allpowerful necroscope eh the man who talks to the dead the famous vampirekiller well i think you are nothing do you said harry and is that why youre here to tell me that fine so youve told me now scurry off back to your carpathian castle and get your filthy leechs mind out of my friends head the eyes in jordans head glared until they seemed about to leap from their orbits and his hands trembled where they gripped the arms of the chair but finally it will be my my great pleasure to meet you again harry keogh he said grinding his teeth but man to man face to face harry was practised in the ways of the wamphyri he knew how to hurl weighty insults man to man he gave a snort of derision you elevate yourself to ridiculous heights janos and face to face why there are cockroaches in this world who stand taller than you manolis got down on one knee beside harrys chair reached for his gun give it to me he said and tell me what you want to know and believe me i will make him tell you i go now janos said but i go knowing that you will come to me he opened his mouth and laughed and wriggled his tongue as frantically and obscenely as a madman i know it as surely as i know that tonight ah tonight sweet sandra will writhe in my bed lathered with the froth of our fornication he laughed a great shout of a laugh and fell limp in his chair his eyes closed his head leaned to one side and his jaw fell open foam dribbled from one corner of his mouth and his left arm and hand vibrated a little where they hung down the side of the chair harry darcy and manolis glanced at each other and at last harry halfreleased the beretta into manoliss hands at which jordans eyes sprang open he laughed again and leaped alert and snatched the gun from between them and ah hahhah he screamed children mere children and putting the gun to his right ear he pulled the trigger harry had drawn back forcing his chair backwards away from the action but darcy and manolis were sprayed with blood and brains as the left side of jordans head flew apart yelping their horror they started upright and back framed in the open doorway a trio of sisters of mercy held their hands to their mouths and gasped they had seen it all or the end of it anyway oh my gggod darcy staggered from the room leaving harry and manolis mouths agape staring at jordans bloody corpse harry and darcy left manolis to hand over to the local police and walked back to their hotel it wasnt yet am but already it was baking hot the heat seemed to bounce off the cobbles in the narrow streets of the old town darcy dumped his bloodied jacket in the back of a refuse truck and cleaned up as best he could in a drinking fountain along the way at the hotel they showered and harry saw to his bruises and then for the best part of an hour they sat and did nothing at all a little before noon manolis joined them what now he wanted to know do we go ahead as planned harry had been thinking it over yes and no he answered you two go ahead as planned go to halki tomorrow then karpathos and see what you can do and youll have the men from ebranch to back you up from then on in but i cant wait i have to square it with that bastard it was what he said at the end i cant live with that it has to be put right youll go to hungary manolis looked washed out exhausted yes harry told him see i thought that after sandra was taken it wouldnt matter shed simply be a vampire beyond anyones help but i hadnt reckoned with how he might use her well it could be that she herself is now past caring but im not so i have to go not even for her sake anymore but for mine i may not any longer have what it takes to get him but i cant let her go on like that darcy shook his head not a good idea harry he said look janos was goading you challenging you to take part in a duel he doesnt think you can win and youve fallen for it you were right the first time where sandra is concerned whats done is done nows the time to steady up and start thinking ahead the time for preparation and planning but it isnt the time to go off halfcocked and get yourself killed you know how difficult its going to be just getting to janos in the carpathians but you also know that if you simply leave him alone then sooner or later hell come looking for you where you can meet him on your terms hell have to if he ever again wants to feel safe in the world harry said manolis i think maybe darcy is right i still dont know why that maniac killed himself and not you but what youre planning now its like putting your head right back in the noose darcy probably is right harry agreed but i have to play it how i see it as for jordan killing himself that was janos showing me how powerful he is yes and hurting me at the same time but kill me no for its like he said he wants me alive im the necroscope i have strange talents there are secrets locked up in my head that janos wants to get at oh he can talk to some of the dead poor bastards in that monstrous necromantic way of his but he cant command their respect as i do hed like to though for hes as vain as the rest of them but he still doesnt feel that hes true wamphyri so he probably wont be satisfied until hes made himself the most powerful vampire the worlds ever seen and to that end if he can find some way to steal my skills from me he let it tail off and immediately in a lighter tone continued anyway you two are going to have plenty on your own plates so stop worrying about me and start worrying about yourselves manolis how about those spearguns and id also like you to book me a seat on the next plane for athens say sometime tomorrow morning with a budapest connection and darcy whoa said darcy you changed the subject a bit fast there harry and lets face it theres really no comparison between what well be doing here in the islands and what youll be going up against in the carpathians also manolis and i we have each other and by tomorrow night therell be a gang of us but youll be on your own all the way down the line harry looked at him with those totally honest incredibly innocent eyes of his and said on my own not really darcy i have a great many friends in a great many places and theyve never once let me down darcy looked at him and thought god yes its just that i keep forgetting who what you are manolis didnt know harry so well however friends the greek said having missed the point of the exchange in hungary romania harry looked at him there too he said and shrugged wherever he stood up im going to my room now i have to try and contact some people wherever manolis repeated him after he had gone darcy nodded and for all the drowsy mediterranean heat he shivered harrys friends are legion he explained right across the world the graveyards are full of them harry tried again to contact mцbius with as little success as the teeming dead allies whom his ma had recruited to that same task he tried to speak with faethor too to check on a certain piece of advice that the extinct vampire had given him which now seemed highly suspect and was likewise frustrated it must be the scorching heat of the midday sun shimmering in romania just as it shimmered here which deterred faethors wamphyri spirit disappointed finally harry reached out with his thoughts to touch the rhodes asylum where trevor jordan now lay in the morgue peaceful in the wake of his travails and well beyond the torments of the merely physical world there at last he was successful is that you harry jordans dead voice was at first tinged with anxiety then relief as he saw that he was correct but of course it is for who else could it be and eagerly harry im glad youve come i want you to know that it wasnt me i mean that i could never have of course you couldnt harry cut him off speaking out loud as he was wont to do when time circumstance and location permitted i know that trevor its one of the reasons i wanted to speak to you to put your mind at rest and let you know that we understand it was janos using you to relay his thoughts and that one godawful action through to us but its a damned shame he had to murder you to be doubly sure id go after him harry said jordan its done now and know it cant be reversed oh i suppose it will get to me later when it sinks in how much ive lost i suppose they i mean we all have to go through that but right now im only interested in revenge and lets face it i havent fared as badly as some god knows id rather be dead than undead in thrall to that monster like poor ken layard yes like ken and harry felt the dead mans shudder thats something else i have to try to put right the necroscope sighed ken belongs to janos now his locator but trevor sandra is his too for a moment there was only a blank horrified silence then oh god harry im so sorry harry felt the others commiserations nodded said nothing and god it seems impossible jordan finally said speaking to himself as much as to harry we came out to greece to find a few drugs and look what we found death destruction and a oneman plague who can burst out any time hes ready and powerful its like yulian bodescu was a pockettorch compared to a laser beam you know i scanned him by mistake i was like a tiny spider who fell in a bathful of water and some bastard pulled the plug there was no fighting him harry his mind is a great black irresistible whirlpool and little old me i dived right in there headfirst thats the other thing i want to talk to you about harry told him this control he had over you even at a distance i mean how could such a thing come about you were a powerful telepath in your own right therein lies a tale jordan answered bitterly and harry were all of us like radio stations our minds i mean most of us operate on very personal channels our own we only talk to ourselves we think to ourselves most of us telepaths on the other hand have this knack of tuning in to other peoples wavelengths but janos is a superior and far more sophisticated station only let someone pick up his wavelength and he jams their transmission tracks the signal home and literally takes over the stronger their beam the faster he homes in on them yes and the harder they fall its as simple as that you mean he got to you because youre a telepath ordinary people would be safe then cant answer yes for a certainty but i would think so but one thing i am certain of with a mind like that he has to be a powerful hypnotist too in fact hell have all the usual the unusual mental powers of the wamphyri in spades so ive been told harry nodded gloomily it makes a nonsense of something faethor said to me faethor youve been talking to that blackhearted bastard again harry he was janoss father i know that said harry but if you dont speak to them you cant know them and thats my best weapon knowing them well i suppose you know best what youre doing but harry never let him into your mind be sure to keep the bastard out of your mind because once hes in hes in for good which was the opposite of the advice faethor had given him ill keep that in mind said harry but artlessly without humour and trevor is there anything i can do for you any messages ive left a few friends behind given time ill think of a couple of things to say not right now though maybe you can get back to me i hope so anyway trevor you were a telepath in life well it doesnt stop there you wont be alone ever see if im not right and theres one last thing yes i i want to make sure youre cremated and then if everything works out i think id like to keep your ashes harry said jordan in a little while did anyone ever tell you youre morbid then he actually laughed however shakily hell i dont care what happens to my ashes though i suppose id get to talk to you more often right i mean from your mantelpiece harry had to grin to keep from crying i suppose you would he said by midafternoon things were starting to shape up harry still couldnt contact mцbius or faethor but manolis and darcy returned from an outing in the town with an armful of spearguns they were the italian champion models manolis had recommended with very powerful single rubber propulsion i once saw a man accidentally shot in the thigh with one of these the greek related they had to open his leg up and cut the harpoon head right out of him our harpoons are being silvered right now we pick them up tonight and my flight to athens harrys resolve was as strong as ever manolis sighed same as last time tomorrow at if theres no trouble with your connection youll be in budapest by oh around but we both wish youd change your mind thats right darcy agreed tomorrow night our people from ebranch will be out here and theyre trying to contact zek foener and jazz simmons in zakinthos to see if theyd like to be in on it well have a hell of a good team harry theres absolutely no reason why you should go off to hungary on your own someone could go with you at least part of the way a good telepath or prognosticator say zek foener harry had turned to look sharply frowningly at darcy on hearing her name spoken and michael simmons oh theyll want to be in on it all right so far thered been no chance to report what trevor jordan had told him about the vampires superior esp now he did so and finished up dont you realize who and what zek foener is only one of the most proficient telepaths in the world just let her mind so much as scrape up against janoss and hed have her and as for jazz he was a hell of a man to have around on starside but this isnt starside the fact is i darent take any of our talented people up against janos hed just take them out one by one and use them for his own i mean this is the very essence of why i have to handle my side of it alone too many good people have lived through too much already just to go risking their necks again now youre right of course darcy nodded but youre our best chance harry our best shot which makes it doubly frustrating to simply say nothing and let you go risking your neck i mean without you why wed be left stumbling around in the dark which seemed to say a lot for what he thought of harrys chances but i wont argue with you harry said quietly im on my own and his voice held a note of finality and of a determination which wouldnt be swayed they hadnt eaten that evening they went out to pick up their silvered harpoons and on the way back stopped off at a taverna for a meal and a drink they ate in silence for a while until darcy said its all boiling up i can feel it my talent wishes to hell tomorrow wasnt coming but it knows it is harry looked up from his large rare steak lets just get through the night first right there was a growl in his voice that darcy wasnt used to it had a hard unaccustomed edge to it tension he supposed nerves but who could blame harry for that harry couldnt know it but he wasnt going to have a good night asleep almost before his head hit the pillows he was at once assailed by strange dreams real dreams in the main but vague and shadowy things which he probably wouldnt remember in the waking world ever since his necroscope talents had developed as a child harry had known two sorts of dreams real dreams the subconscious reshuffling of events and memories from the waking world which anyone might experience and metaphysical messages in the form of warnings omens and occasionally visions or glimpses of real events long since over and done with and others yet to come the latter had presaged his developing deadspeak enabling the dead in their graves to infiltrate his sleeping mind he had learned to separate the two types to know which ones were important and should be remembered and which to discard as meaningless occasionally they would overlap however when a conversation with a dead friend might drift into a real dream or nightmare such as when his ma had become a shrieking vampire or it might just as easily work the other way when a troubled dream would be soothed by the intervention of a dead friend tonight he would experience both types separate and intermingled and all of them nightmarish they started innocuously enough but as the night progressed so he began to feel a certain mental oppression if anyone had shared his room they would have seen him tossing and turning as the weird clearinghouse of his mind set up a series of strange scenarios eventually harrys struggles wearied him and he drifted more deeply into dreams and as was often the case soon found himself in a benighted graveyard this was not in itself ominous he need only declare himself and he knew hed find friends here contrary as dreams are however he made no effort to identify himself but instead wandered among the weedgrown plots and leaning headstones all silvered under the moon there was a ground mist which lapped at the humped roots of stunted trees and turned the welltrodden compacted paths between plots to writhing ribbons of milk harry picked his way silently beneath the lunar lamp and the mist curled almost tangibly about his ankles then suddenly he knew he was not alone in this place and he sensed such a coldness and a silent horror as hed never before known in any cemetery he held his breath and listened but even the beat of his own heart seemed stilled in this now terrible place and in the next moment he knew why it was terrible it wasnt just the preternatural cold and the silence but the nature of the silence the dead themselves were silent they lay petrified in their graves in terror of something which had come among them but what harry wanted to flee the place felt an unaccustomed urge to distance himself from what should be a sure haven in an uncertain dream landscape but at the same time he was drawn towards a mistshrouded corner of the graveyard where rubbery vegetation grew green and lush and damp from the coiling vapours the vapours of the tomb he thought like the cold breath of the dead leaking upwards from all of these graves it was an unusual thought for harry knew that there was no life in death was there no of course not for the two conditions of man were quite separate the living and the dead distinct from each other as the two faces of a fathomless gorge and harry the only living person with the power to bridge the gap oh and what of the undead something squelched underfoot with a sound like bursting bladders of seaweed and harry looked down he stood at the very rim of the rank vegetation beyond which unnatural mists boiled upwards presumably from some untended tomb and at his feet a cluster of small black mushrooms or puffballs releasing their scarlet spores even as he stepped amongst them whose grave was it he wondered out of which these fungi siphoned their putrid nourishment he passed in through a curtain of damp clinging green where heavy leaves and clutching creepers seemed reluctant to admit him but emerging from the other side it was as if hed passed into an entirely different region no mausoleum here no leaning lichened tombstones or weedy plots but a morass a swamp yes harry stood on the rim of a vast misted expanse of quag rotting trees and rank vines and all around wherever there was semisolid ground the wrinkled black toadstools grew in diseased ugly clumps releasing their drifting red spores he moved to turn retreat retrace his steps only to discover himself rooted to the spot fascinated by a sudden commotion in the leprous grey mire directly to the fore the quag was shuddering forming slow doughy ripples as if something huge stirred just below the surface causing vile black bubbles to rise and belch and release their gases and in another moment up from the depths of the bog rose the steaming slab of a headstone complete with its own rectangular plot of hideously quaking earth until now however unquiet harrys dream had been languid as a strange slowmotion ballet but the rest of it came with nerveshattering speed and ferocity longing to turn and run but still rooted there he could only watch as the mush of the bog slopped from the thrusting headstone and dripped from the rim of the risen tomb to reveal its true nature indeed to reveal the identity of its dweller the legend carved in the slab where the oozing quag gurgled from its grooves was hardly unfamiliar it said quite simply harry keogh necroscope then the mound of the burial plot burst open hurling great clods of earth in all directions and lying there in that open grave like some morbid parasite in a wound a semblance or grotesque caricature of harry himself but festooned in all its parts with ripening sporebearing mushrooms harry tried to scream and had no mouth his likeness did the job for him with a monstrous grunt it sat up in its gaping tomb opened its yellow pusfilled eyes and screamed until it rotted down into a gurgling black stump harry put up a hand before his eyes to ward off the sight of the thing and his hand was covered with black nodules like monstrous melanomas growing and sprouting from his flesh even as he stared aghast and now he saw why he couldnt run because he was rooted to the spot was himself a hybrid fungus thing whose tendril toes had hooked themselves into the bank of rotting soil above the quivering swamp he turned up his face to the moon and screamed then not with his puffballspewing mouth but with his mind christ oh christ oh christ and before the dryrot fungus webbing crawled over his eyes to seal them too he saw that in fact the moon was a skull which laughed at him from a sky of blood but before the sky could rain its red on him the moonskull reached down skeletal arms to gather him up draw him from the sucking swamp and refashion his limbs back into a manshape and haarrry the moon sang to him with sandras voice harry oh why dont you answer me the old dream receded apace with the new ones advance harry tossed in his bed and sweated and sent out tremulous deadspeak thoughts into the dark of the night but no no harry came sandras urgent mental voice again dont need that for im not dead better if i were perhaps but im not and only look at me now harry only look at me now he forced open his squeezedshut eyes and looked and tried to accept the strangeness of what he saw the scene itself was weird and gothic and yet harry knew the people in it well enough sandra striding to and fro to and fro wringing her hands and tearing her hair and ken layard hunched over a wooden table strangely slumped and crooked where he crushed his head between taloned hands and gazed feverishly on the unguessed caverns of his own mind sandra the telepath and layard the locator janoss creatures now in their entirety harry was immaterial incorporeal without body he knew it at once that same nonfeeling of unbeing which had been his lot in the strange times between the death of the physical harry keogh and his minds incorporation with the braindead alec kyle he was here not in the flesh but in spirit alone incredible indeed impossible outside the scope of dreams and without the aid of the metaphysical mцbius continuum and yet with his necroscopes instinct harry knew that this was more than just a dream he examined his surroundings a huge bedchamber of a room with a massive fourposter in an archedover recess in a raw stone wall other than this the room contained a low cot with a strawstuffed mattress and mouldy blankets wide wooden chairs and a rough table a great fireplace and blackened flue and ancient tapestries rotting on the gaunt stone walls there were no windows and only one door which was of massive oak and ironbanded it was closed and displayed neither doorknob nor handle harry guessed it would be bolted and barred from the outside the only light came from a pair of squat candles waxwelded to the table where layard sat hunched in his fever of concentration they illuminated flickeringly a vaulted ceiling with nitre crystals crusted in the mortar between massively carved keystone blocks the floor was of stone flags the atmosphere cold and unwelcoming the entire scene fraught with the menace of a dungeon the place was a dungeon or as close as made no difference a dungeon in the ruined castle of the ferenczy harry sandras voice was a hushed frightened whisper kept low for fear of alerting someone she stopped pacing and hugged herself tightly as an involuntary shudder of terror and then of sudden awareness racked her body her mouth fell open in a gasp and she strained her face forward staring at nothing harry is that you ken layard at once looked up and said do you have him his face was gaunt twisted from some unbearable agony with cold sweat standing on his brow but as he spoke the scene began to waver and harry however unwillingly to withdraw dont let it slip sandra hissed she rushed to the table caught layards head in her hands lent her will to his in bolstering whatever extrasensory feat it was which he performed and the room grew solid again and at last the incorporeal necroscope understood as yet they were not entirely in janoss thrall they were his yes but he must needs watch them lock them up when he himself was not close by like now and because they knew they were doomed to his service as undead vampires so they combined their esp in this one last effort to defy him while still their minds were at least in part their own layard had used his talent to locate and fix harry in his bed in a rhodes hotel and sandra had followed layards coordinates to engage the necroscope in telepathic communication but with their powers enhanced or amplified by the vampire stuff janos had put into them they had succeeded above their expectations they had not only sought harry out and contacted him but given him telepathic and visual access to their dungeon prison sandra was dressed in some gauzy shift which let the light of the candles strike right through she wore neither shoes nor underclothes there were dark angry blotches on her breasts and buttocks which could only be bruises layards attire was little more substantial a coarse blanket which hed belted into a sort of cassock it would be bitterly cold down there in the secret core of the old castle but harry rightly supposed that the cold no longer affected them harry harry she hissed again turning her gaze directly towards his unbodied presence where he viewed them harry i know we have you so why dont you answer me her fear and frustration were obvious in the huge orbs of her eyes you you have me he finally spoke up it took a moment to get used to thats all harry her gasp made a plume of mist in the cold air my god we really do have you sandra he said more animated now im asleep and well dreaming sort of but i can wake up or be woken up at any time after that we might still be in contact and we might not youve done this got in touch with me for a reason so now it would be better if you just got on with it his words so cold distant empty seemed to stun her he wasnt how shed expected him to be she went to the table and flopped into a chair alongside layard harry she said ive been used changed poisoned if youve ever loved me especially feeling what youd be feeling for me now then i know youd be screaming and harry youre not screaming im feeling nothing he said i darent feel anything im talking to you thats all but without looking inside dont ask me to look inside too sandra she put her head in her hands and sobbed raggedly cold so cold were you ever ever in your life warm harry sandra he said youre a vampire and though you probably dont know it youre already displaying the traits of a vampire they rarely converse but play wordgames they play on emotions they dont themselves share or understand such as love honesty honour and others which they understand only too well like hate and lust they seek to confuse issues and so blunt the minds of their opponents and to a vampire each and every other creature who is not a thrall is an opponent you sought me out doubtless because you had important things to tell me but now the vampire in you delays and distracts you causes you to deviate from your course you never loved me she accused spitting out the words and showing her altered teeth and for the first time he saw how her eyes and ken layards were yellow and feral later they would turn red if he were to fail and let them have a later and now harry looked again more closely at these two prisoners of janos one whod been a lover and the other something of a friend and saw how well the vampire had done his work on them apart from their eyes their flesh had little of human life in it they were undead with more than their fair share of janos himself in them sandras beauty hitherto natural was now entirely unearthly and layard he looked like a threedimensional cardboard figure which had been partly crushed harrys thoughts were as good as spoken words but i was crushed harry layard looked up and told him speaking to the empty air on karpathos in a moment when janos was distracted i broke a length of driftwood and tried to put its point through him he called his men off the lazarus and had me tied down on the beach where they dropped boulders on me from the low cliffs they only stopped when i was quite broken and buried the vampire stuff in me is healing me now but ill never be straight again harrys pity welled up and threatened to engulf him but he forced it down why did you call me here to advise me or to weaken me with remorse and regrets and with fear for myself are you your own creatures or are you now entirely his at the moment layard answered were our own for how long who can say until he returns and after that the change is working and cant be reversed you are right harry we are vampires we want to help you but the dark stuff in us obfuscates we make no progress said harry only say you loved me sandra pleaded i loved you harry told her liar she hissed harry felt torn i cant love he said in something of desperation and for the first time in his life realized it was probably true once upon a time maybe but no longer manolis papastamos had been right after all he was a cold one sandra shrank down into herself no love in you she said and should we advise you so that you may kill us but isnt that the point of all this said layard isnt it what we want while still we have a choice is it oh is it she clutched one of his broken hands and to harry i thought i no longer wanted to live not like this but now i dont know i dont know harry janos has has he has known me he knows me theres no cavity of my body he hasnt filled i loathe him and yet i want him too and thats the worst to lust after a monster but lust is part of life after all and ive always loved life so what if you win will it be for me as it was for the lady karen no the thought repelled him i couldnt do anything like that again not to you not to anyone not ever if i win it will be as easy for you as i can make it except you cant win layard moaned i only wish you could but he might he might sandra jumped up perhaps janos is wrong about what harry felt hed broken through and was now getting somewhere perhaps hes wrong about what hes looked into the future sandra said its one of his talents hes read the future and seen victory for himself what has he seen what exactly that you will come she answered and that there will be fire and death and thunder such as to wake the dead that the living and the dead and the undead shall all be embroiled in it a chaos spawning only one survivor the most terrible most powerful vampire of all ah and not merely a vampire but wamphyri a paradox layard sobbed for now you know the reason why you must not come harry nodded and said thats always the way it is when you read the future then the dungeons heavy door burst open janos stood there handsome as the devil evil as hell and hells fire burned in his eyes and before the scene dissolved entirely and turned to darkness harry heard him say so give you enough rope and you hang yourselves i knew you would contact him well and what you have done for yourselves you can doubtless do for me so be it second contact horror on halki negative charge turbulent in his rhodian hotel bed harry might have woken up there and then but no sooner was his contact with sandra and layard broken than another voice intruded on his dreams this time a far more welcome visitation harry did you call out did you call his name harry into the void it was mцbius but the waft and whisper of his deadspeak voice told the necroscope that he was just as mazed and wandering as ever his name harry mumbled still tossing and turning in his sticky sheets but gradually settling down again your name do you mean probably but that was earlier no his name mцbius insisted i dont know what youre talking about harry was bewildered ah mцbius sighed partly in relief but mainly in disappointment but i thought for a moment that you had reached a similiar conclusion not at all impossible nor even improbable for as you know ive always considered you my peer harry he still wasnt making much sense but harry didnt like to tell him so his respect for mцbius was limitless your peer he finally answered hardly that sir and whatever new conclusion youve reached no way that i could ever match it not any more for im not the man i used to be which is the reason i was looking for you ah yes i remember now something about losing your deadspeak something about being innumerate well as for the former obviously notfor how else would you be speaking to me right now and innumerate what harry keogh mцbius chuckled that is not how i would describe you harrys turn to sigh his relief mцbiuss mind at first misty was at last coming through to him with something of its usual crystal clarity he pressed his case but thats just it its the only way to describe whats happened to me i am now innumerate i cant conjure the equations i no longer have access to the mцbius continuum and i need the continuum now as never before innumerate the other said yet again plainly astonished but how may i accept it how may i believe it of you you were my star pupil here try this and he inscribed a complicated mathematical sequence on the screen of harrys mind harry looked at it examining each symbol and number in turn and it was like trying to fathom an alien language no use he said astonishing mцbius cried that was a very simple problem harry it appears this disability of yours is serious thats what ive been saying harry tried to be patient and its why i need your help only tell me what you would like me to do now harrys sigh was a glad one for it seemed that at last he had mцbiuss total attention he quickly told him how faethor had got into his mind and untangled the connections hed found there which had been stimulated into agonizing being each time harry had attempted to use his deadspeak faethor was probably the only one who could ever have corrected it he explained because it was one of his own sort whod snarled it up in the first place and so i got my deadspeak back but that wasnt the only obstruction faethor found in there not by a long shot the areas governing my basic and instinctive understanding of numbers had been closed off almost entirely heres what he discovered closed doors barred and bolted with all my maths locked up behind them now faethor is no mathematician but still by sheer force of will he got one of these doors open only for a moment before it slammed shut again but long enough and beyond it the mцbius continuum that was too much for him and he got out of there entirely fascinating said mцbius and it seems well have to start your education all over again harry groaned that isnt quite the way i see it he said i mean i was hoping thered be a much quicker way you see this is something i need right now or im very likely a goner what i mean is well faethor could only handle those areas in which he was the expert and so i was thinking that maybe you but harry mцbius seemed shocked im no vampire your mind is your own private and inviolable and but not for much longer harry cut him off not if you turn me down and desperately now august ferdinand i have to go up against something entirely monstrous and i need all the help i can get but its not just for me its for everyone and everything for you see if i lose this one then my enemy gets it all even the mцbius continuum itself believe me im not exaggerating if you cant open those doors in my head he will and and and after that yes after that i just dont know mцbius was silent for a moment and then that serious eh that serious yes but harry all your secrets are in there your ambitions your most private thoughts also my desires my vices my sins but its no peepshow august you dont have to look where you dont want to the other sighed his acquiescence very well how do we go about it harry was eager now august ferdinand youre the one man among all the dead who can go anywhere literally anywhere in threedimensional space youve been out to the stars down to the bed of the deepest ocean through your knowledge of the mцbius continuum youve thrown off the fetters of the grave so how we go about it is simple i hope so anyway im going to clear my mind and drift in sleep and simply invite you in im going to say mцbius come into my mind enter of your own free will and do whatever is necessary to ahhh came the black gurglingly glutinous utterly overpowering voice of janos ferenczy in harrys mind but such an eloquent invitation never let it be said that i was the one to refuse you mцbius and his deadspeak were swept aside on the instant harry paralysed could do nothing he felt the ferenczy step inside his head as a fish feels the lampreys clamps in its gill and was likewise impotent to stop it it was as if some nameless slug had oozed in through his ear to eat his brain and was now stretching itself luxuriously before commencing the feast he tried to bring down the shutters of his mind but they were stuck effortlessly held open by the invader oh said janos as yet feeling his way enjoying the horror of his host and did i feel you cringe just then could it be that you attempted to evict me and was that a measure of your strength if so then ive precious little to fear here but for shame harry keogh would you invite me in and as quickly throw me out and what sort of a host are you my invitation wasnt to you harry forced his brain into gear tried to remind himself that this was just another vampire janos settled on the thought like a vulture to carrion i was not invited but your mind was open as a whores crotch and just as tempting something of harrys horror receded he tightened his grip on himself forced his feverish mind into what he hoped was a defensive stance but he could almost smell the vampires vile breath and feel his stealthy tread in the corridors of his most secret being and still you accuse me of stenches the invader laughed what was it you likened me to the last time a dead pig you of all people should know better for i am undead suddenly harry was cool he had felt stifled but now it was as if someone had thrown open a window to blow out all the cobwebs of his mind he filled his lungs with the rush of this weird conjectural ether and felt stronger for it and from a far more buoyant if mysterious viewpoint he wondered at the audacity of the vampire that he should feel so safe and secure as to be able to just just walk in here all of these most recent thoughts were guarded so that janos took harrys silence as an indication of sheer terror and so this is the mighty necroscope said the vampire and how does it feel to have my filthy leechs mind in your head harry harry continued to guard his thoughts it wasnt difficult it was like deadspeak where with a small effort of concentration the dead heard only what he required them to hear and again he felt a peculiar surge of confidence which was surely well out of place here for asleep and dreaming he couldnt exert half as much control over his mind as when he was awake however true that might be still he sensed that janos was becoming just a fraction more cautious you know of course that i can bend you to my will just as i bent and broke that fool jordan but was janos stating a fact or was he asking himself a question keep telling yourself that said harry without emotion but remember you entered of your own free will what and now there was a ragged worried edge to janoss thoughts as if for the first time he might be weighing the issues and considering his position here and in the back of harrys mind unsuspected by janos it was as if he heard faethor advising him again as he had in the ruins of his house outside ploiesti instead of shrinking back from him when you sense him near seek him out he would enter your mind enter his he will expect you to be afraid be bold he will threaten brush all such threats aside and strike but above all else do not let his evil weaken you and finally there may be more to your mind than even you suspect harry janos was beginning to think so too this mind of yours is different from the minds of other men it will give me great pleasure to explore it and it will give you great pain well at least you have the vanity of the wamphyri said harry but what is vanity without the means to match it you know us well said janos edgier than ever perhaps too well having second thoughts my son and again but angrily what come now not so nervous i speak more as an uncle than a true father but its a fact i do have a son of my own except of course he is wamphyri but see now i sense your trembling what you afraid how so for after all you have my measure have you not invaded my mind where is my resistance with what may i resist here you are inside the castle of my very being ah but there are castles and there are castles and some are easier to get into than they are to get out of and at last harry brought the shutters of his mind crashing down janos was confused this was no mere man it was as if he talked to something far greater than a man in his panic so the vampire became vicious these puny barriers you have erected i am surrounded by doors but i have the strength to beat them all down indeed to tear them from their hinges harry heard him but he also heard this when he yawns his great jaws at you go in through them for hes softer on the inside beat them all down then he answered tear them from their hinges if you dare janos dared he ran through harrys mind shattering every barrier the necroscope could put in his way tearing down the shutters and screens on his innermost being all harrys past was there his loves and hates his hopes and aspirations and all trampled under as the vampire marauded through previously secret corridors of id in any one of these places the monster might pause a while play cause harry to laugh cry scream or die but realizing now that indeed he had harrys measure he didnt pause but rampaged and what what he finally laughed as he came to a place more heavily fortified than all the rest put together why it can only be the very treasure house and what marvellous secrets are stored here harry keogh are these the vaults of your talents and before harry could answer if he would answer janos had wrenched two of the doors open beyond one of them was the ultimate nothing so that in a single moment janos found himself teetering on the threshold of the mцbius continuum and behind the other was faethor ferenczy crouching there where he directed harrys game and now inspired janoss uttermost terror the invader reared back from faethor who had now emerged more fully from his hiding place and was frantically trying to push him through the doorway to eternity and from the mцbius continuum both and grunted his shock astonishment and total disbelief for within a mainly human identity he had stumbled across not only an unknowable and terrifying concept but also the entirely monstrous and alien mind of his own longdead father terror galvanized him he tore himself free from faethor gasped a stream of semicoherent obscenities at him and fled he broke out of harrys id was gone in a moment he had done no real damage and the necroscope guessed that hed never dare try it again but faethor harry growled his mental voice as grim and wrenching as an old chalk on a new blackboard his own voice now no longer influenced or guided by the mind of his secret tenant and again faethor there was no answer except perhaps a far faint chuckle like oily bubbles bursting on a lake of pitch or perhaps the furtive whir of batwings echoing from the deepest darkest cave oh you bastard you liar harry howled youre in here you have been right from the moment i let you in but i can find you throw you out and at last no need my son came faethors distant diseased whisper the first battle is fought and won the sun rises i get me gone after that harry surfaced from his dreams slow and cold so that the sweat was dry on him by the time he was fully awake and darcy clarke came knocking on his door mumbling about breakfast by then too harry believed hed worked out how he was going to play the rest of it at rhodes town was only just awake but already harry was down on a pier in mandraki harbour to see his friends off darcy and manolis waved several times as their boat pulled out onto the incredible blue millpond of the aegean but he didnt wave back he simply nodded and watched them out of sight and silently wished them luck then he drove over to the beach at kritika and swam for an hour before returning to the hotel and showering even after furiously towelling himself dry and despite the fact that it was at least seventyfive degrees out in the sun he was still cold the coldness he felt had nothing to do with the outside temperature it came from inside harrys bed had been freshly made he lay on it with his hands behind his head and thought a while slowly emptying his mind and letting himself drift then made a stab at faethor and caught him there in his mind before he could wriggle down out of sight faethor right there in his mind and the time just a little after and a scorching sun standing high in the sky so much for the sun as a deterrent harry should have known ghosts dont burn it might give faethor a few bad dreams but it couldnt physically hurt him because there was nothing physical left of him any of harrys dead friends could have told him that much you old devil he said but coldly for he wasnt namecalling just stating a fact you old bastard you old liar so just like thibor fastened on dragosani youre thinking of latching on to me eh thinking of it faethor came into the open and harry could feel him as close as if he stood right there at his bedside fait accompli harry get used to it harry shook his head and grinned mirthlessly i will be rid of you he said believe me faethor ill be rid of you even if it means getting rid of myself suicide faethor tuttutted no not you harry why you are tenacious as the ones you hunt down and destroy you will not kill yourself while theres still a chance to kill another one of them another one of you you mean but you could be wrong faethor me im only human id die pretty easily a bullet through my brain like trevor jordan i wouldnt even know about it believe me its tempting i see no real notion of suicide in your thoughts faethor shrugged so why pretend do you think i feel threatened how can you threaten me harry im already dead but in me you have life right listen and ill tell you something you really dont know whats in my thoughts i can hide them even from you its deadspeak thats how i learned to do it by keeping back my thoughts from the dead i did it then so as not to hurt them but i can just as easily use it the other way for a moment the merest tick of the clock harry felt faethor wavering and he nodded knowingly see i know whats on your mind old devil but do you know whats on mine if i hide it from you so deep in the psyche of harry the father of vampires felt himself surrounded by nothing it fell on him like a blanket as if to smother him it was as if he were back in the earth near ploiesti where his evil fats had been rendered down the night ladislau giresci took his life you see harry told him letting the light of his thoughts shine in again i can shut you out not out harry you can only shut me off but the moment you relax ill be back always for a moment faethor was silent then no for we made a bargain and so long as you hold to it then so shall i when janos is no more then youll be rid of me you swear it upon my soul faethor gurgled like a nightdark swamp and smiled an immaterial smile it was the natural sarcasm of the vampire but harry only said til hold you to that and his mental voice was cold as the spaces between the stars just remember faethor ill hold you to it manolis handled the boat it had a small cabin and a large engine and left a wake like low white walls melting back into the blue always in sight of land they had rounded cape koumbourno and outpaced the waterskiers off kritika beach before harry had even hit the water there by am they had passed cape minas and with the mainland lying to port were heading for alimnia darcy had thought he might have trouble with his stomach but the sea was like glass and with the wind in his face he might easily be enjoying an expensive holiday that is if he wasnt perfectly sure he was heading for horror around a pair of dolphins played chicken across the prow of the boat where it sliced the water by which time theyd passed between the almost barren rocks of alimnia and makri and halki had swum into view fifteen minutes later they were into the harbour and tied up and manolis was chatting with a pair of weathered fishermen where they mended their nets while he made his apparently casual inquiries darcy bought a map from a tiny box of a shop right on the waterfront and studied what he could of the islands layout there wasnt a great deal to study the island was a big rock something less than eight by four miles with the long axis lying east to west looking west a mile or two mountain crests stood wild and desolate where the islands one road of any description wandered apparently aimlessly and darcy knew that his and manoliss destination lay way up there in the heights at the end of that road he didnt need the map to know it his talent had been telling him ever since he stepped from the boat to dry land eventually done with talking to the fishermen manolis joined him no transport he said it is maybe two miles then the climbing and of course we will be carrying our how do you say picnic basket it looks like a long hot walk my friend and all of it uphill darcy looked around well whats that he said if not transport a threewheeled device clattering like a steamengine and pulling a fourwheel cart came clanking out of a narrow street to park in the centre of town that being the waterfront with its bars and tavernas the driver was a slim small greek of about fortyfive he got down from his drivers seat and went into a grocery store darcy and manolis were waiting for him when he came out his name was nikos he owned a taverna and rooms on a beach across the bottleneck of the promontory behind the town business was slow right now and he could run them up to the end of the road for a small remuneration when manolis mentioned a sum of fifteen hundred drachmae his eyes lit up like lamps and after hed collected his fish groceries booze and other items for the taverna then they were off sitting in the back of the cart had to be better than walking but not much better on the way nikos stopped to unload his purchases at the taverna and to open a couple of bottles of beer for his passengers and then the journey continued after a little while and when hed adjusted his position against the jolting darcy took a swig of his beer and said what did you find out there are two of them manolis answered they come down at evening to buy meat red meat no fish and maybe drink a bottle of wine they stay together dont talk much do their own cooking up at the site if they cook he shrugged and looked narroweyed at darcy they work mainly at night when the wind is in the right direction the villagers occasionally hear them blasting nothing big just small charges to shift the rocks and the rubble during the day they are not seen to do too much they laze around in the caves up there what about the tourists darcy inquired wouldnt they be a nuisance and how come lazarides or janos gets away with it i mean digging in these ruins is your government crazy or something this is its history again manoliss shrug the vrykoulakas apparently has his friends anyway they are not actually digging in the ruins beyond the castle where it sits up on the crest the cliff falls away very steeply down there are ledges and caves this is where they are digging the villagers think they are the crazy men what treasure up there dust and rocks and thats all darcy nodded but janos knows better eh lets face it if he buried it he should know where to dig for it manolis agreed as for the tourists there are maybe thirty of them right now they spend their time in the tavernas on the beach lazing around they are on holiday right some climb up to the castle but never down the other side and never at night it feels weird said darcy after a while what does were going up there to kill these things right manolis answered but only if its necessary i mean only if they are things darcy gave an involuntary shudder and glanced at the long narrow wicker basket which lay between them inside it were spearguns wooden stakes harry keoghs crossbow and a gallon of petrol in a plastic container oh they are he said then and offered a curt nod you can believe me they are fifteen minutes later nikos brought his vehicle to a halt in a rising reentry to the left pathways which were little more than goat tracks led steeply up through the ruined streets of an ancient longdeserted hill town above the ruins stood a gleaming white monastery apparently still in use and higher still on the almost sheer crown of the mountain itself the castle manolis breathed as nikos and his wonderful threewheel workhorse made an awkward turn and went rattling and jolting back down into the valley darcy shielded his eyes to gaze up at the ominous walls of the castle standing guard there as it had through all the long centuries but is there a way up yes manolis nodded a goat track hairpins all the way but quite safe according to the fishermen anyway carrying the basket between them they set out to climb beyond the monastery and before the real climbing could begin they paused to look back across the valley they could pick out the boundaries of longforsaken fields and the shells of old houses where olive groves and orchards had long run wild and returned to nature sponges said manolis by way of explanation they were sponge fishermen these people but when the sponges ran out so did the people now as you see its mainly ruins perhaps one day the tourists will bring it back to life again eh darcy had other things than life on his mind lets get on he said already i dont want to go any further and if we hang about much longer i wont want to go at all after that it was all ochre boulders yellow outcrops and winding goat tracks and where there were gaps in the rocks dizzying views which were almost vertiginous but eventually they found themselves in the shadow of enormous walls and passed under a massive sloping stone lintel into the ruin itself the place was polyglot and darcy had been right about its historic value it was ancient greek byzantine and last but not least crusader climbing up onto walls three to four feet thick the view was fantastic with all the coastlines of halki and its neighbouring islands laid open to them they clambered over heaps of stony debris in the shell of a crusader chapel whose walls still carried fading murals of saints wearing faded haloes and finally stood on the rim of the ruins looking down on the bay of trachia down there said manolis thats where they are look do you see those signs of excavation where all of that rubble makes a dark streak on the weathered rocks thats them now we must find the track down to them darcy are you all right you have that look again darcy was anything but all right they theyre down there he said i feel rooted to the spot every step weighs like lead christ my talents a coward you want to rest here a moment god no if i stop now ill not get started again lets get on there were several empty cigarette packets scuff marks on the rocks places where the sandy soil had been compacted by booted feet the way down was neither hard to find nor difficult to negotiate soon they found a rusting wheelbarrow and a broken pick standing on the wide shelf of a natural ledge which had weathered out from the strata and halfway along the ledge that was where much of the stony debris had been excavated from the mouths of several gaping caves moving quietly they approached the cave showing the most recent signs of work and paused at its entrance and as they took out spearguns from their basket and loaded them manolis whispered youre sure well need these yes oh yes darcy nodded his face ashen manolis took a step into the echoing mouth of the cave wait darcy gasped his adams apple working it would be safer to call them out and let them know were here in the sunlight well have the advantage darcy gulped and anyway my urge to get the fuck out of here just climbed the scale by several big notches which probably means they already know were here he was right a shadow stepped forward out of the caves darker shadows moving carefully towards them where they stood in the entrance they looked at each other with widening eyes and together thumbed the safeties off their weapons and lifted them warningly the man in the cave kept coming but turned his shoulder side on and went into something of a forward leaning crouch manolis spat out a stream of gabbled greek curses snatched his beretta from its shoulder holster and transferred the speargun to his left hand the man thing vampire was still coming at them out of the dark but they saw him more clearly now he was tall slim strangely raggedlooking in silhouette he wore a widebrimmed hat baggy trousers a shirt whose unbuttoned sleeves flapped loosely at the wrists he looked for all the world like a scarecrow let down off his pole but it wasnt crows he was scaring only one of them darcy gasped and felt his hair stand on end as he heard pebbles sliding and clattering on the ledge behind them the man in the cave lunged forward manoliss gun flashed blindingly deafeningly darcy looked back and saw a second creature bearing down on them but this one was much closer like his colleague in the cave he wore a floppy hat and in its shade his eyes were yellow viciously feral worse he held a pickaxe slantingly overhead and his face was twisted in a snarl where he aimed it at darcys back darcy or perhaps his talent turned himself to meet the attack aimed pointblank squeezed the trigger of his speargun the harpoon flew straight to its target in the vampires chest the impact brought him to a halt he dropped his pickaxe clutched at the spear where it transfixed him staggered back against the wall of the cliff darcy frozen for a moment could only watch him lurching and mewling there coughing up blood in the cave manolis cursed and fired his gun again and yet again as he followed his target deeper into the darkness then darcy heard an inhuman shriek followed by the slither of silver on steel and finally the meaty thwack of manoliss harpoon entering flesh the sounds brought him out of his shock as he realized that both his and manoliss weapons were now empty he leaned to grab a harpoon from the open basket and the man on the ledge staggered forward and kicked the whole thing basket and contents right off the rim jesus darcy yelled his throat hoarse and dry as sandpaper as again the flameeyed thing turned towards him then the vampire paused looked about and saw its pickaxe where it lay close to the rising cliff it moved to pick it up and darcy moved too his talent told him to run run run but he yelled fuck you and flew like a madman at the stooping vampire he bowled the thing over and himself snatched up the pick the tool was heavy but such was darcys terror that it felt like a toy in his hands manolis came unsteadily out of the cave in time to see darcy swing his weapon in a deadly arc and punch the wider point of its dualpurpose head into his undead opponents forehead the creature made gurgling gagging sounds and sank to its knees then slumped against the cliff face petrol manolis gasped over the edge darcy told him his voice a croak manolis looked over the rim further down the mountain maybe fifty feet lower the wicker basket was jammed in the base of a rocky outcrop where debris from the diggings had piled up to form a scree slide the lid was open and several items lay scattered about you stay keep watch and ill get it manolis said he gave darcy his gun and started to clamber down darcy kept one eye on the vampire with the pickaxe in his head and the other on the leering mouth of the cave the creature he had dealt with a man yes but a creature too was not dead it should be but of course it was undead the small percentage of its system which was vampire protoplasm was working in it even now desperately healing its wounds even as darcy watched it shuddered and its yellow eyes opened and its hand crept shakily towards the harpoon in its chest gritting his teeth darcy stepped closer to it his guardian angel howled at him poured adrenalin into his veins and yelled run run but he shut out all warnings and grasped the end of the spear and yanked it this way and that in the vampires flesh until the thing gnashed its teeth and coughed up blood then flopped back and lay still again darcy stepped back from it on legs that trembled like jelly and gave a mighty heartstopping start as something grasped his ankle he glanced back and down and saw the one from the cave where hed come crawling his iron hand clasping darcys foot there was a spear through his throat just under the adams apple and the right side of the things face had been shot half away but still he was mobile and one mad eye continued to glare from a black orbit set in a mess of red flesh darcy might easily have fainted then instead he fell backwards away from the undead thing and sat down with a bump on the ledge and aiming directly between his feet he emptied manoliss gun right into the grimacing halfface at that point manolis returned he hauled the basket up behind him ripped open its lid and yanked out harry keoghs crossbow a moment later he was loading up and just in time for the one on the ledge had torn the pickaxe from its head and was now working to pull out the harpoon from its chest jesus oh jesus manolis croaked he stepped close to the bloodfrothing horror aimed his weapon from less than three feet away and fired the wooden bolt straight into its heart darcy had meanwhile scrambled backwards away from the other creature manolis caught hold of him and hauled him to his feet said lets finish it while we still can they dragged the vampires back inside the cave as far back as they dared then hurried back out into sunlight but darcy was finished he could do no more his talent was freezing hiiri right out of it is ok manolis understood i can do it darcy crawled away along the ledge and sat there shivering while manolis took up the petrol and again entered the cave a moment later and he reappeared leaving a thin trail of petrol behind him hed liberally doused everything in the cave and the container was almost empty he backed away towards darcy sprinkling the last few drops then tossed the container far out into empty air and took out a cigarette lighter striking the flint he held the naked flame to the trail of petrol blue fire so faint as to be almost invisible raced back along the ledge and into the mouth of the cave there came a whoosh and a tongue of fire like some giants blowtorch followed in the next moment by a terrific explosion that blew out the mouth of the cave in chunks of shattered rock and brought loose scree and pebbles avalanching down from above the shock of it was sufficient to cause manolis to stumble and sit down beside darcy they looked at each other and darcy said what the manoliss jaw hung loosely open then he licked dry lips and said their explosives they must have kept their explosive charges in there they got up and went shakily back to the blocked mouth of the cave down below boulders were still bounding down the mountains steep contours to the sea hundreds of tons of rock had come crushingly down sealing the diggings off and it was plain that nothing alive but nothing was ever going to come out of there its done said manolis and darcy found strength to nod his agreement as they turned away darcy saw something gleaming yellow in the rubble next door to the collapsed cave another smaller opening was still issuing puffs of dust and a little smoke the stone wall between the two excavations had been shattered spilling fractured rock onto the ledge but among the debris lay a lot more than just rocks darcy and manolis stepped among the rubble and looked more closely at what had been unearthed there in that broken wall carefully packed in and sealed behind cleverly shaped blocks of stone had lain the treasure for which jianni lazarides alias janos ferenczy had searched that same treasure he himself had lain down all those centuries ago only the changing contours of the mountain carved and fretted by nature in storms and earthquakes had confused and foiled him the old crusader castle had been his landmark but even that massive silhouette had crumbled and changed through the long years still hed missed his mark by no more than two or three feet the two men scuffed among the dust and broken rocks their excitement dulled to anticlimax after the horror of their too recent experience they saw a treasure out of time thracian gold small bowls and lidded cups gold rhytons spilling rings necklaces and arm clasps a bronze helmet stuffed to brimming with earrings belt clasps and pectorals even a buckled breastplate of solid gold their find eventually got through to manolis but what do we do with it we leave it here darcy straightened up it belongs to the ghosts we dont know what it cost janos to bring it here and bury it or where or how he got it in the first place but theres blood on it be sure eventually someone will come looking for those two and find this instead let the authorities handle it i dont even want to touch it you are right said manolis and they climbed back up to the castle by the two were back down into the village where manolis refuelled the boat for the trip to karpathos while he worked his fishermen friends came over and asked how were the diggers they were blasting manolis answered after a moment so we didnt disturb them anyway the cliffs are very steep and a man could easily fall snotty buggers anyway one of the fishermen commented they dont bother with us and we dont bother with them finished with his fuelling manolis bought a litre of ouzo and they all sat around tables in an open taverna and killed the bottle dead later as their boat pulled away from the stone jetty the greek said i needed that darcy sighed and agreed me too its nasty thirsty work manolis looked at him and nodded and a lot more of it to come before were through my friend it is perhaps the good job ouzo is cheap eh just think with all of that gold we left up there we could have bought the distillery darcy looked back and watched the hump of rock which was halki slowly sinking on the horizon and thought yes and maybe well wish we had halki to karpathos was a little more than sixty miles by the route manolis chose he preferred to stay in sight of land so far as possible and to cruise rather than race his engine when the rocks ktenia and karavolas were behind them then he set a course more nearly southwest and left rhodes behind for karpathos proper that meant the open sea and now darcys stomach began to play him up a little it was a purely physical thing and not too bad after what hed faced already he wasnt going to throw up now at least his talent wasnt warning against shipwrecks or anything to take darcys mind off his misery manolis told him a few details about karpathos second biggest of the dodecanese islands he said she lies just about halfway between rhodes and crete where halki goes east to west karpathos she goes north to south maybe fifty kilometres long but only seven or eight wide just the crest of submarine mountains thats all not the big place really and not many peoples but she has known the turbulent history is that right said darcy scarcely listening oh yes just about everyone ruled or owned or was the governor of karpathos at one time or another the arabs italian pirates out of genoa the venetians crusaders of the knights of st john turks russians even the british huh it took seven centuries for us greeks to get it back and when there was no answer darcy are you all right only just how long before were there were almost halfway there already my friend another hour or not much more and well be rounding the point just under the landing strip thats where we should find the lazarus we can take a look at her but thats all maybe we can hail someone or something on board and see what we think of him right now i dont think much of anybody said darcy but as it happened manolis was wrong and the lazarus was not there they searched the small bays at the southern extremity of the island but found no sign of the white ship manoliss patience was soon exhausted in a little while when it became obvious that their searching was in vain he headed north for the sandy shallowwater beach at amoupi and anchored there where they could wade ashore they ate a greek salad at the beach taverna and drank a small bottle of retsina between them when darcy fell asleep in his chair under the tavernas splitbamboo awning then manolis sighed sat back and lit a cigarette he smoked several admired the tanned bouncing breasts of english girls where they played in the sea drank another bottle of retsina before it was time to wake darcy up just after they set out to return to rhodes that evening coming in stiff weary and tanned by sun and seaspray darcy and manolis found four people waiting for them in the lounge of their hotel there were several moments of confusion darcy knew two of the arrivals well enough for ben trask and david chung were his own men but zekintha foener and her husband michael or jazz were strangers to him except by hearsay darcy had anticipated four and had booked accommodation accordingly but of this specific group he had only expected two on harry keoghs advice he had tried to get a message to zek and jazz that they should stay out of it but either it hadnt reached them or they had chosen to ignore it he would find out later the two missing men were ebranch operatives finalizing a job in england who would fly out here asap on completion of that task the four newcomers having already dropped off their luggage in their rooms and introduced each other were more or less ready to talk business darcy need only introduce manolis and make known the greek policemans role in things then replay the action so far and all systems would be go before that however darcy and manolis excused themselves and took invigorating showers before rejoining the ebranch people where they waited for them then manolis took them all to a rather expensive taverna on the other side of town which wasnt likely to be swamped with tourists and there arranged seating around a large secluded corner table with a view on the night ocean here darcy quickly restated the introductions this time detailing the various talents of his group there was the married couple zek and jazz simmons who had been on starside together with harry keogh zek was a telepath of outstanding ability and an authority on vampires she was experienced as few before her in that she had met up with the minds of the real thing the wamphyri themselves in an entirely alien world she was very goodlooking about fivenine in height slim blonde and blueeyed her greek mother had named her after zante the island where she was born her father had been east german a parapsychologist zek would be in her midthirties maybe eighteen months to two years older than her husband jazz simmons had no extraordinary talents other than those with which an entirely mundane mother nature had endowed him plus those in which british intelligence had expertly instructed him after starside he had opted out of intelligence work to be with zek in greece and the greek islands just a fraction under six feet tall jazz had unruly red hair a square jaw under slightly hollow cheeks grey eyes good strong teeth hands that were hard for all that they were artistically tapered and long arms that gave him something of a gangling looselimbed appearance lean tanned and athletic he looked deceptively easygoing was easygoing in normal circumstances and when there was little or no pressure but he was not to be underestimated hed been trained to a cutting edge in surveillance close protection escape and evasion winter warfare survival weapons handling demolition and unarmed combat the only thing jazz had lacked had been experience and hed got that in the best or worst of all possible places on starside then there were the two men from ebranch david chung a locator and scryer and ben trask a human liedetector chung was twentysix a chinese cockney tried and true born within the sound of bow bells he had been with the branch for nearly six years and during that time had trained himself to a high degree in the extrasensory location of illegal drugs especially cocaine if not for the fact that hed been working on a longterm case in london then he and not ken layard might well have been out here in the first place ben trask was a blocky five feet ten mouseyhaired and greeneyed overweight and slopeshouldered and usually wore what could only be described as a lugubrious expression his speciality was truth presented with a lie or deliberately falsified concept trask would spot it immediately ebranch loaned him out to the police authorities on priority jobs and he was in great demand by foreign affairs to see through the political posturing of certain less than honest members of the international community ben trask knew the ins and outs of londons foreign embassies better than most people know the backs of their hands also hed played a part in the yulian bodescu affair and wasnt likely to take anything too lightly while they waited for their meals darcy filled in all the missing pieces for his team and watched them tighten up as the full horror of the situation was brought home to them then he was interested to know why jazz and zek had invited themselves in on this thing jazz answered for them its harry isnt it harry keogh he gets our vote every time if harry has problems its no use telling zek and me to keep a low profile thats very loyal of you darcy told him but it was harry himself who would have preferred to keep you out of it for your own sakes not that im complaining im short of a couple of good hands and you two probably fit the bill perfectly harrys main concern was that janos ferenczy is one powerful mentalist he has already killed trevor jordan and controls ken layard so you can see why harry was worried he was mainly concerned about what would happen if janos came up against you zek however since janos is now in romania that is to the best of our knowledge and with harry gone there to hunt him down darcy shrugged myself im delighted to have you on the team so when does it all start for us i mean david chung was eager to get into it for you it starts tomorrow darcy told him the active service part of it anyway tonight back at the hotel after weve finished here that will be the time for preparation and planning thats when we detail as best we can who will be doing what and to whom he spied a waiter moving towards their table with a loaded trolley as for this very moment i suggest we enjoy our food and relax as best we can because youd better believe that tomorrows a busy day while darcy clarke and his team thought forward to their next day harry keogh was looking back on the one just ended harrys flight to athens had been uneventful aboard the plane for budapest however when hed closed his eyes even before takeoff and determined to catch an hours sleep hed felt them there the moment he began to drift into dreams alien probes touching on his mind and knowing they were there hed forced himself to stay awake and alert while yet hiding that fact from the telepathic talents who had found him they could only be ken layard and sandra but their esp was cold now and tainted almost completely in thrall to janos ferenczy their tentative touches were slimy as the walls of a sewer so that harry must fight not to recoil from them but he remembered what faethor had told him and strangely enough accepted that it was probably good advice instead of shrinking back from him when you sense him near seek him out he would enter your mind enter his and as the vampire intelligences grew less apprehensive of discovery and avidly scanned him so harry in turn scanned them indeed he spoke to them in whispers under his breath ken sandra so he has your cooperation now well and youve done a good job for him but why so secretive about it eh i was expecting you i knew that he would use you that in fact he cant do without you what him face to face and man to man not a chance your vampire superman is a coward he fears ill creep up on him in the night one man against him and everything he harbours up there in that pesthole in the mountains and hes afraid of me you warned me hed read the future and seen his victory there well you can tell him from me that the future doesnt always work out that way ahhh he sensesss ussss it was sandra hissing like a snake in harrys mind he knows us his thoughts are strong his hidden strengths are surfacing she was right and harry felt the strangeness of it he was stronger and didnt know the source of his new vitality was it faethor he wondered possibly but for the moment there was nothing he could do about faethor and in a storm any port is better than none ken layards locators mind was fastened on harry like a carrier beam he let his own slide down it to its source gazed out through layards eyes it was as if harry were there in the flesh and he was in layards flesh they were in the same subterranean room as before sandra sat opposite him at the table and janos furiously paced the pavings to and fro to and fro where is he what is he thinking the monsters eyes burned red where he turned them on sandra plainly he was worried but he tried to hide it behind a mask of fury he is aboard a plane sandra answered and he is coming so soon hes a madman doesnt he know hell die can he not see that my plans for him go beyond death what are his thoughts he hides them from me janos stopped pacing thrust his halfhandsome halfhideous face at her he hides his thoughts and you a mentalist a thoughtthief what and do you seek to make a fool of me and have i not warned you how it will go for you if you continue to place obstacles in my way now i ask you again what are his thoughts the master vampire had come forward to lean upon the table with both hands glaring into the frightened girls eyes from only inches away his lips curled back like a leather muzzle shrivelling from the jagged teeth of some dead carnivore threatening her all too graphically but she had no answer for him except he he is too strong for me too strong for you janos raged too strong listen in the bowels of this very castle lie the ashes of men like satyrs who in their day swarmed rampant across this land raping to the death women men and babes alike he told her aye and when theyd slain the lot then even the beasts of the field were not beneath their lust for two thousand years some of these creatures whose loins are now dust whose bones are turned to salts have gone without but i say this to you do my bidding now before im tempted to raise them up and command them how to instruct you an unending torment sandra aye for i would line them up against you and as fast as they tore you your vampire would repair the damage only picture it your sweet flesh awash in all their filth ruined and ruined again and again and again harry looked at him out of layards eyes drew phlegm up from layards throat and spat it into the vampires face and as the monster went reeling gurgling and clawing at his face harry said to him with layards voice are you deaf as well as insane janos ferenczy she cant see into my affairs for i am right here seeing into yours layard shocked and astonished sat clutching at his own throat but for a few seconds more at least harry kept a grip on what he now commanded janos staggered back to the table his head cocked questioningly disbelievingly on one side what he glared madly at layard what he lifted a claw of a hand go on harry taunted strike for its only your thrall youll hurt and not the one who commands him janoss jaw fell open he understood you he breathed harry caused layards face to split into a humourless grin and you know he said this fascination of yours with my mind isnt merely unhealthy and irksome i suspect its also contagious i had thought you would learn your lesson janos but apparently i was wrong very well so now lets see what goes on in your head release him janos howled clutching his head in talon hands and hurling himself away from the table send the necroscope out of here i dont want him in my mind dont worry harry told him as layard jerked and writhed where he sat did you really think i would bathe myself in a sewer only remember this janos ferenczy you sought to discover my plans well and now ill tell them to you im coming for you janos and as you now see our powers are more or less equal he withdrew from layards mind and opened his eyes the plane was off the ground heading north and a little west for budapest and harry was well satisfied back in edinburgh less than a week ago hed wondered at his precognitive glimpses of some vague and frightening future and felt that he stood on the threshold of strange new developments now he experienced a sense of justification his necroscopes powers were growing expanding to fill the gap created by harry jnrs tampering that was harrys explanation anyway halfway into the flight asleep in his seat and unafraid to be asleep harry reached out with his deadspeak and found mцbius resting in the leipzig graveyard where he lay buried mцbius knew him at once and said harry i called out to you but got no answer actually ive been halfafraid to contact you that last time it was frightening harry harry nodded so now you know what im up against well at the moment i have him on the run hes not sure what i can do but he knows whatever he plans against me will have to be more physical than mental physically im still very vulnerable thats why i need the mцbius continuum mцbius was at once willing you want me to take it up where i left off yes very well open your mind to me harry did as he was instructed said enter of your own free will and a moment later felt mцbius timid in the labyrinth vaults of his mind youre an open book said mцbius could read you if i wished it find the pages that are stuck down harry told him unglue them for me thats the part of me that ive lost only unlock those doors and ill have access to my best shot mцbius went deeper into yawning caverns of extramundane mind and locked he said then say they have been and by an expert but harry these are no ordinary locks and bolts and bars im within the threshold of your knowledge where an entire section has been closed off this is indeed the source of your instinctive maths but it is sealed with symbols i dont even recognize whoever did it was a genius harry offered a grim nod yes he was but faethor ferenczy and his son janos they were both able to open those doors by sheer force of will mцbius was realistic they are wamphyri harry and i was only a man i was a determined man and i was patient but i was not a giant you cant do it harry held his breath not by force of will by reason perhaps then do what you can harry breathed again may need your help how can i help you while i work you can study study what your numbers said mцbius surprised what else but i know less than a backward child harry protested why to me the very word numbers suggests only a vague and troublesome concept study them anyway mцbius told him and lit up a screen before his inner eye simple additions awaited solutions and incomplete multiplication tables glared at harry with empty white spaces for eyes waiting for him to print the answers on their pupils i i dont know the fucking answers harry groaned then work them out mцbius growled for he had problems enough of his own four rows of seats in front of harry across the central aisle someone turned to glance back at his pale troubled sleeping face the man was girlslender and effeminate in his mannerisms he smoked a marlboro in a cigarette holder and his heavylidded deep seteyes were dark as his thoughts nikolai zharov had fouled up very badly in england and this was his punishment where norman harold wellesley and romanias securitatea had failed now it was zharovs turn his superiors had spelled it out to him go to greece and kill keogh yourself and if you fail dont bother to come back well greece was way back there somewhere now but zharov didnt suppose it mattered much greece hungary romania who would care where he died no one at all just as long as he died by pm harry keogh tourist had been out of budapest airport and onto a train heading east for a place called mezobereny that had been the end of the line for him the halt at which hed disembarked past mezobereny the tracks turned southward for arad which was too far out of his way from now on harry would go by bus taxi cart on foot whatever it took on the outskirts of mezobereny he found a small family hotel called the sarkad after the district where he took a room for the night hed chosen the sarkad for the old world graveyard which stood guarded by tall shady trees in a few acres just across the dusty village road if there were to be night visitations dreams influenced by his enemies maybe or perhaps more physical visitors harry wanted the dead on his side which was why before he settled down for the night he stood by his window and sent his deadspeak thoughts out across the road to the dead in their graves they had heard of the necroscope of course but could scarcely believe that he was actually here full of questions they kept him busy until late but as the midnight hour slipped by harry was obliged to tell them that he was tired and that he really must rest in preparation for the day ahead and getting into bed he thought to himself what a masterpiece of understatement harry was no spy in the normal sense of the word if he had been then he might have noticed the man whod followed him from the railway station to the sarkad and taken the room next door earlier nikolai zharov had listened to the necroscope moving about in his room and when harry had gone to his window so had the russian the light from the rooms had fallen on the road casting harrys shadow where he stood looking out zharov had moved back put out his light then approached the window again and hed looked where harry was looking then for the first time zharov had noticed the graveyard and at that hed shuddered drawn his curtains lit a cigarette and sat on the edge of his bed to smoke it zharov knew about harry keoghs talent he had been in bonnyrig when wellesley tried to kill the necroscope and hed seen what came out of keoghs garden after the traitors attack failed add to that certain details from the report of those securitatea cretins in romania and perhaps this wasnt after all the perfect time or place for a murder but it seemed a perfectly good time to check his weapons he opened the secret compartment in the base of his briefcase took out and assembled the parts of a small but deadly automatic pistol a magazine of sixteen rounds went up into the grip and a spare magazine into his pocket there was also a knife with an eightinch blade slender as a screwdriver and a garotte consisting of a pair of grips with eighteen inches of piano wire strung between them any one of these methods would suffice but zharov must be sure when the time came that it was performed with despatch keogh must not be given the least opportunity to talk to anyone or rather to anything and again the picture of those two people spied across the river near bonnyrig coming out of keoghs garden flashed unbidden on zharovs minds eye he remembered how theyd moved each step an effort of supernatural will and how one of them had seemed to be leaving bits behind which followed on of their own accord after him into the night it was early when the russian thought these things he wasnt yet ready for bed putting on his coat again hed gone down to the hotel barroom to get himself a drink indeed several drinks just as harry had talked to his new friends in their place across the road when he was awake so he now talked to them in his dreams except this time the conversation was far less coherent indeed vague as most dreams are but he was not so deeply asleep that he couldnt sense ken layards locator mind when it swept over him nor so far removed from the waking situation that he couldnt distinguish between the trivial gossip of the teeming dead and the occasional tidbit of reallife importance so that when his deadspeak thoughts first picked up the new voice he knew instinctively that this was a matter of some consequence accordingly he made inquiry who are you were you looking for me harry keogh the new voice came up stronger thank god ive found you do i know you harry was a little cautious in a way said the other weve met indeed i tried to kill you now harry recognized him and knew why he hadnt made the connection earlier it was simple this was a voice he would normally associate with life until now anyway it wasnt or at least it shouldnt be the voice of a dead man wellesley he said but what happened you mean why am i dead well they put me through quite a lot harry not physical stuff no of course not but lots of questioning you know physical i could probably handle but mental the deeper they dug into me the more clearly i could see what a shit id been it was all over for me a long term to serve no career to go back to no real prospects well it sounds hackneyed i know but the simple fact of it was that i was a ruined man so i hanged myself see they dont offer you a gun anymore the honourable solution and all that rot so i used a pair of leather bootlaces i was halfafraid theyd snap but they didnt harry found it hard to pity him the man was a traitor after all so what do you want from me he said would you like me to say how sorry i am offer you a shoulder to cry on hey i have lots of friends among the dead who didnt try to kill me thats not why im here harry wellesley told him no for i got what i deserved i think we all do i came to say im sorry thats all to apologize that i wasnt stronger harry gave a snort oh wow he said gee harry im sorry i wasnt stronger hey if i had been i wouldve fucking killed you wellesley sighed well it was worth a try im sorry i bothered you its just that when i killed myself i didnt know my hard times were only just beginning he began to withdraw whats that harry held him your hard times then he saw what the other meant the dead dont want to know you right wellesley shrugged he was a beaten man something like that but its like i said we get what we deserve im sorry i bothered you harry no wait harry had an idea listen what would you say to a chance to square it with me and with the dead in general is there a way there could be it all depends just name it you had this negative sort of talent right thats right nobody could see into my mind but as you can see it died with me harry shook his head maybe it didnt you see what were doing now isnt the same it isnt telepathy but deadspeak you control it yourself you dont have to speak to me if you dont want to that other thing you had was uncontrollable you didnt even know it was there if someone hadnt noticed it hadnt discovered that your mind was a stone wall you still wouldnt know youd ever had it am i right i suppose you are but what are you getting at im not sure said harry im not even sure if its possible but it would be one hell of a bonus if i had that talent of yours well obviously it would wellesley answered but as youve just pointed out it wasnt a talent it was some kind of negative charge it was there all the time working on its own without my knowledge or assistance maybe so but somewhere in your mind theres the mechanism that governed it id just like to see how it works thats all then if i could sort of imitate it learn how to switch it on and off at will you want to have a look inside my mind are you saying theres a way you can do that maybe there is said harry with your help and maybe thats why no one else ever could because you just kept them out now tell me did you ever read my file of course wellesley gave a wry chuckle at the time i thought it was fantastic i remember one of the espers seeing your file lying on my desk and telling me i wouldnt be caught dead speaking to that guy thats not at all bad harry laughed but he was serious again in a moment and did you read about dragosani and how he stole max batus evil eye that too wellesley answered but he cut it out of his heart read it in his guts tasted it in his blood yes he did harry nodded but it doesnt have to be that way you see thats always been the difference between me and dragosanis sort its the difference between a necromancer and a necroscope he would take what he wanted by force he would torture for it but me i only ask anything i have i give it willingly wellesley told him again harry nodded well that will go a long way with the dead he said so how will you do it wellesley was eager now actually said harry its you who has to do it really so tell me how just let your mind go blank and invite me in harry answered just relax like i was a hypnotist putting you to sleep and say to me enter of your own free will as easily as that the first part anyway said harry very well wellesley was committed so lets try it thracians undead in the med szgany later mцbius came calling harry listen my boy im sorry ive been so long but those mental doors of yours were giving me real problems however and as you well know the more difficult a problem is the more surely it fascinates me so ive been in conference with a few friends and between us weve decided its a new maths what is harry was bewildered and what friends the doors in your mind are sealed shut with numbers mцbius explained but theyre written as symbols like a sort of algebra and what they amount to is the most complicated simultaneous equation you could possibly imagine go on well i could never hope to solve it on my own not unless i cared to spend the next hundred years on it for you see its the sort of problem which may only be resolved through trial and error so ever since i left you ive been looking up certain colleagues and passing it on to them colleagues mцbius sighed harry there were others before me and some of them were a very long time before me but as you of all people know they havent simply gone away theyre still there doing in death what they did in life so ive passed parts of the problem on to them and let me tell you that was no simple matter mercifully however they had all heard of you and to my delight they welcomed me as a colleague however junior you junior in the company of such as aristotle ptolemy copernicus kepler galilei sir isaac newton ole christensen roemer even i am a junior yes and einstein a mere sprout harrys thoughts whirled but werent they mainly astronomers and philosophers mathematicians and many other things said mцbius the sciences interlace and interact harry so as you can see ive been busy but through all of this there was one man i would have liked to approach and didnt dare and do you know he came looking for me it seems he was affronted that hed been left out so who is he harry was fascinated pythagoras harry was stunned still here and still the great mystic and still insisting that god is the ultimate equation but here mцbius grew very quiet and the trouble is im not so sure any more that hes wrong still harry was astonished pythagoras on my case my mother told me there were a lot of people willing to help me but pythagoras mцbius snapped out of his musing hmm yes oh yes but does he have the time for it i mean arent there more pressing no mцbius cut him short for him this is of the ultimate importance dont you realize who pythagoras was and what he did why in the th century bc he had already anticipated the philosophy of numbers he was the principal advocate of the theory that number is the essence of all things the metaphysical principle of rational order in the universe whats more his leading theological doctrine was metempsychosis lost harry could only shake his head and that has something to do with me again mцbiuss sigh my boy youre not listening no you are you are its your damned innumeracy which makes you blind to what im saying it has everything to do with you for after two and a half millennia you are living proof of everything pythagoras advocated you harry the one flesh and blood man in all the world who ever imposed his metaphysical mind on the physical universe harry tried to grasp what mцbius had said but it wouldnt stand still for him it was his innumeracy getting in the way so im going to be ok right were going to break down those doors harry yes given time of course how much time but here mцbius could only shrug hours days weeks we have no way of knowing weeks doesnt cut it harry told him neither does days hours sounds good to me well were trying harry were trying in the heights over halmagiu close to the ruins of his castle janos ferenczy bloodson of faethor ranted and raved he had brought sandra and ken layard up onto the sloping crest of a wedge of rock that jutted out into space a thousand feet above the sliding scree and the steep cliffs of the mountainside the night winds themselves were disturbed by janoss passion they blustered around the high rock threatening to tear the three loose and hurl them down be quiet he threatened the very elements be still and as the winds subsided there where the clouds scudded like things afraid across the face of the moon so the enraged vampire turned on his thralls you he drew layard close gathered up the skin at the back of his neck like a mother cat holds its kitten thrust him towards the edge of the sheer drop i have broken your bones once and must i do it again now tell me where is he where is harry keogh layard wriggled in his grasp pointed to the northwest he was there i swear it less than a hundred miles less than an hour ago i sensed him there he was strong even a beacon but now there is nothing nothing janos hissed turning layards face towards his own and am i a fool you were a talented man a locator but as a vampire your powers are immeasurably improved if it can be found then you can find it so how can you tell me youve lost him how can he be there and then no longer there does he come on even through the night is he somewhere between speak and he gave the other a bonejarring shake he was there layard shrieked i felt him there alone in one place probably settled in for the night i know he was there i found him swept over him and back but i didnt dare linger on him for fear hed follow me back to you only ask the girl shell tell you its true you are in leagued janos hurled him to his knees then snatched at sandras gauzy shift and tore it from her she cringed naked under the moon and tried to cover herself her eyes yellow in the pale oval of her skull but in another moment she drew herself upright janos had already done his worst against horror that numbs flesh has no feeling hes speaking the truth she said i couldnt enter the necroscopes mind in case he entered mine and through me yours but when i sensed him asleep then i thought i might risk a glimpse i tried and he was no longer there or if he was then his mind was closed janos looked at her for long moments let his scarlet gaze burn on her and penetrate until he was sure shed spoken only the truth then and so he is coming he growled well and that was what i wanted wanted sandra smiled at him perhaps a little too knowingly past tense but no longer eh janos he scowled at her caught her shoulder forced her down beside layard then he turned his face to the northwest and held his arms out to the night i lay me down a mist in the valleys he intoned i invoke the lungs of the earth to breathe for me and send up their reek into the air to make his path obscure i call on my familiars to seek him out and make his labours known to me and to the very rocks of the mountains that they shall defy him and these things will stop him sandra tried desperately hard to control her vampire scorn janos turned his crimson gaze on her and she saw that his nose had flattened down and become convoluted like the snout of a bat and that his skull and jaws had lengthened wolfishly i dont know he finally answered her his awful voice vibrating on her nerveendings but if they dont then be sure i know what will with three vampire thralls janos went down into forgotten bowels of earth and nightmare to an all but abandoned place there he used his necromantic skills to call up a thracian lady from her ashes he chained her naked to a wall and called up her husband a warrior chief of massive proportions who was a giant even now and must have been considered a goliath in his day both of these janos had had up before for various reasons but now his purpose was entirely different he had given up tomblooting some five hundred years ago and his appetite for torture and necrophilia had grown jaded in that same distant era while still the thracian warrior stumbled about dazed and disorientated crying out in the reek and the purple smoke of his reanimation janos had him chained and dragged before his lady at sight of her he became calm in a moment tears formed in his eyes and trickled down the leathery bearded pockmarked jowls of his face bodrogk janos spoke to him in an approximation of his own tongue and so you recognize this wife of yours eh but do you see how ive cared for her salts she comes up as perfectly fleshed as in life not like yourself all scarred and burned and pocked from the loss of your materials perhaps i should be more careful how i gather up your ashes as i am with hers when once more i send you down into your jar ah but as you must know she has been of more use to me than you for where you could only give me gold she gave me you are a dog the other shut him off his voice cracking like boulders breaking leaning forward in his chains he strained to reach his tormentor janos laughed as his thralls fought hard to keep bodrogk from breaking loose but then he stopped laughing and held out a glass jug for the other to see and now be still and listen to me he commanded harshvoiced as you see this favourite wife of yours is nearperfect how long she remains so is entirely up to you she is unchanged from a time two thousand years ago and will go on the same for as long as i will it and not a moment longer while he talked his creatures made fast bodrogks chains to staples in the wall now they stood back from him observe said janos he took a glass stem and dipped it in the liquid in the jug then quickly splashed droplets across the huge thracians chest bodrogk looked down at himself his mouth fell open and his eyes started out as smoke curled up from the matted hair of his chest where the acid had touched him he cried out and shook himself in his chains then crumpled to his knees in the agony of his torture and the acid ate into him until his flesh melted and ran in thin rivulets red and yellow all down his quivering thighs his wife the last of the six wives hed had in life cried out to janos that he spare bodrogk this torture and weeping she too collapsed in her chains at last her husband struggled to his feet the orbits of his eyes red with agony and hatred where he gazed at janos i know that she is dead he said even as i am dead and that you are a ghoul and a necromancer but it seems that even in death there is shame torment and pain therefore to spare her any more of that ask what you will of me if i know the answer i will tell it to you if i can perform the deed it shall be done good janos grunted i have six of your men in their burial urns where they lie as salts ashes dust now i shall spill them out of their lekythoi and have them up they will be my guard and you their captain more flesh to torture bodrogks growl was a rumble what janos put on a pained expression but you should be grateful these were your warrior comrades in an age when you battled side by side aye and perhaps you shall again for when my enemy comes against me i cant be sure that hell come alone why i even have your armour with which you decked yourself all those years agone and which was buried with you so you see you shall be the warrior again and again i say to you you should be grateful now i call these others up and i call upon you bodrogk to control them your wife stays here only let one treacherous thracian hand rise against me and she suffers janos bodrogk continued to gaze at him i will do all you ask of me but for all that i was a warrior in life i was a fair man too it is that fairness which prompts me to advise you now keep well the upper hand oh i know you are a vampire and strong but i also know my own strength which is great if you did not have sofia there in chains then for all your acid i would break you into many pieces she alone stays my hand janos laughed like a great baying hound that time shall never come he said but i too shall be fair when this is done and done to my liking then i shall put you both down and mingle your dust and scatter it to the winds forever then that must suffice said the other so be it said janos as the sun painted a crack of gold on the eastern horizon harry keogh slept on but in the aegean sea off rhodes darcy clarke and his team were aboard a slightly larger faster boat than last time and already passing tilos to port where they forged west for sirna watching the sea slip by like blue silk sliced by the scissors prow darcy again went over the plans theyd made last night and looked for loopholes in their logic he remembered how david chung had sat at a table in their hotel rooms while the rest ringed him about and watched his performance chungs parents had been cocaine addicts the drug had rotted their minds and bodies killing both of them while he was still little more than a child so that ever since joining the branch hed aimed his talent in that one specific direction the destruction of everyone who trafficked in human misery they had given the locator other tasks from time to time but everyone in ebranch knew that this was his forte last night hed employed a little of the very substance he loathed crouching over the smallest amount of snow white cocaine upon the table a large map of the dodecanese and upon the map the merest trickle of poisonous dust lying on a flimsy brown cigarette paper to give it definition chung had called for silence and for several minutes had sat there breathing deeply occasionally wetting a finger to take up the white grains and touch them to his tongue then with a single sharp puff of air from his mouth hed blown the cigarette paper and its poison away and in the next moment stabbed the map with his forefinger there hed said and an awful lot of it manolis papastamos and jazz simmons had applauded but zek darcy and ben trask had not seemed much surprised they were impressed of course but esp had been their business for many years it wasnt so strange to them then manolis had looked more closely at the map the place where chung was pointing and nodded lazaridess island he said so now we know where the lazarus is hiding and aboard her all the shit that the vrykoulakas stole from the old samothraki after that planning had been basic to minimal their aim simply to get to the island in the hour after dawn when the white ships vampire crew should be less inclined to activity and to destroy the lazarus vampires and all right there where she was anchored david chung was out of it now his part had been played and the remainder of his time in the sun was his own he wouldnt see the rest of the team until the job was finished and now indeed they were on their way to finish it manolis brought darcys mind back to the present another halfhour and were there do you want to go over it again darcy shook his head no you all know your jobs as for me this time im just a passenger at least until we get onto the island and into janoss place he looked at his team zek was unzipping herself from her lightweight onepiece suit underneath she wore a yellow bathing costume consisting of very little and leaving nothing at all to the imagination she scarcely looked her age but was sleek tanned and stunning with her blue eyes her blonde hair flashing gold and a smile like a white blaze there wouldnt be a man alive or undead who could keep his eyes off her her husband looked at her and grinned whats so amusing she asked him tossing her head i was thinking jazz answered that wed like to sink these blokes along with their ship the idea isnt that they should go diving in the water after you this is something i learned from the lady karen on starside she told him if i can distract them then the rest of you will be able to do your jobs more safely and easily karen was an expert at distraction oh theyll be distracted all right manolis assured her ben trask had meanwhile opened up a small compartmented suitcase and taken out four of six gleaming metal discs some two inches thick by seven across the back of each disc was black magnetic and the obverse fitted with a safety switch and timer manolis looked at the limpet mines where trask began fitting them to a pair of diving belts in place of the usual lead weights and shook his head i still dont know how you got them out of england he said trask shrugged in a diplomatic bag we may be silent partners but were still part of british intelligence after all theres a rock up ahead zek shouted from where she now sat on a rubber mat on the narrow deck on top of the cabin and in front of the windshield she pointed manolis is that it he nodded thats it darcy can you take the wheel darcy took control of the boat and throttled back a little manolis and jazz stripped down to swimsuits and went into the tiny cabin out of sight in there they tested aqualungs and checked their swimfins ben trask took off his jacket and put on sunglasses and a straw hat in his hawaiian shirt he was just some rich tourist fool out for a days pleasureboating darcy might easily be his brother the island had swum up larger and zek was seen to be right it was little more than a big rock there were a few shrubs patches of thyme and coarse grass and lots of rocks and situated centrally above coastal cliffs a weathered yellow stack going up sheer for maybe one hundred and eighty feet zek looked at it and put her hand to her brow thats a pigmy of an aerie she said but it gives me the shudders just the same and there are men no vampires on it two of them at least the boat rounded the point of a promontory and darcy saw what lay ahead but even if he hadnt seen it his talent had already forewarned him stay down he called out to manolis and jazz in the cabin draw those curtains you two arent here there are just the three of us they did as he told them zek stretched herself out luxuriously on the cabins roof and put on sunglasses trask lay back and hooked one leg idly over the boats rail darcy headed the boat directly across the mouth of a small bay and there anchored in the bay the white ship the lazarus trask knocked the cap off a bottle of beer and tilted his head back merely wetting his lips but studying what he could see of the island intently that was part of his job while darcy and zek in their various ways studied the lazarus the island consisted of a tiny beach inside a pair of bare spurs of rock extending oceanward and an almost barren slope of rock climbing to the central stack from this side the top of the stack was seen to be a ruined fortification or pharos of some sort with the remains of badly eroded steps still showing where they zigzagged up to it but halfway up the stack a false flat extensive plateau seemed carved as if in ages past the upper section had split down the centre and half had toppled over with massive walls built around the plateaus perimeter from one side of the needle rock to the other the place had obviously been a crusader stronghold the old walls had long since fallen away in places but it was seen that new walls were now under construction and scaffolding was plainly visible clinging to both the stump and the surviving upper section of the stack darcy meanwhile considered the lazarus the white ship stood off from the beach in deep water central in the small bay her anchorchain went down shimmering into the blue of the sea on the deck under the black scalloped awning a man sat in one of several chairs but as the motorboat came powering into view he stood up and took binoculars from around his neck he wore a widebrimmed floppy hat and sunglasses and he kept fairly well to the shade as he put the binoculars to his eyes and trained them on the motorboat zek propped herself up on one elbow and waved excitedly but the watcher on the deck ignored her at first darcy throttled back and turned the boat in a wide circle about the white ship and joined zek in her waving ahoy there he put on an upperclass english accent ahoy aboard the lazarus the man went to the door of the lounge and leaned halfinside then came back out he now aimed his binoculars at zek where she continued to wave this was scarcely necessary for the circling boat was no more than forty or fifty feet away she felt his gaze on her and shivered despite the blazing heat of the sun a second man who might have been the twin of the first joined him and they silently observed the circling boat but mainly they observed zek darcy throttled back more yet and a third man came out of the white ships lounge ben trask stood up and held up his bottle to them care for a drink he shouted imitating darcys faked accent maybe we can come aboard like fuck thought darcy zek scanned the ship not only above but also below decks she counted six all told three sleeping all of them vampires then one of the sleepers stirred woke up his mind was alert it was more completely vampire than the others before zek could cover her telepathic spying he had seen her she stopped waving and told darcy lets go one of them read me he didnt see anything much only that im more than i appear to be but if they run off now well lose them well see you later ben trask called out as darcy turned the boat away and sped for the tip of the far promontory passing from the view of the watchers on the lazarus he throttled right down and allowed the boat to cruise close up to a flattopped weedgrown rock barely sticking up out of the sea jazz and manolis came out of the cabin put on their masks and adjusted their demand valves and as darcy cut the engine they stepped from the boat to the rock and so into the sea jazz zek called down be careful he might have heard her and he might not his head went down and a stream of bubbles came up the swimmers submerged to fifteen feet and headed back towards the lazarus more distraction said darcy grimly as he throttled up and turned back out to sea darcy zek called to him keep just a little more distant this time theyll be wary im sure as darcy headed straight out to sea and the lazarus came back into view so ben trask got down on his knees and took a sterling submachine gun out of its bag under the seat he extended the butt and slapped a curved magazine of mm rounds into the housing then lay the gun between his feet and covered it with the bag half a mile out darcy turned to port and came speeding back towards the white ship there was activity aboard now where the three on the deck hurried round the rail pausing every few paces to look over into the water jazz and manolis would be there any time now darcy piled on the speed and zek commenced waving as before the men on the deck came together at one point at the rail and again zek felt binoculars trained on her almost naked body but this time the interest was other than sexual then as darcy leaned the boat over on her side and recommenced his circling they heard the rattle of the lazaruss anchorchain as it was drawn up and the throbbing cough of her engines starting into life and now a fourth man came ducking out of the lounge onto the deck cradling a stubby squatbodied machinegun in his arms jesus ben trask yelled and it might have been that his shout of warning was a signal to let the battle commence the man with the machinegun opened up standing there on the deck of the lazarus with his legs braced hosing the smaller craft with lead zek had scrambled down off the cabin roof as she ducked into the tiny cabin the windshield flew into shards and darcy felt the whip of hot lead flying all around then trask stood up and returned fire and the gunner on the lazarus was thrown back as if hed been hit by a piledriver he bounced off a stanchion on the deck came toppling over the rail and splashed down into the water and another crewman ran to retrieve his gun darcy was round the white ship now and putting distance between them as he forged for the open sea but as zek came back out of the cabin she grabbed the wheel and yanked it hard over shouting look oh look darcy let her have the wheel and looked the man with the gun on the deck of the lazarus was firing down into the water shooting at something which drew slowly away from the white ships flank it could only be jazz or manolis or both of them you handle her darcy yelled and he moved to where trask was still firing and drew out a second bag from under the seating but as he loaded up the second smg there came more of the angry waspbuzzing of sprayed bullets and trask cried out and staggered back only just managing to prevent himself going over the side the upper muscle of trasks left arm had a neat hole punched clean through which turned scarlet and spilled over with blood in the next moment then darcy was up on his feet returning fire but the lazarus was moving she reversed out of the bay and began to turn slowly on her own axis and the water boiled furiously where her propellers churned they couldnt stop her now and so let her go and zek went to trask to see if there was anything she could do he grimaced but told her ill be ok just wrap it up thats all heads broke the surface of the water as zek tore trasks shirt from his back to make a bandage and sling darcy throttled right back and drew alongside jazz where he slipped out of his lungs harness and trod water then helped him clamber aboard and manolis came knifing in in an expert flurry of flippers in another moment he too had been dragged up into the boat at which point the motor gave a gurgling cough and stopped dead flooded darcy cried but ben trask was pointing out to sea and yelling jesus jesus the lazarus had turned round and was coming back the throb of her engines was louder faster as she bore down on the smaller vessel and her intention was obvious manolis working furiously to get the motor restarted glanced at the waterproof watch on his wrist she should have gone up by now he yelled the limpets they should have and when the lazarus was something less than fifty yards away then the mines did go off not in one unified explosion but in four the first two exploded near the stern of the white ship with only a second or so between them which had the effect of first throwing the stern one way and then the other and also of lifting it up out of the water slewing and wallowing as the engines seized up the lazarus was still advancing under something of her former impetus but then the third and fourth limpets went off where theyd been placed towards the stem and that changed the whole picture with the stern already low in the water from massive flooding now the prow was pushed up on the crest of whitefoaming waters and as her nose slapped back to the tossing ocean so the engines exploded the back of the boat was at once split open in gouting fire and ruin and hot buckled metal was hurled aloft in a fireball of igniting fuel as the glare of the fireball diminished and a huge smoke ring climbed skyward on the last hot gasp of the ship so she gave up the ghost settled down in the water and sank scraps of burning awning fluttered back to the tossing ocean and the drifting smoke cleared the sea belched hugely and offered up clouds of steam the gurgling and boiling of the waters continued for a few seconds longer before falling silent gone said darcy when he could draw breath right jazz simmons nodded but lets make sure shes all gone and her crew with her manolis got the motor going and they chugged over to where the lazarus had gone down an oil slick lay on the water where bubbles surfaced and made spreading rainbow colours then even as they watched a head and shoulders came bobbing up lolled over backwards and the lower part of the blackened body slowly rotated into view he lay there in the water as if crucified with his arms spreadeagled and great yellow blisters bursting on his neck shoulders and thighs but as they continued to stare aghast so his eyes opened and glared at them and he coughed up phlegm blood and salt water manolis didnt think twice but shut off the motor picked up a speargun and put a harpoon straight into the gagging vampires chest the creature jerked once or twice then lay still in the water but still they couldnt be sure zek looked away as they reeled him in to the side of the boat tied lead weights to his ankles and let him sink slowly out of sight deep water manolis commented without emotion even a vampire is only flesh and blood if he cant breathe he cant live anyway the floor of the sea is rocky here there will be many big groupers down there even if life were possible he cant heal himself faster than they can eat him ben trask was white and shaky but well in control of himself his shoulder was all strapped up now what about the one i knocked overboard he said manolis took the boat to the middle of the bay where the lazarus had been moored and darcy gave a shout and pointed at something that splashed feebly in the water even shot the vampire had made it halfway to land they closed with him speared him and dragged him back out to sea where they dealt with him as with the first one and thats the end of them ben trask grunted not quite zek reminded him pointing at the looming stack of white and yellow stone inland there are two more of them up there she put her hand to her brow and closed her eyes and frowned also there may be something else but im not sure what manolis beached the boat and took up his speargun he was happy with that and with his beretta darcy had his smg which he considered enough to handle and zek took a second speargun jazz was satisfied with harry keoghs crossbow with which hed familiarized himself during the voyage they might have taken the other smg too but ben trask was now out of it and they must leave the gun with him just in case his task stay behind and look after the boat they waded ashore and started up the rocks the trail was easy to follow where the thin soil had been compacted between boulders and where steps had been cut in the steeper places halfway to the stack they paused to take a breather and look back ben was watching them through binoculars and also watching the stack so far there had been no sign of life in the place but as they approached its base jazz spied movement up in the ancient embrasures he immediately dragged zek into cover and motioned darcy and manolis down among jumbled rocks if those creatures up there had rifles he explained they could pick us off like flies but they havent or they would have already manolis pointed out they could have got us as we beached the boat or even as we engaged the lazarus but they have been watching us said zek i could feel them and they are waiting for us up there jazz squinted at the rearing dazzling white walls were skating on very thin ice darcy told the others i can feel my talent telling me that this far is far enough a shout echoed up to them from the beach looking back they saw ben trask struggling up the incline after them hold it he yelled wait he approached to within thirty or forty yards then fell back against a boulder in the shade and rested a while and when he had recovered ive been looking at the fortifications through my glasses he yelled theres something very wrong the climb looks easy enough up those ancient stone steps there but its not its a lie a trap jazz went back and met ben halfway and took the binoculars from him how do you mean a trap its like when i listen to a police interview with a suspect perp ben answered i can tell right off if hes lying even if i dont know what the lie is so dont ask me whats wrong up there just take my word for it that it is ok said jazz go on back down to the boat from here on in we step wary when ben had started back jazz looked through the binoculars at the zigzagging precipitous stone stairway from the base of the stack to the ancient walls close to the top a jumble of boulders and shards of stone bulged from the gaping mouth of a cave held back from the steps and the vertiginous edge by a barrier of heavyduty wire mesh strung between deeply bedded iron staves cables almost invisible hung down from the ramparts and disappeared into the gloom of the cave jazz looked at these cables for long moments demolition wire it could be he rejoined the others where they waited i think were walking right into one he said or we will be if we start up those steps he explained his meaning darcy took the binoculars from him stuck his head out from under cover and doublechecked the face of the looming rock you could be right must be right if ben says its all wrong its all wrong no way we can cut those cables jazz said those things up there have the advantage they could spot a mouse trying to make it up those steps listen said manolis who had also been studying the route up the rock why dont we play them at their own game let them think were falling for it and make them waste their ambush how said darcy we start on up said manolis but we are stringing it out a little and one of us is staying well ahead of the rest the path turns a corner just underneath the cave with the boulders and just before the corner there is this big hole er this concavity in the face of the cliff so one of us has already turned the corner and the others look all set to follow him the creatures up in the fort are in a quandary do they press the button and get the one man for sure or do they wait for the others to come round the corner at this point the one in front he goes faster past the point of maximum danger and the others pretend they are coming on but they only just show themselves and dont actually start on up that leg of the climb the vampires cant wait they have missed one of us and so must try for the other three they press the button boom jazz took it up the three at the rear have now showed themselves around the corner but unbeknown to the guys on top theyre expecting what happens next as the charge blows those rocks out of the cave higher up so the three skip back round the corner and into the scoop in the face of the cliff is how i see it said manolis nodding yes or said darcy his face suddenly pale we leave it till tonight and is your guardian angel speaking manolis looked disgusted i have seen that look on your face before darcy knew he was right and cursed under his breath so who do you suggest bells the cat he said eh who goes first and risks getting blown the hell off the cliff manolis shrugged but who else you of course jazz looked at darcy and said this talent of yours it really works im a deflector yes darcy nodded and sighed so whats the problem the problem is my talent doesnt work in fits and starts darcy answered its working all the time it makes a coward of me even knowing im protected ill still use a taper to light a firework you are saying off you go darcy get on up those stepsbut it is saying run like hell son run like bloody hell so what you have to ask yourself said jazz is whos the boss it or you darcy offered a grim nod for answer slapped a full magazine into the housing of his smg and stepped out into view of who or whatever was watching from above he made for the base of the stone steps and started up the others looked at each other for a moment then manolis started after him jazz let him get out of earshot and said zek you stay here what she looked at him after starside youre telling me that i should let you do something like this on your own im not on my own and what good will you be anyway with only a speargun we need you down here zek if one of those things gets past us youre going to have to stop him thats just an excuse she said you said it yourself what good am i with only a speargun zek i all right she said and theyre waiting for you he kissed her and started after the other two she let him get onto the steps and start upwards then scrambled after they could fight later just before the crucial corner where the narrow stone steps angled left and climbed unevenly up the section of cliff face directly beneath the threatening cave with its potential barrage of boulders darcy paused to let the others catch up a little his breathing was ragged and his legs felt like jelly not because of the stiff climb but because he was fighting his talent every inch of the way he looked back and as manolis and jazz came into view waved and then he turned the corner and pushed on but he remembered how as hed passed the sheltering hollow where the rest of the team would take cover hed been very tempted except he had known that once he stepped in there it would take at least a stick of dynamite to get him out again he craned his neck and glanced straight up and winced he could see the wirenetting holding back the bulging tangle of rocks not ten feet overhead it was time to make his break for it he put on speed and climbed out of the immediate danger area then glanced back and saw jazz and manolis coming round the corner at which precise moment a pebble slipped underfoot and sent him sprawling feeling his feet shoot out over the rim darcy grabbed at projecting rocks and in the same moment knew that it was going to happen shit he yelled clinging to the cliff face and the steps as a deafening explosion sounded close by and its shock wave threatened to hurl him into space then fragments of rock were flying everywhere it was like the entire stack was coming down deaf and suffocating in choking dust and debris darcy could only cling and wait for the ringing to go out of his ears a minute went by or maybe two and the rumbling died away darcy looked back and jazz and manolis were clambering dangerously up towards him across steps choked with rubble but up ahead someone two someones were clambering dangerously down as darcy began pushing himself to his feet he saw them flameeyed snarling coming to meet the stacks invaders head on one of them carried a pistol the other had a ninefoot octopus pole with a barbed trident head the tines must be all of eight inches long darcys smg was trapped under rubble and stony debris he yanked on the sling but it wouldnt come the vampire with the pistol had paused and was taking aim something thrummed overhead and the creature aiming at darcy dropped its pistol and staggered against the cliff face its hands flying to the hardwood bolt skewering its chest it gagged gave a weird hissing cry fell to its knees and toppled into thin air the other one came on cursing and stabbing at darcy with its terrible weapon he somehow managed to turn the wicked trident head aside as manolis arrived behind him then the greek policeman yelled get down and darcy threw himself flat again he heard the crack crack crack of manoliss beretta and the hissing of the vampire turn to shrieks of rage and agony shot three times at close range the thing staggered there on the steps darcy yanked the octopus pole out of its hands slammed the butt end into its chest and over it went mewling and yelping as it pinwheeled all the way down to the base of the stack jazz simmons came up to the other two up or down he panted down said darcy at once and dont worry it isnt my talent playing up its just that i know how hard those things are to kill he looked beyond his two friends wheres zek down below said jazz all the more reason to get back down said darcy after weve burned those two then well see what else is up here but zek wasnt down below she was just that moment coming round the corner and when she saw that they were all in one piece her sigh of relief said more than any number of spoken words they brought petrol from the boat and burned the two badly broken vampires then rested a while before going up into the old fortifications up there janos had been preparing a spacious spartan retreat not quite an aerie of the wamphyri as zek remembered such but a place almost equally sinister and foreboding letting her telepathic talent guide her through piles of tumbled masonry and openings in halfconstructed walls and past deep embrasure windows opening on fantastic views of the oceans curved horizon she led the others to a trapdoor concealed under tarpaulins and timbers they opened it up and saw ageshollowed stone steps leading down into a crusader dungeon rigging torches the men followed the stairwell down into the reeking heart of the stack and zek followed the men down there they foupd the lowwalled rims of a pair of covered wells which plunged even deeper into darkness but that was when zek gasped and lay back against nitrous walls shivering what is it jazzs voice echoed in the leaping torchlight in the wells she gasped one hand held tremblingly to her throat there were places like this in the aeries on starside places where the wamphyri kept their beasts the wells were covered with lids fashioned from planking manolis put his ear to one of the covers and listened but could hear nothing something in the wells he said frowning zek nodded theyre silent now afraid waiting their thoughts are dull vacuous they could be siphoneers or gasbeasts or anything and they dont know who we are but they fear we might be janos these are things of janos grown out of him darcy gave a shudder and said like the creature yulian bodescu kept in his cellar but it has to be safe to look at least because if it wasnt id know manolis and jazz lifted the cover from one of the wells and stood it on its edge by the low wall they looked down into stygian darkness but could see nothing jazz looked at the others shrugged held out his torch over the mouth of the well and let it fall and it was like all hell had been let loose such a howling and roaring a mewling and spitting and frenzied clamour for a moment only a moment the flaring torch as it fell lit up the monstrosity at the bottom of the dry well they saw eyes a great many gaping jaws and teeth a huge lashing of rubbery limbs something terrible beyond words crashed about down there leaped and gibbered in the next moment the torch went out which was as well for theyd seen enough and as the hideous tumult continued jazz and manolis replaced the cover over the awful shaft on their way back up the steps manolis said we shall need all the fuel we can spare and plenty of this building timber jazz added and after that those other limpet mines said darcy so we can be sure weve blocked those wells up forever its time things were put back to rights here as they reached the open air zek clutched jazzs arm and said but if this is a measure of what janos can do here even in the limited time hes had just think what he might have done up in those transylvanian mountains darcy looked at his friends and his face was still gaunt and ashen his throat was dry as he voiced his own thoughts god i wouldnt be in harry keoghs shoes for for anything harry woke up to the sure knowledge that something had happened something far away and terrible inhuman screams rang in his ears and a roaring fire blazed before his eyes but then starting upright in his bed he realized that the screams were only the morning cries of cockerels and that the fire was the blaze of the sun striking through his eastfacing windows now that he was awake there were other sounds and sensations breakfast sounds from downstairs and food smells rising from the kitchen he got up washed shaved and quickly dressed but as he was about to go downstairs he heard a strangely familiar jingling a creaking and the easy clatter of hooves from out in the road he went to look down and was surprised to feel the heat of the sun on his arms where he leaned out of the window he frowned the hot yellow sunlight irritated him made him itchy down there in the road horsedrawn caravans rolled single file four or five of them all in a line gypsies travellers they were heading for the distant mountains and harry felt a sudden kinship for that was his destination too would they cross the border he wondered would they even be allowed to strange if they were for ceausescu didnt have a lot of time for gypsies harry watched them pass by and saw that the last in line was decked in wreaths and oddlyshaped funeral garlands woven from vines and garlic flowers the caravans tiny windows were tightly curtained women walked beside it all in black heads bowed silently grieving the caravan was a hearse and its occupant only recently dead harry felt sympathy reached out with his deadspeak are you ok the unknown others thoughts were calm uncluttered but still he started a little at harrys intrusion and dont you think thats rude of you he said breaking in on me like that harry was at once apologetic im sorry he answered but i was concerned for you its obviously recent and not all of the dead are so stoical about it about death ah but ive been expecting it for a long time you must be the necroscope youve heard about me in that case youll know i didnt mean to be rude but i hadnt realized that my name had reached the travelling folk ive always thought of you as a race apart i mean you have your ways which dont always fit in too well withno thats not what i meant either perhaps youre right and i am rude the other chuckled know what you mean well enough but the dead are the dead harry and now that theyve learned how to talk to each other they talk mainly they reminisce with no real contact with the living except for you of course which makes you yourself a talking point oh yes ive heard about you youre a learned man said harry and very wise i can tell so you wont find death so hard how you were in life thats how youll be in death all the things you wondered about when you were living but which you could never quite resolve youll work them all out now that youre dead youre trying to make me feel better about it and i appreciate that the other answered but theres really no need i was getting old and my bones were weary i was ready for it i suppose by now ill be on my way to my place under the mountains where my traveller forebears will welcome me they too were gypsy kings in their time as am i or as i was i look forward to hearing the history of our race at first hand i suppose i have you to thank for that for without you theyd all be lying there like ancient desiccated seeds in a desert full of potential shape and colour but unable to give them form to the dead you have been rain in the desert harry leaned far out of his window to watch the caravan hearse out of sight around a bend in the dusty road it was nice meeting you he said and if id known you were a king be sure my approach would have been more respectful harry the others deadspeak thoughts drifted back to the necroscope and he sensed that they were a little troubled now you seem to me to be a very rare person good compassionate and wise in your own right for all that you are young and you say that you have recognized an older wisdom in me very well so now i would ask you to accept some sensible advice from a wise old traveller king go anywhere else but where you are going do anything else but that which you have set out to do harry was puzzled and not a little worried gypsies have strange talents and the dead even the recently dead are not without theirs how then a dead gypsy king are you telling my fortune its a long time since i crossed a travellers palm with silver the other vseized upon that with silver aye my palms shall never know its feel again but be sure my eyes are weighted with it no cross yourself with silver harry cross yourself now harry wasnt merely puzzled but suspicious too what did this dead old man know what could he possibly know and what was he trying to say harrys thoughts werent shielded the gypsy king picked them up and answered have said too much already some would consider me a traitor well let them think it for you are right im old and im dead and so can afford one last indulgence but you have been kind and death has put me beyond forfeiture your warning is an ominous thing said harry but there was no answer only a small cloud of dust settling showed where the caravans had passed from sight my route is set harry called after that is the way i must go a sigh drifted back only a sigh thanks anyway harry answered sigh for sigh and felt his shoulders sag a little and goodbye and he sensed the slow sad shake of the others head at am harry booked out of the hotel sarkad in mezobereny and waited by the side of the road for his taxi he carried only his holdall which in fact held very little his sleepingbag a smallscale map of the district in a sidepocket and a packet of sandwiches made up for him by the hotel proprietors daughter the sun was very hot and seemed intensified by the old boneshakers dusty windows it burned harrys wrists where it fell on them causing a sensation which he could only liken to prickly heat at his first opportunity in a village named bekes he called a brief halt to purchase a straw summer hat with a wide brim from mezobereny to his dropoff point close to the romanian border was about twenty kilometres before letting his driver go he checked with him that in fact his map was accurate and that the border crossing point lay only two or three kilometres ahead at a place called gyula gyula yes said the taxi driver pointing vaguely down the road and again gyula you will see them both from the hill the border and gyula harry watched him turn his cab around and drive off then hoisted his holdall to one shoulder and set off on foot he could have taken the taxi closer to the border but hadnt wanted to be seen arriving in that fashion a man on foot is less noticeable on a country road and country was what it was forests green fields crops hedgerows grazing animals it seemed good land but up ahead across the border there lay transylvanias central massif not so darkly foreboding as the meridional perhaps but mountains awesome and threatening enough in their own right where the road crossed the crest of low undulating hills harry could see the greyblue peaks and domes maybe twentyfive miles away they clung to the horizon a sprawl of hazy crags obscured by distance and lowlying cloud his destination and from that same vantage point he could also see the border post its red and whitestriped barrier reaching out across the road from a timber almost austrianstyled chalet borders hadnt much bothered harry not when he had the use of the mцbius continuum but now they bothered him considerably he knew that there was no way he was going to get past this one not on the road at least but his uncomplicated plan had taken that into account now that he knew exactly where he was on the map he would simply continue to act the tourist spending the day quietly in some small village or hamlet there hed study his map until he knew the area intimately and choose himself a safe route across into romania he knew the securitatea were keen to keep romanians in but couldnt see that thered be much todo made about keeping foreigners out after all who but a madman would want to break in harry keogh that was who at the bottom of the hill was a tjunction where a thirdclass road cut north through dense woodland and less than a mile through the woods that must be gyula harry could see hazy blue smoke rising from the chimneys in the neardistance and the gleaming bulbous domes of what were possibly churches it looked a quiet enough place and should suit his purpose ideally but as he reached the bottom of the slope and turned left into the woods he heard again that halffamiliar jingle and saw in the shade of the trees those same gypsy caravans which had passed under his window earlier in the day they had not been here long and the travellers were still setting up camp one of the men wearing black boots leather trousers and a russet shirt with a blackspotted bandana on his brow to trap and control his long shiny black locks was perched on a leaning fence chewing a blade of grass smiling and nodding as harry drew level he said ho stranger you walk alone why not sit a while and take a drink to cut the dust from your throat he held up a long slim bottle of slivovitz the slivas were sharp the year they brewed this one harry began to shake his head then thought why not he could just as easily study his map sat under a tree as anywhere else and draw less attention to himself at that thats very kind of you he answered following up immediately with why you speak my language the other grinned many languages a little of most of them were travellers what would you expect harry walked into the camp with him how did you know i was english because you werent hungarian and because the germans dont much come here anymore also if you were french there would be two or three of you in shorts on bicycles anyway i didnt know and if you hadnt answered me why i still wouldnt not for sure but you look english harry looked at the caravans with their ornate curiously carved sigils their painted and varnished woodwork the various symbols were so stylized they seemed to flow into and become one with the fancy scrolls of the general decoration almost as if theyd been deliberately concealed in the design and looking closer but yet maintaining an attitude of casual observation he saw that he was right and they had been so concealed his interest in this regard centred on the funeral vehicle which stood a little apart from the rest two women in mourning black sat side by side on its steps their heads on their bosoms arms hanging slackly by their sides a dead king said harry and out of the corner of his eye watched his new friend give a start things began to piece themselves together in his mind like bits of a puzzle forming up into a picture how did you know harry shrugged under all the flowers and garlic thats a good rich caravan and fit for a traveller king it carries his coffin right two of them said the other regarding harry in a new perhaps slightly more cautious light oh the other one is for his wife shes the thin one on the steps there her heart is broken she doesnt think shell survive him very long they sat down on the humped roots of a vast tree where harry got out his sandwiches he wasnt hungry but wanted to offer them to his gypsy friend in return for the good plum brandy and where will you bury them he eventually asked the other nodded eastward casually enough but harry felt his dark eyes on him oh under the mountains i saw a border post up there will they let you through the gypsy smiled in a wrinkling of tanned skin and a gold tooth flashed in the sun striking through the trees this has been our route since long before there were border posts or even signposts do you think they would want to stop a funeral what and risk calling down the curse of the gypsies on themselves harry smiled and nodded the old gypsy curse ploy works well for you eh but the other wasnt smiling at all it works he said quite simply harry looked around accepted the bottle again and took a good long pull at it he was aware that others of the gypsy menfolk were watching him but covertly while ostensibly they made camp he sensed the tension in them and found himself in two minds it seemed to harry that hed discovered a way across the border indeed he believed the gypsies would gladly take him across more than gladly and whether he wanted to go with them or not the odd thing was that he didnt feel any animosity towards this man these people who he now felt reasonably sure were here partly out of coincidence but more specifically to entrap him he didnt feel afraid of them at all in fact he felt less afraid generally than at almost any time he could remember in his entire life his problem was simply this should he casually even passively accept their entrapment or should he try to walk out of the camp should he make allusion to the situation make his suspicions known or simply continue to play the innocent in short would it be better to go quietly or should he make a fuss and get roughed up for his trouble of one thing he was certain janos wanted him alive man to man face to face which meant that the last thing the szgany would do would be to hurt him perhaps now that harry was on the hook it were better if he simply lay still and let the monster reel him in part of the way anyway when he yawns his great jaws at you go in through them for hes softer on the inside did i think that harry used his deadspeak or was it you again faethor perhaps it was both of us a gurgling voice answered from deep within harry nodded if only to himself so it was you very well well play it your way good believe me you we have the game well in hand do you think i might rest here a while harry asked the traveller where they sat under the trees its peaceful here and i might just sit and look at my map and plan the rest of my trip he took a last mouthful of slivovitz why not said the other you can be sure no harm will come to you here harry stretched out lay his head on his holdall looked at his map halmagiu was maybe oh sixty miles away the sun was just beyond its zenith the hour a little after noon if the travellers set off again at pm they might just make it to halmagiu by midnight and harry with them he couldnt even hazard a guess as to how they would go about it but felt fairly sure theyd find a way to get him through the checkpoint just as sure as hed seen that sigil of a redeyed bat launching itself from the rim of its urn painted into the woodwork of the kings funeral caravan he closed his eyes and looking inwards directed his deadspeak thoughts at faethor think i frightened janos off when i threatened to enter his mind i mean it was bold of you the other answered at once a clever bluff but you were in error and fortunate indeed that it worked i was only following your instructions harry protested then obviously i had not made myself plain said faethor meant simply that your mind is your castle and that if he tried to invade it you must look to understanding his reasons must look into his mind and try to fathom its workings i did not mean literally that you should step inside it would in any case be impossible youre no telepath harry oh i knew that well enough harry admitted but janos himself wasnt so sure hes seen some strange things in my mind after all not least your presence there and if you were advising me then obviously he would need to step wary the last thing he would want the last thing anyone would want including myself is you in his mind still i suppose youre right and it was bluff but i felt strong i felt i was playing a strong hand you are strong faethor answered but remember you had the additional strength of the girl and layard you were using their amplified talents i know said harry but it felt even stronger than that it could of course have been your influence but i dont think so i felt that it was all mine and i believe that if i had been a true telepath then i would have gone in if only to try and do to janos what he did to trevor jordan he sensed faethors approval bravo but dont run before you can walk my son and before harry could answer will you go with the szgany the filthy zirra in through his jaws harry answered yes i think so if i cant get into his mind then ill get into his body as it were and maybe blunt a few of his teeth a little along the way but answer me this if i have frightened him off from any sort of mental seduction or invasion what will he do next what would you do if you were him what remains to him faethor answered in the skilful use of powers those very powers he desires to steal from you he believes you are his match so he must first conquer you physically what i would do if i were him murder you and then by use of necromancy rip your knowledge right out of your screaming guts your art harry answered thibors dragosanis but janos doesnt have it he has this other thing this ancient alien magic he can reduce you to ashes call you up from your chemical essence torture you until you are a ruin incapable of defending yourself and then enter your mind and so take what he wants hearing that harry no longer felt so strong also the slivovitz had been more potent than he thought and hed taken quite a lot of it suddenly he knew the sensation of giddiness an unaccustomed alcoholic buoyancy and at the same time felt the weight of a blanket tossed across his legs and lower body it was cool under the trees and someone was seeing to his welfare for now at least he opened his eyes a crack and saw his gypsy friend standing there looking down at him the man nodded and smiled and walked away treacherously clever these dogs faethor commented ah harry answered but theyve been well instructed though harry felt he should have no real requirement for sleep still he let himself drowse for two or three days now there had been this weariness on him as if he were convalescing after some minor virus infection or other maybe a bug hed picked up in the greek islands but a strange ailment at best which made him feel strong on the one hand and wearied him on the other perhaps it was a change in the water the air all the mental activity hed been engaging in including his deadspeak so recently returned to him it could be any of these things or perhaps it was something else even as he let himself drift and as he began to dream a strange dream of a world of swamps and mountains and aeries carved of stone and bone and cartilage so mцbius came visiting harry are you all right my boy certainly he answered was merely resting whatever strength i can muster it could be i shall need it the battle draws nigh old friend mцbius was puzzled you use strange terms of expression and you dont quite well feel the same as harrys dream of starside faded so mцbiuss deadspeak made more of an impression what he said did you say something terms of expression i dont feel the same thats better said mцbius with a sigh of relief why for a moment there i thought i was talking to some entirely different person between dream and waking harry narrowed his eyes perhaps you were he said he sought faethor in his mind and wrapped him in a blanket of solitude and there he said and to mцbius can hold him there while we talk some strange tenant aye and greatly unloved and unwanted but for now ive covered his rathole i much prefer my privacy so what is it youve come to tell me august that were almost there the other answered at once the code is breaking down harry revealing itself well soon have the answer i came to bring you hope and to ask you to hold off from your contest just a little while longer so that we too late for that harry broke in its now or never tonight i go up against him again the other was puzzled why you seem almost eager for it he took what was mine challenged me offended me greatly harry answered he would burn me to ashes raise me up torture me for my secrets even invade the mцbius continuum and that is not his territory indeed it is not it belongs to no one it simply is mцbiuss deadspeak voice was dreamy again which caused harry to concentrate and consolidate within his own personality it simply is he repeated to mцbius mystified but of course it is what do you mean it is it thinks everything mцbius answered therefore it is everything but something had been triggered in him he was fading drifting returning to a dimension of pure number and harry made no attempt to retain him but simply let him go man to man face to face harry someone gave his shoulder an urgent shake harry wake up the necroscope came instantly awake almost like stepping through a mцbius door from one existence to another from dream to waking he saw the gypsy he had spoken to and shared food with whose blanket lay across his legs and his first thought was how does he know my name following which he relaxed of course he would know his name janos had told it to him he would have told all of his thralls and human servants and other minion creatures the name of his greatest enemy what is it harry sat up youve slept an hour the other answered well soon be moving on im taking my blanket also there is something you should see oh the gypsy nodded his eyes were keen now dark and sharp do you have a friend who searches for you what a friend here was it possible darcy clarke or one of the others had followed him here from rhodes harry shook his head i dont think so an enemy then who follows on behind in a car harry stood up youve seen such a one show me follow me said the other but keep low he moved at a lope through the trees to a hedgerow harry followed him and was aware of the other gypsies scattered here and there throughout the encampment each of them to a man was silent but tense in the dappled green shade of the trees their belongings were all packed away they were ready to move there said harrys guide he stood aside to let the necroscope peer through the bushes on the other side of the road a man sat at the wheel of an old beetle volkswagen looking at the entrance to the encampment harry didnt know him but he knew him now that his attention had been focussed on him he remembered hed been on the plane this man and in mezobereny possibly that cigarette holder was a dead giveaway likewise his generally snaky effeminate style and now harry remembered too that earlier brush with the securitatea in romania had this man been their contact in rhodes an agent perhaps for the ussrs ebranch he glanced at the gypsy beside him and said an enemy possibly but then he saw the knife ready in the others hand and raised an eyebrow oh the other smiled without humour the szgany dont much care for silent watchers but harry wondered had the knife been for him if hed tried to make a run for it a threat to bring him to heel what now he said watch said the other a gypsy girl in a bright dress and a shawl crossed the road to the car and nikolai zharov sat up straighter at the wheel she showed him a basket filled with trinkets knickknacks and spoke to him but he shook his head then he showed her some paper money and in turn spoke to her questioningly she took the money nodded eagerly pointed through the forest zharov frowned questioned her again she became more insistent stamped her foot pointed again in the direction of gyula along the forest road finally zharov scowled nodded started up his car he drove off in a cloud of dust harry turned to the gypsy and said he was an enemy then and the girl has sent him off on a wild goose chase yes now well be on our way we harry continued to stare at him the man sheathed his knife we travellers he answered who else if you had been awake you could have eaten with us but he shrugged we saved you a little soup another man approached with a bowl and wooden spoon which he offered to harry harry looked at it dont said a deadspeak voice in his head that of the dead gypsy king poison harry answered your people are trying to kill me no they desire you to be still for an hour or two only drink this and you will be still and sick no perhaps a mild soreness in the head which a drink of clean water will drive away but if you drink the soup then all is lost across the border youll go and up into the ageless hills and craggy mountains which as you know belong to the old ferenczy but harry only smiled and grunted his satisfaction so be it he said and drank the soup nikolai zharov drove as far as gyula and midway into the town then finally paid attention to a small niggling voice in the back of his mind the one that was telling him more insistently with each passing moment that he was a fool finally he turned his car around and drove furiously back the way hed come if keogh had gone to gyula he could check it later but meanwhile if the gypsy girl had been lying the traveller camp was empty as though the gypsies had never been there zharov cursed turned left onto the main road and gunned his engine and up ahead he saw the first of the caravans passing leisurely through the border checkpoint he arrived in a skidding of tyres jumped from the car and ran headlong into the oneroom chaletstyle building the border policeman behind his elevated desk picked up his peaked flattopped hat and rammed it on his head he glared at zharov and the russian glared back beyond the dusty flyspecked windows the last caravan was just passing under the raised pole what the russian yelled are you some kind of madman what are you hungarian or romanian the other was young bigbellied redfaced a transylvanian village peasant he had joined the securitatea because it had seemed easier than farming not much money in it but at least he could do a bit of bullying now and then he quite liked bullying but he wasnt keen on being bullied who are you he scowled his piggy eyes startled clown zharov raged those gypsies do they simply come and go isnt this supposed to be a checkpoint does president ceausescu know that these riffraff pass across his borders without so much as a by your leave get off your fat backside follow me a spy is hiding in those caravans the border policemans expression had changed for all he knew zharov might well be some highranking securitatea official certainly he acted like one but what was all this about spies flushing an even brighter red he hurried out from behind his desk did up a loose button on his sweatstained blue uniform shirt nervously fingered the twodayold stubble on his chin zharov led him out of the shack got back into his car and hurled the passengerside door open in he snapped cramming himself into the small seat the confused man blusteringly protested but the travellers arent a problem no one ever troubles them why theyve been coming this way for years they are taking one of their own to bury him and it cant be right to interfere with a funeral lunatic zharov put his foot down hard skidded dangerously close to the rearmost caravan and began to overtake the column did you even look to see if they might be up to something no of course not i tell you they have a british spy with them called harry keogh hes a wanted man in both the ussr and romania well and now hes in your country and therefore under your jurisdiction this could well be a feather in your cap but only if you follow my instructions to the letter yes i see that the other mumbled though in fact he saw very little do you have a weapon what up here what would i shoot squirrels zharov growled and stamped on his brakes skidding the car sideways in front of the first horsedrawn caravan the column at once slowed and began to concertina and as the dust settled zharov and the blustering border policeman got out of the car the kgb man pointed at the covered caravans where scowling gypsies were even now climbing down onto the road search them he ordered but whats to search said the other still mystified theyre caravans a seat at the front a door at the back one room in between a glance will suffice any space which would conceal a man thats what you search zharov snapped but what does he look like the other threw up his hands fool zharov shouted ask what he doesnt look like he doesnt look like a fucking gypsy the mood of the travellers was ugly and getting worse as the russian and his securitatea aide moved down the line of caravans yanking open their doors and looking inside as they approached the last in line the funeral vehicle so a group of the szgany put themselves in their way zharov snatched out his automatic and waved it at them out of the way if you interfere i wont hesitate to use this this is a matter of security and grave consequences may ensue now open this door the gypsy who had spoken to harry keogh stepped forward this was our king we go to bury him you may not go into this caravan zharov stuck the gun up under his jaw open up now he snarled or theyll be burying two of you the door was opened zharov saw two coffins lying side by side on low trestles where they had been secured to the floor he climbed the steps and went in the border policeman and gypsy spokesman went with him he pointed to the lefthand coffin said that one open it you are cursed said the gypsy for all your days which wont be many you are cursed the coffins were of flimsy construction little more than thin boards built by the travellers themselves zharov gave his gun to the mortified border policeman who fully expected the next curse to be directed at him and took out his bonehandled knife at the press of a switch eight inches of steel rod with a needle point slid into view without pause zharov raised his arm and drove the tool down and through the timber lid so that it disappeared to the hilt into the space which would be occupied by the face of whoever lay within inside the coffin muffled someone gasped huh huh huh and there came a bumping and a scrabbling at the lid the gypsys dark eyes bugged he crossed himself stepped back on wobbly legs likewise the border policeman but zharov hadnt noticed nor had he noticed the high smell which wasnt merely garlic grinning savagely he yanked his weapon free and jammed its point under the edge of the lid wrenching here and there until it was loose then he put the bone handle between his teeth took the lid in both hands and yanked it halfopen and from within someone pushed it the rest of the way but it wasnt harry keogh then even as the russians eyes stood out in his pallid face so vasile zirra coughed and grunted in his coffin and reached up a leathery arm to grasp zharov and lever himself upright god the kgb man choked then g g god his knife fell from his slack jaws into the coffin the old dead gypsy king took it up at once and drove it into zharovs bulging left eye all the way in until it scraped the inside of his skull at the back that was enough more than enough zharov blew froth from his jaws and stepped woodenly back until he met the side of the caravan then toppled over sideways falling he made a rattling sound in his throat and striking the floor twitched a little and then he was still but nothing else was still at the front of the column a gypsy drove zharovs car into the ditch at the side of the road the securitatea lout was reeling back in the direction of his border post shouting it had nothing to do with me nothing nothing the szgany spokesman stepped over zharovs body looked fearfully at his old king lying stiff and dead again in his coffin crossed himself a second time and manhandled the cover back into place then someone shouted giddup and the column was off again at the trot half a mile down the road where the roadside ditch was deep and grown with brambles and nettles nikolai zharovs corpse was disposed of it bounced from caravan to road to ditch and flopped from view into the greenery even as harry had drained the soup in the bowl to its last drop drug and all so hed brought wellesleys talent into play and closed his mind off from outside interference the gypsy potion had been quickacting he hadnt even remembered being bundled into the funeral caravan and lain to rest in the second coffin but his mental isolation had disadvantages too for one the dead could no longer communicate with him he had of course taken this into account weighing it against what vasile zirra had told him about the shortterm effect of the gypsy drug and hed been sure he could spare an hour or two at least what the old king hadnt told him was that only a spoonful or two of drugged soup would suffice in draining the bowl dry the necroscope had dosed himself far too liberally now slowly coming awake halfway between the subconscious and conscious worlds he collapsed wellesleys mindshield and allowed himself to drift amidst murmuring deadspeak background static vasile zirra lying only inches away from him was the first to recognize harrys resurgence harry keogh the dead old mans voice was tinged with sadness and not a little frustration you are a brash young man the spider sits waiting to entrap you and you have to throw yourself into his web because you were kind to me and because the dead love you i jeopardized my own position to warn you off and you ignored me so now you pay the penalty at the mention of penalties harry began to come faster awake even though he hadnt yet opened his eyes still he could feel the jolting of the caravan and so knew that he was en route but how far into his journey you drank all of the soup vasile reminded him halmagiu is very close i know this land well i sense it the hour approaches midnight and the mountains loom even now harry panicked a little then and woke up with something of a shock and panicked even more when he discovered himself inside a box which by its shape could only be a coffin vasile zirra calmed him at once that must be how they brought you across the border no it isnt your grave but merely your refuge for now then he told harry about zharov harry answered aloud whispering in the confines of the fragile box you protected me you have the power harry the other shrugged so it was partly that for you and it was partly for him for him but harry knew well enough who he meant for janos ferenczy when you allowed yourself to be drugged you placed yourself in his power in the hands of his people the zirras are his people my son harrys answer was bitter delivered in a tone he rarely if ever used with the dead then the zirras are cowards in the beginning long before your time indeed more than seven long centuries ago janos fooled the zirras he beguiled them fascinated them won them over by use of hypnosis and other powers come down to him from his evil father he made them love him but only so that he could use them before janos the true wamphyri were always loyal to their gypsy retainers and in their turn earned the respect of the szgany forever there was a bond between them but what has janos given you nothing but terror and death and even dead still you are afraid of him especially dead came the answer dont you know what he could do to me he is the phoenix risen from hells flames aye and he could raise me up too if he wished it even from my salts these old bones this old flesh has suffered enough many brave sons of the zirras have gone up into those mountains to appease the great boyar even my own son dumitru gone from us these long years cowards what could we do who are merely men against the might of the wamphyri harry snorted he isnt wamphyri oh he desires to be but theres that of the true vampire essence which escapes him still what could you do against him if you had had the heart you and a band of your men could have gone up to his castle in the mountains sought him out in his place and ended it there and then you could have done it ten twenty even hundreds of years ago even as i must do it now not wamphyri the other was astonished but he is wrong he has his own form of necromancy true and certainly its as cruel a thing as anything the wamphyri ever used but it is not the true art he is a shapechanger within limits but can he form himself into an aerofoil and fly no he uses an aeroplane he is a deceiver a powerful dangerous clever vampire but he is not wamphyri he is what he is said vasile but more thoughtfully now and whatever he is he was too strong for me and mine harry snorted again then leave me be ill need to find help elsewhere smarting from harrys scorn the old gypsy king said anyway what do you know of the wamphyri what does anyone know of them but harry ignored him shut him out and sent forward his deadspeak thoughts into halmagiu to the graveyard there and from there even up to the ruined old castle in the heights black romanian bats in their dozens flitted overhead occasionally coming into the gleam of swaying jolting lamplight where they escorted the jingling column of caravans through the rising misted transylvanian countryside and the same bats flew over the crumbling walls and ruins of castle ferenczy janos was there a dark silhouette on a bluff overlooking the valley like a great bat himself he sniffed the night and observed with some satisfaction the mist lying like milk in the valleys the mist was his as were the bats as were the szgany zirra and in his way janos had communicated with all three my people have him he said as if to remind himself it was a phrase hed repeated often enough through the afternoon and into the night he turned to his vampire thralls sandra and ken layard and said it yet again they have the necroscope and will bring him to me he is asleep drugged which is doubtless why you cant know his whereabouts or read his mind for your powers are puny things with severe limitations but even as janos spoke so his locator gave a sudden start ah layard gasped and there there he is janos grasped his arm said where is he layards eyes were closed he was concentrating his head turned slowly through an angle directed out over the valley to one which encompassed the mountains flank and finally the mistconcealed village close he said down there close to halmagiu janoss eyes lit like lamps with their wicks suddenly turned high he looked at sandra well she locked on to layards extrasensory current followed his scan and yes she said slowly nodding he is there and his thoughts janos was eager what is the necroscope thinking is it as i suspected is he afraid ah he is talented this one but what use esoteric talents against muscle which is utterly ruthless he speaks to the dead yes but my szgany are very much alive and to himself he thought aye he speaks to the dead even to my father who from time to time lodges in his mind which means that just as i know the necroscope likewise the dog knows me i cannot relax this will not be over until it is over perhaps i should have them kill him now and resurrect him at my leisure but where would be the glory the satisfaction in that that is not the way not if i would be wamphyri i must be the one to kill him and then have him up to acknowledge me as his master sandra clung to layards arm and locked on to harrys deadspeak signals and in the next moment snatched herself back from the locator so as to collide with janos himself he grabbed her steadied her well he he speaks with the dead which dead where his wolfs jaws gaped expectantly in the cemetery in halmagiu she gasped and in your castle halmagiu the ridges in his convoluted bats snout quivered the villagers have feared me for centuries even when i was dust in a jar no satisfaction for him there and the dead in my castle they are mainly zirras he laughed hideously and perhaps a little nervously they gave their lives up to me they will not hearken to him in death he wastes his time sandra for all her vampire strength was still shaken he he talked to a great many and they were not gypsies they were warriors in their day almost to a man i sensed the merest murmur of their dead minds but each and every one they burned with their hatred for you what for a moment janos stood frozen and in the next bayed a laugh which was more a howl my thracians my greeks persians scythians they are dust the veriest salts of men only the guards which i raised up from them have form oh i grant you the necroscope may call up corpses to walk again but even he cannot build flesh and bone from a handful of dust and even if he could why i would simply put them down again i have him he is desperate and seeks to enlist impossible allies let him talk to them he laughed again briefly and turning towards the dark irregular pile of his ruined castle narrowed his scarlet eyes come he grunted then there are certain preparations to be made a handful of szgany menfolk bundled harry through the woods and past the outcropping knoll with its cairn of soulstones beneath the cliff his hands were bound behind him and he stumbled frequently his head ached miserably as from some massive hangover but as the group passed close to the base of the knoll so he sensed the wispy wraiths of oncemen all around harry let his deadspeak touch them and knew at once that they were only the echoes of the zirras he had spoken to in the place of many bones deep in the ruins of the castle ferenczy the knolls base was lapped by a clinging ground mist but its domed crest stood clear where the cairn of carved stones pointed at the rising moon men had carved those stones their own headstones before climbing to the heights and sacrificing themselves to a monster men harry whispered to himself sheep they were like sheep to the slaughter his deadspeak was heard as he had intended it should be and from the castle in the heights was answered not all of us harry keogh i for one would have fought him but he was in my brain and squeezed it like a plum you may believe me when i say i did not go to the ferenczy willingly we were not such cowards as you think now tell me did you ever see a compass point south just so easily might a zirra chosen by his master turn away who are you harry inquired dumitru son of vasile well at least you argue more persuasively than your father said harry one of the gypsies prodded him where they bundled him unceremoniously up the first leg of the climb what are you mumbling about are you saying your prayers too late for that if the ferenczy has called you harry said dumitru zirra if i could help you i would in however small a measure but i may not here in the place of many bones i was gnawed upon by one of the grey ones who serve the boyar janos he had my legs off at the knees i could crawl if you called me up but i could never fight what me a halfman of bone and leather and bits of gristle but only say it and iii do what i can so ive found a man at last harry answered this time silently in the unique manner of the necroscope but lie still dumitru zirra for i need more than old bones to go against janos the way was harder now and the gypsies sliced through the thongs binding harrys wrists instead they put two nooses round his neck one held by a man who stayed well ahead of him and the other by a man to his rear only fall now englishman and you hang yourself their spokesman told him or at very least stretch your neck a bit as we haul you up but harry didnt intend to fall he called out to mцbius with his deadspeak august hows it coming were almost there harry came the excited answer from a leipzig graveyard it could be an hour two three at the outside try thirty minutes said harry may not have much more than that left other voices crowded harrys necroscope mind from the graveyard in halmagiu harry keogh we are shunned who named you a friend of the dead was a great liar taken off guard he answered aloud i asked for your help you refused me its not my fault the worlds teeming dead hold you in contempt the szgany where they laboured up the mountainside in the streaming moonlight looked at each other is he mad always he talks to himself harry opened all the channels of his mind removed all barriers within and without and at once faethor was raging at him idiot i am the only one who can help you and yet you keep me hooded like some vicious bird in a cage why do you do this harry because i dont trust you he answered silently your motives your methods you your blackhearted self i dont trust a single thing you say or do faethor youre not only a father of vampires but a father of liars too still you do have a choice a choice what choice get out of my mind and go back to your place in ploiesti not until this thing is seen through to the end and how can i be sure youll stick to that you cant necroscope then sit in the dark said harry closing him off again and now the climb was halfway done in rhodes it was am darcy clarke and his team sat around a table in one of their hotel rooms they had spent time recovering from their work had eaten out as a group had discussed their experiences and how theyd been affected and probably would be affected for a long time to come but in the back of their minds each and every one of them had known that their own part in the fight was minimal and that without harry keoghs success everything else was cosmetic and the partial elation they felt now only the lull before the real storm as theyd returned from their late meal so zek had come up with an idea she was a telepath and david chung a locator together they might be able to reach harry and see what were his circumstances darcy had at once protested but thats just what harry didnt want look if janos got his mental hooks into you ive a feeling hell be too much involved with harry to be thinking about anything else zek had cut in anyway i want to do it in the lady karens stack her aerie on starside had the job of reading the minds of a great many wamphyri not one of them so much as suspected i was there or if they did nothing came of it thats the way ill play it now still darcy wasnt sure i was only thinking about poor trevor he said and about sandra trevor jordan wasnt expecting trouble zek had answered and sandra was inexperienced and her talent variable im not putting her down just stating a fact but no and again she had cut him off if david is willing i want to do it harry means a lot to jazz and me at which darcy had appealed to jazz simmons jazz had shaken his head if she says shell do it then shell do it he said hey dont take my word for it im only married to her and with reservations finally darcy had submitted for the fact was that he as much as anyone else was interested to know harrys circumstances now the three who werent participants darcy jazz and ben trask sat around the table and concentrated on what zek and david were doing the latter with his eyes closed breathing deeply his hands resting lightly on the stock and body of harrys crossbow where it sat on the table and zek similarly disposed her hand on one of his they had been this way for a minute or two waiting for chung to locate the necroscope through the medium of one of his own possessions but as seconds ticked by in silence and the two participants grew even more still so the watchers began to relax a little even to fidget and their thoughts to drift and just at the moment that jazz simmons chose to scratch his nose that was when contact was made it was brief david chung uttered a long drawnout sigh and zek snapped bolt upright in her chair her eyes remained closed for several long seconds while all the colour drained from her face then they shot open and she snatched herself away from chung straightened to her feet and backed unsteadily away from the table jazz went to her at once zek his voice was anxious are you ok for a moment she stared right through him then at him and accepted his arms he felt her trembling but at last she answered yes im all right but harry you found him darcy too had risen to his feet oh yes david chung nodded we found him what did you read zek she looked at him looked at all of them and freed herself from jazzs arms and said nothing darcy said is he ok and he held his breath waiting for her answer eventually she said hes all right yes and he got there safely to his destination i mean also i saw enough to know that it will all come to a head soon but something isnt right darcys heart thudded in his chest not right you mean hes already in trouble she looked at him and her look was so strange it was as if she gazed on alien things in a world of ice beyond the times and places we know in trouble oh hes that all right but not necessarily the trouble youre thinking of can you explain she straightened up and gave herself a shake and hugged her elbows no i cant she said shaking her head not yet and anyway i could be mistaken but mistaken about what darcys frustration was mounting harry is going up against janos ferenczy personally man to to thingl if hes in trouble before they even meet his disadvantage could well be insurmountable again she gave him that strange look and shook her head and quietly said no not insurmountable in fact on a one to one basis i think youll find that that theres not a great deal to choose between them following which and for quite a long time she would say no more with the misted valley far below and in the streaming moonlight of the heights harry knew the climb would soon be over and hed be face to face with hell he had hoped to call up all the local dead into an army on his side arid march with them on janoss place but even the dead were afraid now there was very little time left and probably less hope so the fact that he actually found himself anticipating what was to come was a very hard thing to explain it could be of course that hed simply cracked under the strain but he didnt think so hed never been the type his mind was still open and mцbius picked up his thoughts a breakdown you no never and especially not now when were so close i need to be into your mind harry enter of your own free will he answered almost automatically the other was very quickly in and out and he was excited as never before it all fits it all fits he said and the next time i come im sure ill be able to unlock those doors but not right now im afraid not then there may not be time for a next time dont give in harry i havent im just facing facts i swear well have the answer in minutes and meanwhile you could try helping yourself help myself how give yourself a problem in numbers set yourself a mathematical task prepare to reestablish your numeracy i wouldnt even know what a mathematical problem looked like then ill set one for you the great mathematician was silent for a moment then said now listen stage one i am nothing stage two i am born and in the first second of my existence expand uniformly to a circumference of approximately miles stage three after my second second of uniform expansion my circumference is twice as great question what am i youre crazy said harry thats what you are a minute ago i would have sworn it was me but now i know that im perfectly sane compared to you anyway harry harry laughed out loud causing the gypsies who struggled up the final rise with him to jump a madman they muttered yes the ferenczy has driven him mad the necroscope used his deadspeak again august heres me who cant count his toes without getting nine and you ask me to solve the riddles of the universe pretty close harry mцbius answered pretty close just keep at it and ill be back as soon as possible his deadspeak faded and he was gone jesus said harry to himself shaking his head in disgust jesus but mцbiuss question had stuck in his head he couldnt give it his attention right now but he knew it was in there lodged firmly in his mind and now the party had reached the top of the cliffs and somewhere here on this windblasted sparselyclad plateau here lay the ruins of the castle ferenczy that was where janos waited but right here and now here at the top of the long climb here something else waited seven somethings in all or eight if one included the grey one slinking in the mooncast shadows harrys escort to the lair of the undead vampire the two leading zirras saw them first then harry finally the three gypsies who panted where they laboured close behind all drew back startled and gasping except the necroscope himself for harry knew that he stood in the presence of dead men which was common ground for him what he and the others with him saw was this seven great thracians dead for more than two thousand years raised up again from their burial urns to do janoss bidding they had the aspect of life at least but there was a great deal of death in them too they wore helmets and some pieces of armour of their own period but wherever their grey flesh showed naked it was scarred disfigured their helmets were fearsome things designed to terrify any beholder they were domed of gleaming bronze with oval eyeholes dark in the flicker of their torches and curved downwardsweeping flanges to cover the jaws of the wearers all seven were big men but their leader stood a good four inches taller than the rest he stepped forward massive but the eyes behind the holes in his mask were red with sorrow bodrogk looked at harry keogh and the five who cowered behind him free him he said his tongue was ancient but his meaning the way his bronze sword touched harrys ropes couldnt be mistaken the szgany spokesman stepped cautiously to harrys side and loosened the nooses a little around his neck and to bodrogk the gypsy said you are the ferenczys creatures bodrogk didnt understand he looked this way and that frowning wondering what the mans question had been harry read his deadspeak confusion and answered he wants to know if janos sent you he spoke the words aloud letting his deadspeak do the translating and now bodrogks gaze centred on harry alone the massive thracian paced forward and the gypsies fell back bodrogk caught the ropes around harrys neck and snapped them like threads he grunted an introduction then said and so you are the necroscope beloved of all the worlds dead not all of them harry shook his head for there are cowards among the dead even as there are among the living if i cant know them because they are afraid to know me then i cant befriend them and anyway bodrogk ive no great desire to be loved by thralls bodrogks men had come forward moving closer to the gypsies on the bluff herding them there now their huge leader took off his helmet and tossed it clanking aside his neck was a bulls his face fullbearded fierce but it was grey that face and like the rest of his flesh gaunt with an unspoken horror his haggard harried aspect told far better than any words the way in which janos had dealt with him and his i heard you talking to the dead said bodrogk you must know that all of janoss thralls are not cowards i know that the thracians in the vaults of his castle are dust and so cant help me they told me they would but cant because only janos himself may call them up for he alone has the words on the other hand you and your six are not dust are you calling us cowards bodrogks calloused hand fell upon harrys shoulder close to his neck and in his other hand a great bronze sword was lifted up a little i only know that where some suffer janos to live harry answered i came to kill him and remove his taint forever and are you a warrior harry harry lifted his head gritted his teeth he had never feared the dead and would not now yes bodrogk smiled a strange sad smile which faded at once as he glanced beyond harry and these others with you they captured you and brought you here eh a lamb to the sacrifice they belong to the ferenczy harry nodded the other looked at him and his eyes went into harrys soul a warrior without a sword eh here take mine he placed it in harrys hands then scowled at the szgany and nodded to his men the six thracian lieutenants fell on the gypsies with their swords swept them from the bluff and over the edge of the cliff like chaff it was so swift and sudden they didnt even have time to scream their bodies went bumping bouncing and clattering into the deep dark gorge a friend at last harry nodded i thought i might find a few at least it was you or them bodrogk answered to murder a worthy man or slaughter a handful of dogs thralldom to the ferenczy or freedom for as long as it may last not much of a choice i made the only decision a man could make but if i had paused a moment to think then it might have gone the other way for my wifes sake he explained his meaning youve taken an enormous chance harry told him giving back his sword the dead called out to me bodrogk answered in their thousands they cried out all of them begging your life aye and one especially whose tongue lashed like none other why she might have been my own mother but instead she was yours harry sighed and thought thank god for you ma your mother yes said the other she halfswayed me and sofia did the rest your wife the same bodrogk nodded leading the way back towards the ruined castle in the heights she said to me where is your honour now you who once was mighty rather the applause and cold comforts of the teeming dead and thralldom to janos forever than another urn filled with screaming ashes in the monsters vaults harry said we have much in common then your lady and i and on impulse bodrogk i already have my cause but she must be yours only fight with sofia in mind and you cannot lose and deep inside unseen unheard he prayed it was true except i have no plan he admitted bodrogk laughed however grimly and answered a warrior without a sword nor yet a plan of campaign but he grasped the necroscopes shoulder and added i have been dead a long time harry keogh but in my life i was a king of warriors a general of armies i was the great strategist of my race and all the centuries flown between could not rob me of my cunning harry looked at the thracian striding gaunt grim dead and resurrected beside him but will cunning suffice when the vampire need only mutter a handful of words to return you to dust i think youd better tell me how this magic of his works and then something of your plan the words of devolution may only be spoken by a master a mage said bodrogk janos is one such he must direct his words aim them like an arrow to their target and to hit the target he must first see it wherefore we go up against him as individuals you me my six each man of us a unit in his own right we approach and enter the castle from all sides he cannot smite us all at once and with mere words even words of power he cant smite you at all some of us shall fall aye what of it weve fallen before we desire to fall and to remain fallen but while janos deals with some of us the others especially you harry may live long enough to deal with him harry nodded its as good a plan as any he said but surely he isnt alone he has his vampire thralls bodrogk answered five of them three who were szgany and two but recently joined him one of these is a woman with powers sandra harry breathed her name felt sick in the knowledge of how it must be for her and how it was yet to be and the other a man likewise talented bodrogk continued janos broke him to force his obedience as for the woman he did to her what he does to women the dog then we have them to deal with too indeed and now now they are waiting for us there beneath the trees beyond which lie those tumbled cursed ruins i am now supposed to give you into their hands when they in turn will take you to their master harry looked saw twisted windblasted pines leaning towards the cliffs of the ultimate ridge and in the shadows formed of their canopy he also saw the yellow flames of vampire eyes feral in the night he reverted to true deadspeak using only his mind to ask do you know how to deal with them do you question matched question the stake the sword the fire harry answered grimly swords we have said bodrogk fire too in the torches which my men carry and stakes aye we cut a few while we waited for you at the cliff for you see there were vampires in my day too so lets be at it janoss undead thralls came ghosting out of the trees their long arms reached for harry they smiled their ghastly smiles not a one of them dreamed that bodrogk had renegued but even as they ringed the necroscope about so the thracians fell on them and cut them down it was butchery and it was quick all three vampires were beheaded thrown to the ground and staked through their hearts but only three as bodrogks men took up the bodies of their victims and draped them across low branches and set fire to the tinderdry resinladen trees harry saw a crooked figure standing a little apart and in the next moment ken layard stepped into view harry he sighed harry thank god moonlight turned his sallow flesh golden as he opened his arms wide closed his eyes and turned his face up to the night sky the thracians looked at harry there was nothing he could do he nodded and turned away and saw a tall dark figure standing at the edge of the ruins only a dozen paces away janos bodrogks men had done with layard now they too saw the vampire there in the dark of the ruins his scarlet eyes furiously ablaze the thracians began to melt quickly back into shadows but not quickly enough for two of them who stood close together janos pointed at them and his awful baying voice swelled out like a curse on the night air ogthrod aif gebl eeh yogsothoth there was more but the effects of the rune of dissolution were already apparent the two thracians who were janoss target had already cried out fallen against each other collapsed to insubstantial wraiths which as he finished his devocation drifted to the earth as dust harry glanced all about bodrogk and his remaining four were nowhere to be seen another terror approached the wolf the grey one which had also been part of his escort but who had kept himself well back behind the party of thracians was now creeping up on him shepherding him towards the castles master the necroscope stooped took up one of the bronze swords of the dematerialized thracians felt its great weight smaller than bodrogks sword still it was no rapier harry knew he couldnt hope to wield this thing but it was better than nothing he looked for janos saw the monsters fleeting shadow moving back into the darkness of the ruins a ploy a feint harrys cue to pursue him well and wasnt that what he was here for as he followed after janos so the grey one rushed up behind him and snapped at his heels harry stiffened his leg into a bar of flesh and bone and lashed out and felt teeth crunch as his foot concertinaed the beasts slavering muzzle he snarled at the creature and took up his sword twohanded and astonishingly the wolf shrank back whining before harry could wonder at the meaning of this bodrogk and one of his remaining four stepped from cover and together fell on the animal the sounds of their attack were brief and reminded harry of nothing so much as a butchers shop as they first crippled the beast then cut short its yelping and howling by taking its head harrys eyes were more accustomed to the dark now in fact his clarity of vision in the night was entirely remarkable and a wonder to him but that was something else he had no time to consider instead he looked into the heart of the tumbled pile and saw janos standing behind a toppled wall the monsters gaze was fixed on a point beyond harry the thracians of course but as he pointed his great talon of a hand so the necroscope shouted look out ogthrod aif janos commenced his crackling rune of devolution and before hed finished another thracian had cried out sighed and crumbled into smoking drifting dust one of the two had been saved at least and harry found himself hoping it was bodrogk but now the necroscope went after janos with a vengeance athletic surefooted even in the dark he saw the vampire commence a descent apparently into the earth itself behind a mound of rubble in the last moment before he disappeared he turned his freakish head and looked back and harry saw the crimson lamps of his eyes there was a challenge written there which the necroscope couldnt resist he found the stone trapdoor raised above hollowed steps leading down and almost without thought began his own descent until a voice from behind stopped him looking back he saw bodrogk and his remaining warriors converging on him harry the great thracian rumbled youll be first down go swiftly preserve my sofia he nodded clambered down the spiralling stairwell a wall of stone on one side and a chasm opening on the other down to the first landing but setting foot on the solid stone floor janos was waiting the vampire came from nowhere knocked the sword out of harrys hands hurled the necroscope against the wall with such force that all the wind was hammered out of him before he could draw breath janos towered over him closed one huge hand over his face and slammed his head against the wall physically there was no match harry went out like a light harry haaarry his mother cried out to him a hundred mothers like her an even larger number of friends and acquaintances and all the dead in their graves across the world their voices soughed in the deadspeak aether filled it penetrated the threshold of harrys subconscious mind and wrapped him in their warmth warmth yes for the minds of the dead are different from the common clay of their onceflesh ma he answered through his pain and the struggle to rise up back into the conscious world ma im hurt i know son she said her voice brimming over i feel it we all of us do lie still harry and feel how we feel for you behind her the wash of background deadspeak was building up to a crescendo a wall of mental moaning lying still wont help ma he said nor all the gnashing of teeth i hear going on there im going to have to shut you all out i need to wake up and when ive done that ill need help just to live but the dead can help harry she told him theres one trying to contact you even now who has part of the answer mцbius she had to be talking about mцbius no not him harry sensed the shake of her head another someone who is much closer to you except theres not much left of him harry you wont hear him against all of this wait and ill see if i can quiet them she retreated spoke to others passed on a message that spread outwards like ripples in a calm pond where a stone has been tossed until it encompassed the world the mental babble quickly faded away and an extraordinary silence followed out of which harry whoever it was his deadspeak was so weak that at first the necroscope thought he must be imagining it but are you looking for me he answered eventually who are you am nothing the other sighed not even a whimper not even a ghost or at very best a ghost even among ghosts why even the dead have difficulty hearing my voice harry my name was george vulpe and five years ago my friends and i discovered the castle ferenczy harry nodded he killed you right he did more worse than that the other moaned his deadspeak thin as the slither of dry dead leaves he took my life my body and left me without anything not even a place to rest harry felt that this was very important can you explain ive spoken to a great many zirras in the place of many bones george vulpe told him when the ferenczy lay in his urn they were the ones who came to feed and refuel him with their blood but i was different on my hands there were only three fingers now harry gasped you were the one he has my body the other said again and i cant rest ever what was he harry wanted to know mean how did he usurp you drive you from your body the other explained my blood drew him up from his urn i was a son of his sons from the zirra clan but i didnt know that only my blood knew he came from his urn harry pressed as essential salts my blood transformed him harry needed help to understand he uncovered faethor damn you harry keogh the incorporeal vampire at once raged be quiet harry told him explain what this man is saying to me faethor heard vulpes story said why isnt it obvious janos had taken precautions when i reduced his brain and vampire both to ashes his ever faithful zirras hid him away in a secret place until he could perform this this metempsychosis but it wasnt merely a transfer of minds janoss leech was revived from its ashes the creature itself entered this ones body and now but harry at once closed him down again and george he said thanks for your help i dont see what good it will do me but thanks anyway the only answer was a sigh rapidly fading to nothing harry strove to rise up from unconsciousness to revive himself to wake up and was on the verge of succeeding then mцbius came harry mцbius cried we have it we believe we have it he entered the necroscopes mind and in another moment yes yes this must be right but are you ready ive never been so ready harry answered thats not what i meant said mцbius mean are you prepared mentally prepared mentally august what is this the mцbius continuum harry i can open those doors but not if youre not ready for it theres a different universe in there doors opening on places undreamed harry i wouldnt want you to get sucked into your own mind sucked into harry shook his head dont follow look did you solve my problem problem suddenly harry felt rage and frustration boiling up in him your fucking problem what time do you think ive had for solving fucking problems did you even think about it no yes yes i thought about it and nothing harry im going to open one of those doors now the necroscope felt nothing did it work it worked yes mцbius breathed and if you have the equations you should be able to do the rest yourself but i dont feel any different did you ever before i mean no but ill open another door there but this time harry did feel it a sharp white lance of agony setting off fireworks in his head it was something like the pain harry jnr had arranged for him if ever he should be tempted to use his deadspeak but since he was already unconscious its effect was greatly reduced and it served an entirely different purpose instead of blacking him out it jabbed him awake he came awake into a waking nightmare cold liquid burned his face got into his throat and stung him caused him to cough it was alcohol certainly it was volatile it smoked shimmering into vapour all around and harry was lying in it he struggled to his hands and knees tried not to breathe the fumes which were rising up into some sort of flue directly overhead a blackened flue fireblackened harry kneeled in a basin or depression cut from solid rock kneeled there in this pool of volatile liquid impressions came very quickly he must be in the very bowels of the castle down in the bedrock itself a huge cave and against the opposite wall where roughhewn steps led up to the higher levels there stood janos watching him he held a burning brand aloft his scarlet eyes reflecting its fire their eyes met locked and janoss lips drew back from his monstrous teeth in a hideous grin and so you are awake necroscope he said good for i desired that you should feel the fire which will make you mine forever he looked at the torch in his hand then at the floor harry looked too at a shallow trough or channel where it had been cut in the rock it ran from janoss feet across the floor to the lip of the basin jesus harry lurched for the rim of the shallow pool and his hands shot out from under him he wallowed in the liquid put one hand on the rim and drew himself up heard janoss mad laughter and saw him slowly lowering the brand to the floor my problem harry mцbius was hysterical in his horror harry fought back terror to picture the thing instinctively translating mцbiuss circumferences into diameters and his intuitive mathematical talent returned to him at last did the rest what am i mцbius howled as the fire of janoss torch descended to the liquid fuse light harry cried aloud what else can you be only light expands at twice the speed of light from nothing to a diameter of miles in two seconds fire whooshed came racing across the floor of the cave in a blueglaring blaze which light mцbius was frantic you were nothing until you came into existence harry yelled therefore you are the primal light yes mцbius danced in harrys mind and my source was the mцbius continuum welcome back harry computer screens opened in harrys mind even as the bowl became an inferno searing heat roared up in a tongue of blue fire that belched into the chimney overhead liquid fire singed the hair from his head and face and set his clothes blazing it lasted perhaps one tenth of a second until harry conjured a mцbius door and toppled through it he knew where to go conjured a second door and fell out of the mцbius continuum into a deep drift of snow at the roof of the world he was scorched yes but alive alive as never before elation filled him and more than elation his laughter hysterical as mцbiuss own quickly died down went out of him became a growl that rumbled menacingly in his throat janos had seen him disappear and in that moment had known that harry keogh was invincible the necroscope had gone where and hed be back when and what awesome powers would he bring with him janos dared not wait to find out he bounded up the stairs through the lower limits of the castles labyrinth bowels eventually emerging in the area of massively vaulted rooms which housed his urns and jars and lekythoi and discovered harry there ahead of him harry bodrogk and the remaining thracians janos fell back to crouch against a wall hissing then straightened up to come forward again you are dust he snarled at bodrogk and pointed his finger the huge thracian chief and two of his captains ducked through an arched door into another room but the third was caught in the blast of janoss devocation ogthrod aif gebl eeh yogsothoth ngahng aiy zhro the devolved man threw up his arms and sighed his last and fell in a cloud of greygreen chemicals janos roared his mad laughter leaped to take up the fallen warriors sword he advanced on harry sword raised high and the necroscope knew exactly what to do for harry was a mage a master in his own right and in his mind right now crying out from all of their prisoning urns a thousand deadspeak voices instructed him in the words of power he pointed at the jars scattered all about and turning in a circle uttered the rune of invocation yai ngngah yogsothoth hee lgeb fai throdog uaaah the vaulted room filled with stench and purple smoke in a moment obscuring harry janos and all and out of the rush and reek came the cries of the tortured there had been no time for the mixing of chemicals these resurrected thracians persians scythians and greeks would all be imperfect but their lust for vengeance would be entirely in keeping janos knew it too he careened through their stumbling groaning ranks as they shattered their jars and grew up like mushrooms out of nothing but as fast as he could target a group and put them down again so the necroscope called them up there was no way the vampire could win he couldnt bellow his words fast enough and the ranks of resurrected warriors were rapidly closing on him blasting a path of dust before him he fled to the steps winding up to ruined regions above and passed from sight the hideously incomplete army would follow after but harry cautioned them stay here your part is played but this time when you go down you know that you may rest in peace and they blessed him as he returned them all to their materia all except the warrior king bodrogk and taking bodrogk with him he stepped through a mцbius door and out again into the ruins of castle ferenczy they waited and in a little while janos came grunting whining and panting into the night he saw them choked on his terror gagged and reeled as he stumbled away from them out of the ruins he was spent he had no breath he tottered to the cliff behind the castle and climbed it along a path and halfway up found harry and bodrogk waiting for him the huge thracian carried a battleaxe there was nowhere left to run janos looked outwards to the night and his crimson eyes gazed on empty space in all his life thered been only one wamphyri art he never mastered or counterfeited and now he must he held up his arms and willed the change and his clothing tore as his body wrenched itself into a great blanket an aerofoil of flesh and like a bat in the night he launched himself from the cliffside path he succeeded he flew with the tatters of his ripped clothing fluttering about him like strange wings he flew until bodrogks hurled battleaxe buried itself in his spine harry and bodrogk returned to the ruins and found the monster writhing there where hed crashed down in the rubble he choked and coughed up blood but already hed worked the axe loose and his vampire flesh was healing him the necroscope kneeled beside him and looked him in the eye man to man face to terrifying terrified face bastard necroscope janoss eyes bled where they bulged you have a mans body harry answered without emotion but your mind and the vampire within you were raised from ashes in an urn he pointed a steady hand and finger ashes to ashes janos and dust to dust ogthrod aif gebl eeh the vampire gave a shriek wriggled frantically choked gagged and regained his manshape and the necroscope continued yogsothoth ngahngaiy no janos howled nnnoooooooo as harry uttered the final word zhror so janoss entire body convulsed in instant unbearable agony he writhed frantically vibrated then grew still finally his head flopped back and his awful mouth flew open and the lights went out in his eyes then his massive chest slowly deflated as he sighed his last long sigh no air escaped him but a cloud of red dust drifting on the air the rest of his body even his head must be full of the stuff and as the dust of that devolved vampire leech settled it reminded the necroscope of nothing so much as the spores of those weird mushrooms at faethors place on the outskirts of ploiesti which in turn served to remind him of something else as yet unfinished bodrogks lady sofia came up out of the ruins and sandra came with her she came ghosting in the way of vampire thralls her yellow eyes alive in the night but harry knew that she was less than sandra now or more briefly he remembered his precognitive glimpse back at the start of this whole thing of an alien creature that came to him in the night and lusted after him but only for his blood sandra was now an alien creature who would lust after men for their blood she flew into his arms and sobbed into his neck and holding her tightly as much to steady himself as to steady her he looked over her sallow shoulder to where bodrogk gathered up his wife and he heard sofia say she saved me the vampire girl found me where janos had hidden me and set me free and harry wondered her last freewill act before the monstrous fever in her blood claims her for its own sandras beautiful nearnaked body was cold as clay where it pressed against the necroscope and harry knew there was no way he could ever warm it a telepath she heard the thought as surely as if it had been spoken and drew back a little but not far enough his thin sharp stake a splinter of old oak drove up under her breast and into her heart she took one last breath one staggering step away from him and fell bodrogk seeing harrys anguish did the rest epilogue all night harry sat alone in the ruins sat there with his thoughts with faethor trapped within him and the teeming dead held at bay without he let no one in to witness his sorrow he had thought he would be cold but strangely was not he had thought the darkness and the shadows would bother him but the night had felt like an old friend with the dawn spreading in the east he sought out bodrogk and his lady they had found a sheltered place to light a fire and now reclined in each others arms watching the sun rise their faces greeted him with something of sadness but also with a great resolve it doesnt have to be he said the choice is yours our world is two thousand years in the past bodrogk answered since then weve prayed for peace a thousand times you have the power necroscope harry nodded uttered his esoteric farewell and watched their dust mingle as a breeze came up to blow them away and now he was ready he returned to the ruins and set faethor free what that father of vampires raged and am i your last resort harry keogh do you enlist my aid now when all else has failed you nothing has failed harry told him and then even by his standards he did a strange thing he deliberately lied to a dead man janos is crippled dying he said faethors fury knew no bounds without me you brought him down without me he doesnt know i had a hand in it i want to feel the dogs pain he crashed out of harrys mind and discovered janos dead astonished faethor knew the truth but of course harry had known it before him he triggered wellesleys talent to shut faethor out i told you id be rid of you he said fool faethor raged be back in never fear only relax your guard by the smallest fraction and well be one again necroscope we had a bargain harry was reasonable ive played my part go back to your place in ploiesti faethor back to the cold earth after ive known your warmth never dont you know what has happened janos made no great error when he read the future he knew that a master vampire the greatest of them all would go down from this place when all was done i am that vampire harry in your body men shouldnt read the future said harry for its a devious thing and now i have to be on my way where you go i go harry shrugged and opened a mцbius door remember dragosani he said and he stepped through the door faethor shuddered but went in with him dragosani was a fool he blustered you dont shake me off so lightly theres still time harry told him i can still take you to ploiesti to hell with ploiesti harry opened a pasttime door and launched himself through it and faethor clung to him like the grim death he was you wont shake me loose necroscope they gazed on the past of all mankind their myriad neon lifethreads dwindling away to a bright blue origin and now faethor moaned where are you taking me to see what has been harry told him see see there that red thread among the blue indeed a scarlet thread yours faethor and do you see where it stops thats where ladislau giresci took your head the night your house was bombed thats where your lifethread stopped and youd have been wise to stop with it take take me out of here faethor gasped and gurgled and clung like an incorporeal leech harry returned to the mцbius continuum and chose a futuretime door where now the billions of blue lifethreads wove out and away forever speeding into a dazzling everexpanding future he drifted out among them and was quickly drawn along the timestream and this thread you see unwinding out of me he said its my future and mine said faethor doggedly steadier now but see its tinged with red harry ignored him do you see that faethor see it fool the red is me proof that im part of you always wrong said harry i can go back because my thread is unbroken because i have a past i can reel myself in but your past was finished back in ploiesti you have no thread no lifeline faethor what the others nightmare voice was a croak then the master of the mцbius continuum brought himself to an abrupt halt but the spirit of faethor ferenczy shot on into the future harry he cried out in his terror dont do this but its done the necroscope called after him you have no flesh no past nothing faethor except the longest loneliest emptiest future any creature ever suffered goodbye hhharry haaarry haaaarrry haaaaaaaaaa but harry closed the door and shut him off always except that before the door slammed shut he looked again at the blue thread unwinding out of himself and saw that it was still tinged red men should never try to read the future for its a devious thing я
