 clive barker books of blood volume every body is a book of blood wherever were opened were red contents dread hells event jacqueline ess her will and testement the skins of the fathers new murders in the rue morgue dread there is no delight the equal of dread if it were possible to sit invisible between two people on any train in any waiting room or office the conversation overheard would time and again circle on that subject certainly the debate might appear to be about something entirely different the state of the nation idle chat about death on the roads the rising price of dental care but strip away the metaphor the innuendo and there nestling at the heart of the discourse is dread while the nature of god and the possibility of eternal life go undiscussed we happily chew over the minutiae of misery the syndrome recognizes no boundaries in bathhouse and seminarroom alike the same ritual is repeated with the inevitability of a tongue returning to probe a painful tooth we come back and back and back again to our fears sitting to talk them over with the eagerness of a hungry man before a full and steaming plate while he was still at university and afraid to speak stephen grace was taught to speak of why he was afraid in fact not simply to talk about it but to analyze and dissect his every nerve ending looking for tiny terrors in this investigation he had a teacher quaid it was an age of gurus it was their season in universities up and down england young men and women were looking east and west for people to follow like lambs steve grace was just one of many it was his bad luck that quaid was the messiah he found theyd met in the student common room the names quaid said the man at steves elbow at the bar oh youre steve grace yes youre in the ethics class right right i dont see you in any of the other philosophy seminars or lectures its my extra subject for the year im on the english literature course i just couldnt bear the idea of a year in the old norse classes so you plumped for ethics yes quaid ordered a double brandy he didnt look that well off and a double brandy would have just about crippled steves finances for the next week quaid downed it quickly and ordered another what are you having steve was nursing half a pint of lukewarm lager determined to make it last an hour nothing for me yes you will im fine another brandy and a pint of lager for my friend steve didnt resist quaids generosity a pint and a half of lager in his unfed system would help no end in dulling the tedium of his oncoming seminars on charles dickens as a social analyst he yawned just to think of it somebody ought to write a thesis on drinking as a social activity quaid studied his brandy a moment then downed it or as oblivion he said steve looked at the man perhaps five years older than steves twenty the mixture of clothes he wore was confusing tattered running shoes cords a greywhite shirt that had seen better days and over it a very expensive black leather jacket that hung badly on his tall thin frame the face was long and unremarkable the eyes milkyblue and so pale that the colour seemed to seep into the whites leaving just the pinpricks of his irises visible behind his heavy glasses lips full like a jagger but pale dry and unsensual hair a dirty blond quaid steve decided could have passed for a dutch dopepusher he wore no badges they were the common currency of a students obsessions and quaid looked naked without something to imply how he took his pleasures was he a gay feminist savethewhale campaigner or a fascist vegetarian what was he into for gods sake you should have been doing old norse said quaid why they dont even bother to mark the papers on that course said quaid steve hadnt heard about this quaid droned on they just throw them all up into the air face up an a face down a b oh it was a joke quaid was being witty steve attempted a laugh but quaids face remained unmoved by his own attempt at humour you should be in old norse he said again who needs bishop berkeley anyhow or plato or or its all shit yes ive watched you in the philosophy class steve began to wonder about quaid you never take notes do you no i thought you were either sublimely confident or you simply couldnt care less neither im just completely lost quaid grunted and pulled out a pack of cheap cigarettes again that was not the done thing you either smoked gauloises camel or nothing at all its not true philosophy they teach you here said quaid with unmistakable contempt oh we get spoonfed a bit of plato or a bit of bentham no real analysis its got all the right markings of course it looks like the beast it even smells a bit like the beast to the uninitiated what beast philosophy true philosophy its a beast stephen dont you think i hadnt its wild it bites he grinned suddenly vulpine yes it bites he replied oh that pleased him again for luck bites stephen nodded the metaphor was beyond him i think we should feel mauled by our subject quaid was warming to the whole subject of mutilation by education we should be frightened to juggle the ideas we should talk about why because if we were philosophers worth we wouldnt be exchanging academic pleasantries we wouldnt be talking semantics using linguistic trickery to cover the real concerns what would we be doing steve was beginning to feel like quaids straight man except that quaid wasnt in a joking mood his face was set his pinprick irises had closed down to tiny dots we should be walking close to the beast steve dont you think reaching out to stroke it pet it milk it what er what is the beast quaid was clearly a little exasperated by the pragmatism of the enquiry its the subject of any worthwhile philosophy stephen its the things we fear because we dont understand them its the dark behind the door steve thought of a door thought of the dark he began to see what quaid was driving at in his labyrinthine fashion philosophy was a way to talk about fear we should discuss whats intimate to our psyches said quaid if we dont we risk quaids loquaciousness deserted him suddenly what quaid was staring at his empty brandy glass seeming to will it to be full again want another said steve praying that the answer would be no what do we risk quaid repeated the question well i think if we dont go out and find the beast steve could see the punchline coming sooner or later the beast will come and find us there is no delight the equal of dread as long as its someone elses casually in the following week or two steve made some enquiries about the curious mr quaid nobody knew his first name nobody was certain of his age but one of the secretaries thought he was over thirty which came as a surprise his parents cheryl had heard him say were dead killed the thought that appeared to be the sum of human knowledge where quaid was concerned i owe you a drink said steve touching quaid on the shoulder he looked as though hed been bitten brandy thank you steve ordered the drinks did i startle you i was thinking no philosopher should be without one one what brain they fell to talking steve didnt know why hed approached quaid again the man was ten years his senior and in a different intellectual league he probably intimidated steve if he was to be honest about it quaids relentless talk of beasts confused him yet he wanted more of the same more metaphors more of that humourless voice telling him how useless the tutors were how weak the students in quaids world there were no certainties he had no secular gurus and certainly no religion he seemed incapable of viewing any system whether it was political or philosophical without cynicism though he seldom laughed out loud steve knew there was a bitter humour in his vision of the world people were lambs and sheep all looking for shepherds of course these shepherds were fictions in quaids opinion all that existed in the darkness outside the sheepfold were the fears that fixed on the innocent mutton waiting patient as stone for their moment everything was to be doubted but the fact that dread existed quaids intellectual arrogance was exhilarating steve soon came to love the iconoclastic ease with which he demolished belief after belief sometimes it was painful when quaid formulated a watertight argument against one of steves dogma but after a few weeks even the sound of the demolition seemed to excite quaid was clearing the undergrowth felling the trees razing the stubble steve felt free nation family church law all ash all useless all cheats and chains and suffocation there was only dread i fear you fear we fear quaid was fond of saying he she or it fears theres no conscious thing on the face of the world that doesnt know dread more intimately than its own heartbeat one of quaids favourite baitingvictims was another philosophy and eng lit student cheryl fromm she would rise to his more outrageous remarks like fish to rain and while the two of them took knives to each others arguments steve would sit back and watch the spectacle cheryl was in quaids phrase a pathological optimist and youre full of shit shed say when the debate had warmed up a little so who cares if youre afraid of your own shadow im not i feel fine she certainly looked it cheryl fromm was wet dream material but too bright for anyone to try making a move on her we all taste dread once in a while quaid would reply to her and his milky eyes would study her face intently watching for her reaction trying steve knew to find a flaw in her conviction i dont no fears no nightmares no way ive got a good family dont have any skeletons in my closet i dont even eat meat so i dont feel bad when i drive past a slaughterhouse i dont have any shit to put on show does that mean im not real it means quaids eyes were snakeslits it means your confidence has something big to cover back to nightmares big nightmares be specific define your terms i cant tell you what you fear tell me what you fear then quaid hesitated finally he said its beyond analysis beyond analysis my ass that brought an involuntary smile to steves lips cheryls ass was indeed beyond analysis the only response was to kneel down and worship quaid was back on his soapbox what i fear is personal to me it makes no sense in a larger context the signs of my dread the images my brain uses if you like to illustrate my fear those signs are mild stuff by comparison with the real honor thats at the root of my personality ive got images said steve pictures from childhood that make me think of he stopped regretting this confessional already what said cheryl you mean things to do with bad experiences falling off your bike or something like that perhaps steve said i find myself sometimes thinking of those pictures not deliberately just when my concentrations idling its almost as though my mind went to them automatically quaid gave a little grunt of satisfaction precisely he said freud writes on that said cheryl what freud cheryl repeated this time making a performance of it as though she were speaking to a child sigmund freud you may have heard of him quaids lip curled with unrestrained contempt mother fixations dont answer the problem the real terrors in me in all of us are prepersonality dreads there before we have any notion of ourselves as individuals the thumbnail curled up on itself in the womb feels fear you remember do you said cheryl maybe quaid replied deadly serious the womb quaid gave a sort of halfsmile steve thought the smile said i have knowledge you dont it was a weird unpleasant smile one steve wanted to wash off his eyes youre a liar said cheryl getting up from her seat and looking down her nose at quaid perhaps i am he said suddenly the perfect gentleman after that the debates stopped no more talking about nightmares no more debating the things that go bump in the night steve saw quaid irregularly for the next month and when he did quaid was invariably in the company of cheryl fromm quaid was polite with her even deferential he no longer wore his leather jacket because she hated the smell of dead animal matter this sudden change in their relationship confounded stephen but he put it down to his primitive understanding of sexual matters he wasnt a virgin but women were still a mystery to him contradictory and puzzling he was also jealous though he wouldnt entirely admit that to himself he resented the fact that the wet dream genius was taking up so much of quaids time there was another feeling a curious sense he had that quaid was courting cheryl for his own strange reasons sex was not quaids motive he felt sure nor was it respect for cheryls intelligence that made him so attentive no he was cornering her somehow that was steves instinct cheryl fromm was being rounded up for the kill then after a month quaid let a remark about cheryl drop in conversation shes a vegetarian he said cheryl of course cheryl i know she mentioned it before yes but it isnt a fad with her shes passionate about it cant even bear to look in a butchers window she wont touch meat smell meat oh steve was stumped where was this leading dread steve of meat the signs are different from person to person she fears meat she says shes so healthy so balanced shit ill find find what the fear steve youre not going to steve didnt know how to voice his anxiety without sounding accusatory harm her said quaid no im not going to harm her in any way any damage done to her will be strictly selfinflicted quaid was staring at him almost hypnotically its about time we learnt to trust one another quaid went on he leaned closer between the two of us listen i dont think i want to hear we have to touch the beast stephen damn the beast i dont want to hear steve got up as much to break the oppression of quaids stare as to finish the conversation were friends stephen yes then respect that what silence not a word steve nodded that wasnt a difficult promise to keep there was nobody he could tell his anxieties to without being laughed at quaid looked satisfied he hurried away leaving steve feeling as though he had unwillingly joined some secret society for what purpose he couldnt begin to tell quaid had made a pact with him and it was unnerving for the next week he cut all his lectures and most of his seminars notes went uncopied books unread essays unwritten on the two occasions he actually went into the university building he crept around like a cautious mouse praying he wouldnt collide with quaid he neednt have feared the one occasion he did see quaids stooping shoulders across the quadrangle he was involved in a smiling exchange with cheryl fromm she laughed musically her pleasure echoing off the wall of the history department the jealousy had left steve altogether he wouldnt have been paid to be so near to quaid so intimate with him the time he spent alone away from the bustle of lectures and overfull corridors gave steves mind time to idle his thoughts returned like tongue to tooth like fingernail to scab to his fears and so to his childhood at the age of six steve had been struck by a car the injuries were not particularly bad but concussion left him partially deaf it was a profoundly distressing experience for him not understanding why he was suddenly cut off from the world it was an inexplicable torment and the child assumed it was eternal one moment his life had been real full of shouts and laughter the next he was cut off from it and the external world became an aquarium full of gaping fish with grotesque smiles worse still there were times when he suffered what the doctors called tinnitus a roaring or ringing sound in the ears his head would fill with the most outlandish noises whoops and whistlings that played like soundeffects to the flailings of the outside world at those times his stomach would churn and a band of iron would be wrapped around his forehead crushing his thoughts into fragments dissociating head from hand intention from practice he would be swept away in a tide of panic completely unable to make sense of the world while his head sang and rattled but at night came the worst terrors he would wake sometimes in what had been the reassuring womb of his bedroom to find the ringing had begun in his sleep his eyes would jerk open his body would be wet with sweat his mind would be filled with the most raucous din which he was locked in with beyond hope of reprieve nothing could silence his head and nothing it seemed could bring the world the speaking laughing crying world back to him he was alone that was the beginning middle and end of the dread he was absolutely alone with his cacophony locked in this house in this room in this body in this head a prisoner of deaf blind flesh it was almost unbearable in the night the boy would sometimes cry out not knowing he was making any sound and the fish who had been his parents would turn on the light and come to try and help him bending over his bed making faces their soundless mouths forming ugly shapes in their attempts to help their touches would calm him at last with time his mother learned the trick of soothing away the panic that swept over him a week before his seventh birthday his hearing returned not perfectly but well enough for it to seem like a miracle the world snapped back into focus and life began afresh it took several months for the boy to trust his senses again he would still wake in the night halfanticipating the headnoises but though his ears would ring at the slightest volume of sound preventing steve from going to rock concerts with the rest of the students he now scarcely ever noticed his slight deafness he remembered of course very well he could bring back the taste of his panic the feel of the iron band around his head and there was a residue of fear there of the dark of being alone but then wasnt everyone afraid to be alone to be utterly alone steve had another fear now far more difficult to pin down quaid in a drunken revelation session he had told quaid about his childhood about the deafness about the night terrors quaid knew about his weakness the clear route into the heart of steves dread he had a weapon a stick to beat steve with should it ever come to that maybe that was why he chose not to speak to cheryl and certainly that was why he avoided quaid the man had a look in certain moods of malice nothing more or less he looked like a man with malice deep deep in him maybe those four months of watching people with the sound turned down had sensitized steve to the tiny glances sneers and smiles that flit across peoples faces he knew quaids life was a labyrinth a map of its complexities was etched on his face in a thousand tiny expressions the next phase of steves initiation into quaids secret world didnt come for almost three and a half months the university broke for the summer recess and the students went their ways steve took his usual vacation job at his fathers printing works it was long hours and physically exhausting but an undeniable relief for him academe had overstuffed his mind he felt forcefed with words and ideas the print work sweated all of that out of him rapidly sorting out the jumble in his mind it was a good time he scarcely thought of quaid at all he returned to campus in the late september the students were still thin on the ground most of the courses didnt start for another week and there was a melancholy air about the place without its usual melee of complaining flirting arguing kids steve was in the library cornering a few important books before others on his course had their hands on them books were pure gold at the beginning of term with reading lists to be checked off and the university book shop forever claiming the necessary titles were on order they would invariably arrive those vital books two days after the seminar in which the author was to be discussed this final year steve was determined to be ahead of the rush for the few copies of seminal works the library possessed the familiar voice spoke early to work steve looked up to meet quaids pinprick eyes im impressed steve what with your enthusiasm for the job oh quaid smiled what are you looking for something on bentham ive got principles of morals and legislation will that do it was a trap no that was absurd he was offering a book how could that simple gesture be construed as a trap come to think of it the smile broadened i think its the library copy ive got ill give it to you thanks good holiday yes thank you you very rewarding the smile had decayed into a thin line beneath his youve grown a moustache it was an unhealthy example of the species thin patchy and dirtyblond it wandered back and forth under quaids nose as if looking for a way off his face quaid looked faintly embarrassed was it for cheryl he was definitely embarrassed now well sounds like you had a good vacation the embarrassment was surmounted by something else ive got some wonderful photographs quaid said what of holiday snaps steve couldnt believe his ears had c fromm tamed the quaid holiday snaps you wont believe some of them there was something of the arab selling dirty postcards about quaids manner what the hell were these photographs split beaver shots of cheryl caught reading kant i dont think of you as being a photographer its become a passion of mine he grinned as he said passion there was a barelysuppressed excitement in his manner he was positively gleaming with pleasure youve got to come and see them i tonight and pick up the bentham at the same time thanks ive got a house for myself these days round the corner from the maternity hospital in pilgrim street number sixtyfour some time after nine right thanks pilgrim street quaid nodded i didnt know there were any habitable houses in pilgrim street number sixtyfour pilgrim street was on its knees most of the houses were already rubble a few were in the process of being knocked down their inside walls were unnaturally exposed pink and pale green wallpapers fireplaces on upper storeys hanging over chasms of smoking brick stairs leading from nowhere to nowhere and back again number sixtyfour stood on its own the houses in the terrace to either side had been demolished and bulldozed away leaving a desert of impacted brickdust which a few hardy and foolhardy weeds had tried to populate a threelegged white dog was patrolling its territory along the side of sixtyfour leaving little pissmarks at regular intervals as signs of its ownership quaids house though scarcely palatial was more welcoming than the surrounding wasteland they drank some bad red wine together which steve had brought with him and they smoked some grass quaid was far more mellow than steve had ever seen him before quite happy to talk trivia instead of dread laughing occasionally even telling a dirty joke the interior of the house was bare to the point of being spartan no pictures on the walls no decoration of any kind quaids books and there were literally hundreds of them were piled on the floor in no particular sequence that steve could make out the kitchen and bathroom were primitive the whole atmosphere was almost monastic after a couple of easy hours steves curiosity got the better of him wheres the holiday snaps then he said aware that he was slurring his words a little and no longer giving a shit oh yes my experiment experiment tell you the truth steve im not so sure i should show them to you why not im into serious stuff steve and im not ready for serious stuff is that what youre saying steve could feel quaids technique working on him even though it was transparently obvious what he was doing i didnt say you werent ready what the hell is this stuff pictures of you remember cheryl pictures of cheryl ha how could i forget she wont be coming back this term oh she had a revelation quaids stare was basilisklike what do you mean she was always so calm wasnt she quaid was talking about her as though she were dead calm cool and collected yes i suppose she was poor bitch all she wanted was a good fuck steve smirked like a kid at quaids dirty talk it was a little shocking like seeing teacher with his dick hanging out of his trousers she spent some of the vacation here here in this house you like her then shes an ignorant cow shes pretentious shes weak shes stupid but she wouldnt give she wouldnt give a fucking thing you mean she wouldnt screw oh no shed strip off her knickers soon as look at you it was her fears she wouldnt give same old song but i persuaded her in the fullness of time quaid pulled out a box from behind a pile of philosophy books in it was a sheaf of black and white photographs blown up to twice postcard size he passed the first one of the series over to steve i locked her away you see steve quaid was as unemotional as a newsreader to see if i could needle her into showing her dread a little bit what do you mean locked her away upstairs steve felt strange he could hear his ears singing very quietly bad wine always made his head ring i locked her away upstairs quaid said again as an experiment thats why i took this house no neighbours to hear no neighbours to hear what steve looked at the grainy image in his hand concealed camera said quaid she never knew i was photographing her photograph one was of a small featureless room a little plain furniture thats the room top of the house warm a bit stuffy even no noise no noise quaid proffered photograph two same room now most of the furniture had been removed a sleeping bag was laid along one wall a table a chair a bare light bulb thats how i laid it out for her it looks like a cell quaid grunted photograph three the same room on the table a jug of water in the corner of the room a bucket roughly covered with a towel whats the bucket for she had to piss yes all amenities provided said quaid i didnt intend to reduce her to an animal even in his drunken state steve took quaids inference he didnt intend to reduce her to an animal however photograph four on the table on an unpatterned plate a slab of meat a bone sticks out from it beef said quaid but shes a vegetarian so she is its slightly salted wellcooked good beef photograph five the same cheryl is in the room the door is closed she is kicking the door her foot and fist and face a blur of fury i put her in the room about five in the morning she was sleeping i carried her over the threshold myself very romantic she didnt know what the hell was going on you locked her in there of course an experiment she knew nothing about it wed talked about dread you know me she knew what i wanted to discover knew i wanted guineapigs she soon caught on once she realized what i was up to she calmed down photograph six cheryl sits in the corner of the room thinking i think she believed she could outwait me photograph seven cheryl looks at the leg of beef glancing at it on the table nice photo dont you think look at the expression of disgust on her face she hated even the smell of cooked meat she wasnt hungry then of course eight she sleeps nine she pisses steve felt uncomfortable watching the girl squatting on the bucket knickers round her ankles tearstains on her face ten she drinks water from the jug eleven she sleeps again back to the room curled up like a foetus how long has she been in the room this was only fourteen hours in she lost orientation as to time very quickly no light change you see her bodyclock was fucked up pretty soon how long was she in here till the point was proved twelve awake she cruises the meat on the table caught surreptitiously glancing down at it this was taken the following morning i was asleep the camera just took pictures every quarter hour look at her eyes steve peered more closely at the photograph there was a certain desperation on cheryls face a haggard wild look the way she stared at the beef she could have been trying to hypnotize it she looks sick shes tired thats all she slept a lot as it happened but it seemed just to make her more exhausted than ever she doesnt know now if its day or night and shes hungry of course its been a day and a half shes more than a little peckish thirteen she sleeps again curled into an even tighter ball as though she wanted to swallow herself fourteen she drinks more water i replaced the jug when she was asleep she slept deeply i could have done a jig in there and it wouldnt have woken her lost to the world he grinned mad thought steve the mans mad god it stank in there you know how women smell sometimes its not sweat its something else heavy odour meaty bloody she came on towards the end of her time hadnt planned it that way fifteen she touches the meat this is where the cracks begin to show said quaid with quiet triumph in his voice this is where the dread begins steve studied the photograph closely the grain of the print blurred the detail but the cool mama was in pain that was for sure her face was knotted up half in desire half in repulsion as she touched the food sixteen she was at the door again throwing herself at it every part of her body flailing her mouth a black blur of angst screaming at the blank door she always ended up haranguing me whenever shed had a confrontation with the meat how long is this coming up for three days youre looking at a hungry woman it wasnt difficult to see that the next photo she stood still in the middle of the room averting her eyes from the temptation of the food her entire body tensed with the dilemma youre starving her she can go ten days without eating quite easily fasts are common in any civilized country steve sixty per cent of the british population is clinically obese at any one time she was too fat anyhow eighteen she sits the fat girl in her corner of the room weeping about now she began to hallucinate just little mental ticks she thought she felt something in her hair or on the back of her hand id see her staring into midair sometimes watching nothing nineteen she washes herself she is stripped to the waist her breasts are heavy her face is drained of expression the meat is a darker tone than in the previous photographs she washed herself regularly never let twelve hours go by without washing from head to toe the meat looks ripe dark its quite warm in her little room and theres a few flies in there with her theyve found the meat laid their eggs yes its ripening up quite nicely is that part of the plan sure if the meat revolted when it was fresh what about her disgust at rotted meat thats the crux of her dilemma isnt it the longer she waits to eat the more disgusted she becomes with what shes been given to feed on shes trapped with her own horror of meat on the one hand and her dread of dying on the other which is going to give first steve was no less trapped now on the one hand this joke had already gone too far and quaids experiment had become an exercise in sadism on the other hand he wanted to know how far this story ended there was an undeniable fascination in watching the woman suffer the next seven photographs twenty twentyone two three four five and six pictured the same circular routine sleeping washing pissing meatwatching sleeping washing pissing then twentyseven see she picks up the meat yes she picks it up her face full of horror the haunch of the beef looks wellripened now speckled with flies eggs gross she bites it the next photograph and her face is buried in the meat steve seemed to taste the rotten flesh in the back of his throat his mind found a stench to imagine and created a gravy of putrescence to run over his tongue how could she do it twentynine she is vomiting in the bucket in the corner of the room thirty she is sitting looking at the table it is empty the waterjug has been thrown against the wall the plate has been smashed the beef lies on the floor in a slime of degeneration thirtyone she sleeps her head is lost in a tangle of arms thirtytwo she is standing up she is looking at the meat again defying it the hunger she feels is plain on her face so is the disgust thirtythree she sleeps how long now asked steve five days no six six days thirtyfour she is a blurred figure apparently flinging herself against a wall perhaps beating her head against it steve couldnt be sure he was past asking part of him didnt want to know thirtyfive she is again sleeping this time beneath the table the sleeping bag has been torn to pieces shredded cloth and pieces of stuffing littering the room thirtysix she speaks to the door through the door knowing she will get no answer thirtyseven she eats the rancid meat calmly she sits under the table like a primitive in her cave and pulls at the meat with her incisors her face is again expressionless all her energy is bent to the purpose of the moment to eat to eat til the hunger disappears til the agony in her belly and the sickness in her head disappear steve stared at the photograph it startled me said quaid how suddenly she gave in one moment she seemed to have as much resistance as ever the monologue at the door was the same mixture of threats and apologies as shed delivered day in day out then she broke just like that squatted under the table and ate the beef down to the bone as though it were a choice cut thirtyeight she sleeps the door is open light pours in thirtynine the room is empty where did she go she wandered downstairs she came into the kitchen drank several glasses of water and sat in a chair for three or four hours without saying a word did you speak to her eventually when she started to come out of her fugue state the experiment was over i didnt want to hurt her what did she say nothing nothing nothing at all for a long time i dont believe she was even aware of my presence in the room then i cooked some potatoes which she ate she didnt try and call the police no no violence no she knew what id done and why id done it it wasnt preplanned but wed talked about such experiments in abstract conversations she hadnt come to any harm you see shed lost a bit of weight perhaps but that was about all where is she now she left the day after i dont know where she went and what did it all prove nothing at all perhaps but it made an interesting start to my investigations start this was only a start there was plain disgust for quaid in steves voice stephen you could have killed her no she could have lost her mind unbalanced her permanently possibly but unlikely she was a strongwilled woman but you broke her yes it was a journey she was ready to take wed talked of going to face her fear so here was i arranging for cheryl to do just that nothing much really you forced her to do it she wouldnt have gone otherwise true it was an education for her so now youre a teacher steve wished hed been able to keep the sarcasm out of his voice but it was there sarcasm anger and a little fear yes im a teacher quaid replied looking at steve obliquely his eyes not focused im teaching people dread steve stared at the floor are you satisfied with what youve taught and learned steve ive learned too its a very exciting prospect a world of fears to investigate especially with inteffigent subjects even in the face of rationalization steve stood up i dont want to hear any more oh ok ive got classes early tomorrow no what a beat faltering no dont go yet why his heart was racing he feared quaid hed never realized how profoundly ive got some more books to give you steve felt his face flush slightly what had he thought in that moment that quaid was going to bring him down with a rugby tackle and start experimenting on his fears no idiot thoughts ive got a book on kierkegaard youll like upstairs ill be two minutes smiling quaid left the room steve squatted on his haunches and began to sheaf through the photographs again it was the moment when cheryl first picked up the rotting meat that fascinated him most her face wore an expression completely uncharacteristic of the woman he had known doubt was written there and confusion and deep dread it was quaids word a dirty word an obscene word associated from this night on with quaids torture of an innocent girl for a moment steve thought of the expression on his own face as he stared down at the photograph was there not some of the same confusion on his face and perhaps some of the dread too waiting for release he heard a sound behind him too soft to be quaid unless he was creeping oh god unless he was a pad of chloroformed cloth was clamped over steves mouth and his nostrils involuntarily he inhaled and the vapours stung his sinuses made his eyes water a blob of blackness appeared at the corner of the world just out of sight and it started to grow this stain pulsing to the rhythm of his quickening heart in the centre of steves head he could see quaids voice as a veil it said his name stephen again ephen phen hen en the stain was the world the world was dark gone away out of sight out of mind steve fell clumsily amongst the photographs when he woke up he was unaware of his consciousness there was darkness everywhere on all sides he lay awake for an hour with his eyes wide before he realized they were open experimentally he moved first his arms and his legs then his head he wasnt bound as hed expected except by his ankle there was definitely a chain or something similar around his left ankle it chafed his skin when he tried to move too far the floor beneath him was very uncomfortable and when he investigated it more closely with the palm of his hand he realized he was lying on a huge grille or grid of some kind it was metal and its regular surface spread in every direction as far as his arms would reach when he poked his arm down through the holes in this lattice he touched nothing just empty air falling away beneath him the first infrared photographs quaid took of stephens confinement pictured his exploration as quaid had expected the subject was being quite rational about his situation no hysterics no curses no tears that was the challenge of this particular subject he knew precisely what was going on and he would respond logically to his fears that would surely make a more difficult mind to break than cheryls but how much more rewarding the results would be when he did crack would his soul not open up then for quaid to see and touch there was so much there in the mans interior he wanted to study gradually steves eyes became accustomed to the darkness he was imprisoned in what appeared to be some kind of shaft it was he estimated about twenty feet wide and completely round was it some kind of airshaft for a tunnel or an underground factory steves mind mapped the area around pilgrim street trying to pinpoint the most likely place for quaid to have taken him he could think of nowhere nowhere he was lost in a place he couldnt fix or recognize the shaft had no corners to focus his eyes on and the walls offered no crack or hole to hide his consciousness in worse he was lying spreadeagled on a grid that hung over this shaft his eyes could make no impression on the darkness beneath him it seemed that the shaft might be bottomless and there was only the thin network of the grill and the fragile chain that shackled his ankle to it between him and falling he pictured himself poised under an empty black sky and over an infinite darkness the air was warm and stale it dried up the tears that had suddenly sprung to his eyes leaving them gummy when he began to shout for help which he did after the tears had passed the darkness ate his words easily having yelled himself hoarse he lay back on the lattice he couldnt help but imagine that beyond his frail bed the darkness went on forever it was absurd of course nothing goes on forever he said aloud nothing goes on forever and yet hed never know if he fell in the absolute blackness beneath him hed fall and fall and fall and not see the bottom of the shaft coming though he tried to think of brighter more positive images his mind conjured his body cascading down this horrible shaft with the bottom a foot from his hurtling body and his eyes not seeing it his brain not predicting it until he hit would he see light as his head was dashed open on impact would he understand in the moment that his body became offal why hed lived and died then he thought quaid wouldnt dare wouldnt dare he screeched wouldnt dare the dark was a glutton for words as soon as hed yelled into it it was as though hed never made a sound and then another thought a real baddie suppose quaid had found this circular hell to put him in because it would never be found never be investigated maybe he wanted to take his experiment to the limits to the limits death was at the limits and wouldnt that be the ultimate experiment for quaid watching a man die watching the fear of death the mother lode of dread approach sartre had written that no man could ever know his own death but to know the deaths of others intimately to watch the acrobatics that the mind would surely perform to avoid the bitter truth that was a clue to deaths nature wasnt it that might in some small way prepare a man for his own death to live anothers dread vicariously was the safest cleverest way to touch the beast yes he thought quaid might kill me out of his own tenor steve took a sour satisfaction in that thought that quaid the impartial experimenter the wouldbe educator was obsessed with terrors because his own dread ran deepest that was why he had to watch others deal with their fears he needed a solution a way out for himself thinking all this through took hours in the darkness steves mind was quicksilver but uncontrollable he found it difficult to keep one train of argument for very long his thoughts were like fish small fast fish wriggling out of his grasp as soon as he took a hold of them but underlying every twist of thought was the knowledge that he must outplay quaid that was certain he must be calm prove himself a useless subject for quaids analysis the photographs of these hours showed stephen lying with his eyes closed on the grid with a slight frown on his face occasionally paradoxically a smile would flit across his lips sometimes it was impossible to know if he was sleeping or waking thinking or dreaming quaid waited eventually steves eyes began to flicker under his lids the unmistakable sign of dreaming it was time while the subject slept to turn the wheel of the rack steve woke with his hands cuffed together he could see a bowl of water on a plate beside him and a second bowl full of lukewarm unsalted porridge beside it he ate and drank thankfully as he ate two things registered first that the noise of his eating seemed very loud in his head and second that he felt a construction a tightness around his temples the photographs show stephen clumsily reaching up to his head a harness is strapped on to him and locked in place it clamps plugs deep into his ears preventing any sound from getting in the photographs show puzzlement then anger then fear steve was deaf all he could hear were the noises in his head the clicking of his teeth the slush and swallow of his palate the sounds boomed between his ears like guns tears sprang to his eyes he kicked at the grid not hearing the clatter of his heels on the metal bars he screamed until his throat felt as if it was bleeding he heard none of his cries panic began in him the photographs showed its birth his face was flushed his eyes were wide his teeth and gums exposed in a grimace he looked like a frightened monkey all the familiar childhood feelings swept over him he remembered them like the faces of old enemies the chittering limbs the sweat the nausea in desperation he picked up the bowl of water and upturned it over his face the shock of the cold water diverted his mind momentarily from the panicladder it was climbing he lay back down on the grid his body a board and told himself to breathe deeply and evenly relax relax relax he said aloud in his head he could hear his tongue clicking he could hear his mucus too moving sluggishly in the panicconstricted passages of his nose blocking and unblocking in his ears now he could detect the low soft hiss that waited under all the other noises the sound of his mind it was like the white noise between stations on the radio this was the same whine that came to fetch him under anaesthetic the same noise that would sound in his ears on the borders of sleep his limbs still twitched nervously and he was only halfaware of the way he wrestled with his handcuffs indifferent to their edges scouring the skin at his wrists the photographs recorded all these reactions precisely his war with hysteria his pathetic attempts to keep the fears from resurfacing his tears his bloody wrists eventually exhaustion won over panic as it had so often as a child how many times had he fallen asleep with the salttaste of tears in his nose and mouth unable to fight any longer the exertion had heightened the pitch of his headnoises now instead of a lullaby his brain whistled and whooped him to sleep oblivion was good quaid was disappointed it was clear from the speed of his response that stephen grace was going to break very soon indeed in fact he was as good as broken only a few hours into the experiment and quaid had been relying on stephen after months of preparing the ground it seemed that this subject was going to lose his mind without giving up a single clue one word one miserable word was all quaid needed a little sign as to the nature of the experience or better still something to suggest a solution a healing totem a prayer even surely some saviour comes to the lips as the personality is swept away in madness there must be something quaid waited like a carrion bird at the site of some atrocity counting the minutes left to the expiring soul hoping for a morsel steve woke face down on the grid the air was much staler now and the metal bars bit into the flesh of his cheek he was hot and uncomfortable he lay still letting his eyes become accustomed to his surroundings again the lines of the grid ran off in perfect perspective to meet the wall of the shaft the simple network of crisscrossed bars struck him as pretty yes pretty he traced the lines back and forth til he tired of the game bored he rolled over onto his back feeling the grid vibrate under his body was it less stable now it seemed to rock a little as he moved hot and sweaty steve unbuttoned his shirt there was sleepspittle on his chin but he didnt care to wipe it off what if he drooled who was to see he half pulled off his shirt and using one foot kicked his shoe off the other shoe lattice fall sluggishly his mind made the connection he sat up oh poor shoe his shoe would fall it would slip between the bars and be lost but no it was finely balanced across two sides of a latticehole he could still save it if he tried he reached for his poor poor shoe and his movement shifted the grid the shoe began to slip please he begged it dont fall he didnt want to lose his nice shoe his pretty shoe it mustnt fall it mustnt fall as he stretched to snatch it the shoe tipped heel down through the grid and fell into the darkness he let out a cry of loss that he couldnt hear oh if only he could listen to the shoe falling to count the seconds of its descent to hear it thud home at the bottom of the shaft at least then hed know how far he had to fall to his death he couldnt endure it any longer he rolled over on to his stomach and thrust both arms through the grid screaming ill go too ill go too he couldnt bear waiting to fall in the dark in the whining silence he just wanted to follow his shoe down down down the dark shaft to extinction and have the whole game finished once and for all ill go ill go ill go he shrieked he pleaded with gravity beneath him the grid moved something had broken a pin a chain a rope that held the grid in position had snapped he was no longer horizontal already he was sliding across the bars as they tipped him off into the dark with shock he realized his limbs were no longer chained he would fall the man wanted him to fall the bad man what was his name quake quail quarrel automatically he seized the grid with both hands as it tipped even further over maybe he didnt want to fall after his shoe after all maybe life a little moment more of life was worth holding on to the dark beyond the edge of the grid was so deep and who could guess what lurked in it in his head the noises of his panic multiplied the thumping of his bloody heart the stutter of his mucus the dry rasp of his palate his palms slick with sweat were losing their grip gravity wanted him it demanded its rights of his bodys bulk demanded that he fall for a moment glancing over his shoulder at the mouth that opened under him he thought he saw monsters stirring below him ridiculous loony things crudely drawn dark on dark vile graffiti leered up from his childhood and uncurled their claws to snatch at his legs mama he said as his hands failed him and he was delivered into dread mama that was the word quaid heard it plainly in all its banality mama by the time steve hit the bottom of the shaft he was past judging how far hed fallen the moment his hands let go of the grid and he knew the dark would have him his mind snapped the animal self survived to relax his body saving him all but minor injury on impact the rest of his life all but the simplest responses were shattered the pieces flung into the recesses of his memory when the light came at last he looked up at the person in the mickey mouse mask at the door and smiled at him it was a childs smile one of thankfulness for his comical rescuer he let the man take him by the ankles and haul him out of the big round room in which he was lying his pants were wet and he knew hed dirtied himself in his sleep still the funny mouse would kiss him better his head lolled on his shoulders as he was dragged out of the torturechamber on the floor beside his head was a shoe and seven or eight feet above him was the grid from which he had fallen it meant nothing at all he let the mouse sit him down in a bright room he let the mouse give him his ears back though he didnt really want them it was funny watching the world without sound it made him laugh he drank some water and ate some sweet cake he was tired he wanted to sleep he wanted his mama but the mouse didnt seem to understand so he cried and kicked the table and threw the plates and cups on the floor then he ran into the next room and threw all the papers he could find in the air it was nice watching them flutter up and flutter down some of them fell face down some face up some were covered with writing some were pictures horrid pictures pictures that made him feel very strange they were all pictures of dead people every one of them some of the pictures were of little children others were of grownup children they were lying down or halfsitting and there were big cuts in their faces and their bodies cuts that showed a mess underneath a mishmash of shiny bits and oozy bits and all around the dead people black paint not in neat puddles but splashed all around and fingermarked and handprinted and very messy in three or four of the pictures the thing that made the cuts was still there he knew the word for it axe there was an axe in a ladys face buried almost to the handle there was an axe in a mans leg and another lying on the floor of a kitchen beside a dead baby this man collected pictures of dead people and axes which steve thought was strange that was his last thought before the toofamiliar scent of chloroform filled his head and he lost consciousness the sordid doorway smelt of old urine and fresh vomit it was his own vomit it was all over the front of his shirt he tried to stand up but his legs felt wobbly it was very cold his throat hurt then he heard footsteps it sounded like the mouse was coming back maybe hed take him home get up son it wasnt the mouse it was a policeman what are you doing down there i said get up bracing himself against the crumbling brick of the doorway steve got to his feet the policeman shone his torch at him jesus christ said the policeman disgust written over his face youre in a right fucking state where do you live steve shook his head staring down at his vomitsoaked shirt like a shamed schoolboy whats your name he couldnt quite remember name lad he was trying if only the policeman wouldnt shout come on take a hold of yourself the words didnt make much sense steve could feel tears pricking the backs of his eyes home now he was blubbering sniffing snot feeling utterly forsaken he wanted to die he wanted to lie down and die the policeman shook him you high on something he demanded pulling steve into the glare of the streetlights and staring at his tearstained face youd better move on mama said steve i want my mama the words changed the encounter entirely suddenly the policeman found the spectacle more than disgusting more than pitiful this little bastard with his bloodshot eyes and his dinner down his shirt was really getting on his nerves too much money too much dirt in his veins too little discipline mama was the last straw he punched steve in the stomach a neat sharp functional blow steve doubled up whimpering shut up son another blow finished the job of crippling the child and then he took a fistful of steves hair and pulled the little druggys face up to meet his you want to be a derelict is that it no no steve didnt know what a derelict was he just wanted to make the policeman like him please he said tears coming again take me home the policeman seemed confused the kid hadnt started fighting back and calling for civil rights the way most of them did that was the way they usually ended up on the ground bloodynosed calling for a social worker this one just wept the policeman began to get a bad feeling about the kid like he was mental or something and hed beaten the shit out of the little snot fuck it now he felt responsible he took hold of steve by the arm and bundled him across the road to his car get in take me ill take you home son ill take you home at the night hostel they searched steves clothes for some kind of identification found none then scoured his body for fleas his hair for nits the policeman left him then which steve was relieved about he hadnt liked the man the people at the hostel talked about him as though he wasnt in the room talked about how young he was discussed his mentalage his clothes his appearance then they gave him a bar of soap and showed him the showers he stood under the cold water for ten minutes and dried himself with a stained towel he didnt shave though theyd lent him a razor hed forgotten how to do it then they gave him some old clothes which he liked they werent such bad people even if they did talk about him as though he wasnt there one of them even smiled at him a burly man with a grizzled beard smiled as he would at a dog they were odd clothes he was given either too big or too small all colours yellow socks dirty white shirt pinstripe trousers that had been made for a glutton a threadbare sweater heavy boots he liked dressing up putting on two vests and two pairs of socks when they werent looking he felt reassured with several thicknesses of cotton and wool wrapped around him then they left him with a ticket for his bed in his hand to wait for the dormitories to be unlocked he was not impatient like some of the men in the corridors with him they yelled incoherently many of them their accusations laced with obscenities and they spat at each other it frightened him all he wanted was to sleep to lie down and sleep at eleven oclock one of the warders unlocked the gate to the dormitory and all the lost men filed through to find themselves an iron bed for the night the dormitory which was large and badlylit stank of disinfectant and old people avoiding the eyes and the flailing arms of the other derelicts steve found himself an illmade bed with one thin blanket tossed across it and lay down to sleep all around him men were coughing and muttering and weeping one was saying his prayers as he lay staring at the ceiling on his grey pillow steve thought that was a good idea so he said his own childs prayer gentle jesus meek and mild look upon this little child pity my what was the word pity my simplicity suffer me to come to thee that made him feel better and the sleep a balm was blue and deep quaid sat in darkness the terror was on him again worse than ever his body was rigid with fear so much so that he couldnt even get out of bed and snap on the light besides what if this time this time of all times the tenor was true what if the axeman was at the door in flesh and blood grinning like a loon at him dancing like the devil at the top of the stairs as quaid had seen him in dreams dancing and grinning grinning and dancing nothing moved no creak of the stair no giggle in the shadows it wasnt him after all quaid would live til morning his body had relaxed a little now he swung his legs out of bed and switched on the light the room was indeed empty the house was silent through the open door he could see the top of the stairs there was no axeman of course steve woke to shouting it was still dark he didnt know how long hed been asleep but his limbs no longer ached so badly elbows on his pillow he halfsat up and stared down the dormitory to see what all the commotion was about four bedrows down from his two men were fighting the bone of contention was by no means clear they just grappled with each other like girls screeching and puffing each others hair by moonlight the blood on their faces and hands was black one of them the older of the two was thrust back across his bed screaming i will not go to the finchley road you will not make me dont strike me im not your man im not the other was beyond listening he was too stupid or too mad to understand that the old man was begging to be left alone urged on by spectators on every side the old mans assailant had taken off his shoe and was belabouring his victim with it steve could hear the crack crack of his blows heel on head there were cheers accompanying each strike and lessening cries from the old man suddenly the applause faltered as somebody came into the dormitory steve couldnt see who it was the mass of men crowded around the fight were between him and the door he did see the victor toss his shoe into the air however with a final shout of fucker the shoe steve couldnt take his eyes off the shoe it rose in the air turning as it rose then plummeted to the bare boards like a shot bird steve saw it clearly more clearly than hed seen anything in many days it landed not far from him it landed with a loud thud it landed on its side as his shoe had landed his shoe the one he kicked off on the grid in the room in the house in pilgrim street quaid woke with the same dream always the stairway always him looking down the tunnel of the stairs while that ridiculous sight halfjoke halfhorror tiptoed up towards him a laugh on every step hed never dreamt twice in one night before he swung his hand out over the edge of the bed and fumbled for the bottle he kept there in the dark he swigged from it deeply steve walked past the knot of angry men not caring about their shouts or the old mans groans and curses the warders were having a hard time dealing with the disturbance it was the last time old man crowley would be let in he always invited violence this had all the marks of a nearriot it would take hours to settle them down again nobody questioned steve as he wandered down the corridor through the gate and into the vestibule of the night hostel the swing doors were closed but the night air bitter before dawn smelt refreshing as it seeped in the pokey reception office was empty and through the door steve could see the fireextinguisher hanging on the wall it was red and bright beside it was a long black hose curled up on a red drum like a sleeping snake beside that sitting in two brackets on the wall was an axe a very pretty axe stephen walked into the office a little distance away he heard running feet shouts a whistle but nobody came to interrupt steve as he made friends with the axe first he smiled at it the curve of the blade of the axe smiled back then he touched it the axe seemed to like being touched it was dusty and hadnt been used in a long while too long it wanted to be picked up and stroked and smiled at steve took it out of its brackets very gently and slid it under his jacket to keep warm then he walked back out of the reception office through the swingdoors and out to find his other shoe quaid woke again it took steve a very short time to orient himself there was a spring in his step as he began to make his way to pilgrim street he felt like a clown dressed in so many bright colours in such floppy trousers such silly boots he was a comical fellow wasnt he he made himself laugh he was so comical the wind began to get into him whipping him up into a frenzy as it scooted through his hair and made his eyeballs as cold as two lumps of ice in his sockets he began to run skip dance cavort through the streets white under the lights dark in between now you see me now you dont now you see me now you quaid hadnt been woken by the dream this time this time he had heard a noise definitely a noise the moon had risen high enough to throw its beams through the window through the door and on to the top of the stairs there was no need to put on the light all he needed to see he could see the top of the stairs were empty as ever then the bottom stair creaked a tiny noise as though a breath had landed on it quaid knew dread then another creak as it came up the stairs towards him the ridiculous dream it had to be a dream after all he knew no clowns no axekillers so how could that absurd image the same image that woke him night after night be anything but a dream yet perhaps there were some dreams so preposterous they could only be true no clowns he said to himself as he stood watching the door and the stairway and the spotlight of the moon quaid knew only fragile minds so weak they couldnt give him a clue to the nature to the origin or to the cure for the panic that now held him in thrall all they did was break crumble into dust when faced with the slightest sign of the dread at the heart of life he knew no clowns never had never would then it appeared the face of a fool pale to whiteness in the light of the moon its young features bruised unshaven and puffy its smile open like a childs smile it had bitten its lip in its excitement blood was smeared across its lower jaw and its gums were almost black with blood still it was a clown indisputably a clown even to its illfitting clothes so incongruous so pathetic only the axe didnt quite match the smile it caught the moonlight as the maniac made small chopping motions with it his tiny black eyes glinting with anticipation of the fun ahead almost at the top of the stairs he stopped his smile not faltering for a moment as he gazed at quaids terror quaids legs gave out and he stumbled to his knees the clown climbed another stair skipping as he did so his glittering eyes fixed on quaid filled with a sort of benign malice the axe rocked back and forth in his white hands in a petite version of the killing stroke quaid knew him it was his pupil his guineapig transformed into the image of his own dread him of all men him the deaf boy the skipping was bigger now and the clown was making a deepthroated noise like the call of some fantastical bird the axe was describing wider and wider sweeps in the air each more lethal than the last stephen said quaid the name meant nothing to steve all he saw was the mouth opening the mouth closing perhaps a sound came out perhaps not it was irrelevant to him the throat of the clown gave out a screech and the axe swung up over his head twohanded at the same moment the merry little dance became a run as the axe man leapt the last two stairs and ran into the bedroom full into the spotlight quaids body half turned to avoid the killing blow but not quickly or elegantly enough the blade slit the air and sliced through the back of quaids arm sheering off most of his triceps shattering his humerus and opening the flesh of his lower arm in a gash that just missed his artery quaids scream could have been heard ten houses away except that those houses were rubble there was nobody to hear nobody to come and drag the clown off him the axe eager to be about its business was hacking at quaids thigh now as though it was chopping a log yawning wounds four or five inches deep exposed the shiny steak of the philosophers muscle the bone the marrow with each stroke the clown would tug at the axe to pull it out and quaids body would jerk like a puppet quaid screamed quaid begged quaid cajoled the clown didnt hear a word all he heard was the noise in his head the whistles the whoops the howls the hums he had taken refuge where no rational argument nor threat would ever fetch him out again where the thump of his heart was law and the whine of his blood was music how he danced this deafboy danced like a loon to see his tormentor gaping like a fish the depravity of his intellect silenced forever how the blood spurted how it gushed and fountained the little clown laughed to see such fun there was a nights entertainment to be had here he thought the axe was his friend forever keen and wise it could cut and crosscut it could slice and amputate yet still they could keep this man alive if they were cunning enough alive for a long long while steve was happy as a lamb they had the rest of the night ahead of them and all the music he could possibly want was sounding in his head and quaid knew meeting the clowns vacant stare through an air turned bloody that there was worse in the world than dread worse than death itself there was pain without hope of healing there was life that refused to end long after the mind had begged the body to cease and worst there were dreams come true hells event hell came up to the streets and squares of london that september icy from the depths of the ninth circle too frozen to be warmed even by the swelter of an indian summer it had laid its plans as carefully as ever plans being what they were and fragile this time it was perhaps a little more finicky than usual checking every last detail twice or three times to be certain it had every chance of winning this vital game it had never lacked competitive spirit it had matched life against flesh a thousand thousand times down the centuries sometimes winning more often losing wagers were after all the stuff of its advancement without the human urge to compete to bargain and to bet pandemonium might well have fallen for want of citizens dancing dog racing fiddleplaying it was all one to the gulfs all a game in which it might if it played with sufficient wit garner a soul or two that was why hell came up to london that bright blue day to run a race and to win if it could enough souls to keep it busy with perdition another age cameron tuned his radio the voice of the commentator flared and faded as though he was speaking from the pole instead of st pauls cathedral it was still a good halfhour before the race began but cameron wanted to listen to the warmup commentary just to hear what they were saying about his boy atmosphere is electric probably tens of thousands along the route the voice disappeared cameron cursed and toyed with the dial until the imbecilities reappeared been called the race of the year and what a day it is isnt it jim it certainly is mike thats big jim delaney whos up there in the eye in the sky and hell be following the race along the route giving us a birds eye view wont you jim i certainly will mike well theres a lot of activity behind the line the competitors are all loosening up for the start i can see nick loyer there hes wearing number three and i must say hes looking very fit he said to me when he arrived he didnt usually like to run on sundays but hes made an exception for this race because of course its a charity event and all the proceeds will be going to cancer research joel jones our gold medallist in the metres is here and hell be running against his great rival frank mccloud and besides the big boys weve got a smattering of new faces wearing number five the south african malcolm voight and completing the field lester kinderman who was of course the surprise winner of the marathon in austria last year and i must say they all look fresh as daisies on this superb september afternoon couldnt ask for a better day could we jim joel had woken with bad dreams youll be fine stop fretting cameron had told him but he didnt feel fine he felt sick in the pit of his stomach not prerace nerves he was used to those and he could deal with the feeling two fingers down the throat and throw up that was the best remedy hed found get it over and done with no this wasnt prerace nerves or anything like them it was deeper for a start as though his bowels to his centre to his source were cooking cameron had no sympathy its a charity race not the olympics he said looking the boy over act your age that was camerons technique his mellow voice was made for coaxing but was used to bully without that bullying there would have been no gold medal no cheering crowds no admiring girls one of the tabloids had voted joel the best loved black face in england it was good to be greeted as a friend by people hed never met he liked the admiration however shortlived it might turn out to be they love you said cameron god knows why they love you then he laughed his little cruelty over youll be all right son he said get out and run for your life now in the broad daylight joel looked at the rest of the field and felt a little more buoyant kinderman had stamina but he had no finishing power over middle distance marathon technique was a different skill altogether besides he was so shortsighted he wore wire rimmed glasses so thick they gave him the look of a bemused frog no danger there loyer he was good but this wasnt really his distance either he was a hurdler and a sometime sprinter metres was his limit and even then he wasnt happy voight the south african well there was not much information on him obviously a fit man to judge by the look of him and someone to watch out for just in case he sprung a surprise but the real problem of the race was mccloud joel had run against frank flash mccloud three times twice beaten him into second place once had the positions reversed and frankie boy had a few scores to settle especially the olympics defeat he hadnt liked taking the silver frank was the man to watch charity race or no charity race mccloud would be running his best for the crowd and for his pride he was at the line already testing his starting position his ears practically pricked flash was the man no doubt of it for a moment joel caught voight staring at him unusual that competitors seldom even glanced at each other before a race it was a kind of coyness the mans face was pale and his hairline was receding he looked to be in his early thirties but had a younger leaner physique long legs big hands a body somehow out of proportion to his head when their eyes met voight looked away the fine chain around his neck caught the sun and the crucifix he was wearing glinted gold as it swung gently beneath his chin joel had his goodluck charm with him too tucked into the waistband of his shorts a lock of his mothers hair which she had plaited for him half a decade ago before his first major race she had returned to barbados the following year and died there a great grief an unforgettable loss without cameron he would have crumbled cameron watched the preparations from the steps of the cathedral he planned to see the start then ride his bike round the back of the strand to catch the finish hed arrive well before the competitors and he could keep up with the race on his radio he felt good with the day his boy was in fine shape nausea or no nausea and the race was an ideal way to keep the lad in a competitive mood without overstretching him it was quite a distance of course across ludgate circus along fleet street and past temple bar into the strand then cutting across the corner of trafalgar and down whitehall to the houses of parliament running on tarmac too but it was good experience for joel and it would pressure him a little which was useful there was a distance runner in the boy and cameron knew it hed never been a sprinter he couldnt pace himself accurately enough he needed distance and time to find his pulse to settle down and to work out his tactics over metres the boy was a natural his stride was a model of economy his rhythm damnnear perfect but more he had courage courage had won him the gold and courage would take him first to the finish again and again thats what made joel different any number of technical whizzkids came and went but without courage to supplement those skills they went for almost nothing to risk when it was worth risking to run til the pain blinded you that was special and cameron knew it he liked to think hed had a little of it himself today the boy looked less than happy women trouble was camerons bet there were always problems with women especially with the golden boy reputation joel had garnered hed tried to explain that thered be plenty of time for bed and bawd when his career had run out of steam but joel wasnt interested in celibacy and cameron didnt altogether blame him the pistol was raised and fired a plume of bluewhite smoke followed by a sound more pop than bang the shot woke the pigeons from the dome of st pauls and they rose in a chattering congregation their worship interrupted joel was off to a good start clean neat and fast the crowd began to call his name immediately their voices at his back at his side a gale of loving enthusiasm cameron watched the first two dozen yards as the field jockeyed for a running order loyer was at the front of the pack though cameron wasnt sure whether hed got there by choice or chance joel was behind mccloud who was behind loyer no hurry boy said cameron and slipped away from the starting line his bicycle was chained up in paternoster row a minutes walk from the square hed always hated cars godless things crippling inhuman unchristian things with a bike you were your own master wasnt that all a man could ask and its a superb start here to what looks like a potentially marvellous race theyre already across the square and the crowds going wild here it really is more like the european games than a charity race what does it look like to you jim well mike i can see crowds lining the route all the way along fleet street and ive been asked by the police to tell people please not to try and drive down to see the race because of course all these roads have been cleared for the event and if you try and drive really youll get nowhere whos got the lead at the moment well nick loyer is really setting the pace at this stage in the game though of course as we know theres going to be a lot of tactical running over this kind of distance its more than a middledistance and its less than a marathon but these men are all tacticians and theyll each be trying to let the other make the running in the early stages cameron always said let the others be heroes that was a hard lesson to learn joel had found when the pistol was fired it was difficult not to go for broke unwind suddenly like a tight spring all gone in the first two hundred yards and nothing left in reserve its easy to be a hero cameron used to say its not clever its not clever at all dont waste your time showing off just let the supermen have their moment hang on to the pack but hold back a little better to be cheered at the post because you won than have them call you a goodhearted loser win win win at all costs at almost all costs win the man who doesnt want to win is no friend of mine hed say if you want to do it for the love of it for the sport of it do it with somebody else only public schoolboys believe that crap about the joy of playing the game theres no joy for losers boy what did i say theres no joy for losers be barbaric play the rules but play them to the limit as far as you can push push let no other sonofabitch tell you differently youre here to win what did i say win in paternoster row the cheering was muted and the shadows of the buildings blocked the sun it was almost cold the pigeons still passed over unable to settle now theyd been roused from their roost they were the only occupants of the back streets the rest of the living world it seemed was watching this race cameron unlocked his bicycle pocketed the chain and padlocks and hopped on pretty healthy for a fifty year old he thought despite the addiction to cheap cigars he switched on the radio reception was bad walled in by the buildings all crackle he stood astride his bike and tried to improve the tuning it did a little good and nick loyer is falling behind already that was quick mind you loyer was past his prime by two or three years time to throw in the spikes and let the younger men take over hed had to do it though my god it had been painful cameron remembered acutely how hed felt at thirtythree when he realized that his best running years were over it was like having one foot buried in the grave a salutary reminder of how quickly the body blooms and begins to wither as he pedaled out of the shadows into a sunnier street a black mercedes chauffeurdriven sailed past so quietly it could have been windpropelled cameron caught sight of the passengers only briefly one he recognized as a man voight had been talking with before the race a thin faced individual of about forty with a mouth so tight his lips might have been surgically removed beside him sat voight impossible as it seemed it was voights face that glanced back out of the smoked glass windows he was even dressed for the race cameron didnt like the look of this at all hed seen the south african five minutes earlier off and running so who was this a double obviously it smelt of a fix somehow it stank to high heaven the mercedes was already disappearing around a corner cameron turned off the radio and pedaled pellmell after the car the balmy sun made him sweat as he rode the mercedes was threading its way through the narrow streets with some difficulty ignoring all the one way signs as it went its slow passage made it relatively easy for cameron to keep the vehicle in view without being seen by its occupants though the effort was beginning to light a fire in his lungs in a tiny nameless alley just west of fetter lane where the shadows were particularly dense the mercedes stopped cameron hidden from view round a corner not twenty yards from the car watched as the door was opened by the chauffeur and the lipless man with the voight lookalike close behind stepped out and went into a nondescript building when all three had disappeared cameron propped his bike up against the wall and followed the street was pindrop hushed from this distance the roar of the crowd was only a murmur it could have been another world this street the flitting shadows of birds the windows of the buildings bricked up the peeling paint the rotten smell in the still air a dead rabbit lay in the gutter a black rabbit with a white collar someones lost pet flies rose and fell on it alternately startled and ravenous cameron crept towards the open door as quietly as he was able he had as it turned out nothing to fear the trio had disappeared down the dark hallway of the house long since the air was cool in the hall and smelt of damp looking fearless but feeling afraid cameron entered the blind building the wallpaper in the hallway was shitcoloured the paint the same it was like walking into a bowel a dead mans bowel cold and shitty ahead the stairway had collapsed preventing access to the upper storey they had not gone up but down the door to the cellar was adjacent to the defunct staircase and cameron could hear voices from below no time like the present he thought and opened the door sufficiently to squeeze into the dark beyond it was icy not just cold not damp but refrigerated for a moment he thought hed stepped into a cold storage room his breath became a mist at his lips his teeth wanted to chatter cant turn back now he thought and started down the frostslick steps it wasnt impossibly dark at the bottom of the flight a long way down a pale light flickered its uninspired glow aspiring to the day cameron glanced longingly round at the open door behind him it looked extremely tempting but he was curious so curious there was nothing to do but descend in his nostrils the scent of the place teased he had a lousy sense of smell and a worse palate as his wife was fond of reminding him shed say he couldnt distinguish between garlic and a rose and it was probably true but the smell in this deep meant something to him something that stirred the acid in his belly into life goats it smelt ha he wanted to tell her then and there how hed remembered it smelt of goats he was almost at the bottom of the stairs twenty maybe thirty feet underground the voices were still some distance away behind a second door he was standing in a little chamber its walls badly whitewashed and scrawled with obscene graffiti mostly pictures of the sexact on the floor a candelabra seven forked only two of the dingy candles were lit and they burned with a guttering flame that was almost blue the goaty smell was stronger now and mingled with a scent so sicklysweet it belonged in a turkish brothel two doors led off the chamber and from behind one cameron heard the conversation continuing with scrupulous caution he crossed the slippery floor to the door straining to make sense of the murmuring voices there was an urgency in them hurry the right skills children children laughter i believe we tomorrow all of us laughter again suddenly the voices seemed to change direction as if the speakers were moving back towards the door cameron took three steps back across the icy floor almost colliding with the candelabra the flames spat and whispered in the chamber as he passed he had to choose either the stairs or the other door the stairs represented utter retreat if he climbed them hed be safe but he would never know never know why the cold why the blue flames why the smell of goats the door was a chance back to it his eyes on the door opposite he fought with the bitingly cold brass handle it turned with some tussling and he ducked out of sight as the door opposite opened the two movements were perfectly syncopated god was with him even as he closed the door he knew hed made an error god wasnt with him at all needles of cold penetrated his head his teeth his eyes his fingers he felt as though hed been thrown naked into the heart of an iceberg his blood seemed to stand still in his veins the spit on his tongue crystallized the mucus on the lining of his nose pricked as it turned to ice the cold seemed to cripple him he couldnt even turn round barely able to move his joints he fumbled for his cigarette lighter with fingers so numb they could have been cut off without him feeling it the lighter was already glued to his hand the sweat on his fingers had turned to frost he tried to ignite it against the dark against the cold reluctantly it sparked into a spluttering halflife the room was large an icecavern its walls its encrusted roof sparkled and shone stalactites of ice lancesharp hung over his head the floor on which he stood poised uncertainly was raked towards a hole in the middle of the room five or six feet across its edges and walls were so lined with ice it seemed as though a river had been arrested as it poured down into the darkness he thought of xanadu a poem he knew by heart visions of another albion where aiph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea if there was indeed a sea down there it was a frozen sea it was death forever it was as much as he could do to keep upright to prevent himself from sliding down the incline towards the unknown the lighter flickered as an icy air blew it out shit said cameron as he was plunged into darkness whether the word alerted the trio outside or whether god deserted him totally at that moment and invited them to open the door he would never know but as the door swung wide it pushed cameron off his feet too numb and too frozen to prevent his fall he collapsed to the ice floor as the smell of the goat wafted into the room cameron half turned voights double was at the door as was the chauffeur and the third man in the mercedes he wore a coat apparently made of several goatskins the hooves and the horns still hung from it the blood on its fur was brown and gummy what are you doing here mr cameron asked the goatcoated man cameron could barely speak the only feeling left in his head was a pinpoint of agony in the middle of his forehead what the hell is going on he said through lips almost too frozen to move precisely that mr cameron the man replied hell is going on as they ran past st marylestrand loyer glanced behind him and stumbled joel a full three metres behind the leaders knew the man was giving up so quickly too there was something amiss he slackened his pace letting mccloud and voight pass him no great hurry kinderman was quite a way behind unable to compete with these fast boys he was the tortoise in this race for sure loyer was overtaken by mccloud then voight and finally jones and kinderman his breath had suddenly deserted him and his legs felt like lead worse he was seeing the tarmac under his running shoes creaking and cracking and fingers like loveless children seeking up out of the ground to touch him nobody else was seeing them it seemed the crowds just roared on while these illusory hands broke out of their tarmac graves and secured a hold on him he collapsed into their dead arms exhausted his youth broken and his strength spent the enquiring fingers of the dead continued to pluck at him long after the doctors had removed him from the track examined him and sedated him he knew why of course lying there on the hot tarmac while they had their pricking way with him hed looked behind him thats what had made them come hed looked and after loyers sensational collapse the race is open wide frank the flash mccloud is setting the pace now and hes really speeding away from the new boy voight joel jones is even further behind he doesnt seem to be keeping up with the leaders at all what do you think jim well hes either pooped already or hes really taking a chance that theyll exhaust themselves remember hes new over this distance yes jim and that might make him careless certainly hes going to have to do a lot of work to improve on his present position in third place joel felt giddy for a moment as hed watched loyer begin to lose his grip on the race hed heard the man praying out loud praying to god to save him hed been the only one who heard the words yea though i walk through the shadows of the valley of death i shall fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they the sun was hotter now and joel was beginning to feel the familiar voices of his tiring limbs running on tarmac was hard on the feet hard on the joints not that that would make a man take to praying he tried to put loyers desperation out of his mind and concentrate on the matter in hand there was still a lot of running to do the race was not even half over plenty of time to catch up with the heroes plenty of time as he ran his brain idly turned over the prayers his mother had taught him in case he should need one but the years had eroded them they were all but gone my name said the goatcoated man is gregory burgess member of parliament you wouldnt know me i try to keep a low profile mp said cameron yes independent very independent is that voights brother burgess glanced at voights other self he was not even shivering in the intense cold despite the fact that he was only wearing a thin singlet and shorts brother burgess said no no he is my what is the word familiar the word rang a bell but cameron wasnt wellread what was a familiar show him said burgess magnanimously voights face shook the skin seeming to shrivel the lips curling back from the teeth the teeth melting into a white wax that poured down a gullet that was itself transfiguring into a column of shimmering silver the face was no longer human no longer even mammalian it had become a fan of knives their blades glistening in the candlelight through the door even as this bizarrerie became fixed it started to change again the knives melting and darkening fur sprouting eyes appearing and swelling to balloon size antennae leapt from this new head mandibles were extruded from the pulp of transfiguration and the head of a bee huge and perfectly intricate now sat on voights neck burgess obviously enjoyed the display he applauded with gloved hands familiars both he said gesturing to the chauffeur who had removed the cap and let a welter of auburn hair fall to her shoulders she was ravishingly beautiful a face to give your life for but an illusion like the other no doubt capable of infinite personae theyre both mine of course said burgess proudly what was all cameron could manage he hoped it stood for all the questions in his head i serve hell mr cameron and in its turn hell serves me hell behind you one of the entrances to the ninth circle you know your dante i presume lo dis and lo the place where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength why are you here to run this race or rather my third familiar is already running the race he will not be beaten this time this time it is hells event mr cameron and we shall not be cheated of the prize hell said cameron again you believe dont you youre a good churchgoer still pray before you eat like any godfearing soul afraid of choking on your dinner how do you know i pray your wife told me oh your wife was very informative about you mr cameron she really opened up to me very accommodating a confirmed analyst after my attentions she gave me so much information youre a good socialist arent you like your father politics now oh politics is the hub of the issue mr cameron without politics were lost in a wilderness arent we even hell needs order nine great circles a pecking order of punishments look down see for yourself cameron could feel the hole at his back he didnt need to look we stand for order you know not chaos thats just heavenly propaganda and you know what well win its a charity race charity is the least of it were not running this race to save the world from cancer were running it for government cameron halfgrasped the point government he said once every century this race is run from st pauls to the palace of westminster often it has been run at the dead of night unheralded unapplauded today it is run in full sunshine watched by thousands but whatever the circumstance it is always the same race your athletes against one of ours if you win another hundred years of democracy if we win as we will the end of the world as you know it at his back cameron felt a vibration the expression on burgess face had abruptly changed the confidence had become clouded the smugness was instantly replaced by a look of nervous excitement well well he said his hands flapping like birds it seems we are about to be visited by higher powers how flattering cameron turned and peered over the edge of the hole it didnt matter how curious he was now they had him he may as well see all there was to see a wave of icy air blew up from the sunless circle and in the darkness of the shaft he could see a shape approaching its movement was steady and its face was thrown back to look at the world cameron could hear its breathing see the wound of its features open and close in the murk oily bone locking and unlocking like the face of a crab burgess was on his knees the two familiars flat on the floor to either side of him faces to the ground cameron knew he would have no other chance he stood up his limbs hardly in his control and blundered towards burgess whose eyes were closed in reverent prayer more by accident than intention his knee caught burgess under the jaw as he passed and the man was sent sprawling camerons soles slid on the floor out of the icecavern and into the candlelit chamber beyond behind him the room was filling with smoke and sighs and cameron like lots wife fleeing from the destruction of sodom glanced back just once to see the forbidden sight behind him it was emerging from the shaft its grey bulk filling the hole lit by some radiance from below its eyes deepset in the naked bone of its elephantine head met camerons through the open door they seemed to touch him like a kiss entering his thoughts through his eyes he was not turned to salt pulling his curious glance away from the face he skated across the antechamber and started to climb the stairs two and three at a time falling and climbing falling and climbing the door was still ajar beyond it daylight and the world he flung the door open and collapsed into the hallway feeling the warmth already beginning to wake his frozen nerves there was no noise on the stairs behind him clearly they were too in awe of their fleshless visitor to follow him he hauled himself along the wall of the hallway his body wracked with shivers and chatterings still they didnt follow outside the day was blindingly bright and he began to feel the exhilaration of escape it was like nothing hed ever felt before to have been so close yet survived god had been with him after all he staggered along the road back to his bicycle determined to stop the race to tell the world his bike was untouched its handlebars warm as his wifes arms as he hooked his leg over the look he had exchanged with hell caught fire his body ignorant of the heat in his brain continued about its business for a moment putting its feet on the pedals and starting to ride away cameron felt the ignition in his head and knew he was dead the look the glance behind him lots wife like lots stupid wife the lightning leapt between his ears faster than thought his skull cracked and the lightning whitehot shot out from the furnace of his brain his eyes withered to black nuts in his sockets he belched light from mouth and nostrils the combustion turned him into a column of black flesh in a matter of seconds without a flame or a wisp of smoke camerons body was completely incinerated by the time the bicycle careered off the road and crashed through the tailors shop window where it lay like a dummy face down amongst the ashen suits he too had looked back the crowds at trafalgar square were a seething mass of enthusiasm cheers tears and flags it was as though this little race had become something special for these people a ritual the significance of which they could not know yet somewhere in them they understood the day was laden with sulphur they sensed their lives stood on tiptoe to reach heaven especially the children they ran along the route shouting incoherent blessings their faces squeezed up with their fears some called his name joel joel or did he imagine that had he imagined too the prayer from loyers lips and the signs in the radiant faces of the babies held high to watch the runners pass as they turned into whitehall frank mccloud glanced confidentially over his shoulder and hell took him it was sudden it was simple he stumbled an icy hand in his chest crushing the life out of him joel slowed as he approached the man his face was purple his lips foamy mccloud he said and stopped to stare in his great rivals thin face mccloud looked up at him from behind a veil of smoke that had turned his grey eyes ochre joel reached down to help him dont touch me mccloud growled the filament vessels in his eyes bulged and bled cramp asked joel is it cramp run you bastard run mccloud was saying at him as the hand in his innards seized his life out he was oozing blood through the pores on his face now weeping red tears run and dont look back for christs sake dont look back what is it run for your life the words werent requests but imperatives run not for gold or glory just to live joel glanced up suddenly aware that there was some hugeheaded thing at his back cold breath on his neck he picked up his heels and ran well things arent going so well for the runners here jim after loyer going down so sensationally now frank mccloud has stumbled too ive never seen anything quite like it but he seems to have had a few words with joel jones as he ran past so he must be ok mccloud was dead by the time they put him in the ambulance and putrefied by the following morning joel ran jesus did he run the sun had become ferocious in his face washing the colour out of the cheering crowds out of the faces out of the flags everything was one sheet of noise drained of humanity joel knew the feeling that was coming over him the sense of dislocation that accompanied fatigue and overoxygenation he was running in a bubble of his own consciousness thinking sweating suffering by himself for himself in the name of himself and it wasnt so bad this being alone songs began to fill his head snatches of hymns sweet phrases from love songs dirty rhymes his self idled and his dreammind unnamed and fearless took over ahead washed by the same white rain of light was voight that was the enemy that was the thing to be surpassed voight with his shining crucifix rocking in the sun he could do it as long as he didnt look as long as he didnt look behind him burgess opened the door of the mercedes and climbed in time had been wasted valuable time he should be at the houses of parliament at the finishing line ready to welcome the runners home there was a scene to play in which he would pretend the mild and smiling face of democracy and tomorrow not so mild his hands were clammy with excitement and his pinstripe suit smelt of the goatskin coat he was obliged to wear in the room still nobody would notice and even if they did what englishman would be so impolite to mention that he smelt goaty he hated the lower chamber the perpetual ice that damn yawning hole with its distant sound of loss but all that was over now hed made his oblations hed shown his utter and ceaseless adoration of the pit now it was time to reap the rewards as they drove he thought of his many sacrifices to ambition at first minor stuff kittens and cockerels later he was to discover how ridiculous they thought such gestures were but at the beginning hed been innocent not knowing what to give or how to give it they began to make their requirements clear as the years went by and he in time learnt to practice the etiquette of selling his soul his self mortifications were studiously planned and immaculately staged though they had left him without nipples or the hope of children it was worth the pain though the power came to him by degrees a triple first at oxford a wife endowed beyond the dreams of priapism a seat in parliament and soon soon enough the country itself the cauterized stumps of his thumbs ached as they often did when he was nervous idly he sucked on one well were now in the closing stages of what really has been one hell of a race eh jim oh yes its really been a revelation hasnt it voight is really the outsider of the field and here he is streaking away from the competition without much effort of course jones made the unselfish gesture of checking with frank mccloud that he was indeed all right after that bad fall of his and that put him behind its lost the race for jones really hasnt it i think thats right i think it lost the race for him this is a charity race of course absolutely and in a situation like this its not whether you win or lose its how you play the game right right well theyre both in sight of the houses of parliament now as they come round the bend of whitehall and the crowds are cheering their boy on but i really think its a lost cause mind you he brought something special out of the bag in sweden he did he did maybe hell do it again joel ran and the gap between himself and voight was beginning to close he concentrated on the mans back his eyes boring into his shirt learning his rhythm looking for weaknesses there was a slowing there the man was not as fast as he had been an unevenness had crept into his stride a sure sign of fatigue he could take him with courage he could take him and kinderman hed forgotten about kinderman without thinking joel glanced over his shoulder and looked behind him kinderman was way back still keeping his steady marathon runners pace unchanged but there was something else behind joel another runner almost on his heels ghostly vast he averted his eyes and stared ahead cursing his stupidity he was gaining on voight with every pace the man was really running out of steam quite clearly joel knew he could take him for certain if he worked at it forget his pursuer whatever it was forget everything except overtaking voight but the sight at his back wouldnt leave his head dont look back mcclouds words too late hed done it better to know then who this phantom was he looked again at first he saw nothing just kinderman jogging along and then the ghost runner appeared once more and he knew what had brought mccloud and loyer down it was no runner living or dead it wasnt even human a smoky body and yawning darkness for its head it was hell itself that was pressing on him dont look back its mouth if mouth it was was open breath so cold it made joel gasp swirled around him that was why loyer had muttered prayers as he ran much good it had done him death had come anyway joel looked away not caring to see hell so close trying to ignore the sudden weakness in his knees now voight too was glancing behind him the look on his face was dark and uneasy and joel knew somehow that he belonged to hell that the shadow behind him was voights master voight voight voight voight joel expelled the word with every stride voight heard his name being spoken black bastard he said aloud joels stride lengthened a little he was within two metres of hells runner look behind you said voight i see it its come for you the words were mere melodrama twodimensional he was master of his body wasnt he and he was not afraid of darkness he was painted in it wasnt that what made him less than human as far as so many people were concerned or more more than human bloodier sweatier fleshier more arm more leg more head more strength more appetite what could hell do eat him hed taste foul on the palate freeze him he was too hotblooded too fast too living nothing would take him he was a barbarian with the manners of a gentleman neither night nor day entirely voight was suffering his pain was in his torn breath in the gangling rags of his stride they were just fifty metres from the steps and the finishing line but voights lead was being steadily eroded each step brought the runners closer then the bargains began listen to me what are you power ill get you power just let us win joel was almost at his side now too late his legs elated his mind spun with pleasure hell behind him hell beside him what did he care he could run he passed voight joints fluent an easy machine bastard bastard bastard the familiar was saying his face contorted with the agonies of stress and didnt that face flicker as joel passed it by didnt its features seem to lose momentarily the illusion of being human then voight was falling behind him and the crowds were cheering and the colours were flooding back into the world it was victory ahead he didnt know for what cause but victory nevertheless there was cameron he saw him now standing on the steps beside a man joel didnt know a man in a pinstripe suit cameron was smiling and shouting with uncharacteristic enthusiasm beckoning to joel from the steps he ran if anything a little faster towards the finishing line his strength coaxed by camerons face then the face seemed to change was it the heat haze that made his hair shimmer no the flesh of his cheeks was bubbling now and there were dark patches growing darker still on his neck at his forehead now his hair was rising from his head and cremating light was flickering up from his scalp cameron was burning cameron was burning and still the smile and still the beckoning hand joel felt sudden despair hell behind hell in front this wasnt cameron cameron was nowhere to be seen so cameron was gone he knew it in his gut cameron was gone and this black parody that smiled at him and welcomed him was his last moments replayed for the delight of his admirers joels step faltered the rhythm of his stride lost at his back he heard voights breath horridly thick close closer his whole body suddenly revolted his stomach demanded to throw up its contents his legs cried out to collapse his head refused to think only to fear run he said to himself run run run but hell was ahead how could he run into the arms of such foulness voight had closed the gap between them and was at his shoulder jostling him as he passed the victory was being snatched from joel easily sweets from a babe the finishing line was a dozen strides away and voight had the lead again scarcely aware of what he was doing joel reached out and snatched at voight as he ran grabbing his singlet it was a cheat clear to everybody in the crowd but what the hell he pulled hard at voight and both men stumbled the crowd parted as they veered off the track and fell heavily voight on top of joel joels arm flung out to prevent him falling too heavily was crushed under the weight of both bodies caught badly the bone of his forearm cracked joel heard it snap a moment before he felt the spasm then the pain threw a cry out of his mouth on the steps burgess was screeching like a wild man quite a performance cameras were snapping commentators commenting get up get up the man was yelling but joel had snatched voight with his one good arm and nothing was going to make him let go the two rolled around in the gravel every roll crushing joels arm and sending spurts of nausea through his gut the familiar playing voight was exhausted it had never been so tired unprepared for the stress of the race its master had demanded it run its temper was short its control perilously close to snapping joel could smell its breath on his face and it was the smell of a goat show yourself he said the things eyes had lost their pupils they were all white now joel hawked up a clot of phlegm from the back of his thickspittled mouth and spat it in the familiars face its temper broke the face dissolved what had seemed to be flesh sprouted into a new resemblance a devouring trap without eyes or nose or ears or hair all around the crowd shrank back people shrieked people fainted joel saw none of this but heard the cries with satisfaction this transformation was not just for his benefit it was common knowledge they were seeing it all the truth the filthy gaping truth the mouth was huge and lined with teeth like the maw of some deepwater fish ridiculously large joels one good arm was under its lower jaw just managing to keep it at bay as he cried for help nobody stepped forward the crowd stood at a polite distance still screaming still staring unwilling to interfere it was purely a spectator sport wrestling with the devil nothing to do with them joel felt the last of his strength falter his arm could keep the mouth at bay no longer despairing he felt the teeth at his brow and at his chin felt them pierce his flesh and his bone felt finally the white night invade him as the mouth bit off his face the familiar rose up from the corpse with strands of joels head hanging out from between its teeth it had taken off the features like a mask leaving a mess of blood and jerking muscle in the open hole of joels mouth the root of his tongue flapped and spurted past speaking sorrow burgess didnt care how he appeared to the world the race was everything a victory was a victory however it was won and jones had cheated after all here he yelled to the familiar heel it turned its bloodstrung face to him come here burgess ordered it they were only a few yards apart a few strides to the line and the race was won run to me burgess screeched run run run the familiar was weary but it knew its masters voice it loped towards the line blindly following burgess calls four paces three and kinderman ran past it to the line shortsighted kinderman a pace ahead of voight took the race without knowing the victory he had won without even seeing the horrors that were sprawled at his feet there were no cheers as he passed the line no congratulations the air around the steps seemed to darken and an unseasonal frost appeared in the air shaking his head apologetically burgess fell to his knees our father who wert in heaven unhallowed be thy name such an old trick such a naпve response the crowd began to back away some people were already running children knowing the nature of the dark having been so recently touched by it were the least troubled they took their parents hands and led them away from the spot like lambs telling them not to look behind them and their parents halfremembered the womb the first tunnel the first aching exit from a hallowed place the first terrible temptation to look behind and die remembering they went with their children only kinderman seemed untouched he sat on the steps and cleaned his glasses smiling to have won indifferent to the chill burgess knowing his prayers were insufficient turned tail and disappeared into the palace of westminster the familiar deserted relinquished all claim to human appearance and became itself insolid insipid it spat out the foultasting flesh of joel jones half chewed the runners face lay on the gravel beside his body the familiar folded itself into the air and went back to the circle it called home it was stale in the corridors of power no life no help burgess was out of condition and his running soon became a walk a steady step along the gloompanelled corridors his feet almost silent on the well trodden carpet he didnt quite know what to do clearly he would be blamed for his failure to plan against all eventualities but he was confident he could argue his way out of that he would give them whatever they required as recompense for his lack of foresight an ear a foot he had nothing to lose but flesh and blood but he had to plan his defence carefully because they hated bad logic it was more than his life was worth to come before them with halfformed excuses there was a chill behind him he knew what it was hell had followed him along these silent corridors even into the very womb of democracy he would survive though as long as he didnt turn round as long as he kept his eyes on the floor or on his thumbless hands no harm would come to him that was one of the first lessons one learnt dealing with the gulfs there was a frost in the air burgess breath was visible in front of him and his head was aching with cold im sorry he said sincerely to his pursuer the voice that came back to him was milder than hed expected it wasnt your fault no said burgess taking confidence from its conciliatory tone it was an error and i am contrite i overlooked kinderman that was a mistake we all make them said hell still in another hundred years well try again democracy is still a new cult its not lost its superficial glamour yet well give it another century and have the best of them then yes but you i know no power for you gregory no its not the end of the world look at me not at the moment if you dont mind burgess kept walking steady step upon steady step keep it calm keep it rational look at me please hell cooed later sir im only asking you to look at me a little respect would be appreciated i will i will really later the corridor divided here burgess took the lefthand fork he thought the symbolism might flatter it was a culdesac burgess stood still facing the wall the cold air was in his marrow and the stumps of his thumbs were really giving him jip he took off his gloves and sucked hard look at me turn and look at me said the courteous voice what was he to do now back out of the corridor and find another way was best presumably hed just have to walk around and around in circles until hed argued his point sufficiently well for his pursuer to leave him be as he stood juggling the alternatives available to him he felt a slight ache in his neck look at me the voice said again and his throat was constricted there was strangely a grinding in his head the sound of bone rasping bone it felt like a knife was lodged in the base of his skull look at me hell said one final time and burgess head turned not his body that stayed standing facing the blank wall of the culdesac but his head cranked around on its slender axis disregarding reason and anatomy burgess choked as his gullet twisted on itself like a flesh rope his vertebrae screwed to powder his cartilage to fibre mush his eyes bled his ears popped and he died looking at that sunless unbegotten face i told you to look at me said hell and went its bitter way leaving him standing there a fine paradox for the democrats to find when they came bustling with words into the palace of westminster jacqueline ess her will and testement my god she thought this cant be living day in day out the boredom the drudgery the frustration my christ she prayed let me out set me free crucify me if you must but put me out of my misery in lieu of his euthanasian benediction she took a blade from bens razor one dull day in late march locked herself in the bathroom and slit her wrists through the throbbing in her ears she faintly heard ben outside the bathroom door are you in there darling go away she thought she said im back early sweetheart the traffic was light please go away the effort of trying to speak slid her off the toilet seat and on to the whitetiled floor where pools of her blood were already cooling darling go darling away are you all right now he was rattling at the door the rat didnt he realize she couldnt open it wouldnt open it answer me jackie she groaned she couldnt stop herself the pain wasnt as terrible as shed expected but there was an ugly feeling as though shed been kicked in the head still he couldnt catch her in time not now not even if he broke the door down he broke the door down she looked up at him through an air grown so thick with death you could have sliced it too late she thought she said but it wasnt my god she thought this cant be suicide i havent died the doctor ben had hired for her was too perfectly benign only the best hed promised only the very best for my jackie its nothing the doctor reassured her that we cant put right with a little tinkering why doesnt he just come out with it she thought he doesnt give a damn he doesnt know what its like i deal with a lot of these womens problems he confided fairly oozing a practiced compassion its got to epidemic proportions among a certain agebracket she was barely thirty what was he telling her that she was prematurely menopausal depression partial or total withdrawal neuroses of every shape and size youre not alone believe me oh yes i am she thought im here in my head on my own and you cant know what its like well have you right in two shakes of a lambs tail im a lamb am i does he think im a lamb musing he glanced up at his framed qualifications then at his manicured nails then at the pens on his desk and notepad but he didnt look at jacqueline anywhere but at jacqueline i know he was saying now what youve been through and its been traumatic women have certain needs if they go unanswered what would he know about womens needs youre not a woman she thought what he said had she spoken she shook her head denying speech he went on finding his rhythm once more im not going to put you through interminable therapysessions you dont want that do you you want a little reassurance and you want something to help you sleep at nights he was irritating her badly now his condescension was so profound it had no bottom allknowing allseeing father that was his performance as if he were blessed with some miraculous insight into the nature of a womans soul of course ive tried therapy courses with patients in the past but between you and me he lightly patted her hand fathers palm on the back of her hand she was supposed to be flattered reassured maybe even seduced between you and me its so much talk endless talk frankly what good does it do weve all got problems you cant talk them away can you youre not a woman you dont look like a woman you dont feel like a woman did you say something she shook her head i thought you said something please feel free to be honest with me she didnt reply and he seemed to tire of pretending intimacy he stood up and went to the window i think the best thing for you he stood against the light darkening the room obscuring the view of the cherry trees on the lawn through the window she stared at his wide shoulders at his narrow hips a fine figure of a man as ben would have called him no childbearer he made to remake the world a body like that if not the world remaking minds would have to do i think the best thing for you what did he know with his hips with his shoulders he was too much a man to understand anything of her i think the best thing for you would be a course of sedatives now her eyes were on his waist and a holiday her mind had focused now on the body beneath the veneer of his clothes the muscle bone and blood beneath the elastic skin she pictured it from all sides sizing it up judging its powers of resistance then closing on it she thought be a woman simply as she thought that preposterous idea it began to take shape not a fairytale transformation unfortunately his flesh resisted such magic she willed his manly chest into making breasts of itself and it began to swell most fetchingly until the skin burst and his sternum flew apart his pelvis teased to breaking point fractured at its centre unbalanced he toppled over on to his desk and from there stared up at her his face yellow with shock he licked his lips over and over again to find some wetness to talk with his mouth was dry his words were stillborn it was from between his legs that all the noise was coming the splashing of his blood the thud of his bowel on the carpet she screamed at the absurd monstrosity she had made and withdrew to the far corner of the room where she was sick in the pot of the rubber plant my god she thought this cant be murder i didnt so much as touch him what jacqueline had done that afternoon she kept to herself no sense in giving people sleepless nights thinking about such peculiar talent the police were very kind they produced any number of explanations for the sudden departure of dr blandish though none quite described how his chest had erupted in that extraordinary fashion making two handsome domes of his pectorals it was assumed that some unknown psychotic strong in his insanity had broken in done the deed with hands hammers and saws and exited locking the innocent jacqueline ess in an appalled silence no interrogation could hope to penetrate person or persons unknown had clearly dispatched the doctor to where neither sedatives nor therapy could help him she almost forgot for a while but as the months passed it came back to her by degrees like a memory of a secret adultery it teased her with its forbidden delights she forgot the nausea and remembered the power she forgot sordidity and remembered strength she forgot the guilt that had seized her afterwards and longed longed to do it again only better jacqueline is this my husband she thought actually calling me by my name usually it was jackie or jack or nothing at all jacqueline he was looking at her with those big baby blues of his like the collegeboy shed loved at first sight but his mouth was harder now and his kisses tasted like stale bread jacqueline yes ive got something i want to speak to you about a conversation she thought it must be a public holiday i dont know how to tell you this try me she suggested she knew that she could think his tongue into speaking if it pleased her make him tell her what she wanted to hear words of love maybe if she could remember what they sounded like but what was the use of that better the truth darling ive gone off the rails a bit what do you mean she said have you you bastard she thought it was while you werent quite yourself you know when things had more or less stopped between us separate rooms you wanted separate rooms and i just went bananas with frustration i didnt want to upset you so i didnt say anything but its no use me trying to live two lives you can have an affair if you want to ben its not an affair jackie i love her he was preparing one of his speeches she could see it gathering momentum behind his teeth the justifications that became accusations those excuses that always turned into assaults on her character once he got into full flow thered be no stopping him she didnt want to hear shes not like you at all jackie shes frivolous in her way i suppose youd call her shallow it might be worth interrupting here she thought before he ties himself in his usual knots shes not moody like you you know shes just a normal woman i dont mean to say youre not normal you cant help having depressions but shes not so sensitive theres no need ben no damn it i want it all off my chest on to me she thought youve never let me explain he was saying youve always given me one of those damn looks of yours as if you wished id die wished id shut up shut up you dont care how i feel he was shouting now always in your own little world shut up she thought his mouth was open she seemed to wish it closed and with the thought his jaws snapped together severing the very tip of his pink tongue it fell from between his lips and lodged in a fold of his shirt shut up she thought again the two perfect regiments of his teeth ground down into each other cracking and splitting nerve calcium and spit making a pinkish foam on his chin as his mouth collapsed inwards shut up she was still thinking as his startled baby blues sank back into his skull and his nose wormed its way into his brain he was not ben any longer he was a man with a red lizards head flattening battening down upon itself and thank god he was past speechmaking once and for all now she had the knack of it she began to take pleasure in the changes she was willing upon him she flipped him head over heels on to the floor and began to compress his arms and legs telescoping flesh and resistant bone into a smaller and yet smaller space his clothes were folded inwards and the tissue of his stomach was plucked from his neatly packaged entrails and stretched around his body to wrap him up his fingers were poking from his shoulderblades now and his feet still thrashing with fury were tripped up in his gut she turned him over one final time to pressure his spine into a footlong column of muck and that was about the end of it as she came out of her ecstasy she saw ben sitting on the floor shut up into a space about the size of one of his fine leather suitcases while blood bile and lymphatic fluid pulsed weakly from his hushed body my god she thought this cant be my husband hes never been as tidy as that this time she didnt wait for help this time she knew what shed done and she accepted her crime for the toorough justice it was she packed her bags and left the home im alive she thought for the first time in my whole wretched life im alive vassis testimony to you who dream of sweet strong women i leave this story it is a promise as surely as it is a confession as surely as its the last words of a lost man who wanted nothing but to love and be loved i sit here trembling waiting for the night waiting for that whining pimp koos to come to my door again and take everything i own from me in exchange for the key to her room i am not a courageous man and i never have been so im afraid of what may happen to me tonight but i cannot go through life dreaming all the time existing through the darkness on only a glimpse of heaven sooner or later one has to gird ones loins and get up and find it even if it means giving away the world in exchange i probably make no sense youre thinking you who chanced on this testimony youre thinking who was he this imbecile my name was oliver vassi i am now thirtyeight years old i was a lawyer until a year or more ago when i began the search that ends tonight with that pimp and that key and that holy of holies but the story begins more than a year ago it is many years since jacqueline ess first came to me she arrived out of the blue at my offices claiming to be the widow of a friend of mine from law school one benjamin ess and when i thought back i remembered the face a mutual friend whod been at the wedding had shown me a photograph of ben and his blushing bride and here she was every bit as elusive a beauty as her photograph promised i remember being acutely embarrassed at that first interview shed arrived at a busy time and i was up to my neck in work but i was so enthralled by her i let all the days interviews fall by the wayside and when my secretary came in she gave me one of her steely glances as if to throw a bucket of cold water over me i suppose i was enamoured from the start and she sensed the electric atmosphere in my office me i pretended i was merely being polite to the widow of an old friend i didnt like to think about passion it wasnt a part of my nature or so i thought how little we know i mean really know about our capabilities jacqueline told me lies at that first meeting about how ben had died of cancer of how often he had spoken of me and how fondly i suppose she could have told me the truth then and there and i would have lapped it up i believe i was utterly devoted from the beginning but its difficult to remember quite how and when interest in another human being flares into something more committed more passionate it may be that i am inventing the impact she had on me at that first meeting simply reinventing history to justify my later excesses im not sure anyway wherever and whenever it happened however quickly or slowly i succumbed to her and the affair began im not a particularly inquisitive man where my friends or my bedpartners are concerned as a lawyer one spends ones time going through the dirt of other peoples lives and frankly eight hours a day of that is quite enough for me when im out of the office my pleasure is in letting people be i dont pry i dont dig i just take them on face value jacqueline was no exception to this rule she was a woman i was glad to have in my life whatever the truth of her past she possessed a marvellous sangfroid she was witty bawdy oblique i had never met a more enchanting woman it was none of my business how shed lived with ben what the marriage had been like etc etc that was her history i was happy to live in the present and let the past die its own death i think i even flattered myself that whatever pain she had experienced i could help her forget it certainly her stories had holes in them as a lawyer i was trained to be eagleeyed where fabrications were concerned and however much i tried to put my perceptions aside i sensed that she wasnt quite coming clean with me but everyone has secrets i knew that let her have hers i thought only once did i challenge her on a detail of her pretended lifestory in talking about bens death she let slip that he had got what he deserved i asked her what she meant she smiled that gioconda smile of hers and told me that she felt there was a balance to be redressed between men and women i let the observation pass after all i was obsessed by that time past all hope of salvation whatever argument she was putting i was happy to concede it she was so beautiful you see not in any two dimensional sense she wasnt young she wasnt innocent she didnt have that pristine symmetry so favoured by admen and photographers her face was plainly that of a woman in her early forties it had been used to laugh and cry and usage leaves its marks but she had a power to transform herself in the subtlest way making that face as various as the sky early on i thought it was a makeup trick but as we slept together more and more and i watched her in the mornings sleep in her eyes and in the evenings heavy with fatigue i soon realized she wore nothing on her skull but flesh and blood what transformed her was internal it was a trick of the will and you know that made me love her all the more then one night i woke with her sleeping beside me we slept often on the floor which she preferred to the bed beds she said reminded her of marriage anyway that night she was lying under a quilt on the carpet of my room and i simply out of adoration was watching her face in sleep if one has given oneself utterly watching the beloved sleep can be a vile experience perhaps some of you have known that paralysis staring down at features closed to your enquiry locked away from you where you can never ever go into the others mind as i say for us who have given ourselves that is a horror one knows in those moments that one does not exist except in relation to that face that personality therefore when that face is closed down that personality is lost in its own unknowable world one feels completely without purpose a planet without a sun revolving in darkness thats how i felt that night looking down at her extraordinary features and as i chewed on my soullessness her face began to alter she was clearly dreaming but what dreams must she have been having her very fabric was on the move her muscle her hair the down on her cheek moving to the dictates of some internal tide her lips bloomed from her bone boiling up into a slavering tower of skin her hair swirled around her head as though she were lying in water the substance of her cheeks formed furrows and ridges like the ritual scars on a warrior inflamed and throbbing patterns of tissue swelling up and changing again even as a pattern formed this fluxion was a terror to me and i must have made some noise she didnt wake but came a little closer to the surface of sleep leaving the deeper waters where these powers were sourced the patterns sank away in an instant and her face was again that of a gently sleeping woman that was you can understand a pivotal experience even though i spent the next few days trying to convince myself that i hadnt seen it the effort was useless i knew there was something wrong with her and at that time i was certain she knew nothing about it i was convinced that something in her system was awry and that i was best to investigate her history before i told her what i had seen on reflection of course that seems laughably naive to think she wouldnt have known that she contained such a power but it was easier for me to picture her as prey to such skill than mistress of it thats a man speaking of a woman not just me oliver vassi of her jacqueline ess we cannot believe we men that power will ever reside happily in the body of a woman unless that power is a male child not true power the power must be in male hands godgiven thats what our fathers tell us idiots that they are anyway i investigated jacqueline as surreptitiously as i could i had a contact in york where the couple had lived and it wasnt difficult to get some enquiries moving it took a week for my contact to get back to me because hed had to cut through a good deal of shit from the police to get a hint of the truth but the news came and it was bad ben was dead that much was true but there was no way he had died of cancer my contact had only got the vaguest clues as to the condition of bens corpse but he gathered it had been spectacularly mutilated and the prime suspect my beloved jacqueline ess the same innocent woman who was occupying my flat sleeping by my side every night so i put it to her that she was hiding something from me i dont know what i was expecting in return what i got was a demonstration of her power she gave it freely without malice but i would have been a fool not to have read a warning into it she told me first how she had discovered her unique control over the sum and substance of human beings in her despair she said when she was on the verge of killing herself she had found in the very deepwater trenches of her nature faculties she had never known existed powers which came up out of those regions as she recovered like fish to the light then she showed me the smallest measure of these powers plucking hairs from my head one by one only a dozen just to demonstrate her formidable skills i felt them going she just said one from behind your ear and id feel my skin creep and then jump as fingers of her volition snatched a hair out then another and another it was an incredible display she had this power down to a fine art locating and withdrawing single hairs from my scalp with the precision of tweezers frankly i was sitting there rigid with fear knowing that she was just toying with me sooner or later i was certain the time would be right for her to silence me permanently but she had doubts about herself she told me how the skill though she had honed it scared her she needed she said someone to teach her how to use it best and i was not that somebody i was just a man who loved her who had loved her before this revelation and would love her still in spite of it in fact after that display i quickly came to accommodate a new vision of jacqueline instead of fearing her i became more devoted to this woman who tolerated my possession of her body my work became an irritation a distraction that came between me and thinking of my beloved what reputation i had began to deteriorate i lost briefs i lost credibility in the space of two or three months my professional life dwindled away to almost nothing friends despaired of me colleagues avoided me it wasnt that she was feeding on me i want to be clear about that she was no lamia no succubus what happened to me my fall from grace with ordinary life if you like was of my own making she didnt bewitch me thats a romantic lie to excuse rape she was a sea and i had to swim in her does that make any sense id lived my life on the shore in the solid world of law and i was tired of it she was liquid a boundless sea in a single body a deluge in a small room and i will gladly drown in her if she grants me the chance but that was my decision understand that this has always been my decision i have decided to go to the room tonight and be with her one final time that is of my own free will and what man would not she was sublime for a month after that demonstration of power i lived in a permanent ecstasy of her when i was with her she showed me ways to love beyond the limits of any other creature on gods earth i say beyond the limits with her there were no limits and when i was away from her the reverie continued because she seemed to have changed my world then she left me i knew why shed gone to find someone to teach her how to use strength but understanding her reasons made it no easier i broke down lost my job lost my identity lost the few friends i had left in the world i scarcely noticed they were minor losses beside the loss of jacqueline jacqueline my god she thought can this really be the most influential man in the country he looked so unprepossessing so very unspectacular his chin wasnt even strong but titus penifer was power he ran more monopolies than he could count his word in the financial world could break companies like sticks destroying the ambitions of hundreds the careers of thousands fortunes were made overnight in his shadow entire corporations fell when he blew on them casualties of his whim this man knew power if any man knew it he had to be learned from you wouldnt mind if i called you j would you no have you been waiting long long enough i dont normally leave beautiful women waiting yes you do she knew him already two minutes in his presence was enough to find his measure he would come quickest to her if she was quietly insolent do you always call women youve never met before by their initials its convenient for filing do you mind it depends on what what i get in return for giving you the privilege its a privilege is it to know your name yes well im flattered unless of course you grant that privilege widely she shook her head no he could see she wasnt profligate with her affections why have you waited so long to see me he said why have i had reports of your wearing my secretaries down with your constant demands to meet with me do you want money because if you do youll go away emptyhanded i became rich by being mean and the richer i get the meaner i become the remark was truth he spoke it plainly i dont want money she said equally plainly thats refreshing theres richer than you he raised his eyebrows in surprise she could bite this beauty true he said there were at least half a dozen richer men in the hemisphere im not an adoring little nobody i havent come here to screw a name ive come here because we can be together we have a great deal to offer each other such as he said i have my body he smiled it was the straightest offer hed heard in years and what do i offer you in return for such largesse i want to learn learn how to use power she was stranger and stranger this one what do you mean he replied playing for time he hadnt got the measure of her she vexed him confounded him shall i recite it for you again in bourgeois she said playing insolence with such a smile he almost felt attractive again no need you want to learn to use power i suppose i could teach you i know you can you realize im a married man virginia and i have been together eighteen years you have three sons four houses a maidservant called mirabelle you loathe new york and you love bangkok your shirt collar is ѕ your favourite colour green turquoise youre getting subtler in your old age im not old eighteen years a married man it ages you prematurely not me prove it how take me what take me here draw the blinds lock the door turn off the computer terminal and take me i dare you dare how long was it since anyone had dared him to do anything dare he was excited he hadnt been so excited in a dozen years he drew the blinds locked the door turned off the video display of his fortunes my god she thought ive got him it wasnt an easy passion not like that with vassi for one thing pettifer was a clumsy uncultured lover for another he was too nervous of his wife to be a wholly successful adulterer he thought he saw virginia everywhere in the lobbies of the hotels they took a room in for the afternoon in cabs cruising the street outside their rendezvous once even dressed as a waitress and swabbing down a table in a restaurant all fictional fears but they dampened the spontaneity of the romance somewhat still she was learning from him he was as brilliant a potentate as he was inept a lover she learned how to be powerful without exercising power how to keep ones self uncontaminated by the foulness all charisma stirs up in the uncharismatic how to make the plain decisions plainly how to be merciless not that she needed much education in that particular quarter perhaps it was more truthful to say he taught her never to regret her absence of instinctive compassion but to judge with her intellect alone who deserved extinction and who might be numbered amongst the righteous not once did she show herself to him though she used her skills in the most secret of ways to tease pleasure out of his stale nerves in the fourth week of their affair they were lying side by side in a lilac room while the midafternoon traffic growled in the street below it had been a bad bout of sex he was nervous and no tricks would coax him out of himself it was over quickly almost without heat he was going to tell her something she knew it it was waiting this revelation somewhere at the back of his throat turning to him she massaged his temples with her mind and soothed him into speech he was about to spoil the day he was about to spoil his career he was about god help him to spoil his life i have to stop seeing you he said he wouldnt dare she thought im not sure what i know about you or rather what i think i know about you but it makes me cautious of you j do you understand no im afraid i suspect you of crimes crimes you have a history whos been rooting she asked surely not virginia no not virginia shes beyond curiosity who then its not your business who she pressed lightly on his temples it hurt him and he winced whats wrong she asked my heads aching tension thats all just tension i can take it away titus she touched her fingers to his forehead relaxing her hold on him he sighed as relief came is that better yes whos been snooping titus i have a personal secretary lyndon youve heard me speak of him he knew about our relationship from the beginning indeed he books the hotels arranges my cover stories for virginia there was a sort of boyishness in this speech that was rather touching as though he was embarrassed to leave her rather than heartbroken lyndons quite a miracleworker hes maneuvered a lot of things to make it easier between us so hes got nothing against you its just that he happened to see one of the photographs i took of you i gave them to him to shred why i shouldnt have taken them it was a mistake virginia might have he paused began again anyhow he recognized you although he couldnt remember where hed seen you before but he remembered eventually he used to work for one of my newspapers as a gossip columnist thats how he came to be my personal assistant he remembered you from your previous incarnation as it were jacqueline ess the wife of benjamin ess deceased deceased he brought me some other photographs not as pretty as the ones of you photographs of what your home and the body of your husband they said it was a body though in gods name there was precious little human being left in it there was precious little to start with she said simply thinking of bens cold eyes and colder hands fit only to be shut up and forgotten what happened to ben he was killed how did his voice waver a little very easily she had risen from the bed and was standing by the window strong summer light carved its way through the slats of the blind ridges of shadow and sunlight charting the contours of her face you did it yes he had taught her to be plain yes i did it he had taught her an economy of threat too leave me and ill do the same again he shook his head never you wouldnt dare he was standing in front of her now we must understand each other j i am powerful and i am pure do you see my public face isnt even touched by a glimmer of scandal i could afford a mistress a dozen mistresses to be revealed but a murderess no that would spoil my life is he blackmailing you this lyndon he stared at the day through the blinds with a crippled look on his face there was a twitch in the nerves of his cheek under his left eye yes if you must know he said in a dead voice the bastard has me for all im worth i see and if he can guess so can others you understand im strong youre strong we can twist them around our little fingers no yes i have skills titus i dont want to know you will know she said she looked at him taking hold of his hands without touching him he watched all astonished eyes as his unwilling hands were raised to touch her face to stroke her hair with the fondest of gestures she made him run his trembling fingers across her breasts taking them with more ardour than he could summon on his own initiative you are always too tentative titus she said making him paw her almost to the point of bruising this is how i like it now his hands were lower fetching out a different look from her face tides were moving over it she was all alive deeper his finger intruded his thumb stroked i like that titus why cant you do that to me without me demanding he blushed he didnt like to talk about what they did together she coaxed him deeper whispering i wont break you know virginia may be dresden china im not i want feeling i want something that i can remember you by when im not with you nothing is everlasting is it but i want something to keep me warm through the night he was sinking to his knees his hands kept by her design on her and in her still roving like two lustful crabs his body was awash with sweat it was she thought the first time shed ever seen him sweat dont kill me he whimpered i could wipe you out wipe she thought then put the image out of her mind before she did him some harm i know i know he said you can kill me easily he was crying my god she thought the great man is at my feet sobbing like a baby what can i learn of power from this puerile performance she plucked the tears off his cheeks using rather more strength than the task required his skin reddened under her gaze let me be j i cant help you im useless to you it was true he was absolutely useless contemptuously she let his hands go they fell limply by his sides dont ever try and find me titus you understand dont ever send your minions after me to preserve your reputation because i will be more merciless than youve ever been he said nothing just knelt there facing the window while she washed her face drank the coffee theyd ordered and left lyndon was surprised to find the door of his office ajar it was only seventhirtysix none of the secretaries would be in for another hour clearly one of the cleaners had been remiss leaving the door unlocked hed find out who sack her he pushed the door open jacqueline was sitting with her back to the door he recognized the back of her head that fall of auburn hair a sluttish display too teased too wild his office an annex to mr pettifers was kept meticulously ordered he glanced over it everything seemed to be in place what are you doing here she took a little breath preparing herself this was the first time she had planned to do it before it had been a spurofthemoment decision he was approaching the desk and putting down his briefcase and his neatlyfolded copy of the financial times you have no right to come in here without my permission he said she turned on the lazy swivel of his chair the way he did when he had people in to discipline lyndon she said nothing you can say or do will change the facts mrs ess he said saving her the trouble of introducing the subject you are a coldblooded killer it was my bounden duty to inform mr pettifer of the situation you did it for the good of titus of course and the blackmail that was also for the good of titus was it get out of my office was it lyndon youre a whore whores know nothing they are ignorant diseased animals he spat oh youre cunning i grant you that but then sos any slut with a living to make she stood up he expected a riposte he got none at least not verbally but he felt a tautness across his face as though someone was pressing on it what are you doing he said doing his eyes were being forced into slits like a child imitating a monstrous oriental his mouth was hauled wide and tight his smile brilliant the words were difficult to say stopit she shook her head whore he said again still defying her she just stared at him his face was beginning to jerk and twitch under the pressure the muscles going into spasm the police he tried to say if you lay a finger on me i wont she said and pressed home her advantage beneath his clothes he felt the same tension all over his body pulling his skin drawing him tighter and tighter something was going to give he knew it some part of him would be weak and tear under this relentless assault and if he once began to break open nothing would prevent her ripping him apart he worked all this out quite coolly while his body twitched and he swore at her through his enforced grin cunt he said syphilitic cunt he didnt seem to be afraid she thought in extremis he just unleashed so much hatred of her the fear was entirely eclipsed now he was calling her a whore again though his face was distorted almost beyond recognition and then he began to split the tear began at the bridge of his nose and ran up across his brow and down bisecting his lips and his chin then his neck and chest in a matter of seconds his shirt was dyed red his dark suit darkening further his cuffs and trouserlegs pouring blood the skin flew off his hands like gloves off a surgeon and two rings of scarlet tissue lolled down to either side of his flayed face like the ears of an elephant his namecalling had stopped he had been dead of shock now for ten seconds though she was still working him over vengefully tugging his skin off his body and flinging the scraps around the room until at last he stood steaming in his red suit and his red shirt and his shiny red shoes and looked to her eyes a little more like a sensitive man content with the effect she released him he lay down quietly in a blood puddle and slept my god she thought as she calmly took the stairs out the back way that was murder in the first degree she saw no reports of the death in any of the papers and nothing on the news bulletins lyndon had apparently died as he had lived hidden from public view but she knew wheels so big their hubs could not be seen by insignificant individuals like herself would be moving what they would do how they would change her life she could only guess at but the murder of lyndon had not simply been spite though that had been a part of it no shed also wanted to stir them up her enemies in the world and bring them after her let them show their hands let them show their contempt their terror shed gone through her life it seemed looking for a sign of herself only able to define her nature by the look in others eyes now she wanted an end to that it was time to deal with her pursuers surely now everyone who had seen her pettifer first then vassi would come after her and she would close their eyes permanently make them forgetful of her only then the witnesses destroyed would she be free pettifer didnt come of course not in person it was easy for him to find agents men without scruple or compassion but with a nose for pursuit that would shame a bloodhound a trap was being laid for her though she couldnt yet see its jaws there were signs of it everywhere an eruption of birds from behind a wall a peculiar light from a distant window footsteps whistles darksuited men reading the news at the limit of her vision as the weeks passed they didnt come any closer to her but then neither did they go away they waited like cats in a tree their tails twitching their eyes lazy but the pursuit had pettifers mark shed learned enough from him to recognize his circumspection and his guile they would come for her eventually not in her time but in theirs perhaps not even in theirs in his and though she never saw his face it was as though titus was on her heels personally my god she thought im in danger of my life and i dont care it was useless this power over flesh if it had no direction behind it she had used it for her own petty reasons for the gratification of nervous pleasure and sheer anger but these displays hadnt brought her any closer to other people they just made her a freak in their eyes sometimes she thought of vassi and wondered where he was what he was doing he hadnt been a strong man but hed had a little passion in his soul more than ben more than pettifer certainly more than lyndon and she remembered fondly he was the only man shed ever known who had called her jacqueline all the rest had manufactured unendearing corruptions of her name jackie or j or in bens more irritating moods juju only vassi had called her jacqueline plain and simple accepting in his formal way the completeness of her the totality of her and when she thought of him tried to picture how he might return to her she feared for him vassis testimony of course i searched for her its only when youve lost someone that you realize the nonsense of that phrase its a small world it isnt its a vast devouring world especially if youre alone when i was a lawyer locked in that incestuous coterie i used to see the same faces day after day some id exchange words with some smiles some nods we belonged even if we were enemies at the bar to the same complacent circle we ate at the same tables we drank elbow to elbow we even shared mistresses though we didnt always know it at the time in such circumstances its easy to believe the world means you no harm certainly you grow older but then so does everyone else you even believe in your selfsatisfied way that the passage of years makes you a little wiser life is bearable even the am sweats come more infrequently as the bankbalance swells but to think that the world is harmless is to lie to yourself to believe in socalled certainties that are in fact simply shared delusions when she left all the delusions fell away and all the lies i had assiduously lived by became strikingly apparent its not a small world when theres only one face in it you can bear to look upon and that face is lost somewhere in a maelstrom its not a small world when the few vital memories of your object of affection are in danger of being trampled out by the thousands of moments that assail you every day like children tugging at you demanding your sole attention i was a broken man i would find myself sleeping in tiny bedrooms in forlorn hotels drinking more often than eating and writing her name like a classic obsessive over and over again on the walls on the pillow on the palm of my hand i broke the skin of my palm with my pen and the ink infected it the marks still there im looking at it now jacqueline it says jacqueline then one day entirely by chance i saw her it sounds melodramatic but i thought i was going to die at that moment id imagined her for so long keyed myself up for seeing her again that when it happened i felt my limbs weaken and i was sick in the middle of the street not a classic reunion the lover on seeing his beloved throws up down his shirt but then nothing that happened between jacqueline and myself was ever quite normal or natural i followed her which was difficult there were crowds and she was walking fast i didnt know whether to call out her name or not i decided not what would she have done anyway seeing this unshaven lunatic shambling towards her calling her name she would have run probably or worse she would have reached into my chest seizing my heart in her will and put me out of my misery before i could reveal her to the world so i was silent and simply followed her doggedly to what i assumed was her apartment and i stayed there or in the vicinity for the next two and a half days not quite knowing what to do it was a ridiculous dilemma after all this time of watching for her now that she was within speaking distance touching distance i didnt dare approach maybe i feared death but then here i am in this stinking room in amsterdam setting my testimony down and waiting for koos to bring me her key and i dont fear death now probably it was my vanity that prevented me from approaching her i didnt want her to see me cracked and desolate i wanted to come to her clean her dreamlover while i waited they came for her i dont know who they were two men plainly dressed i dont think policemen too smooth cultured even and she didnt resist she went smilingly as if to the opera at the first opportunity i returned to the building a little better dressed located her apartment from the porter and broke in she had been living plainly in one corner of the room she had set up a table and had been writing her memoirs i sat down and read and eventually took the pages away with me she had got no further than the first seven years of her life i wondered again in my vanity if i would have been chronicled in the book probably not i took some of her clothes too only items she had worn when i had known her and nothing intimate im not a fetishist i wasnt going to go home and bury my face in the smell of her underwear but i wanted something to remember her by to picture her in though on reflection i never met a human being more fitted to dress purely in her skin so i lost her a second time more the fault of my own cowardice than circumstance pettifer didnt come near the house they were keeping mrs ess in for four weeks she was given more or less everything she asked for except her freedom and she only asked for that in the most abstracted fashion she wasnt interested in escape though it would have been easy to achieve once or twice she wondered if titus had told the two men and the woman who were keeping her a prisoner in the house exactly what she was capable of she guessed not they treated her as though she were simply a woman titus had set eyes on and desired they had procured her for his bed simple as that with a room to herself and an endless supply of paper she began to write her memoirs again from the beginning it was late summer and the nights were getting chilly sometimes to warm herself she would lie on the floor and will her body to ripple like the surface of a lake her body without sex became a mystery to her again and she realized for the first time that physical love had been an exploration of that most intimate and yet most unknown region of her being her flesh she had understood herself best embracing someone else seen her own substance clearly only when anothers lips were laid on it adoring and gentle she thought of vassi again and the lake at the thought of him was roused as if by a tempest her breasts shook into curling mountains her belly ran with extraordinary tides currents crossed and recrossed her flickering face lapping at her mouth and leaving their mark like waves on sand as she was fluid in his memory so as she remembered him she liquefied she thought of the few times she had been at peace in her life and physical love discharging ambition and vanity had always preceded those fragile moments there were other ways presumably but her experience had been limited her mother had always said that women being more at peace with themselves than men needed fewer distractions from their hurts but shed not found it like that at all shed found her life full of hurts but almost empty of ways to salve them she left off writing her memoirs when she reached her ninth year she despaired of telling her story from that point on with the first realization of oncoming puberty she burnt the papers on a bonfire she lit in the middle of her room the day that pettifer arrived my god she thought this cant be power pettifer looked sick as physically changed as a friend shed lost to cancer one month seemingly healthy the next sucked up from the inside selfdevoured he looked like a husk of a man his skin grey and mottled only his eyes glittered and those like the eyes of a mad dog he was dressed immaculately as though for a wedding j titus he looked her up and down are you well thank you yes they give you everything you ask for perfect hosts you havent resisted resisted being here locked up i was prepared after lyndon for another slaughter of the innocents lyndon was not innocent titus these people are you didnt tell them i didnt deem it necessary may i close the door he was her captor but he came like an emissary to the camp of a greater power she liked the way he was with her cowed but elated he closed the door and locked it i love you j and i fear you in fact i think i love you because i fear you is that a sickness i would have thought so yes so would i why did you take such a time to come i had to put my affairs in order otherwise there would have been chaos when i was gone youre leaving he looked into her the muscles of his face ruffled by anticipation i hope so where to still she didnt guess what had brought him to the house his affairs neatened his wife unknowingly asked forgiveness of as she slept all channels of escape closed all contradictions laid to rest still she didnt guess hed come to die im reduced by you j reduced to nothing and there is nowhere for me to go do you follow no i cannot live without you he said the clichй was unpardonable could he not have found a better way to say it she almost laughed it was so trite but he hadnt finished and i certainly cant live with you abruptly the tone changed because you revolt me woman your whole being disgusts me so she asked softly so he was tender again and she began to understand kill me it was grotesque the glittering eyes were steady on her its what i want he said believe me its all i want in the world kill me however you please ill go without resistance without complaint she remembered the old joke masochist to sadist hurt me for gods sake hurt me sadist to masochist no and if i refuse she said you cant refuse im loathsome but i dont hate you titus you should im weak im useless to you i taught you nothing you taught me a great deal i can control myself now lyndons death was controlled was it certainly it looked a little excessive to me he got everything he deserved give me what i deserve then in my turn ive locked you up ive rejected you when you needed me punish me for it i survived j even in this extremity he couldnt call her by her full name please to god please to god i need only this one thing from you do it out of whatever motive you have in you compassion or contempt or love but do it please do it no she said he crossed the room suddenly and slapped her very hard lyndon said you were a whore he was right you are gutter slut nothing better he walked away turned walked back hit her again faster harder and again six or seven times backwards and forwards then he stopped panting you want money bargains now blows then bargains she was seeing him twisted through tears of shock which she was unable to prevent do you want money he said again what do you think he didnt hear her sarcasm and began to scatter notes around her feet dozens and dozens of them like offerings around the statue of the virgin anything you want he said jacqueline in her belly she felt something close to pain as the urge to kill him found birth but she resisted it it was playing into his hands becoming the instrument of his will powerless usage again thats all she ever got she had been bred like a cow to give a certain supply of care to husbands of milk to babies of death to old men and like a cow she was expected to be compliant with every demand made of her when ever the call came well not this time she went to the door where are you going she reached for the key your death is your own business not mine she said he ran at her before she could unlock the door and the blow in its force in its malice was totally unexpected bitch he shrieked a hail of blows coming fast upon the first in her stomach the thing that wanted to kill grew a little larger he had his fingers tangled in her hair and pulled her back into the room shouting obscenities at her an endless stream of them as though hed opened a dam full of sewerwater on her this was just another way for him to get what he wanted she told herself if you succumb to this youve lost hes just manipulating you still the words came the same dirty words that had been thrown at generations of unsubmissive women whore heretic cunt bitch monster yes she was that yes she thought monster i am the thought made it easy she turned he knew what she intended even before she looked at him he dropped his hands from her head her anger was already in her throat coming out of her crossing the air between them monster he calls me monster i am i do this for myself not for him never for him for myself he gasped as her will touched him and the glittering eyes stopped glittering for a moment the will to die became the will to survive all too late of course and he roared she heard answering shouts steps threats on the stairs they would be in the room in a matter of moments you are an animal she said no he said certain even now that his place was in command you dont exist she said advancing on him theyll never find the part that was titus titus is gone the rest is just the pain was terrible it stopped even a voice coming out from him or was that her again changing his throat his palate his very head she was unlocking the plates of his skull and reorganizing him no he wanted to say this isnt the subtle ritual i had planned i wanted to die folded into you i wanted to go with my mouth clamped to yours cooling in you as i died this is not the way i want it no no no they were at the door the men whod kept her here beating on it she had no fear of them of course except that they might spoil her handiwork before the final touches were added to it someone was hurling themselves at the door now wood splintered the door was flung open the two men were both armed they pointed their weapons at her steadyhanded mr pettifer said the younger man in the corner of the room under the table pettifers eyes shone mr pettifer he said again forgetting the woman pettifer shook his snouted head dont come any closer please he thought the man crouched down and stared under the table at the disgusting beast that was squatting there bloody from its transformation but alive she had killed his nerves he felt no pajn he just survived his hands knotted into paws his legs scooped up around his back knees broken so he had the look of a fourlegged crab his brain exposed his eyes lidless lower jaw broken and swept up over his top jaw like a bulldog ears torn off spine snapped humanity bewitched into another state you are an animal shed said it wasnt a bad facsimile of beast hood the man with the gun gagged as he recognized fragments of his master he stood up greasychinned and glanced around at the woman jacqueline shrugged you did this awe mingled with the revulsion she nodded come titus she said clicking her fingers the beast shook its head sobbing come titus she said more forcefully and titus pettifer waddled out of his hiding place leaving a trail like a punctured meatsack the man fired at pettifers remains out of sheer instinct anything anything at all to prevent this disgusting creature from approaching him titus stumbled two steps back on his bloody paws shook himself as if to dislodge the death in him and failing died content she asked the gunman looked up from the execution was the power talking to him no jacqueline was staring at pettifers corpse asking the question of him content the gunman dropped his weapon the other man did the same how did this happen asked the man at the door a simple question a childs question he asked said jacqueline it was all i could give him the gunman nodded and fell to his knees vassis testimony chance has played a worryingly large part in my romance with jacqueline ess sometimes its seemed ive been subject to every tide that passes through the world spun around by the merest flick of accidents wrist other times ive had the suspicion that she was masterminding my life as she was the lives of a hundred others a thousand others arranging every fluke meeting choreographing my victories and my defeats escorting me blindly towards this last encounter i found her without knowing id found her that was the irony of it id traced her first to a house in surrey a house that had a year previous seen the murder of one titus pettifer a billionaire shot by one of his own bodyguards in the upstairs room where the murder had taken place all was serenity if she had been there they had removed any sign but the house now in virtual ruin was prey to all manner of graffiti and on the stained plaster wall of that room someone had scrawled a woman she was obscenely overendowed her gaping sex blazing with what looked like lightning and at her feet there was a creature of indeterminate species perhaps a crab perhaps a dog perhaps even a man whatever it was it had no power over itself it sat in the light of her agonizing presence and counted itself amongst the fortunate looking at that wizened creature with its eyes turned up to gaze on the burning madonna i knew the picture was a portrait of jacqueline i dont know how long i stood looking at the graffiti but i was interrupted by a man who looked to be in a worse condition than me a beard that had never been trimmed or washed a frame so wasted i wondered how he managed to stand upright and a smell that would not have shamed a skunk i never knew his name but he was he told me the maker of the picture on the wall it was easy to believe that his desperation his hunger his confusion were all marks of a man who had seen jacqueline if i was rough in my interrogation of him im sure he forgave me it was an unburdening for him to tell everything hed seen the day that pettifer had been killed and know that i believed it all he told me his fellow bodyguard the man who had fifed the shots that had killed pettifer had committed suicide in prison his life he said was meaningless she had destroyed it i gave him what reassurances i could that she meant no harm and that he neednt fear that she would come for him when i told him that he cried more i think out of loss than relief finally i asked him if he knew where jacqueline was now id left that question to the end though it had been the most pressing enquiry because i suppose i didnt dare hope hed know but my god he did she had not left the house immediately after the shooting of pettifer she had sat down with this man and talked to him quietly about his children his tailor his car shed asked him what his mother had been like and hed told her his mother had been a prostitute had she been happy jacqueline had asked hed said he didnt know did she ever cry shed asked hed said he never saw her laugh or cry in his life and shed nodded and thanked him later before his suicide the other gunman had told him jacqueline had gone to amsterdam this he knew for a fact from a man called koos and so the circle begins to close yes i was in amsterdam seven weeks without finding a single clue to her whereabouts until yesterday evening seven weeks of celibacy which is unusual for me listless with frustration i went down to the redlight district to find a woman they sit there you know in the windows like mannequins beside pinkfringed lamps some have miniature dogs on their laps some read most just stare out at the street as if mesmerized there were no faces there that interested me they all seemed joyless lightless too much unlike her yet i couldnt leave i was like a fat boy in a sweet shop too nauseous to buy too gluttonous to go towards the middle of the night i was spoken to out of the crowd by a young man who on closer inspection was not young at all but heavily made up he had no eyebrows just pencil marks drawn on to his shiny skin a cluster of gold earrings in his left ear a halfeaten peach in his whitegloved hand open sandals lacquered toenails he took hold of my sleeve proprietarily i must have sneered at his sickening appearance but he didnt seem at all upset by my contempt you look like a man of discernment he said i looked nothing of the kind you must be mistaken i said no he replied i am not mistaken you are oliver vassi my first thought absurdly was that he intended to kill me i tried to pull away his grip on my cuff was relentless you want a woman he said did i hesitate enough for him to know i meant yes though i said no i have a woman like no other he went on shes a miracle i know youll want to meet her in the flesh what made me know it was jacqueline he was talking about perhaps the fact that he had known me from out of the crowd as though she was up at a window somewhere ordering her admirers to be brought to her like a diner ordering lobster from a tank perhaps too the way his eyes shone at me meeting mine without fear because fear like rapture he felt only in the presence of one creature on gods cruel earth could i not also see myself reflected in his perilous look he knew jacqueline i had no doubt of it he knew i was hooked because once i hesitated he turned away from me with a mincing shrug as if to say you missed your chance where is she i said seizing his twigthin arm he cocked his head down the street and i followed him suddenly as witless as an idiot out of the throng the road emptied as we walked the red lights gave way to gloom and then to darkness if i asked him where we were going once i asked him a dozen times he chose not to answer until we reached a narrow door in a narrow house down some razorthin street were here he announced as though the hovel were the palace of versailles up two flights in the otherwise empty house there was a room with a black door he pressed me to it it was locked see he invited shes inside its locked i replied my heart was fit to burst she was near for certain i knew she was near see he said again and pointed to a tiny hole in the panel of the door i devoured the light through it pushing my eye towards her through the tiny hole the squalid interior was empty except for a mattress and jacqueline she lay spreadeagled her wrists and ankles bound to rough posts set in the bare floor at the four corners of the mattress who did this i demanded not taking my eye from her nakedness she asks he replied it is her desire she asks she had heard my voice she cranked up her head with some difficulty and stared directly at the door when she looked at me all the hairs rose on my head i swear it in welcome and swayed at her command oliver she said jacqueline i pressed the word to the wood with a kiss her body was seething her shaved sex opening and closing like some exquisite plant purple and lilac and rose let me in i said to koos you will not survive one night with her let me in she is expensive he warned how much do you want everything you have the shirt off your back your money your jewellery then she is yours i wanted to beat the door down or break his nicotine stained fingers one by one until he gave me the key he knew what i was thinking the key is hidden he said and the door is strong you must pay mr vassi you want to pay it was true i wanted to pay you want to give me all you have ever owned all you have ever been you want to go to her with nothing to claim you back i know this it s how they all go to her all are there many she is insatiable he said without relish it wasnt a pimps boast it was his pain i saw that clearly i am always finding more for her and burying them burying them that i suppose is koos function he disposes of the dead and he will get his lacquered hands on me after tonight he will fetch me off her when i am dry and useless to her and find some pit some canal some furnace to lose me in the thought isnt particularly attractive yet here i am with all the money i could raise from selling my few remaining possessions on the table in front of me my dignity gone my life hanging on a thread waiting for a pimp and a key its well dark now and hes late but i think he is obliged to come not for the money he probably has few requirements beyond his heroin and his mascara he will come to do business with me because she demands it and he is in thrall to her every bit as much as i am oh he will come of course he will come well i think that is sufficient this is my testimony i have no time to reread it now his footsteps are on the stairs and i must go with him this i leave to whoever finds it to use as they think fit by morning i shall be dead and happy believe it my god she thought koos has cheated me vassi had been outside the door shed felt his flesh with her mind and shed embraced it but koos hadnt let him in despite her explicit orders of all men vassi was to be allowed free access koos knew that but hed cheated her the way theyd all cheated her except vassi with him it had been love she lay on the bed through the night never sleeping she seldom slept now for more than a few minutes and only then with koos watching her shed done herself harm in her sleep mutilating herself without knowing it waking up bleeding and screaming with every limb sprouting needles shed made out of her own skin and muscle like a flesh cactus it was dark again she guessed but it was difficult to be sure in this heavily curtained barebulb lit room it was a perpetual day to the senses perpetual night to the soul she would lie bedsores on her back on her buttocks listening to the far sounds of the street sometimes dozing for a while sometimes eating from koos hand being washed being toileted being used a key turned in the lock she strained from the mattress to see who it was the door was opening opening opened vassi oh god it was vassi at last she could see him crossing the room towards her let this not be another memory she prayed please let it be him this time true and real jacqueline he said the name of her flesh the whole name jacqueline it was him behind him koos stared between her legs fascinated by the dance of her labia koo she said trying to smile i brought him he grinned at her not looking away from her sex a day she whispered i waited a day koos you made me wait whats a day to you he said still grinning she didnt need the pimp any longer not that he knew that in his innocence he thought vassi was just another man shed seduced along the way to be drained and discarded like the others koos believed he would be needed tomorrow thats why he played this fatal game so artlessly lock the door she suggested to him stay if you like stay he said leering you mean and watch he watched anyway she knew he watched through that hole he had bored in the door she could hear him pant sometimes but this time let him stay forever carefully he took the key from the outside of the door closed it slipped the key into the inside and locked it even as the lock clicked she killed him before he could even turn round and look at her again nothing spectacular in the execution she just reached into his pigeon chest and crushed his lungs he slumped against the door and slid down smearing his face across the wood vassi didnt even turn round to see him die she was all he ever wanted to look at again he approached the mattress crouched and began to untie her ankles the skin was chafed the rope scabby with old blood he worked at the knots systematically finding a calm he thought hed lost a simple contentment in being here at the end unable to go back and knowing that the path ahead was deep in her when her ankles were free he began on her wrists interrupting her view of the ceiling as he bent over her his voice was soft why did you let him do this to you i was afraid of what to move even to live every day agony yes he understood so well that total incapacity to exist she felt him at her side undressing then laying a kiss on the sallow skin of the stomach of the body she occupied it was marked with her workings the skin had been stretched beyond its tolerance and was permanently crisscrossed he lay down beside her and the feel of his body against hers was not unpleasant she touched his head her joints were stiff the movements painful but she wanted to draw his face up to hers he came smiling into her sight and they exchanged kisses my god she thought we are together and thinking they were together her will was made flesh under his lips her features dissolved becoming the red sea hed dreamt of and washing up over his face that was itself dissolving common waters made of thought and bone her keen breasts pricked him like arrows his erection sharpened by her thought killed her in return with his only thrust tangled in a wash of love they thought themselves extinguished and were outside the hard world mourned on the chatter of buyers and sellers continuing through the night eventually indifference and fatigue claimed even the eagerest merchant inside and out there was a healing silence an end to losses and to gains the skins of the fathers the car coughed and choked and died davidson was suddenly aware of the wind on the desert road as it keened at the windows of his mustang he tried to revive the engine but it refused life exasperated davidson let his sweating hands drop off the wheel and surveyed the territory in every direction hot air hot rock hot sand this was arizona he opened the door and stepped out on to the baking dust highway in front and behind it stretched unswervingly to the pale horizon if he narrowed his eyes he could just make out the mountains but as soon as he attempted to fix his focus they were eaten up by the heathaze already the sun was corroding the top of his head where his blond hair was thinning he threw up the hood of the car and peered hopelessly into the engine regretting his lack of mechanical knowhow jesus he thought why dont they make the damn things foolproof then he heard the music it was so far off it sounded like a whistling in his ears at first but it became louder it was music of a sort how did it sound like the wind through telephone lines a sourceless rhythmless heartless airwave plucking at the hairs on the back of his neck and telling them to stand he tried to ignore it but it wouldnt go away he looked up out of the shade of the bonnet to find the players but the road was empty in both directions only as he scanned the desert to the southeast did a line of tiny figures become visible to him walking or skipping or dancing at the furthest edge of his sight liquid in the heat of the earth the procession if that was its nature was long and making its way across the desert parallel to the highway their paths would not cross davidson glanced down once more into the cooling entrails of his vehicle and then up again at the distant line of dancers he needed help no doubt of it he started off across the desert towards them once off the highway the dust not impacted by the passage of cars was loose it flung itself up at his face with every step progress was slow he broke into a trot but they were receding from him he began to run over the thunder of his blood he could hear the music more loudly now there was no melody apparent but a constant rising and falling of many instruments howls and hummings whistlings drummings and roarings the head of the procession had now disappeared received into distance but the celebrants still paraded past he changed direction a little to head them off glancing over his shoulder briefly to check his way back with a stomachchurning sense of loneliness he saw his vehicle as small as a beetle on the road behind him sitting weighed down by a boiling sky he ran on a quarter of an hour perhaps and he began to see the procession more clearly though its leaders were well out of sight it was he began to believe a carnival of some sort extraordinary as that seemed out here in the middle of gods nowhere the last dancers in the parade were definitely costumed however they wore headdresses and masks that tottered well above human height there was the flutter of brightlycoloured feathers and streamers coiling in the air behind them whatever the reason for the celebration they reeled like drunkards loping one moment leaping the next squirming some of them on the ground bellies to the hot sand davidsons lungs were torn with exhaustion and it was clear he was losing the pursuit having gained on the procession it was now moving off faster than he had strength or willpower to follow he stopped bracing his arms on his knees to support his aching torso and looked under his sweatsodden brow at his disappearing salvation then summoning up all the energy he could muster he yelled stop at first there was no response then through the slits of his eyes he thought he saw one or two of the revelers halt he straightened up yes one or two were looking at him he felt rather than saw their eyes upon him he began to walk towards them some of the instruments had died away as though word of his presence was spreading among them theyd definitely seen him no doubt of that he walked on faster now and out of the haze the details of the procession began to come clear his pace slowed a little his heart already pounding with exertion thudded in his chest my jesus he said and for the first time in his thirtysix godless years the words were a true prayer he stood off half a mile from them but there was no mistaking what he saw his aching eyes knew papiermвchй from flesh illusion from misshapen reality the creatures at the end of the procession the least of the least the hangerson were monsters whose appearance beggared the nightmares of insanity one was perhaps eighteen or twenty feet tall its skin that hung in folds on its muscle was a sheath of spikes its head a cone of exposed teeth set in scarlet gums another was threewinged its triple ended tail thrashing the dust with reptilian enthusiasm a third and fourth were married together in a union of monstrosities the result of which was more disgusting than the sum of its parts through its length and breadth this symbiotic horror was locked in seeping marriage its limbs thrust in and through wounds in its partners flesh though the tongues of its heads were wound together it managed a cacophonous howl davidson took a step back and glanced round at the car and the highway as he did so one of the things black and red began to scream like a whistle even at a half miles distance the noise cut into davidsons head he looked back at the procession the whistling monster had left its place in the parade and its clawed feet were pounding the desert as it began to race towards him uncontrollable panic swept through davidson and he felt his trousers fill as his bowels failed him the thing was rushing towards him with the speed of a cheetah growing with every second so he could see more detail of its alien anatomy with every step the thumbless hands with their toothed palms the head that bore only a tricoloured eye the sinew of its shoulder and chest even its genitals erect with anger or lust twopronged and beating against its abdomen davidson shrieked a shriek that was almost the equal of the monsters noise and fled back the way he had come the car was a mile two miles away and he knew it offered no protection were he to reach it before the monster overcame him in that moment he realized how close death was how close it had always been and he longed for a moments comprehension of this idiot honor it was already close behind him as his shitslimed legs buckled and he fell and crawled and dragged himself towards the car as he heard the thud of its feet at his back he instinctively huddled into a ball of whimpering flesh and awaited the coup de grace he waited two heartbeats three four still it didnt come the whistling voice had grown to an unbearable pitch and was now fading a little the gnashing palms did not connect with his body cautiously expecting his head to be snapped from his neck at any moment he peered through his fingers the creature had overtaken him perhaps contemptuous of his frailty it had run on past him towards the highway davidson smelt his excrement and his fear he felt curiously ignored behind him the parade had moved on only one or two inquisitive monsters still looked over theft shoulders in his direction as they receded into the dust the whistling now changed pitch davidson cautiously raised his head from ground level the noise was all but outside his hearingrange just a shrill whine at the back of his aching head he stood up the creature had leapt on to the top of his car its head was thrown back in a kind of ecstasy its erection plainer than ever the eye in its huge head glinting with a final swoop to its voice which took the whistle out of human hearing it bent upon the car smashing the windshield and curling its mouthed hands upon the roof it then proceeded to tear the steel back like so much paper its body twitching with glee its head jerking about once the roof was torn up it leapt on to the highway and threw the metal into the air it turned in the sky and smashed down on the desert floor davidson briefly wondered what he could possibly put on the insurance form now the creature was tearing the vehicle apart the doors were scattered the engine was ripped out the wheels slashed and wrenched off the axles to davidsons nostrils there drifted the unmistakable stench of gasoline no sooner had he registered the smell than a shard of metal glanced against another and the creature and the car were sheathed in a billowing column of fire blackening into smoke as it balled over the highway the thing did not call out or if it did its agonies were beyond hearing it staggered out of the inferno with its flesh on fire every inch of its body alight its arms flailed wildly in a vain attempt to douse the fire and it began to run off down the highway fleeing from the source of its agony towards the mountains flames sprouted off its back and the air was tinged with the smell of its cooking flesh it didnt fall however though the fire must have been devouring it the run went on and on until the heat dissolved the highway into the blue distance and it was gone davidson sank down on to his knees the shit on his legs was already dry in the heat the car continued to burn the music had gone entirely as had the procession it was the sun that drove him from the sand back towards his gutted car he was blankeyed when the next vehicle along the highway stopped to pick him up sheriff josh packard stared in disbelief at the claw prints on the ground at his feet they were etched in slowly solidifying fat the liquid flesh of the monster that had run through the main street of welcome minutes ago it had then collapsed breathing its last breath and died in a writhing ball three trucks length from the bank the normal business of welcome the trading the debating the how do you dos had halted one or two nauseous individuals had been received into the lobby of the hotel while the smell of fricasseed flesh thickened the good desert air of the town the stench was something between overcooked fish and an exhumation and it offended packard this was his town overlooked by him protected by him the intrusion of this fireball was not looked upon kindly packard took out his gun and began to walk towards the corpse the flames were all but out now having eaten the best of their meal even so destroyed by fire it was a sizeable bulk what might once have been its limbs were gathered around what might have been its head the rest was beyond recognition all in all packard was glad of that small mercy but even in the charnelhouse confusion of rendered flesh and blackened bone he could make out enough inhuman forms to quicken his pulse this was a monster no doubt of it a creature from earth out of earth indeed up from the underworld and on its way to the great bowl for a night of celebration once every generation or so his father had told him the desert spat out its demons and let them loose awhile being a child who thought for himself packard had never believed the shit his father talked but was this not such a demon whatever mischance had brought this burning monstrosity into his town to die there was pleasure for packard in the proof of their vulnerability his father had never mentioned that possibility halfsmiling at the thought of mastering such foulness packard stepped up to the smoking corpse and kicked it the crowd still lingering in the safety of the doorways cooed with admiration at his bravery the halfsmile spread across his face that kick alone would be worth a night of drinks perhaps even a woman the thing was belly up with the dispassionate gaze of a professional demonkicker packard scrutinized the tangle of limbs across the head it was quite dead that was obvious he sheathed his gun and bent towards the corpse get a camera out here jebediah he said impressing even himself his deputy ran off towards the office what we need he said is a picture of this here beauty packard went down on his haunches and reached across to the blackened limbs of the thing his gloves would be ruined but it was worth the inconvenience for the good this gesture would be doing for his public image he could almost feel the admiring looks as he touched the flesh and began to shake a limb loose from the head of the monster the fire had welded the parts together and he had to wrench the limb free but it came with a jellied sound revealing the heatwithered eye on the face beneath he dropped the limb back where it had come with a look of disgust a beat then the demons arm was snaking up suddenly too suddenly for packard to move and in a moment sublime with terror the sheriff saw the mouth open in the palm of its forefoot and close again around his own hand whimpering he lost balance and sat in the fat pulling away from the mouth as his glove was chewed through and the teeth connected with his hand clipping off his fingers as the rasping maw drew digits blood and stumps further into its gut packards bottom slid in the mess under him and he squirmed howling now to loose himself it still had life in it this thing from the underworld packard bellowed for mercy as he staggered to his feet dragging the sordid bulk of the thing up off the ground as he did so a shot sounded close to packards ear fluids blood and pus spattered him as the limb was blown to smithereens at the shoulder and the mouth loosed its grip on packard the wasted mass of devouring muscle fell to the ground and packards hand or what was left of it was in the open air again there were no fingers remaining on his right hand and barely half a thumb the shattered bone of his digits jutted awkwardly from a partially chewed palm eleanor kooker dropped the barrel of the shotgun she had just fired and grunted with satisfaction your hands gone she said with brutal simplicity monsters packard remembered his father telling him never die hed remembered too late and now hed sacrificed his hand his drinking sexing hand a wave of nostalgia for lost years with those fingers washed over him while dots burst into darkness before his eyes the last thing he saw as a dead faint carried him to the ground was his dutiful deputy raising a camera to record the whole scene the shack at the back of the house was lucys refuge and always had been when eugene came back drunk from welcome or a sudden fury took him because the stew was cold lucy retired into the shack where she could weep in peace there was no pity to be had in lucys life none from eugene certainly and precious little time to pity herself today the old source of irritation had got eugene into a rage the child the nurtured and carefully cultivated child of their love named after the brother of moses aaron which meant exalted one a sweet boy the prettiest boy in the whole territory five years old and already as charming and polite as any east coast momma could wish to raise aaron lucys pride and joy a child fit to blow bubbles in a picture book fit to dance fit to charm the devil himself that was eugenes objection that flicking childs no more a boy than you are he said to lucy hes not even a halfboy hes only fit for putting in fancy shoes and selling perfume or a preacher hes fit for a preacher he pointed a nailbitten crookthumbed hand at the boy youre a shame to your father aaron met his fathers stare you hear me boy eugene looked away the boys big eyes made him sick to his stomach more like a dogs eyes than anything human i want him out of this house whats he done he doesnt need to do a thing its sufficient hes the way he is they laugh at me you know that they laugh at me because of him nobody laughs at you eugene oh yes not for the boys sake huh if they laugh they dont laugh at the boy they laugh at you shut your mouth they know what you are eugene they see you clear clear as i see you i tell you woman sick as a dog in the street talking about what youve seen and what youre scared of he struck her as he had many times before the blow drew blood as similar blows had for five years but though she reeled her first thoughts were for the boy aaron she said through the tears the pain had brought come with me you let the bastard alone eugene was trembling aaron the child stood between father and mother not knowing which to obey the look of confusion on his face brought lucys tears more copiously mama said the child very quietly there was a grave look in his eyes that went beyond confusion before lucy could find a way to cool the situation eugene had hold of the boy by his hair and was dragging him closer you listen to your father boy yes yes sir we say to our father dont we we say yes sir aarons face was thrust into the stinking crotch of his fathers jeans yes sir he stays with me woman youre not taking him out into that fucking shack one more time he stays with his father the skirmish was lost and lucy knew it if she pressed the point any further she only put the child at further risk if you harm him im his father woman eugene grinned what do you think id hurt my own flesh and blood the boy was locked to his fathers hips in a position that was scarcely short of obscene but lucy knew her husband and he was dose to an outburst that would be uncontrollable she no longer cared for herself shed had her joys but the boy was so vulnerable get out of our sight woman why dont you the boy and i want to be alone dont we eugene dragged aarons face from his crotch and sneered down at his pale face dont we yes papa yes papa oh yes indeed papa lucy left the house and retired into the cool darkness of the shack where she prayed for aaron named after the brother of moses aaron whose name meant exalted one she wondered how long he could survive the brutalities the future would provide the boy was stripped now he stood white in front of his father he wasnt afraid the whipping that would be meted out to him would pain him but this was not true fear youre sickly lad said eugene running a huge hand over his sons abdomen weak and sickly like a runty hog if i was a farmer and you were a hog boy you know what id do again he took the boy by the hair the other hand between the legs you know what id do boy no papa what would you do the scored hand slid up over aarons body while his father made a slitting sound why id cut you up and feed you to the rest of the litter nothing a hog likes better to eat than hogmeat howd you like that no papa you wouldnt like that no thank you papa eugenes face hardened well id like to see that aaron id like to see what youd do if i was to open you up and have a look inside you there was a new violence in his fathers games which aaron couldnt understand new threats new intimacy uncomfortable as he was the boy knew the real fear was felt not by him but by his father fear was eugenes birthright just as it was aarons to watch and wait and suffer until the moment came he knew that he would be an instrument in the destruction of his father maybe more than an instrument anger erupted in eugene he stared at the boy his brown fists clenched so tight that the knuckles burned white the boy was his ruin somehow hed killed the good life theyd lived before he was born as surely as if hed shot his parents dead scarcely thinking of what he was doing eugenes hands closed around the back of the boys frail neck aaron made no sound i could kill you boy yes sir what do you say to that nothing sir you should say thank you sir why why boy cause this lifes not worth what a hog can shit and id be doing you a loving service as a father should a son yes sir in the shack behind the house lucy had stopped crying there was no purpose in it and besides something in the sky she could see through the holes in the roof had brought memories to her that wiped the tears away a certain sky pure blue sheenyclear eugene wouldnt harm the boy he wouldnt dare ever dare harm that child he knew what the boy was though hed never admit to it she remembered the day six years ago now when the sky had been sheened like today and the air had been livid with the heat eugene and she had been just about as hot as the air they hadnt taken their eyes off each other all day he was stronger then in his prime a soaring splendid man his body made heavy with work and his legs so hard they felt like rock when she ran her hands over them she had been quite a looker herself the best damn backside in welcome firm and downy a divide so softly haired eugene couldnt keep from kissing her even there in the secret place hed pleasure her all day and all night sometimes in the house they were building or out on the sand in the late afternoon the desert made a fine bed and they could lie uninterrupted beneath the wide sky that day six years ago the sky had darkened too soon long before night was due it had seemed to blacken in a moment and the lovers were suddenly cold in their hurried nakedness she had seen over his shoulder the shapes the sky had taken the vast and monumental creatures that were watching them he in his passion still worked at her thrust to his root and out the length again as he knew she delighted in til a hand the colour of beets and the size of a man pinched his neck and plucked him out of his wifes lap she watched him lifted into the sky like a squirming jackrabbit spitting from two mouths north and south as he finished his thrusts on the air then his eyes opened for a moment and he saw his wife twenty feet below him still bare still spread butterfly wide with monsters on every side casually without malice they threw him away out of their ring of admiration and out of her sight she remembered so well the hour that followed the embraces of the monsters not foul in any way not gross or harmful never less than loving even the machineries of reproduction that they pierced her with one after the other were not painful though some were as large as eugenes fisted arm and hard as bone how many of those strangers took her that afternoon three four five mingling their semen in her body fondly teasing joy from her with their patient thrusts when they went away and her skin was touched with sunlight again she felt though on reflection it seemed shameful a loss as though the zenith of her life was passed and the rest of her days would be a cold ride down to death she had got up at last and walked over to where eugene was lying unconscious on the sand one of his legs broken by the fall she had kissed him and then squatted to pass water she hoped and hope it was that there would be fruit from the seed of that days love and it would be a keepsake of her joy in the house eugene struck the boy aarons nose bled but he made no sound speak boy what shall i say am i your father or not yes father liar he struck again without warning this time the blow carried aaron to the floor as his small uncalloused palms flattened against the kitchen tiles to raise himself he felt something through the floor there was a music in the ground liar his father was saying still there would be more blows to come the boy thought more pain more blood but it was bearable and the music was a promise after a long wait of an end to blows once and for all davidson staggered into the main street of welcome it was the middle of the afternoon he guessed but the town appeared to be empty until his eye alighted on the dark smoking mound in the middle of the street a hundred yards from where he stood if such a thing had been possible his blood would have run cold at the sight he recognized what that bundle of burned flesh had been despite the distance and his head spun with horror it had all been real after all he stumbled on a couple more steps fighting the dizziness and losing until he felt himself supported by strong arms and heard through a fuzz of headnoises reassuring words being spoken to him they made no sense but at least they were soft and human he could give up any pretence to consciousness he fainted but it seemed there was only a moment of respite before the world came back into view again as odious as ever he had been carried inside and was lying on an uncomfortable sofa a womans face that of eleanor kooker staring down at him she beamed as he came round the manll survive she said her voice like cabbage going through a grater she leaned further forward you seen the thing did you davidson nodded better give us the lowdown a glass was thrust into his hand and eleanor filled it generously with whisky drink she demanded then tell us what you got to tell he downed the whisky in two and the glass was immediately refilled he drank the second glass more slowly and began to feel better the room was filled with people it was as though all of welcome was pressing into the kooker front parlour quite an audience but then it was quite a tale loosened by the whisky he began to tell it as best he could without embellishment just letting the words come in return eleanor described the circumstances of sheriff packards accident with the body of the carwrecker packard was in the room looking the worse for consoling whiskies and pain killers his mutilated hand bound up so well it looked more like a club than a limb its not the only devil out there said packard when the stories were out sos you say said eleanor her quick eyes less than convinced my papa said so packard returned staring down at his bandaged hand and i believe it sure as hell i believe it then wed best do something about it like what posed a sour looking individual leaning against the mantelpiece whats to be done about the likes of a thing that eats automobiles eleanor straightened up and delivered a wellaimed sneer at the questioner well lets have the benefit of your wisdom lou she said what do you think we should do i think we should lie low and let em pass im no ostrich said eleanor but if you want to go bury your head ill lend you a spade lou ill even dig you the hole general laughter the cynic discomforted fell silent and picked at his nails we cant sit here and let them come running through said packards deputy between blowing bubbles with his gum they were going towards the mountains davidson said away from welcome so whats to stop them changing their goddam minds eleanor countered well no answer a few nods a few head shakings jebediah she said youre deputy what do you think about this the young man with the badge and the gum flushed a little and plucked at his thin moustache he obviously hadnt a clue i see the picture the woman snapped back before he could answer clear as a bell youre all too shit scared to go poking them divils out of their holes that it murmurs of selfjustification around the room more headshaking youre just planning to sit yourselves down and let the women folk be devoured a good word devoured so much more emotive than eaten eleanor paused for effect then she said darkly or worse worse than devoured pity sakes what was worse than devoured youre not going to be touched by no divils said packard getting up from his seat with some difficulty he swayed on his feet as he addressed the room were going to have them shiteaters and lynch em this rousing battlecry left the males in the room unroused the sheriff was low on credibility since his encounter in main street discretions the better part of valour davidson murmured under his breath thats so much horseshit said eleanor davidson shrugged and finished off the whisky in his glass it was not refilled he reflected ruefully that he should be thankful he was still alive but his workschedule was in ruins he had to get to a telephone and hire a car if necessary have someone drive out to pick him up the divils whatever they were were not his problem perhaps hed be interested to read a few columninches on the subject in newsweek when he was back east and relaxing with barbara but now all he wanted to do was finish his business in arizona and get home as soon as possible packard however had other ideas youre a witness he said pointing at davidson and as sheriff of this community i order you to stay in welcome until youve answered to my satisfaction all inquiries i have to put to you the formal language sounded odd from his slobbish mouth ive got business davidson began then you just send a cable and cancel that business mr fancydavidson the man was scoring points off him davidson knew bolstering his shattered reputation by taking potshots at the easterner still packard was the law there was nothing to be done about it he nodded his assent with as much good grace as he could muster thered be time to lodge a formal complaint against this hicktown mussolini when he was home safe and sound for now better to send a cable and let business go hang so whats the plan eleanor demanded of packard the sheriff puffed out his boozebrightened cheeks we deal with the divils he said how guns woman youll need more than guns if theyre as big as he says they are they are said davidson believe me they are packard sneered well take the whole fucking arsenal he said jerking his remaining thumb at jebediah go break out the heavyduty weapons boy antitank stuff bazookas general amazement you got bazookas said lou the mantelpiece cynic packard managed a leering smile military stuff he said left over from the big one davidson sighed inwardly the man was a psychotic with his own little arsenal of outofdate weapons which were probably more lethal to the user than to the victim they were all going to die god help him they were all going to die you may have lost your fingers said eleanor kooker delighted by this show of bravado but youre the only man in this room josh packard packard beamed and rubbed his crotch absent mindedly davidson couldnt take the atmosphere of handmedown machismo in the room any longer look he piped up ive told you all i know why dont i just let you folks get on with it you aint leaving said packard if thats what youre rooting after im just saying we know what youre saying son and i aint listening if i see you hitch up your britches to leave ill string you up by your balls if youve got any the bastard would try it too thought davidson even if he only had one hand to do it with just go with the flow he told himself trying to stop his lip curling if packard went out to find the monsters and his damn bazooka backfired that was his business let it be theres a whole tribe of them lou was quietly pointing out according to this man so how do we take out so many of them strategy said packard we dont know their positions surveillance replied packard they could really fuck us up sheriff jebediah observed picking a collapsed gumbubble from his moustache this is our territory said eleanor we got it we keep it jebediah nodded yes ma he said suppose they just disappeared suppose we cant find them no more lou was arguing couldnt we just let em go to ground sure said packard and then were left waiting around for them to come out again and devour the women folk maybe they mean no harm lou replied packards reply was to raise his bandaged hand they done me harm that was incontestable packard continued his voice hoarse with feeling shit i want them comebags so bad im going out there with or without help but weve got to outthink them out manoeuvre them so we dont get anybody hurt the man talks some sense thought davidson indeed the whole room seemed impressed murmurs of approval all round even from the mantelpiece packard rounded on the deputy again you get your ass moving son i want you to call up that bastard crumb out of caution and get his boys down here with every goddam gun and grenade theyve got and if he asks what for you tell him sheriff packards declaring a state of emergency and im requisitioning every asshole weapon in fifty miles and the man on the other end of it move it son now the room was positively glowing with admiration and packard knew it well blow the fuckers apart he said for a moment the rhetoric seemed to work its magic on davidson and he halfbelieved it might be possible then he remembered the details of the procession tails teeth and all and his bravado sank without trace they came up to the house so quietly not intending to creep just so gentle with their tread nobody heard them inside eugenes anger had subsided he was sitting with his legs up on the table an empty bottle of whisky in front of him the silence in the room was so heavy it suffocated aaron his face puffed up with his fathers blows was sitting beside the window he didnt need to look up to see them coming across the sand towards the house their approach sounded in his veins his bruised face wanted to light up with a smile of welcome but he repressed the instinct and simply waited slumped in beaten resignation until they were almost upon the house only when their massive bodies blocked out the sunlight through the window did he stand up the boys movement woke eugene from his trance what is it boy the child had backed off from the window and was standing in the middle of the room sobbing quietly with anticipation his tiny hands were spread like sunrays his fingers jittering and twitching in his excitement whats wrong with the window boy aaron heard one of his true fathers voices eclipse eugenes mumblings like a dog eager to greet his master after a long separation the boy ran to the door and tried to claw it open it was locked and bolted whats that noise boy eugene pushed his son aside and fumbled with the key in the lock while aarons father called to his child through the door his voice sounded like a rush of water counter pointed by soft piping sighs it was an eager voice a loving voice all at once eugene seemed to understand he took hold of the boys hair and hauled him away from the door aaron squealed with pain papa he yelled eugene took the cry as addressed to himself but aarons true father also heard the boys voice his answering call was threaded with piercing notes of concern outside the house lucy had heard the exchange of voices she came out of the protection of her shack knowing what shed see against that sheening sky but no less dizzied by the monumental creatures that had gathered on every side of the house an anguish went through her remembering the lost joys of that day six years previous they were all there the unforgettable creatures an incredible selection of forms pyramidal heads on rose coloured classically proportioned torsos that umbrellaed into shifting skirts of lace flesh a headless silver beauty whose six mother of pearl arms sprouted in a circle from around its purring pulsating mouth a creature like a ripple on a fastrunning stream constant but moving giving out a sweet and even tone creatures too fantastic to be real too real to be disbelieved angels of the hearth and threshold one had a head moving back and forth on a gossamer neck like some preposterous weathervane blue as the early night sky and shot with a dozen eyes like so many suns another father with a body like a fan opening and closing in his excitement his orange flesh flushing deeper as the boys voice was heard again papa at the door of the house stood the creature lucy remembered with greatest affection the one who had first touched her first soothed her fears first entered her infinitely gentle it was perhaps twenty feet tall when standing at its full height now it was bowed towards the door its mighty hairless head like that of a bird painted by a schizophrenic bent close to the house as it spoke to the child it was naked and its broad dark back sweated as it crouched inside the house eugene drew the boy close to him as a shield what do you know boy papa i said what do you know papa jubilation was in aarons voice the waiting was over the front of the house was smashed inwards a limb like a flesh hook curled under the lintel and hauled the door from its hinges bricks flew up and showered down again woodsplinters and dust filled the air where there had once been safe darkness cataracts of sunlight now poured onto the dwarfed human figures in the ruins eugene peered up through the veil of dust the roof was being peeled back by giant hands and there was sky where there had been beams towering on every side he saw the limbs bodies and faces of impossible beasts they were teasing the remaining walls down destroying his house as casually as he would break a bottle he let the boy slip from his grasp without realizing what hed done aaron ran towards the creature on the threshold papa it scooped him up like a father meeting a child out of school and its head was thrown back in a wave of ecstasy a long indescribable noise of joy was uttered out of its length and breadth the hymn was taken up by the other creatures mounting in celebration eugene covered his ears and fell to his knees his nose had begun to bleed at the first notes of the monsters music and his eyes were full of stinging tears he wasnt frightened he knew they were not capable of doing him harm he cried because he had ignored this eventuality for six years and now with their mystery and their glory in front of him he sobbed not to have had the courage to face them and know them now it was too late theyd taken the boy by force and reduced his house and his life to ruins indifferent to his agonies they were leaving singing their jubilation his boy in their arms forever in the township of welcome organization was the byword of the day davidson could only watch with admiration the way these foolish hardy people were attempting to confront impossible odds he was strangely enervated by the spectacle like watching settlers in some movie preparing to muster paltry weaponry and simple faith to meet the pagan violence of the savage but unlike the movie davidson knew defeat was preordained hed seen these monsters aweinspiring whatever the rightness of the cause the purity of the faith the savages trampled the settlers underfoot fairly often the defeats just make it into the movies eugenes nose ceased to bleed after half an hour or so but he didnt notice he was dragging pulling cajoling lucy towards welcome he wanted to hear no explanations from the slut even though her voice was babbling ceaselessly he could only hear the sound of the monsters churning tones and aarons repeated call of papa that was answered by a housewrecking limb eugene knew he had been conspired against though even in his most tortured imaginings he could not grasp the whole truth aaron was mad he knew that much and somehow his wife his ripebodied lucy who had been such a beauty and such a comfort was instrumental in both the boys insanity and his own grief shed sold the boy that was his halfformed belief in some unspeakable way she had bargained with these things from the underworld and had exchanged the life and sanity of his only son for some kind of gift what had she gained for this payment some trinket or other that she kept buried in her shack my god she would suffer for it but before he made her suffer before he wrenched her hair from its holes and tarred her flashing breasts with pitch she would confess hed make her confess not to him but to the people of welcome the men and women who scoffed at his drunken ramblings laughed when he wept into his beer they would hear from lucys own lips the truth behind the nightmares he had endured and learn to their horror that demons he talked about were real then he would be exonerated utterly and the town would take him back into its bosom asking for his forgiveness while the feathered body of his bitchwife swung from a telephone pole outside the towns limits they were two miles outside welcome when eugene stopped somethings coming a cloud of dust and at its swirling heart a multitude of burning eyes he feared the worst my christ he loosed his wife were they coming to fetch her too yes that was probably another part of the bargain shed made theyve taken the town he said the air was full of their voices it was too much to bear they were coming at him down the road in a whining horde driving straight at him eugene turned to run letting the slut go they could have her as long as they left him alone lucy was smiling into the dust its packard she said eugene glanced back along the road and narrowed his eyes the cloud of divils was resolving itself the eyes at its heart were headlights the voices were sirens there was an army of cars and motorcycles led by packards howling vehicle careering down the road from welcome eugene was confounded what was this a mass exodus lucy for the first time that glorious day felt a twinge of doubt as it approached the convoy slowed and came to a halt the dust settled revealing the extent of packards kamikaze squad there were about a dozen cars and half a dozen bikes all of them loaded with police and weapons a smattering of welcome citizens made up the army among them eleanor kooker an impressive array of mean minded wellarmed people packard leant out of his car spat and spoke got problems eugene he asked im no fool packard said eugene not saying you are i seen these things lucyll tell you i know you have eugene i know you have theres no denying that theres divils in them hills sure as shit whatd you think ive got this posse together for if it aint divils packard grinned across to jebediah at the wheel sure as shit he said again were going to blow them all to kingdom come from the back of the car miss kooker leaned out the window she was smoking a cigar seems we owe you an apology gene she said offering an apology for a smile hes still a sot she thought marrying that fatbottomed whore was the death of him what a waste of a man eugenes face tightened with satisfaction seems you do get in one of them cars behind said packard you and lucy both and well fetch them out of their holes like snakes theve gone towards the hills said eugene that so took my boy threw my house down many of them dozen or so ok eugene youd best get in with us packard ordered a cop out of the back youre going to be hot for them bastards eh eugene turned to where lucy had been standing and i want her tried he said but lucy was gone running off across the desert dollsized already shes headed off the road said eleanor shell kill herself killings too good for her said eugene as he climbed into the car that womans meaner than the devil himself hows that gene sold my only son to hell that woman lucy was erased by the heathaze to hell then let her be said packard hellll take her back sooner or later lucy had known they wouldnt bother to follow her from the moment shed seen the car lights in the dustcloud seen the guns and the helmets she knew she had little place in the events ahead at best she would be a spectator at worst shed die of heatstroke crossing the desert and never know the upshot of the oncoming battle shed often mused about the existence of the creatures who were collectively aarons father where they lived why theyd chosen in their wisdom to make love to her shed wondered also whether anyone else in welcome had knowledge of them how many human eyes other than her own had snatched glimpses of their secret anatomies down the passage of years and of course shed wondered if there would one day come a reckoning time a confrontation between one species and the other now it seemed to be here without warning and against the background of such a reckoning her life was as nothing once the cars and bikes had disappeared out of sight she doubled back tracing her footmarks in the sand til she met the road again there was no way of regaining aaron she realized that she had in a sense merely been a guardian of the child though shed borne him he belonged in some strange way to the creatures that had married their seeds in her body to make him maybe shed been a vessel for some experiment in fertility and now the doctors had returned to examine the resulting child maybe they had simply taken him out of love whatever the reasons she only hoped she would see the outcome of the battle deep in her in a place touched only by monsters she hoped for their victory even though many of the species she called her own would perish as a result in the foothills there hung a great silence aaron had been set down amongst the rocks and they gathered around him eagerly to examine his clothes his hair his eyes his smile it was towards evening but aaron didnt feel cold the breaths of his fathers were warm and smelt he thought like the interior of the general supplies emporium in welcome a mingling of toffee and hemp fresh cheese and iron his skin was tawny in the light of the diminishing sun and at his zenith stars were appearing he was not happier at his mothers nipple than in that ring of demons at the toe of the foothills packard brought the convoy to a halt had he known who napoleon bonaparte was no doubt he would have felt like that conqueror had he known that conquerors lifestory he might have sensed that this was his waterloo but josh packard lived and died bereft of heroes he summoned his men from their cars and went amongst them his mutilated hand tucked in his shirt for support it was not the most encouraging parade in military history there were more than a few white and sicklypale faces amongst his soldiers more than a few eyes that avoided his stare as he gave his orders men he bawled men weve arrived were organized and weve got god on our side weve got the best of the brutes already understand silence baleful looks more sweat i dont want to see one jack man of you turn your heel and run cause if you do and i set my eyes on you youll crawl home with your backside shot to hell eleanor thought of applauding but the speech wasnt over and remember men here packards voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper these divils took eugenes boy aaron not four hours past took him fairly off his mothers tit while she was rocking him to sleep they aint nothing but savages whatever they may look like they dont give a mind to a mother or a child or nothing so when you get up close to one you just think how youd have felt if youd been taken from your mothers tit he liked the phrase mothers tit it said so much so simply mommas tit had a good deal more power to move these men than her apple pie youve nothing to fear but seeming less than men men good line to finish on get on with it he got back into the car someone down the line began to applaud and the clapping was taken up by the rest of them packards wide red face was cleft with a hard yellow smile wagons roll he grinned and the convoy moved off into the hills aaron felt the air change it wasnt that he was cold the breaths that warmed him remained as embracing as ever but there was nevertheless an alteration in the atmosphere some kind of intrusion fascinated he watched his fathers respond to the change their substance glinting with new colours graver warier colours one or two even lifted their heads as if to sniff the air something was wrong something someone was coming to interfere with this night of festival unplanned and uninvited the demons knew the signs and they were not unprepared for the eventuality was it not inevitable that the heroes of welcome would come after the boy didnt the men believe in their pitiable way that their species was born out of earths necessity to know itself nurtured from mammal to mammal until it blossomed as humanity natural then to treat the fathers as the enemy to root them out and try to destroy them a tragedy really when the only thought the fathers had was of unity through marriage that their children should blunder in and spoil the celebration still men would be men maybe aaron would be different though perhaps he too would go back in time into the human world and forget what he was learning here the creatures who were his fathers were also mens fathers and the marriage of semen in lucys body was the same mix that made the first males women had always existed they had lived a species to themselves with the demons but they had wanted playmates and together they had made men what an error what a cataclysmic miscalculation within mere eons the worst rooted out the best the women were made slaves the demons killed or driven underground leaving only a few pockets of survivors to attempt again that first experiment and make men like aaron who would be wiser to their histories only by infiltrating humanity with new male children could the master race be made milder that chance was slim enough without the interference of more angry children their fat white fists hot with guns aaron scented packard and his stepfather and smelling them knew them to be alien after tonight they would be known dispassionately like animals of a different species it was the gorgeous array of demons around him he felt closest to and he knew he would protect them if necessary with his life packards car led the attack the wave of vehicles appeared out of the darkness their sirens blaring their headlights on and drove straight towards the knot of celebrants from one or two of the cars terrified cops let out spontaneous howls of tenor when the full spectacle came into view but by that time the attack force was committed shots were fired aaron felt his fathers close around him protectively their flesh now darkening with anger and fear packard knew instinctively that these things were capable of fear he could smell it off them it was part of his job to recognize fear to play on it to use it against the miscreant he screeched his orders into his microphone and led the cars into the circle of demons in the back of one of the following cars davidson closed his eyes and offered up a prayer to yahweh buddha and groucho marx grant me power grant me indifference grant me a sense of humour but nothing came to assist him his bladder still bubbled and his throat still throbbed ahead the shriek of brakes davidson opened his eyes and caught sight of one of the creatures wrapping its purpleblack arm around packards car and lifting it into the air one of the back doors flung open and a figure he recognized as eleanor kooker fell the few feet to the ground followed closely by eugene leaderless the cars were in a frenzy of collisions the whole scene partially eclipsed by smoke and dust there was the sound of breaking windscreens as cops took the quick way out of their cars the shrieks of crumpling hoods and sheered off doors the dying howl of a crushed siren the dying plea of a crushed cop packards voice was clear enough however howling orders from his car even as it was lifted higher into the air its engine revving its wheels spinning foolishly in space the demon was shaking the car as a child might a toy until the drivers door opened and jebediah fell to the ground at the creatures skirt of skin davidson saw the skirt envelop the brokenbacked deputy and appear to suck him into its folds he could see too how eleanor was standing up to the towering demon as it devoured her son jebediah come out of there she shrieked and fired shot after shot into his devourers featureless cylindrical head davidson got out of the car to see better across a clutter of crashed vehicles and bloodsplattered hoods he could make the whole scene out more plainly the demons were sloping away from the battle leaving this one extraordinary monster to hold the bridgehead quietly davidson offered up a prayer of thanks to any passing deity the divils were disappearing theres be no pitched battle no handtotentacle fight the boy would be simply eaten alive or whatever they planned for the poor little bastard indeed couldnt he see aaron from where he stood wasnt that his frail form the retreating demons were holding so high like a trophy with eleanors curses and accusations in their ears the sheltering cops began to emerge from their hidingplaces to surround the remaining demon there was after all only one left to face and it had their napoleon in its slimy grip they let off volley upon volley into its creases and tucks and against the impartial geometry of its head but the divil seemed unconcerned only when it had shaken packards car until the sheriff rattled like a dead frog in a tin can did it lose interest and drop the vehicle a smell of gasoline filled the air and turned davidsons stomach then a cry heads down a grenade surely not not with so much gasoline on the davidson fell to the floor a sudden silence in which an injured man could be heard whimpering somewhere in the chaos then the dull earthrocking thud of the erupting grenade somebody said jesus christ with a kind of victory in his voice jesus christ in the name of for the glory of the demon was ablaze the thin tissue of its gasoline soaked skirt was burning one of its limbs had been blown off by the blast another partially destroyed thick colourless blood splashed from the wounds and the stump there was a smell in the air like burnt candy the creature was clearly in an agony of cremation its body reeled and shuddered as the flames licked up to ignite its empty face and it stumbled away from its tormentors not sounding its pain davidson got a kick out of seeing it burn like the simple pleasure he had from putting the heel of his boot in the centre of a jellyfish favourite summertime occupation of his childhood in maine hot afternoons spiking menowar packard was being dragged out of the wreckage of his car my god that man was made of steel he was standing upright and calling his men to advance on the enemy even in his finest hour a flake of fire dropped from the flowering demon and touched the lake of gasoline packard was standing in a moment later he the car and two of his saviours were enveloped in a billowing cloud of white fire they stood no chance of survival the flames just washed them away davidson could see their dark forms being wasted in the heart of the inferno wrapped in folds of fire curling in on themselves as they perished almost before packards body had hit the ground davidson could hear eugenes voice over the flames see what theyve done see what theyve done the accusation was greeted by feral howls from the cops waste them eugene was screaming waste them lucy could hear the noise of the battle but she made no attempt to go in the direction of the foothills something about the way the moon was suspended in the sky and the smell on the breeze had taken all desire to move out of her exhausted and enchanted she stood in the open desert and watched the sky when after an age she brought her gaze back down to fix on the horizon she saw two things that were of mild interest out of the hills a dirty smudge of smoke and the edge of her vision in the gentle night light a line of creatures hurrying away from the hills she suddenly began to run it occurred to her as she ran that her gait was sprightly as a young girls and that she had a young girls motive that is she was in pursuit of her lover in an empty stretch of desert the convocation of demons simply disappeared from sight from where lucy was standing panting in the middle of nowhere they seemed to have been swallowed up by the earth she broke into a run again surely she could see her son and his fathers once more before they left forever or was she after all her years of anticipation to be denied even that in the lead car davidson was driving commandeered to do so by eugene who was not at present a man to be argued with something about the way he carried his rifle suggested hed shoot first and ask questions later his orders to the straggling army that followed him were two parts incoherent obscenities to one part sense his eyes gleamed with hysteria his mouth dribbled a little he was a wild man and he terrified davidson but it was too late now to turn back he was in cahoots with the man for this last apocalyptic pursuit see them blackeyed sons of bitches dont have no fucking heads eugene was screaming over the tortured roar of the engine why you taking this track so slow boy he jabbed the rifle in davidsons crotch drive or ill blow your brains out i dont know which way theyve gone davidson yelled back at eugene what you mean show me i cant show you if theyve disappeared eugene just about appreciated the sense of the response slow down boy he waved out of the car window to slow the rest of the army stop the car stop the car packard brought the car to a halt and put those fucking lights out all of you the headlights were quenched behind the rest of the entourage followed suit a sudden dark a sudden silence there was nothing to be seen or heard in any direction theyd disappeared the whole cacophonous tribe of demons had simply vanished into the air chimerical the desert vista brightened as their eyes became accustomed to the gleam of the moonlight eugene got out of the car rifle still at the ready and stared at the sand willing it to explain fuckers he said very softly lucy had stopped running now she was walking towards the line of cars it was all over by now they had all been tricked the disappearing act was a trump card noone could have anticipated then she heard aaron she couldnt see him but his voice was as clear as a bell and like a bell it summoned like a bell it rang out this is a time of festival celebrate with us eugene heard it too he smiled they were near after all hey the boys voice said where is he you see him davidson davidson shook his head then wait wait i see a light look straight ahead awhile i see it with exaggerated caution eugene motioned davidson back into the drivers seat drive boy but slowly and no lights davidson nodded more jellyfish for the spiking he thought they were going to get the bastards after all and wasnt that worth a little risk the convoy started up again creeping forward at a snails pace lucy began to run once more she could see the tiny figure of aaron now standing on the lip of a slope that led under the sand the cars were moving towards it seeing them approaching aaron stopped his calls and began to walk away back down the slope there was no need to wait any longer they were following for certain his naked feet made scarcely a mark in the softsanded incline that led away from the idiocies of the world in the shadows of the earth at the end of that slope fluttering and smiling at him he could see his family hes going in said davidson then follow the little bastard said eugene maybe the kid doesnt know what hes doing and get some light on him the headlights illuminated aaron his clothes were in tatters and his body was slumped with exhaustion as he walked a few yards off to the right of the slope lucy watched as the lead car drove over the lip of the earth and followed the boy down into no she said to herself dont davidson was suddenly scared he began to slow the car get on with it boy eugene jabbed the rifle into his crotch again weve got them cornered weve got a whole nest of them here the boys leading us right to them the cars were all on the slope now following the leader their wheels slipping in the sand aaron turned behind him illuminated only by the phosphorescence of their own matter the demons stood a mass of impossible geometries all the attributes of lucifer were spread among the bodies of the fathers the extraordinary anatomies the dreaming spires of heads the scales the skirts the claws the clippers eugene brought the convoy to a halt got out of the car and began to walk towards aaron thank you boy he said come here well look after you now weve got them youre safe aaron stared at his father uncomprehending the army was disgorging from the cars behind eugene readying their weapons a bazooka was being hurriedly assembled a cocking of rifles a weighingup of grenades come to papa boy eugene coaxed aaron didnt move so eugene followed him a few yards deeper into the ground davidson was out of the car now shaking from head to foot maybe you should put down the rifle maybe hes scared he suggested eugene grunted and let the muzzle of the rifle drop a few inches youre safe said davidson its all right walk towards us boy slowly aarons face began to flush even in the deceptive light of the headlamps it was clearly changing colour his cheeks were blowing up like balloons and the skin on his forehead was wriggling as though his flesh was full of maggots his head seemed to liquefy to become a soup of shapes shifting and blossoming like a cloud the faзade of boyhood broken as the father inside the son showed its vast and unimaginable face even as aaron became his fathers son the slope began to soften davidson felt it first a slight shift in the texture of the sand as though an order had passed through it subtle but allpervasive eugene could only gape as aarons transformation continued his entire body now overtaken by the tremors of change his belly had become distended and a harvest of cones budded from it which even now flowered into dozens of coiled legs the change was marvellous in its complexity as out of the cradle of the boys substance came new glories without warning eugene raised his rifle and fired at his son the bullet struck the boydemon in the middle of his face aaron fell back his transformation still taking its course even as his blood a stream part scarlet part silver ran from his wound into the liquefying earth the geometries in the darkness moved out of hiding to help the child the intricacy of their forms was simplified in the glare of the headlamps but they seemed even as they appeared to be changing again bodies becoming thin in their grief a whine of mourning like a solid wall of sound from their hearts eugene raised his rifle a second time whooping at his victory he had them my god he had them dirty stinking faceless flickers but the mud beneath his feet was like warm treacle as it rose around his shins and when he fired he lost balance he yelled for assistance but davidson was already staggering back up the slope out of the gully fighting a losing battle against the rising mire the rest of the army were similarly trapped as the desert liquefied beneath them and glutinous mud began to creep up the slope the demons had gone retreated into the dark their lament sunk away eugene flat on his back in the sinking sand fired off two useless vehement shots into the darkness beyond aarons corpse he was kicking like a hog with its throat cut and with every kick his body sunk deeper as his face disappeared beneath the mud he just glimpsed lucy standing at the edge of the slope staring down towards aarons body then the mire covered his face and blotted him out the desert was upon them with lightning speed one or two of the cars were already entirely submerged and the tide of sand climbing the slope was relentlessly catching up with the escapees feeble cries for assistance ended with choking silences as mouths were filled with desert somebody was shooting at the ground in an hysterical attempt to dam the flow but it reached up swiftly to snatch every last one of them even eleanor kooker wasnt to be let free she struggled cursing and pressing the thrashing body of a cop deeper into the sand in her frantic attempts to step out of the gully there were universal howls now as panicking men groped and grasped at each other for support desperately trying to keep their heads afloat in the sea of sand davidson was buried up to his waist the ground that eddied about his lower half was hot and curiously inviting the intimacy of its pressure had given him an erection a few yards behind him a cop was screaming blue murder as the desert ate him up further still from him he could see a face peering out from the seething ground like a living mask thrown on the earth there was an arm close by still waving as it sank a pair of fat buttocks was poking up from the silt sea like two watermelons a policemans farewell lucy took one step backwards as the mud slightly overran the lip of the gully but it didnt reach her feet nor curiously did it dissipate itself as a waterwave might have done like concrete it hardened fixing its living trophies like flies in amber from the lips of every face that still took air came a fresh cry of terror as they felt the desert floor stiffen around their struggling limbs davidson saw eleanor kooker buried to breastlevel tears were pouring down her cheeks she was sobbing like a little girl he scarcely thought of himself of the east of barbara of the children he thought not at all the men whose faces were buried but whose limbs or parts of bodies still broke surface were dead of asphyxiation by now only eleanor kooker davidson and two other men survived one was locked in the earth up to his chin eleanor was buried so that her breasts sat on the ground her arms were free to beat uselessly at the ground that held her fast davidson himself was held from his hips down and most horribly one pathetic victim was seen only by his nose and mouth his head was tipped back into the ground blinded by rock still he breathed still he screamed eleanor kooker was scrabbling at the ground with torn nails but this was not loose sand it was immovable get help she demanded of lucy hands bleeding the two women stared at each other jesus god screamed the mouth the head was silent by his glazed look it was apparent that hed lost his mind please help us pleaded davidsons torso fetch help lucy nodded go demanded eleanor kooker go numbly lucy obeyed already there was a glimmer of dawn in the east the air would soon be blistering in welcome three hours walk away she would find only old men hysterical women and children she would have to summon help from perhaps fifty miles distance even assuming she found her way back even assuming she didnt collapse exhausted to the sand and die it would be noon before she could fetch help to the woman to the torso to the head to the mouth by that time the wilderness would have had the best of them the sun would have boiled their brainpans dry snakes would have nested in their hair the buzzards would have hooked out their helpless eyes she glanced round once more at their trivial forms dwarfed by the bloody sweep of the dawn sky little dots and commas of human pain on a blank sheet of sand she didnt care to think of the pen that wrote them there that was for tomorrow after a while she began to run new murder in the rue morgue winter lewis decided was no season for old men the snow that lay five inches thick on the streets of paris froze him to the marrow what had been a joy to him as a child was now a curse he hated it with all his heart hated the snowballing children hated too the young lovers eager to be caught in a flurry together it was uncomfortable and tiresome and he wished he was in fort lauderdale where the sun would be shining but catherines telegram though not explicit had been urgent and the ties of friendship between them had been unbroken for the best part of fifty years he was here for her and for her brother phillipe however thin his blood felt in this ice land it was foolish to complain hed come at a summons from the past and he would have come as swiftly and as willingly if paris had been burning besides it was his mothers city shed been born on the boulevard diderot back in a time when the city was untrammelled by freethinking architects and social engineers now every time lewis returned to paris he steeled himself for another desecration it was happening less of late hed noticed the recession in europe made governments less eager with their bulldozers but still year after year more fine houses found themselves rubble whole streets sometimes gone to ground even the rue morgue there was of course some doubt as to whether that infamous street had ever existed in the first place but as his years advanced lewis had seen less and less purpose in distinguishing between fact and fiction that great divide was for young men who still had to deal with life for the old the distinction was academic what did it matter what was true and what was false what real and what invented in his head all of it the halflies and the truths were one continuum of personal history maybe the rue morgue had existed as it had been described in edgar allan poes immortal story maybe it was pure invention whichever the notorious street was no longer to be found on a map of paris perhaps lewis was a little disappointed not to have found the rue morgue after all it was part of his heritage if the stories he had been told as a young boy were correct the events described in the murders in the rue morgue had been narrated to poe by lewiss grandfather it was his mothers pride that her father had met poe while traveling in america apparently his grandfather had been a globetrotter unhappy unless he visited a new town every week and in the winter of he had been in richmond virginia it was a bitter winter perhaps not unlike the one lewis was presently suffering and one night the grandfather had taken refuge in a bar in richmond there with a blizzard raging outside he had met a small dark melancholy young man called eddie he was something of a local celebrity apparently having written a tale that had won a competition in the baltimore saturday visitor the tale was ms found in a bottle and the haunted young man was edgar allan poe the two had spent the evening together drinking and poe had gently pumped lewiss grandfather for stories of the bizarre of the occult and of the morbid the worldlywise traveler was glad to oblige pouring out believeitornot fragments that the writer later turned into the mystery of marie roget and the murders in the rue morgue in both those stories peering out from between the atrocities was the peculiar genius of c auguste dupin c auguste dupin poes vision of the perfect detective calm rational and brilliantly perceptive the narratives in which he appeared rapidly became wellknown and through them dupin became a fictional celebrity without anyone in america knowing that dupin was a real person he was the brother of lewiss grandfather lewiss great uncle was c auguste dupin and his greatest case the murders in the rue morgue they too were based on fact the slaughters that occurred in the story had actually taken place two women had indeed been brutally killed in the rue morgue they were as poe had written madame lespanaye and her daughter mademoiselle camille lespanaye both women of good reputation who lived quiet and unsensational lives so much more horrible then to find those lives so brutally cut short the daughters body had been thrust up the chimney the body of the mother was discovered in the yard at the back of the house her throat cut with such savagery that her head was all but sawn off no apparent motive could be found for the murders and the mystery further deepened when all the occupants of the house claimed to have heard the voice of the murderer speaking in a different language the frenchman was certain the voice had spoken spanish the englishman had heard german the dutchman thought it was french dupin in his investigations noted that none of the witnesses actually spoke the language they claimed to have heard from the lips of the unseen murderer he concluded that the language was no language at all but the wordless voice of a wild beast an ape in fact a monstrous orangoutang from the east indian islands its tawny hairs had been found in the grip of the slain madame lespanaye only its strength and agility made the appalling fate of mademoiselle lespanaye plausible the beast had belonged to a maltese sailor had escaped and run riot in the bloody apartment on the rue morgue that was the bones of the story whether true or not the tale held a great romantic appeal for lewis he liked to think of his great uncle logically pacing his way through the mystery undistressed by the hysteria and horror around him he thought of that calm as essentially european belonging to a lost age in which the light of reason was still valued and the worst horror that could be conceived of was a beast with a cutthroat razor now as the twentieth century ground through its last quarter there were far greater atrocities to be accounted for all committed by human beings the humble orangoutang had been investigated by anthropologists and found to be a solitary herbivore quiet and philosophical the true monsters were far less apparent and far more powerful their weapons made razors look pitiful their crimes were vast in some ways lewis was almost glad to be old and close to leaving the century to its own devices yes the snow froze his marrow yes to see a young girl with a face of a goddess uselessly stirred his desires yes he felt like an observer now instead of a participator but it had not always been that way in in the very room at number eleven quai de bourbon where he now sat there had been experience enough paris was still a pleasuredome in those days studiously ignoring rumours of war and preserving though at times the strain told an air of sweet naпvetй they had been careless then in both senses of the word living endless lives of perfect leisure it wasnt so of course the lives had not been perfect or endless but for a time a summer a month a day it had seemed nothing in the world would change in half a decade paris would burn and its playful guilt which was true innocence would be soiled permanently they had spent many days in the apartment lewis now occupied wonderful times when he thought of them his stomach seemed to ache with the loss his thoughts turned to more recent events to his new york exhibition in which his series of paintings chronicling the damnation of europe had been a brilliant critical success at the age of seventythree lewis fox was a feted man articles were being written in every art periodical admirers and buyers had sprung up like mushrooms overnight eager to purchase his work to talk with him to touch his hand all too late of course the agonies of creation were long over and hed put down his brushes for the last time five years ago now when he was merely a spectator his critical triumph seemed like a parody he viewed the circus from a distance with something approaching distaste when the telegram had come from paris begging for his assistance he had been more than pleased to slip away from the ring of imbeciles mouthing his praise now he waited in the darkening apartment watching the steady flow of cars across the pont louisphillipe as tired parisians began the trek home through the snow their horns blared their engines coughed and growled their yellow fog lamps made a ribbon of light across the bridge still catherine didnt come the snow which had held off for most of the day was beginning to fall again whispering against the window the traffic flowed across the seine the seine flowed under the traffic night fell at last he heard footsteps in the hail exchanged whispers with the housekeeper it was catherine at last it was catherine he stood up and stared at the door imagining it opening before it opened imagining her in the doorway lewis my darling she smiled at him a pale smile on a paler face she looked older than hed expected how long was it since hed seen her four years or five her fragrance was the same as she always wore and it reassured lewis with its permanence he kissed her cold cheeks lightly you look well he lied no i dont she said if i look well its an insult to phillipe how can i be well when hes in such trouble her manner was brisk and forbidding as always she was three years his senior but she treated him as a teacher would a recalcitrant child she always had it was her way of being fond greetings over she sat down beside the window staring out over the seine small grey icefloes floated under the bridge rocking and revolving in the current the water looked deadly as though its bitterness could crush the breath out of you what trouble is phillipe in hes accused of a tiny hesitation a flicker of an eyelid murder lewis wanted to laugh the very thought was preposterous phillipe was sixtynine years old and as mildmannered as a lamb its true lewis i couldnt tell you by telegram you understand i had to say it myself murder hes accused of murder who a girl of course one of his fancy women he still gets around does he we used to joke hed die on a woman remember lewis halfnodded she was nineteen natalie perec quite an educated girl apparently and lovely long red hair you remember how phillipe loved redheads nineteen he has nineteen year olds she didnt reply lewis sat down knowing his pacing of the room irritated her in profile she was still beautiful and the wash of yellowblue through the window softened the lines on her face magically erasing fifty years of living where is he they locked him up they say hes dangerous they say he could kill again lewis shook his head there was a pain at his temples which might go if he could only close his eyes he needs to see you very badly but maybe sleep was just an escape here was something even he couldnt be a spectator to phillipe laborteaux stared at lewis across the bare scored table his face weary and lost they had greeted each other only with handshakes all other physical contact was strictly forbidden i am in despair he said shes dead my natalie is dead tell me what happened i have a little apartment in montmartre in the rue des martyrs just a room really to entertain friends catherine always keeps number so neat you know a man cant spread himself out natalie used to spend a lot of time with me there everyone in the house knew her she was so good natured so beautiful she was studying to go into medical school bright and she loved me phillipe was still handsome in fact as the fashion in looks came full circle his elegance his almost dashing face his unhurried charm were the order of the day a breath of a lost age perhaps i went out on sunday morning to the patisserie and when i came back the words failed him for a moment lewis his eyes filled with tears of frustration this was so difficult for him his mouth refused to make the necessary sounds dont lewis began i want to tell you lewis i want you to know i want you to see her as i saw her so you know what there is there is what there is in the world the tears ran down his face in two graceful rivulets he gripped lewis hand in his so tightly it ached she was covered in blood in wounds skin torn off hair torn out her tongue was on the pillow lewis imagine that shed bitten it off in her terror it was just lying on the pillow and her eyes all swimming in blood like shed wept blood she was the dearest thing in all creation lewis she was beautiful no more i want to die lewis no i dont want to live now theres no point they wont find you guilty i dont care lewis you must look after catherine now i read about the exhibition he almost smiled wonderful for you we always said didnt we before the war youd be the one to be famous id be the smile had gone notorious they say terrible things about me now in the newspapers an old man going with young girls you see that doesnt make me very wholesome they probably think i lost my temper because i couldnt perform with her thats what they think im certain he lost his way halted began again you must look after catherine shes got money but no friends shes too cool you see too hurt inside and that makes people wary of her you have to stay with her i shall i know i know thats why i feel happy really to just no phillipe just die theres nothing left for us lewis the worlds too hard lewis thought of the snow and the icefloes and saw the sense in dying the officer in charge of the investigation was less than helpful though lewis introduced himself as a relative of the esteemed detective dupin lewiss contempt for the shoddilydressed weasel sitting in his cluttered hole of an office made the interview crackle with suppressed anger your friend the inspector said picking at the raw cuticle of his thumb is a murderer monsieur fox it is as simple as that the evidence is overwhelming i cant believe that believe what you like to believe thats your prerogative we have all the evidence we need to convict phillipe laborteaux of murder in the first degree it was a coldblooded killing and he will be punished to the full extent of the law this is my promise what evidence do you have against him monsieur fox i am not beholden to you what evidence we have is our business suffice it to say that no other person was seen in the house during the time that the accused claims he was at some fictional patisserie and as access to the room in which the deceased was found is only possible by the stairs what about a window a plain wall three flights up maybe an acrobat an acrobat might do it and the state of the body the inspector made a face disgust horrible skin and muscle stripped from the bone all the spine exposed blood much blood phillipe is seventy so an old man would not be capable in other respects the inspector interrupted he seems to have been quite capable oui the lover yes the passionate lover he was capable of that and what motive would you claim he had his mouth scalloped his eyes rolled and he tapped his chest le coeur humain he said as if despairing of reason in affairs of the heart le coeur humain quel mystиre nestce pas and exhaling the stench of his ulcer at lewis he proffered the open door merci monsieur fox i understand your confusion oui but you are wasting your time a crime is a crime it is real not like your paintings he saw the surprise on lewiss face oh i am not so uncivilized as not to know your reputation monsieur fox but i ask you make your fictions as best you can that is your genius oui mine to investigate the truth lewis couldnt bear the weasels cant any longer truth he snapped back at the inspector you wouldnt know the truth if you tripped over it the weasel looked as though hed been slapped with a wet fish it was precious little satisfaction but it made lewis feel better for at least five minutes the house on the rue des martyrs was not in good condition and lewis could smell the damp as he climbed to the little room on the third floor doors opened as he passed and inquiring whispers ushered him up the stairs but nobody tried to stop him the room where the atrocity had happened was locked frustrated but not knowing how or why it would help phillipes case to see the interior of the room he made his way back down the stairs and into the bitter air catherine was back at the quai de bourbon as soon as lewis saw her he knew there was something new to hear her grey hair was loosed from the bun she favoured wearing and hung unbraided at her shoulders her face was a sickly yellowgrey by the lamplight she shivered even in the clogged air of the centrallyheated apartment whats wrong he asked i went to phillipes apartment so did i it was locked i have the key phillipes spare key i just wanted to pick up a few clothes for him lewis nodded and somebody else was there police no who i couldnt see i dont know exactly he was dressed in a big coat scarf over his face hat gloves she paused then he had a razor lewis a razor an open razor like a barber something jangled in the back of lewis foxs mind an open razor a man dressed so well he couldnt be recognized i was terrified did he hurt you she shook her head i screamed and he ran away didnt say anything to you no maybe a friend of phillipes i know phillipes friends then of the girl a brother perhaps but what there was something odd about him he smelt of perfume stank of it and he walked with such mincing little steps even though he was huge lewis put his arm around her whoever it was you scared them off you just mustnt go back there if we have to fetch clothes for phillipe ill gladly go thank you i feel a fool he may have just stumbled in come to look at the murderchamber people do that dont they out of some morbid fascination tomorrow ill speak to the weasel weasel inspector marais have him search the place did you see phillipe yes is he well lewis said nothing for a long moment he wants to die catherine hes given up fighting already before he goes to trial but he didnt do anything we cant prove that youre always boasting about your ancestors your blessed dupin you prove it where do i start speak to some of his friends lewis please maybe the woman had enemies jacques solal stared at lewis through his roundbellied spectacles his irises huge and distorted through the glass he was the worse for too much cognac she hadnt got any enemies he said not her oh maybe a few women jealous of her beauty lewis toyed with the wrapped cubes of sugar that had come with his coffee solal was as uninformative as he was drunk but unlikely as it seemed catherine had described the runt across the table as phillipes closest friend do you think phillipe murdered her solal pursed his lips who knows whats your instinct ah he was my friend if i knew who had killed her i would say so it seemed to be the truth maybe the little man was simply drowning his sorrows in cognac he was a gentlemen solal said his eyes drifting towards the street through the steamed glass of the brasserie window brave parisians were struggling through the fury of another blizzard vainly attempting to keep their dignity and their posture in the teeth of a gale a gentleman he said again and the girl she was beautiful and he was in love with her she had other admirers of course a woman like her jealous admirers who knows again who knows the inquiry hung on the air like a shrug who knows who knows lewis began to understand the inspectors passion for truth for the first time in ten years perhaps a goal appeared in his life an ambition to shoot this indifferent who knows out of the air to discover what had happened in that room on the rue des martyrs not an approximation not a fictionalized account but the truth the absolute unquestionable truth do you remember if there were any particular men who fancied her he asked solal grinned he only had two teeth in his lower jaw oh yes there was one who i never knew his name a big man i saw him outside the house three or four times though to smell him youd have thought he made an unmistakable face that implied he thought the man was homosexual the arched eyebrows and the pursed lips made him look doubly ridiculous behind the thick spectacles he smelt oh yes of what perfume lewis perfume somewhere in paris there was a man who had known the girl phillipe loved jealous rage had overcome him in a fit of uncontrollable anger he had broken into phillipes apartment and slaughtered the girl it was as clear as that somewhere in paris another cognac solal shook his head already im sick he said lewis called the waiter across and as he did so his eye alighted on a cluster of newspaper clippings pinned behind the bar solal followed his gaze phillipe he liked the pictures he said lewis stood up he came here sometimes to see them the cuttings were old stained and fading some were presumably of purely local interest accounts of a fireball seen in a nearby street another about a boy of two burned to death in his cot one concerned an escaped puma one an unpublished manuscript by rimbaud a third detailed casualties in a plane crash at orleans airport but there were other cuttings too some far older than others atrocities bizarre murders ritual rapes an advertisement for fantomas another for cocteaus la belle et la bete and almost buried under this embarrassment of bizarreries was a sepia photograph so absurd it could have come from the hand of max ernst a halfring of welldressed gentlemen many sporting the thick moustaches popular in the eighteennineties were grouped around the vast bleeding bulk of an ape which was suspended by its feet from a lamppost the faces in the picture bore expressions of mute pride of absolute authority over the dead beast which lewis clearly recognized as a gorilla its inverted head had an almost noble tilt in death its brow was deep and furrowed its jaw though shattered by a fearsome wound was thinly bearded like that of a patrician and its eyes rolled back in its head seemed full of concern for this merciless world they reminded lewis those rolling eyes of the weasel in his hole tapping his chest le coeur humain pitiful what is that he asked the acneridden barman pointing at the picture of the dead gorilla a shrug was the reply indifferent to the fate of men and apes who knows said solal at his back who knows it was not the ape of poes story that was certain that tale had been told in and the photograph was far more recent besides the ape in the picture was a gorilla clearly a gorilla had history repeated itself had another ape a different species but an ape nevertheless been loosed on the streets of paris at the turn of the century and if so if the story of the ape could repeat itself once why not twice as lewis walked through the freezing night back to the apartment at the quai de bourbon the imagined repetition of events became more attractive and now further symmetry presented itself to him was it possible that he the great nephew of c auguste dupin might become involved in another pursuit not entirely dissimilar from the first the key to phillipes room at the rue des martyrs was icy in lewiss hand and though it was now well past midnight he couldnt help but turn off at the bridge and make his way up the boulevard de sebastopol west on to boulevard bonnenouvelle then north again towards the place pigalle it was a long exhausting trudge but he felt in need of the cold air to keep his head clear of emotionalism it took him an hour and a half to reach the rue des martyrs it was saturday night and there was still a lot of noise in a number of the rooms lewis made his way up the two flights as quietly as he could his presence masked by the din the key turned easily and the door swung open street lights illuminated the room the bed which dominated the space was bare presumably sheets and blankets had been taken away for forensic tests the eruption of blood onto the mattress was a mulberry colour in the gloom otherwise there was no sign of the violence the room had witnessed lewis reached for the light switch and snapped it on nothing happened he stepped deeply into the room and stared up at the light fixture the bulb was shattered he half thought of retreating of leaving the room to darkness and returning in the morning when there were fewer shadows but as he stood under the broken bulb his eyes began to pierce the gloom a little better and he began to make out the shape of a large teak chest of drawers along the far wall surely it was a matter of a few minutes work to find a change of clothes for phillipe otherwise he would have to return the next day another long journey through the snow better to do it now and save his bones the room was large and had been left in chaos by the police lewis stumbled and cursed as he crossed to the chest of drawers tripping over a fallen lamp and a shattered vase downstairs the howls and shrieks of a welladvanced party drowned any noise he made was it an orgy or a fight the noise could have been either he struggled with the top drawer of the teak chest and eventually wrenched it open ferreting in the depths for the bare essentials of phillipes comfort a clean undershirt a pair of socks initialed handkerchiefs beautifully pressed he sneezed the chilly weather had thickened the catarrh on his chest and the mucus in his sinuses a handkerchief was to hand and he blew his nose clearing his blocked nostrils for the first time the smell of the room came to him one odour predominated above the damp and the stale vegetables perfume the lingering scent of perfume he turned into the darkened room hearing his bones creak and his eyes fell on the shadow behind the bed a huge shadow a bulk that swelled as it rose into view it was he saw at once the razorwielding stranger he was here in waiting curiously lewis wasnt frightened what are you doing he demanded in a loud strong voice as he emerged from his hiding place the face of the stranger came into the watery light from the street a broad flatfeatured flayed face his eyes were deepset but without malice and he was smiling smiling generously at lewis who are you lewis asked again the man shook his head shook his body in fact his gloved hands gesturing around his mouth was he dumb the shaking of the head was more violent now as though he was about to have a fit are you all right suddenly the shaking stopped and to his surprise lewis saw tears large syrupy tears well up in the strangers eyes and roll down his rough cheeks and into the bush of his beard as if ashamed of his display of feelings the man turned away from the light making a thick noise of sobbing in his throat and exited lewis followed more curious about this stranger than nervous of his intentions wait the man was already halfway down the first flight of stairs nimble despite his build please wait i want to talk to you lewis began down the stairs after him but the pursuit was lost before it was started lewis joints were stiff with age and the cold and it was late no time to be running after a much younger man along a pavement made lethal with ice and snow he chased the stranger as far as the door and then watched him run off down the street his gait was mincing as catherine had said almost a waddle ridiculous in a man so big the smell of his perfume was already snatched away by the northeast wind breathless lewis climbed the stairs again past the din of the party to claim a set of clothes for phillipe the next day paris woke to a blizzard of unprecedented ferocity the calls to mass went unrequited the hot sunday croissants went unbought the newspapers lay unread on the vendors stalls few people had either the nerve or the motive to step outside into the howling gale they sat by their fires hugging their knees and dreamt of spring catherine wanted to go to the prison to visit phillipe but lewis insisted that he go alone it was not simply the cold weather that made him cautious on her behalf he had difficult words to say to phillipe delicate questions to ask him after the previous nights encounter in his room he had no doubt that phillipe had a rival probably a murderous rival the only way to save phillipes life it seemed was to trace the man and if that meant delving into phillipes sexual arrangements then so be it but it wasnt a conversation he or phillipe would have wanted to conduct in catherines presence the fresh clothes lewis had brought were searched then given to phillipe who took them with a nod of thanks i went to the house last night to fetch these for you oh there was somebody in the room already phillipes jaw muscle began to churn as he ground his teeth together he was avoiding lewiss eyes a big man with a beard do you know him or of him no phillipe no the same man attacked catherine lewis said what phillipe had begun to tremble with a razor attacked her phillipe said are you sure or was going to no he would never have touched her never who is it phillipe do you know tell her not to go there again please lewis his eyes implored please for gods sake tell her never to go there again will you do that or you not you either who is it tell her i will but you must tell me who this man is phillipe he shook his head grinding his teeth together audibly now you wouldnt understand lewis i couldnt expect you to understand tell me i want to help just let me die who is he just let me die i want to forget why do you try to make me remember i want to he looked up again his eyes were bloodshot and redrimmed from nights of tears but now it seemed there were no more tears left in him just an arid place where there had been an honest fear of death a love of love and an appetite for life what met lewiss eyes was a universal indifference to continuation to selfpreservation to feeling she was a whore he suddenly exclaimed his hands were fists lewis had never seen phillipe make a fist in his life now his nails bit into the soft flesh of his palm until blood began to flow whore he said again his voice too loud in the little cell keep your row down snapped the guard a whore this time phillipe hissed the accusation through teeth exposed like those of an angry baboon lewis could make no sense of the transformation you began all this phillipe said looking straight at lewis meeting his eyes fully for the first time it was a bitter accusation though lewis didnt understand its significance me with your stories with your damn dupin dupin it was all a lie all stupid lies women murder you mean the rue morgue story you were so proud of that werent you all those silly lies none of it was true yes it was no it never was lewis it was a story thats all dupin the rue morgue the murders his voice trailed away as though the next words were unsayable the ape those were the words the apparently unspeakable was spoken as though each syllable had been cut from his throat the ape what about the ape there are beasts lewis some of them are pitiful circus animals they have no brains they are born victims then there are others what others natalie was a whore he screamed again his eyes big as saucers he took hold of lewis lapels and began to shake him everybody else in the little room turned to look at the two old men as they wrestled over the table convicts and their sweethearts grinned as phillipe was dragged off his friend his words descending into incoherence and obscenity as he thrashed in the warders grip whore whore whore was all he could say as they hauled him back to his cell catherine met lewis at the door of her apartment she was shaking and tearful beyond her the room was wrecked she sobbed against his chest as he comforted her but she was inconsolable it was many years since hed comforted a woman and hed lost the knack of it he was embarrassed instead of soothing and she knew it she broke away from his embrace happier untouched he was here she said he didnt need to ask who the stranger the tearful razorwielding stranger what did he want he kept saying phillipe to me almost saying it grunting it more than saying it and when i didnt answer he just destroyed the furniture the vases he wasnt even looking for anything he just wanted to make a mess it made her furious the uselessness of the attack the apartment was in ruins lewis wandered through the fragments of porcelain and shredded fabric shaking his head in his mind a confusion of tearful faces catherine phillipe the stranger everyone in his narrow world it seemed was hurt and broken everyone was suffering and yet the source the heart of the suffering was nowhere to be found only phillipe had pointed an accusing finger at lewis himself you began all this werent those his words you began all this but how lewis stood at the window three of the small panes had been cracked by flying debris and a wind was insinuating itself into the apartment with frost in its teeth he looked across at the icethickened waters of the seine then a movement caught his eye his stomach turned the full face of the stranger was turned up to the window his expression wild the clothes he had always worn so impeccably were in disarray and the look on his face was of utter utter despair so pitiful as to be almost tragic or rather a performance of tragedy an actors pain even as lewis stared down at him the stranger raised his arms to the window in a gesture that seemed to beg either forgiveness or understanding or both lewis backed away from the appeal it was too much all too much the next moment the stranger was walking across the courtyard away from the apartment the mincing walk had deteriorated into a rolling lope lewis uttered a long low moan of recognition as the illdressed bulk disappeared from view lewis it wasnt a mans walk that roll that swagger it was the gait of an upright beast whod been taught to walk and now without its master was losing the trick of it it was an ape oh god oh god it was an ape i have to see phillipe laborteaux im sorry monsieur but prison visitors this is a matter of life and death officer easily said monsieur lewis risked a lie his sister is dying i beg you to have some compassion ohwell a little doubt lewis levered a little further a few minutes only to settle arrangements cant it wait until tomorrow shell be dead by morning lewis hated talking about catherine in such a way even for the purpose of this deception but it was necessary he had to see phillipe if his theory was correct history might repeat itself before the night was out phillipe had been woken from a sedated sleep his eyes were circled with darkness what do you want lewis didnt even attempt to proceed any further with his lie phillipe was drugged as it was and probably confused best to confront him with the truth and see what came of it you kept an ape didnt you a look of terror crossed phillipes face slowed by the drugs in his blood but plain enough didnt you lewis phillipe looked so very old answer me phillipe i beg you before its too late did you keep an ape it was an experiment thats all it was an experiment why your stories your damn stories i wanted to see if it was true that they were wild i wanted to make a man of it make a man of it and that whore natalie she seduced it lewis felt sick this was a convolution he hadnt anticipated seduced it whore phillipe said with infinite regret where is this ape of yours youll kill it it broke into the apartment while catherine was there destroyed everything phillipe its dangerous now that it has no master dont you understand catherine no shes all right its trained it wouldnt harm her its watched her in hiding come and gone quiet as a mouse and the girl it was jealous so it murdered her perhaps i dont know i dont want to think about it why havent you told them had the thing destroyed i dont know if its true its probably all a fiction one of your damn fictions just another story a sour wily smile crossed his exhausted face you must know what i mean lewis it could be a story couldnt it like your tales of dupin except that maybe i made it true for a while did you ever think of that maybe i made it true lewis stood up it was a tired debate reality and illusion either a thing was or was not life was not a dream where is the ape he demanded phillipe pointed to his temple here where you can never find him he said and spat in lewis face the spittle hit his lip like a kiss you dont know what you did youll never know lewis wiped his lip as the warders escorted the prisoner out of the room and back to his happy drugged oblivion all he could think of now left alone in the cold interview room was that phillipe had it easy hed taken refuge in pretended guilt and locked himself away where memory and revenge and the truth the wild marauding truth could never touch him again he hated phillipe at that moment with all his heart hated him for the dilettante and the coward hed always known him to be it wasnt a more gentle world phillipe had created around him it was a hiding place as much a lie as that summer of had been no life could be lived the way hed lived it without a reckoning coming sooner or later and here it was that night in the safety of his cell phillipe woke it was warm but he was cold in the utter dark he chewed at his wrists until a pulse of blood bubbled into his mouth he lay back on his bed and quietly splashed and fountained away to death out of sight and out of mind the suicide was reported in a small article on the second page of le monde the big news of the following day however was the sensational murder of a redheaded prostitute in a little house off the rue de rochechquant monique zevaco had been found at three oclock in the morning by her flat mate her body in a state so horrible as to defy description despite the alleged impossibility of the task the media set about describing the indescribable with a morbid will every last scratch tear and gouging on moniques partially nude body tattooed drooled le monde with a map of france was chronicled in detail as indeed was the appearance of her welldressed overperfumed murderer who had apparently watched her at her toilet through a small back window then broken in and attacked mademoiselle zevaco in her bathroom the murderer had then fled down the stairs bumping into the flat mate who would minutes after discover mademoiselle zevacos mutilated corpse only one commentator made any connection between the murder at the rue des martyrs and the slaughter of mme zevaco and he failed to pick up on the curious coincidence that the accused phillipe laborteaux had that same night taken his own life the funeral took place in a storm the cortege edging its pitiful way through the abandoned streets towards montparnasse with the lashing snow entirely blotting out the road ahead lewis sat with catherine and jacques solal as they laid phillipe to rest every one of his circle had deserted him unwilling to attend the funeral of a suicide and of a suspected murderer his wit his good looks his infinite capacity to charm went for nothing at the end he was not as it turned out entirely unmourned by strangers as they stood at the graveside the cold cutting into them solal sidled up to lewis and nudged him what over there under the tree solal nodded beyond the praying priest the stranger was standing at a distance almost hidden by the marble mausoleums a heavy black scarf was wrapped across his face and a widebrimmed hat pulled down over his brow but his bulk was unmistakable catherine had seen him too she was shaking as she stood wrapped round by lewiss embrace not just with cold but with fear it was as though the creature was some morbid angel come to hover a while and enjoy the grief it was grotesque and eerie that this thing should come to see phillipe consigned to the frozen earth what did it feel anguish guilt yes did it feel guilt it knew it had been seen and it turned its back shambling away without a word to lewis jacques solal slipped away from the grave in pursuit in a short while both the stranger and his pursuer were erased by the snow back at the quai de bourbon catherine and lewis said nothing of the incident a kind of barrier had appeared between them forbidding contact on any level but the most trivial there was no purpose in analysis and none in regrets phillipe was dead the past their past together was dead this final chapter in their joint lives soured utterly everything that preceded it so that no shared memory could be enjoyed without the pleasure being spoilt phillipe had died horribly devouring his own flesh and blood perhaps driven mad by a knowledge he possessed of his own guilt and depravity no innocence no history of joy could remain unstained by that fact silently they mourned the loss not only of phillipe but of their own past lewis understood now phillipes reluctance to live when there was such loss in the world solal rang breathless after his chase but elated he spoke in whispers to lewis clearly enjoying the excitement im at the gare du nord and ive found out where our friend lives ive found him lewis excellent ill come straight away ill meet you on the steps of the gare du nord ill take a cab ten minutes its in the basement of number sixteen rue des fleurs ill see you there dont go in jacques wait for me dont the telephone clicked and solal was gone lewis reached for his coat who was that she asked but she didnt want to know lewis shrugged on his overcoat and said nobody at all dont worry i wont be long take your scarf she said not glancing over her shoulder yes thank you youll catch a chill he left her gazing over the nightclad seine watching the icefloes dance together on the black water when he arrived at the house on the rue des fleurs solal was not to be seen but fresh footprints in the powdery snow led to the front door of number sixteen and then foiled went around the back of the house lewis followed them as he stepped into the yard behind the house through a rotted gate that had been crudely forced by solal he realized he had come without a weapon best to go back perhaps find a crowbar a knife something even as he was debating with himself the back door opened and the stranger appeared dressed in his now familiar overcoat lewis flattened himself against the wall of the yard where the shadows were deepest certain that he would be seen but the beast was about other business he stood in the doorway with his face fully exposed and for the first time in the reflected moonlight off the snow lewis could see the creatures physiognomy plainly its face was freshly shaved and the scent of cologne was strong even in the open air its skin was pink as a peach though nicked in one or two places by a careless blade lewis thought of the openrazor it had apparently threatened catherine with was that what its business had been in phillipes room the purloining of a good razor it was pulling its leather gloves on over its wide shaved hands making small coughing noises in its throat that sounded almost like grunts of satisfaction lewis had the impression that it was preparing itself for the outside world and the sight was touching as much as intimidating all this thing wanted was to be human it was aspiring in its way to the model phillipe had given it had nurtured in it now deprived of its mentor confused and unhappy it was attempting to face the world as it had been taught to do there was no way back for it its days of innocence had gone it could never be an unambitious beast again trapped in its new persona it had no choice but to continue in the life its master had awoken its taste for without glancing in lewis direction it gently closed the door behind it and crossed the yard its walk transforming in those few steps from a simian roll to the mincing waddle that it used to simulate humanity then it was gone lewis waited a moment in the shadows breathing shallowly every bone in his body ached with cold now and his feet were numb the beast showed no sign of returning so he ventured out of his hiding place and tried the door it was not locked as he stepped inside a stench struck him the sickly sweet smell of rotten fruit mingled with the cloying cologne the zoo and the boudoir he edged down a flight of slimy stone steps and along a short tiled corridor towards a door it too was unlocked and the bare bulb inside illuminated a bizarre scene on the floor a large somewhat threadbare persian carpet sparse furnishings a bed roughly covered with blankets and stained hessian a wardrobe bulging with oversize clothes discarded fruit in abundance some trodden into the floor a bucket filled with straw and stinking of droppings on the wall a large crucifix on the mantelpiece a photograph of catherine lewis and phillipe together in a sunlit past smiling at the sink the creatures shaving kit soap brush razor fresh suds on the dresser a pile of money left in careless abundance beside a pile of hypodermics and a collection of small bottles it was warm in the beasts garret perhaps the furnace for the house roared in an adjacent cellar solal was not there suddenly a noise lewis turned to the door expecting the ape to be filling it teeth bared eyes demonic but he had lost all orientation the noise was not from the door but from the wardrobe behind the pile of clothes there was a movement solal jacques solal half fell out of the wardrobe and sprawled across the persian carpet his face was disfigured by one foul wound so that it was all but impossible to find any part of his features that was still jacques the creature had taken hold of his lip and pulled his muscle off his bone as though removing a balaclava his exposed teeth chattered away in nervous response to oncoming death his limbs jangled and shook but jacques was already gone these shudders and jerks were not signs of thought or personality just the din of passing lewis knelt at solals side his stomach was strong during the war being a conscientious objector he had volunteered to serve in the military hospital and there were few transformations of the human body he had not seen in one combination or another tenderly he cradled the body not noticing the blood he hadnt loved this man scarcely cared for him at all but now all he wanted was to take him away out of the apes cage and find him a human grave hed take the photograph too that was too much giving the beast a photograph of the three friends together it made him hate phillipe more than ever he hauled the body off the carpet it required a gargantuan effort and the sultry heat in the room after the chill of the outside world made him dizzy he could feel a jittering nervousness in his limbs his body was close to betraying him he knew it close to failing to losing its coherence and collapsing not here in gods name not here maybe he should go now and find a phone that would be wise call the police yes call catherine yes even find somebody in the house to help him but that would mean leaving jacques in the lair for the beast to assault again and he had become strangely protective of the corpse he was unwilling to leave it alone in an anguish of confused feelings unable to leave jacques yet unable to move him far he stood in the middle of the room and did nothing at all that was best yes nothing at all too tired too weak nothing at all was best the reverie went on interminably the old man fixed beyond movement at the crux of his feelings unable to go forward into the future or back into the soiled past unable to remember unable to forget waiting in a dreamy halflife for the end of the world it came home noisily like a drunken man and the sound of its opening the outer door stirred lewis into a slow response with some difficulty he hauled jacques into the wardrobe and hid there himself with the faceless head in his lap there was a voice in the room a womans voice maybe it wasnt the beast after all but no through the crack of the wardrobe door lewis could see the beast and a redhaired young woman with him she was talking incessantly the perpetual trivia of a spacedout mind youve got more oh you sweetie oh you dear man thats wonderful look at all this stuff she had pills in her hands and was swallowing them like sweets gleeful as a child at christmas where did you get all this ok if you dont want to tell me its fine by me was this phillipes doing too or had the ape stolen the stuff for his own purposes did he regularly seduce redheaded prostitutes with drugs the girls grating babble was calming now as the pills took effect sedating her transporting her to a private world lewis watched entranced as she began to undress its so hotin here the ape watched his back to lewis what expression did that shaved face wear was there lust in its eyes or doubt the girls breasts were beautiful though her body was rather too thin the young skin was white the nipples flowerpink she raised her arms over her head and as she stretched the perfect globes rose and flattened slightly the ape reached a wide hand to her body and tenderly plucked at one of her nipples rolling it between darkmeat fingers the girl sighed shall i take everything off the monkey grunted you dont say much do you she shimmied out of her red skirt now she was naked but for a pair of knickers she lay on the bed stretching again luxuriating in her body and the welcome heat of the room not even bothering to look at her admirer wedged underneath solals body lewis began to feel dizzy again his lower limbs were now completely numb and he had no feeling in his right arm which was pressed against the back of the wardrobe yet he didnt dare move the ape was capable of anything he knew that if he was discovered what might it not choose to do to him and to the girl every part of his body was now either nerveless or wracked with pain in his lap solals seeping body seemed to become heavier with every moment his spine was screaming and the back of his neck pained him as though pierced with hot knittingneedles the agony was becoming unbearable he began to think he would die in this pathetic hiding place while the ape made love the girl sighed and lewis looked again at the bed the ape had its hand between her legs and she squirmed beneath its ministrations yes oh yes she said again and again as her lover stripped her completely it was too much the dizziness throbbed through lewis cortex was this death the lights in the head and the whine in the ears he closed his eyes blotting out the sight of the lovers but unable to shut out the noise it seemed to go on forever invading his head sighs laughter little shrieks at last darkness lewis woke on an invisible rack his body had been wrenched out of shape by the limitations of his hidingplace he looked up the door of the wardrobe was open and the ape was staring down at him its mouth attempting a grin it was naked and its body was almost entirely shaved in the cleft of its immense chest a small gold crucifix glinted lewis recognized the jewellery immediately he had bought it for phillipe in the champs elysees just before the war now it nestled in a tuft of reddishorange hair the beast proffered a hand to lewis and he automatically took it the coarsepalmed grip hauled him from under solals body he couldnt stand straight his legs were rubbery his ankles wouldnt support him the beast took hold of him and steadied him his head spinning lewis looked down into the wardrobe where solal was lying tucked up like a baby in its womb face to the wall the beast closed the door on the corpse and helped lewis to the sink where he was sick phillipe he dimly realized that the woman was still here in the bed just woken after a night of love phillipe whos this she was scrabbling for pills on the table beside the bed the beast sauntered across and snatched them from her hands ah phillipe please do you want me to go with this one as well i will if you want just give me back the pills she gestured towards lewis i dont usually go with old men the ape growled at her the expression on her face changed as though for the first time she had an inkling of what this john was but the thought was too difficult for her drugged mind and she let it go please phillipe she whimpered lewis was looking at the ape it had taken the photograph from the mantelpiece its dark nail was on lewis picture it was smiling it recognized him even though fortyodd years had drained so much life from him lewis it said finding the word quite easy to say the old man had nothing in his stomach to vomit and no harm left to feel this was the end of the century he should be ready for anything even to be greeted as a friend of a friend by the shaved beast that loomed in front of him it would not harm him he knew that probably phillipe had told the ape about their lives together made the creature love catherine and himself as much as it had adored phillipe lewis it said again and gestured to the woman offering her for his pleasure lewis shook his head in and out in and out part fiction part fact it had come to this offered a human woman by this naked ape it was the last god help him the very last chapter in the fiction his great uncle had begun from love to murder back to love again the love of an ape for a man he had caused it with his dreams of fictional heroes steeped in absolute reason he had coaxed phillipe into making real the stories of a lost youth he was to blame not this poor strutting ape lost between the jungle and the stock exchange not phillipe wanting to be young forever certainly not cold catherine who after tonight would be completely alone it was him his the crime his the guilt his the punishment his legs had regained a little feeling and he began to stagger to the door arent you staying said the redhaired woman this thing he couldnt bring himself to name the animal you mean phillipe he isnt called phillipe lewis said hes not even human please yourself she said and shrugged to his back the ape spoke saying his name but this time instead of it coming out as a sort of gruntword its simian palate caught phillipes inflexion with unnerving accuracy better than the most skilful of parrots it was phillipes voice perfectly lewis it said not pleading not demanding simply naming for the pleasure of naming an equal the passersby who saw the old man clamber on to the parapet of the pont du carrousel stared but made no attempt to stop him jumping he teetered a moment as he stood up straight then pitched over into the threshing churning icewater one or two people wandered to the other side of the bridge to see if the current had caught him it had he rose to the surface his face bluewhite and blank as a babys then some intricate eddy snatched at his feet and pulled him under the thick water closed over his head and churned on who was that somebody asked who knows it was a clearheaven day the last of the winters snow had fallen and the thaw would begin by noon birds exulting in the sudden sun swooped over the sacrй coeur paris began to undress for spring its virgin white too spoiled to be worn for long in midmorning a young woman with red hair her arm linked in that of a large ugly man took a leisurely stroll to the steps of the sacre coeur the sun blessed them bells rang it was a new day
