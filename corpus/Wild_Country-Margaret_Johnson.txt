 chapter one the flower market mistake the woman in the red dress was holding some large yellow flowers to her face behind her there were lots more flowers big flowers small flowers flowers of every possible colour i was very pleased id got up early to see nices famous flower market it was beautiful and it helped me to forget that i wasnt going to have a nice day or a nice ten days grant cooper grant cooper i couldnt believe i was going to work with that man for ten days it was going to be horrible but i wouldnt think about it until i had to and here in the market i could almost forget there was colour all around me not just the flowers but also the people buying them in their summer clothes even the buildings behind the market were colourful red and orange with blue windows what a lovely picture it would make if i only had my paints with me but i did have a pencil somewhere i could do a quick drawing i still had a few minutes before i had to leave for the airport i found the pencil in the bottom of my shoulder bag together with an old letter soon my pencil was moving quickly over the back of the letter as i began to draw the woman in the red dress she was smelling some red flowers now and her hair was very blonde in the sunshine as i drew what i saw i quickly forgot about everything else the woman buying the flowers obviously knew the flower seller they were talking and laughing together and i had lots of time to work on my picture i dont know how long i stood there i only know that the next time i looked at my watch it was nine oclock nine oclock i only had thirty minutes to get to the airport oh no i was going to be late again but before i could put the pencil and paper back into my bag i felt something soft against my legs it was a small brown dog and he was on his own hello boy i said are you lost the dog seemed to smile up at me and i reached out to touch it the dog smiled again and then it bit me i screamed and jumped quickly back from the dog too quickly there was a very loud crash behind me mademoiselle shouted an angry voice i turned round to see flowers all over the ground im sorry i said that dog it bit me what dog asked the angry flower seller well that one i said but when i looked down the dog had disappeared it was here a minute ago i said turning to look unfortunately i turned so quickly that my shoulder bag flew through the air and crashed into some more flowers mademoiselle shouted the flower seller again im sorry i started to say but then i noticed that things were about to get even worse a river of dirty water from the flowers was moving very quickly towards the blonde womans expensive white summer shoes madame i shouted but it was too late my shoes cried the blonde woman my flowers cried the flower seller i held my hand up to show what the dog had done my finger i cried but neither the flower seller nor the blonde woman was interested in my hurt finger after id given a lot of money to the flower seller for her flowers and to the blonde woman to clean her dirty shoes i caught a bus to the airport i was feeling fed up it wasnt the best start to a new tour but then my tours never did seem to go well id been a tour leader for wild country my fathers walking holiday company for a year in that time id been late meeting a group at the airport several times id also lost my wallet with all the money to buy food for the tour group for a week in it and of course everybody who worked for wild country knew about the time id taken a group to the wrong town on the wrong day theyd all missed their plane home now that was a very famous mistake my mistakes were so famous in the company that doing something wrong was called doing a tess marriot i think it was grant cooper who started saying that actually horrible man and now my father had arranged for me to work with grant cooper on this tour he thought i would learn something from grant something to make me a better tour leader i thought my father was wrong i was just too different to grant and i didnt want to be like him anyway after thirty minutes in a hot bus with these thoughts going round and round my head i felt very fed up which was the opposite of how i should be when i meet a group at the start of a holiday a tour leader should smile as often as possible thats what it said in the book i was given when i started the job at the beginning of a tour holidaymakers are often tired from their journeys they may also be worried about what the other people on the holiday will be like a smile from you makes everybody feel better so as i entered the airport building i tried to put a smile on my face but it was difficult to keep it there as i tried without luck to find my group wild country walking in provence i asked any group of more than four people but they all looked at me as if i was mad i was beginning to think id got the time wrong or come to the wrong airport when i saw him grant cooper my heart immediately gave a jump and not just because i was nervous about being late i didnt like grant but he was very goodlooking id liked the look of him when i first met him but then id spoken to him and all that changed i just didnt find him easy to get on with every time he spoke to me i felt he was laughing at me it made me so mad i wanted to scream as i got closer i could see that grant had already found the group there was nothing else to do but walk up to them with a big wild country smile on my face hello everybody i said im tess marriot one of your tour leaders i hope you had a good journey hello tess grant said did you get lost on your way to the airport my face went red no i said i had a bit of an accident but im here now so perhaps wed better make our way to the hotel the hotel la tour isnt it i reached into my shoulder bag for the hotel information but could only find my drawing of the market oh i said thats not it im sure its here somewhere youve probably lost it grant told me but never mind i have the information here its the hotel des deux tours i turned my drawing over here it is i said hotel des deux tours youre right grant smiled at me i usually am he said very nice drawing by the way tess right everyone now were finally all here lets get on our way the tour bus is waiting for us outside as i followed everyone out of the airport building i felt as if there must be smoke coming from the top of my head it was the way i always felt when i was around grant cooper thank you very much dad i thought thank you very much chapter two please dad i sat next to a woman called ellen on the bus she was canadian and she told me shed been on wild country holidays all over the world she seemed very nice as i half listened to her i looked at the other people in the group it was a small group only five people altogether there was a couple who were kissing or touching each other all the time and i thought they must be just married and on holiday a honeymoon couple they were called james and sarah but i knew id always think of them as the honeymoon couple there was also a whitehaired man of about sixty and a very beautiful scandinavian woman of about eighteen with long blonde hair astrid she was called shed smiled when we were introduced but now she was looking out of the window i thought she looked sad the man with the white hair was called david and he had a walking stick grant was talking to him about the mountains he probably wanted to know if david would be able to do all the walking on the holiday wild country holidays are really for people in good health because the walks can be difficult i knew grant had to ask david about his leg but i hoped hed be kind about it before he started working for wild country grant had been a soldier for five years sometimes he spoke to tourists as if they were soldiers too hed spoken to me like that when we first met but i wasnt going to let him do it on this tour oh no the couple were kissing again ellen saw me looking at them makes you feel a bit sick doesnt it she said softly and i had to put my hand over my mouth to hide my smile a tour leader should not laugh at the tourists in their group i didnt need the wild country book to tell me that what did you do to your finger ellen asked me and i saw grant look over at us with that smile of his yes he said what did you do to your finger tess its a long story i said and turned my head away so i couldnt see him but i still heard what he said i thought it might be and then he laughed when we got to the hotel i phoned my father while grant went to the front desk with the group im just on my way to a meeting tess my father said can i call you back later this will only take a minute dad i said i just want to ask you to let me work with someone else please i dont like grant we just dont get on well together when he spoke dad sounded a bit impatient oh tess he said grants a good man and hes very good at his job youll learn a lot from him listen dad i started to say but it was no good come on tess he said youll be ok after all when you take over the company youre going to have to get on with everyone arent you now i must go my meetings about to start love you and he was gone as i went to join grant and the group everyone looked at me i felt as if they knew what id been talking to my father about ok tess grant asked me and i smiled as nicely as i could yes thank you grant i said good he said and then turned to the group right you can go up to your rooms for a bit and well meet back down here at twelve oclock ill tell you something about the tour and then the rest of the day is free for you to do what you like ok after theyd all gone off to their rooms grant and i were left alone i can help you tell them about the tour if you like i offered grant looked at me i didnt think youd been here before he said i havent led a tour here i said but i have been on holiday here i know the area quite well grant smiled well i think i must know the area a little bit better than you tess ive been leading tours here for over a year now anyway i thought the idea was for you to learn from me my face quickly went red it was clear that grant thought it was very funny that my father had sent me to learn from him i dont need to learn how to speak to a group i told him i dont have any problems doing that no grant said well of course do add anything if you think it will be helpful tess from the way he said it i knew he didnt think anything i said to the group would be helpful see you back here in an hour grant turned to leave then looked back oh and tess if you do leave the hotel please dont get lost he was laughing as he walked away as for me that smoke was starting to come out of the top of my head again i knew it was it was going to be a very long ten days chapter three shopping with grant first thing tomorrow we drive to standrelesalpes grant said from there we start a sixhour walk through the forest to castellane grant told the group youll love castellane i added its so beautiful theres a lovely river and mountains everywhere grant gave me a look thank you tess he said while were in castellane you can climb up to the top of robion mountain which is one thousand six hundred and sixty metres high or there are some nice restaurants with tables outside if you want to just look at robion with some good food and a glass of wine i said grants voice sounded cross next day its an early start as we climb above the verdon river where the mountains of cadieres de brandis are one thousand metres high the colours are beautiful i told the group the river is so blue through the trees and the mountains seem to be looking down on us like people ellen started to laugh are you two sure youre talking about the same holiday she asked grant looked at me crossly just what i was thinking ellen he said we dont have to carry our bags do we asked david worriedly no i said quickly before grant could answer your bags go by bus dont worry you wont have much to carry said grant just the things you need during the day water lunch money things like that everything else goes in the bus grant went on the tents youll be sleeping in your sleeping bags the cooking things everything grant looked at his watch right the rest of today is free for you to look around nice tess and i need to go shopping for food for the tour so well meet you back here tomorrow morning at eight oclock to set off for standrelesalpes he stood up and began walking away calling to me as if i were a dog come on tess i had no idea why grant wanted me to go shopping with him because half the time he was walking ahead of me even when i did catch up with him he didnt agree with anything i wanted to buy that cheese is no good tess grant said why not it tastes lovely i replied true but itll also smell horrible after a few days in the sun grant went on not peaches tess he said whats wrong with peaches i asked theyre too soft apples are better he replied and so on by the time wed finished our shopping i wasnt feeling very happy at all the fact that i secretly knew grant was right about everything made it worse i did like smelly cheese and soft peaches but i really only wanted to buy them because he didnt want me to right said grant after wed taken the shopping back to the hotel thats me finished for the day im meeting someone this afternoon it was obvious from his smile that the someone was a woman as if i was interested see you tomorrow then i said and turned away yes said grant at eight oclock hed said the words eight oclock loudly and i turned back i can tell the time you know i said but i could see from his face he wasnt sure that this was true good he said laughingly but when i started to leave he called after me again look tess i turned round again what is it now i didnt ask to work with you and i know you didnt ask to work with me but here we are so shall we at least try to get on with each other i looked back at him crossly he was the one who was doing everything he could to make me angry all the time he was the one who was talking about my mistakes and laughing at me ill try if you try i said but i didnt like the smile he gave me of course ill try tess he said then he gave me a little wave and walked off probably to meet his someone poor woman she didnt know what she was getting herself into as for me i went back to my hotel room to work on a painting of the woman in the market or at least that was what i wanted to do but i couldnt keep my mind on my work grant and some of the things hed said to me kept getting in the way why did he enjoy making me angry so much it had always been the same ever since wed first met he thought i only had my job because wild country was my fathers company i left my painting and took a glass of orange juice over to the window the street below was busy with people enjoying the sunshine as they looked in shop windows at expensive fashions but i didnt really see them i was still thinking about grant the trouble was he was right i did still only have my job because wild country was dads company if it hadnt been his company id have been out after the wrong airport mistake i was sure and the truth was i wasnt very comfortable with that fact which was why grant made me so angry when he talked about it i didnt want to be a bad tour leader in fact i didnt want to be a tour leader at all i wanted to be an artist but dad wouldnt hear of it his father my grandfather had been an artist but the family had been very poor because grandfather hadnt sold many pictures dad didnt want me to be poor hed worked very hard all his life and now he was rich and wild country was doing very well im his only child and since mum died fifteen years ago dad and i have always been very close we may be very different but we love each other very much i wanted to please him but sometimes it was very hard i wanted to be an artist so very much i wanted to do something i was good at and i just knew i would never be good at being the manager of wild country which is what dad wanted me to be oh well for now at least there was nothing i could do about it so i went back to my painting of the woman in the market and after a few minutes i forgot about grant and dad i forgot about everything except colour and light and paint chapter four the tour begins to be sure that i wasnt late the next day i got up early and was down at breakfast by seven oclock ellen was already there and when she waved to me i took my breakfast over to her table morning i said may i join you she smiled at me please do i sat down and put sugar in my coffee did you enjoy your afternoon in nice i asked ellen nodded oh yes she said i did lots of shopping its a very good thing our bags go by bus she looked at me how did you and grant do with your shopping something about the way she was looking at me made my face go red fine i said and she smiled hes a very handsome man she said is he i said dont you think so continued ellen i havent really thought about it i said which of course wasnt the truth i just wanted to talk about something else are you looking forward to todays walk i asked ellen smiled again yes she said very much at that moment grant came into the restaurant and both ellen and i looked his way he wasnt alone a tall woman with black hair was holding his hand who is that ellen asked me not sounding pleased grant saw us and called over good morning ladies beautiful morning isnt it that i told ellen must be his french girlfriend is she coming on the tour with us asked ellen i have no idea i said but in the end the woman didnt join us when the bus set off for standrelesalpes grant kissed her goodbye and then he got on the bus the woman stood and watched us drive away she looked sad ellen was sitting in the seat next to me do you think hell see her again she whispered but i didnt want to think about it who knows i said grant was sitting at the front next to the driver he turned round to look at us ok as were driving along ill tell you something about what were going to do he said grant stopped to smile at everyone and everyone except me smiled back as youll know from the holiday information on this tour we spend two nights au sauvage he went on david spoke up i read that but i wasnt sure what it meant he said it means we put our tents up in the wild grant told him we wont be using a campsite and we wont be near any towns or villages so therell be no bars or restaurants and no toilets ellen asked him with a smile grant smiled back thats correct ellen he said no toilets but dont worry there are trees to hide behind and lots of earth astrid didnt look very happy about that and to tell the truth i didnt blame her but actually astrid didnt ever look very happy i made a note in my mind to have a quiet talk with her soon the poor woman looked as if she wanted to cry all the time something must be wrong tonight we have both toilets and a very good restaurant youll be glad to hear grant continued ok one more thing before i let you enjoy the rest of the journey when we stop for the night youll all need to learn how to put your tents up ill show you how to do it tonight but after that youre on your own dont worry it isnt difficult but its important to put your tent up safely or it could blow away if the wind gets strong ok grant looked at us all does anybody have any questions no how about you tess anything you want to add about all the beautiful colours well be seeing perhaps he was having another joke at me i knew but this time he wasnt going to make me cross i smiled at him sweetly no thank you grant i said i think youve told us everything we need to know for now grant turned around and i felt ellen touch me with her elbow isnt he wonderful she said i could eat him i really could no thank you i thought i dont want my stomach to hurt chapter five colours and conversation we began our sixhour walk from standrelesalpes at about eleven oclock soon we were beginning to climb up a very big hill grant was at the front with ellen and they looked deep in conversation the honeymoon couple were behind them holding hands and then came astrid david and myself as i walked i could hear the sound of ellen laughing and i thought she was probably already letting grant know how wonderful he was grants head would be very big by the end of the holiday though come to think of it it was already quite big women always seemed to be throwing themselves at him i had no idea why appearance wasnt everything you only had to spend a few minutes with the man to know that i decided to talk to david and get to know him better going uphill is hard work isnt it i started but actually david seemed to be doing ok better than me in fact i find it more difficult going downhill with my leg he told me do you i said what did you do to your leg if you dont mind me asking i crashed my motorbike when i was twenty he told me oh i said how awful david smiled at me it was my own fault i was riding badly he said and anyway it was a long time ago i cant really remember what its like not to have a bad leg any more it certainly doesnt stop me doing what i want to do i can see that i said david was walking quickly much more quickly than me actually he said looking back at me do you mind if i go on ahead my leg hurts in the afternoons but its fine in the morning of course not i said feeling stupid as one of the tour leaders i should be able to climb these hills with no problem but actually i was feeling a bit tired well it was a very big hill as id told grant id been here before on holiday but it hadnt been a holiday like this id come with a friend and wed driven everywhere in her car after about half an hour my legs really hurt and i was very hot i stopped for a moment to rest and looked down the hill towards standrelesalpes the town looked very small and the light was beautiful there was sunshine on the buildings and the roofs were an orangered colour the hills around the town were dark though and i saw that the sky was full of large black clouds tess a voice shouted to me from further up the hill i looked up to see grant and the rest of the group looking down at me what are you doing grants voice was angry er just looking at the colours i shouted back and began to walk again when i reached the group grants face looked like one of the black clouds id just seen in the sky when shes not a tour leader tess is an artist grant told everyone he thought people would laugh but they didnt really said ellen and david together even the honeymoon couple james and sarah looked interested were looking for some pictures for our new home they told me a picture of this area would be really good well i said pleased if i have time ill do one for you grants face looked even more like a black cloud than ever can we continue walking please he said if youve seen enough colours for now tess sarah laughed behind her hand and i smiled at her ill talk to you and james about it this evening sarah i told her we began walking again ten minutes later it began to rain very heavily within seconds those people in the group who hadnt brought their raincoats with them which was sarah and james astrid and of course me were wet through i caught up with astrid well soon dry out when the sun comes out again i told her with a smile it gets so hot in the south of france i dont like the heat astrid said unhappily oh i said so why had she decided to come on holiday to a hot part of the world when she didnt like the heat astrids hair was very blonde her skin was very fair too i hoped she had a sun hat with her well well be walking through the forest very soon i said the rain stopped when we reached the forest unfortunately the trees shut out the sunshine so those of us with wet clothes walked along very uncomfortably even my walking shoes had rain in them i could feel the water between my toes every time i put my foot down it was horrible ahead of me sarah and james were laughing together they didnt seem to mind about being wet and it was easy to think of them in thirty years time telling their grandchildren about it when we went on our honeymoon it rained and rained and rained i thought about trying to talk to them about the painting they wanted then they looked at each other and kissed again and i decided to leave it for a while so i turned to astrid they look very happy dont they i said with a smile but astrid didnt smile back yes they do she said in her sad voice though i cannot understand why they are on this holiday i would want to be alone if i was just married yes i said i think i would too i smiled at her again what made you choose this holiday astrid i asked do you like walking yes she said her voice sounding tired i do like walking but i did not i didnt understand sorry i said you did not what i did not choose this holiday she explained my boyfriend chose it oh i see i said interested and why couldnt he come with you well astrid said her voice sounding strange he decided to go to australia with with his new girlfriend when i saw that astrid was crying i wished i hadnt asked her about the holiday id only wanted to make conversation but now i seemed to have made things worse im sorry astrid i said and she looked at me so am i she said australia australia is a country i dreamed of going to with my boyfriend christian but he wanted to come here and i wanted only to be with him so i said yes and then one week ago he told me it was all over between us he had met a new woman and he did not love me anymore it is not fair ahead of us sarah and james were still laughing their arms around each other as they walked astrid stopped walking and put her hands to her face she was crying really loudly now and everyone including grant turned round to see what was wrong oh very good work tess i told myself angrily putting my hand on astrids shoulder very good work indeed chapter six tents and cafe bars id like to be able to say the day got better after this but i cant because it didnt astrid stopped crying but she was quiet and unhappy all day just after lunch it started to rain again and it didnt stop all afternoon by the time we got near our campsite the people with raincoats were also wet and even though he didnt say anything i could tell davids leg was hurting even ellen james and sarah had stopped smiling ill go on ahead and meet the driver the bus should be there by now grant said just walk straight on tess you cant miss the campsite its called les pins de montagne and its about two kilometres away just through the village with that he walked quickly away leaving us to follow we stood in a wet group under some trees watching him until he went around the corner and then i turned to look at everybody ok i said with a smile anybody know any jokes to make us feel better there were a few smiles but nobody said anything ok i said ill start where do horses go when theyre ill i waited a few moments before i told them to the horsepital thats a very bad joke tess ellen said but most people were smiling ok i said how about this one what game do cows play at parties moosical chairs that ones even worse ellen said but everyone laughed because the joke was so bad as we walked on through the rain other people told their own jokes by the time we reached the village we were feeling happier and when we reached a cafe bar ellen stopped i dont know about anybody else but id really like to go in there for a nice hot cup of coffee she said the others agreed ok i said im sure a quick cup of coffee would be fine the cafe bar was warm with comfortable chairs even though it was august there was a nice fire burning i made a fire because of this weather the cafe owner told us this summer is the wettest in this area for fifty years thank you for telling us that said ellen we sat near the fire to dry off and after wed finished our coffee nobody wanted to move the cafe owner came over to take our empty cups can i get you anything else he asked more coffee perhaps ellen looked at her cup just one more coffee before we go she said looking at me hopefully we have food as well the cafe owner told us i am hungry said sarah me too said james its a long time since lunch ages agreed ellen in fact i dont think i could walk another step until ive eaten something me neither said david picking up a menu i looked out of the window it was still raining but i thought about grant waiting at les pins de montagne for us i knew we really should be going we had to put the tents up but by now even astrid had a menu in her hands i couldnt make them all come and the weather was awful grant should understand i looked in my bag for my phone it wasnt there i looked in my jacket pocket it wasnt there either perhaps id left it in my other jacket pocket or my suitcase id have to walk to the campsite to tell grant what was happening i stood up id better go and tell grant where we are i said see you all back here later ok they said happily see you later but as i walked through the rain towards les pins de montagne i became more and more sure that grant would not understand hed told me to bring the group to les pins de montagne he hadnt said anything about going into a cafe bar on the way tess grant was waiting for me at the campsite hello i said where is everybody tess grant asked i tried phoning you but your phone just rang and rang i tried to sound brave but it didnt really work my voice came out all wrong i sounded like a schoolgirl i know maybe i left it somewhere im not sure where grant didnt look surprised wheres the group tess he asked again theyre having a cup of coffee i told him and something to eat at at the cafe bar in the village having something to eat grant repeated my words angrily having something to eat what about their tents you knew i wanted to show them how to put the tents up first but its raining i said they wanted to get dry grant was really angry theyll want to be dry tonight too when they go to sleep he said they wont be dry if they have to sleep out in the rain well i said we can put their tents up for once grant agreed with me but he didnt sound very happy about it yes he said it looks as if well have to and he walked quickly away towards the wild country bus which the driver had parked under some trees i followed more slowly feeling a bit worried as i watched grant get the tents out of the bus i hadnt actually put a tent up before but it couldnt be too difficult could it it was within minutes of getting my first tent out of its bag everything had gone wrong the tent was very large and i couldnt tell which way round it went while i was trying to find out the wind caught the tent and soon it was over my head like a big wet blanket oh i cried fighting to get it off grant came to help do you actually know what youre doing at all tess he asked but he could see by the look on my face that i didnt youve never led any camping tours before have you tess grant said no i agreed i havent have you even been camping before he asked no i said well said grant youd better watch and learn then so i watched grant put five tents up then he watched me while i tried to put the last one up and all the time it was raining raining raining ive never been so wet outside of a bath in my life no not like that like this grant told me impatiently when i did something wrong do it the way i showed you im trying my best i told him angrily are you really tess he said taking the tent from me to show me again yes i am i said if youd told the group they couldnt stay in the cafe bar we wouldnt be doing this at all grant said angrily his hands busy with the tent i knew it had been weak of me to give in to the group but i didnt want grant to know that they were wet and theyre on holiday i said i wanted them to enjoy themselves grant turned to look at me well i tell you he said if i wasnt teaching you how to do your job better then id tell you to do just that i looked at him what do you mean just that id tell you to enjoy yourself he said forget about being a tour leader and just take a holiday it sounded good but as it was grants idea i couldnt possibly agree you dont think i could lead this tour on my own do you i said no grant said i dont and neither does your father or he wouldnt have sent you to learn from me my fathers wrong i said youre both wrong i could easily lead this tour why dont you take a holiday and ill be tour leader the sixth tent was finally up grant stood up and looked at me ok he said i looked back at him surprised ok what i asked ok he said again you be tour leader and ill take a holiday he threw me the keys to the bus and began to walk away and im going to start my holiday with a good meal in the village see you tomorrow at breakfast but i said but he just gave me a wave without stopping bye tess he said over his shoulder i stood there watching him go now what had i done when i got back to the cafe bar i found that most of the group had drunk wine with their meals they were still sitting by the fire and they were loud and happy tess ellen said loudly when she saw me everything ok at les montagnes des pins les pins de montagne i told her unhappily my stomach feeling very empty at the smell of the food in the cafe bar yes your tents are all up maybe wed better go now before it gets dark but noone was interested in leaving so i stopped trying to be a good tour leader and ordered something to eat and then everybody had some more wine by the time we finally got back to les pins de montagne it was almost midnight it took us quite a long time to find our tents in the dark as we walked around ellen james and sarah were laughing shh i said trying to be a good tour leader again people are trying to sleep for some reason that only seemed to make them laugh even more shh they all said loudly i thought i heard a loud cough come from grants tent but finally everybody was safely in their tents and i could take my wet clothes off i was tired cold and a bit worried about the next day would grant really do what hed said take a holiday while i acted as tour leader i put on my nightclothes and got into my sleeping bag well if grant wanted to play games it was fine by me i knew we needed to get packed up quite early the next day but it must be easier to take a tent down than to put one up everything would be fine chapter seven asking for help but you cant take a tent down when somebodys still sleeping in it and at nine oclock the next morning nobody seemed to want to get up across the campsite grant was finishing his breakfast he smiled and gave me a wave morning tess he said sleeping in are they oh dear let me know when youre ready to leave will you and then he lay down on the ground and put his hat over his face i wanted to run over and knock his hat off his face but i didnt i went into ellens tent and gave her a shake ellen i said its time to get up mmm she said sleepily what time is it nine oclock i told her but ellen had already gone back to sleep i left her to sleep a little longer and went to try david i called his name but he didnt hear me even when i put my head inside his tent there was a lot of soft laughing coming from sarah and jamess tent so i didnt like to go in there only astrid was awake and she looked as if she hadnt slept all night i will get up in a moment tess she said in her sad voice astrids tent was close to where grant was as i came out of her tent i heard him say something from under his hat pardon i said going closer what did you say just as grant took his hat off his face i fell over a stone on the ground i ended up almost on top of him and our faces were suddenly very close too close i asked if you needed any help he said softly and for some reason i couldnt stop looking at his mouth it was a very nice mouth id always thought so right from the first time wed met and suddenly i was remembering how it had looked when hed kissed the french woman beside the bus tess he said er what i said dreamily looking into his brown eyes he smiled and i suddenly felt he knew what was in my mind i asked if you needed any help to get everybody up he said still in that soft voice i was angry last night we dont have to do this do what i asked stupidly it was difficult to think about what he was saying this he said this game lets forget about last night ill go back to being tour leader i was mad seriously mad this was grant cooper grant cooper who enjoyed making my life as difficult as possible grant cooper who loved to make me look stupid what was i doing looking at his mouth and thinking about kissing him no i said getting quickly to my feet its ok thanks i want to be tour leader ok grant said but if you change your mind you only have to tell me no chance i thought to myself as i walked quickly back over to ellens tent i was sure i heard grant laughing we finally left les pins de montagne an hour and a half later than planned it was dry but the sky was full of dark clouds it looked as if it would start to rain again soon i dont think i was the only one who wished we were travelling in the bus with the luggage we were a quiet group as we walked along there was no laughing or telling jokes this morning most people were tired and some had headaches from last nights wine the only person who seemed to be happy was grant he was out in front singing a little song to himself as he walked i certainly didnt feel like singing we were going up another long hill and my legs hurt i was also remembering how id felt back at les pins de montagne how was it possible to want to kiss somebody and to want to push them off the hill all at the same time because i had wanted to kiss grant but i was very pleased i hadnt excuse me tess i realised david had come to speak to me i smiled at him yes david he looked uncomfortable well its just are you sure were walking the right way only grant told me we should go between those two mountains and we seem to be going away from them i stopped and looked across at the mountains he was talking about then i looked down at my map oh no david was right wed gone the wrong way several kilometres back id been so busy thinking about grant that id missed our turning problem tess grant asked with a smile coming back down the hill i tried to smile no i said at least not really we need to go back a little way sorry everybody nobody said anything but i knew they were a bit fed up especially david who found going downhill difficult why hadnt grant said something at the time hed obviously known wed gone wrong the man was acting like a child and it wasnt fair to the group we needed to talk i walked more quickly to catch up with grant this is stupid i told him when i got close enough to speak he turned to look at me whats that tess he said with a smile oh how i hated that smile why didnt you tell me wed gone wrong i asked you didnt ask me for help grant said walking on youre the tour leader i didnt like to tell you what to do but as i said if you do want help you only have to ask and with that he walked on more quickly there was no way i could keep up but if i thought things were bad worse was to come when we were high up on a mountain with no trees near it began to rain again very hard we all had our raincoats with us that day but the rain was falling so hard even they couldnt keep us dry it was time for lunch but there was nowhere to stop and it was difficult to see where we were going i wasnt even completely sure where we were i had a picture in my mind of us still being up on the mountain in the rain by the time night came i knew i needed help to get everybody safely down feeling a little sick i walked up to grant can you help whats that he said id spoken quietly because i hadnt wanted anybody else to hear but i knew grant had heard me he just wanted to enjoy hearing me say it again but i had no choice it didnt matter how i felt what mattered was that everybody in the group was safe i dont think i can do this i said i think were lost i i need your help grant looked at me say please he said i wanted to hit him please i said please can you help he smiled of course i can he said i told you you only had to ask it wasnt so difficult was it it had been difficult one of the most difficult things id ever had to do but it was worth it within ten minutes we were eating our lunch under some trees which grant knew about for the rest of the afternoon we walked the right way up and down the hills with him at the front i walked at the back happy to leave him to it i didnt even try to talk to anybody i was busy with my thoughts which were about my dreams of becoming a fulltime artist i had to do it i had to i was a bad tour leader and that was never going to change id always be a bad tour leader my father would just have to understand id tell him as soon as we got back to nice chapter eight funny pictures the next few days were much the same grant walked at the front and i walked at the back grant had us up by eight oclock in the morning and ready to leave by nine every day we went up mountains and back down them again we ate our lunch at one oclock and we rested at eleven oclock and three oclock by six oclock in the evening our tents were up and at seventhirty we ate dinner oh and there was something else that was the same it rained every day one afternoon ellen was walking next to me this holiday is no fun she said its more like work than a holiday she looked at grant who was at the front as usual he may look good enough to eat but hes just mr clock do this at this time do that at that time and tonight its going to be even worse no toilets no restaurants i dont know whose idea this camping au sauvage was but it was a stupid idea im fed up tess cant you tell us some bad jokes that was fun i looked at ellen who i now thought of as my friend and smiled maybe i did have something to offer the group something grant didnt seem to be able to give them ill think of something i told ellen ellen smiled at me good she said and while youre doing that im going to have another try at making mr clock up there take it easy i watched as ellen walked quickly to the front to join grant it wasnt long before i heard them laughing but nobody was laughing very much by the evening the place where we were to spend the night would obviously be beautiful on a nice evening but it wasnt a nice evening it was wet and the moon was behind a cloud everybody ate dinner together in the cooking tent but there wasnt very much conversation after the plates were cleared away and washed i shouted to everybody above the noise of the rain on the tent if anybody wants a caricature of themselves im happy to draw one i said whats a caricature astrid asked its a picture that makes you look stupid grant told her helpfully i gave him a dirty look its a funny picture i explained to astrid it does look like you but if you have a bit of a big nose i make it very big or if you have small eyes i make them very small astrid nodded i know ive seen those in newspapers sometimes no i dont think i want one thank you ellen stood up well i do she sat down in front of me come on tess make me look as stupid as possible anything for a laugh i moved some of the lamps so i had enough light to see then i held my pencil in my hand and sat looking at ellen while i decided how to draw her the best thing about ellens face was her eyes they were beautiful warm and friendly she was so full of life too that was what i liked about her things were never boring when ellen was around her hair was very alive she had a lot of it and i thought it must be very difficult to brush in the mornings suddenly i smiled to myself youve thought of something havent you said ellen watching my face i smiled at her yes i said beginning to draw but im not sure youll like it i told you ellen said with a laugh i dont care do what you like ok i said but remember you said that as i drew everybody except astrid came near to watch i soon forgot about them as i thought about what i was doing id remembered a little cat id had when i was a child messy id called her shed had a sweet face just like ellen and shed loved running about and getting into trouble the picture took about five minutes to finish there i said holding it out to ellen she took it from me and began to laugh id drawn her as half woman half cat with lots of wild hair all over the place and a food bowl with chocolates in it ellen was always eating chocolate thats very good tess she said just like me on a bad day and she passed the picture round for everybody else to look at me next said sarah even astrid asked me to draw her picture in the end astrids neck is quite long and her eyes are large and sad so i made her neck very long and her eyes very large when i gave the picture to her she looked at it for a long time her face was so sad i began to feel worried then finally she spoke yes she said it is very good then i saw that she was crying oh no what had i done now oh astrid i said im sorry she shook her head no she said its ok its just that christian always loved my long neck he said he said it was lovely like the neck of a water bird a swan asked david and astrid nodded yes a swan she said and then she took her picture and walked sadly away still crying after that everybody felt a bit flat and most people decided to go to bed soon only grant and i were left in the tent well i said standing up but grant put out a hand to stop me wait a minute he said you havent done a caricature of me yet chapter nine the river mistake i looked at grant as he sat down in the chair opposite me i didnt want to draw him and i knew why it was because i didnt want to spend all that time looking at him oh i said you dont want me to draw you do you i was only doing it to keep everybody happy this evening and whats wrong with keeping me happy he asked with a lazy smile i knew i had no choice id have to draw him oh all right then i said with all the other pictures id started by spending some time looking at the person i didnt do that with grant i began drawing immediately and i only looked up at him when i had to and each time i did look at him he was looking at me it almost felt as if grant was the one doing the drawing youre a good artist grant told me suddenly and i nodded continuing with my work yes yes i said and im a bad tour leader i know you dont have to say it i wasnt going to say that actually grant surprised me by saying those drawings you did of everyone were very good thats all youre a good artist or are you one of those people who dont like people saying nice things about them i couldnt believe it was grant saying nice things about me that was the thing id always believed him to be an uncaring sort of man or maybe not uncaring exactly but the sort of man who didnt notice or think about how other people were feeling why dont you work as an artist he went on isnt there enough money in it i dont care about money i said then dont you believe in yourself grant went on yes i said no oh i dont know not enough perhaps look do you mind staying quiet i cant draw very well if im talking grant smiled ok he said but you should think about working as an artist i said nothing and just got on with my drawing but after a few more minutes i looked at my picture and shook my head it was all wrong it wasnt a caricature of grant at all i needed to start again so i put the first picture face down on the floor and took another piece of paper what was wrong with that one grant immediately wanted to know it just wasnt right i told him but that wasnt good enough for grant let me see it he said no i said i told you it isnt right now please be quiet i need to i know grant said you need to think i smiled thats right this time i sat for a while before i began to draw looking at grants face and thinking grant was a very strong person and he had a strong face he liked to be the boss he had to be the best and he always thought he was right as i looked at him i tried to think what animals were like that and then i began to smile to myself again i dont think i like that smile grant said but i just went on smiling and said nothing my pencil moving quickly over the paper here i said when the picture was finished i hope you like it but i didnt actually think grant would like the picture so i got up quickly and went to the tent entrance tess grant said behind me come back here but i didnt stop i just ran out into the rain laughing id drawn grant as two animals half big cat and half bull complete with a ring through his nose well that was just what he was like i thought grant might come after me but he didnt so i threw my drawing things into my tent and walked towards the trees by the river to find somewhere to go to the toilet on my way i went past astrids tent it was open and the rain was getting in i looked in to see if she was there astrid i called but the tent was empty i closed the front of the tent to keep the inside dry and continued walking towards the trees to tell the truth i was very worried about astrid shed been really sad when shed seen my caricature of her i was so stupid i always seemed to make her feel even worse about things poor woman where was she now it was still raining very hard she would be wet through as i went into the trees i looked around for her astrid i called softly are you out here there was no answer but suddenly i heard a noise something large had jumped or fallen into the water a few metres away now i was really worried astrid i shouted astrid and i hurried over to the river to take a look but i could see nothing it was too dark astrid i called again when there was still no answer i began to run back towards the tents to find grant the lamps were still on in the cooking tent i hurried inside grant was sitting where id left him looking at one of my drawings when he looked up at me he knew something was wrong the drawing fell to the ground as he got up what is it tess he asked its astrid i said i think shes jumped into the river grant got up immediately come on he said moving quickly past me we both hurried back towards the woods and the river where did you see her go in grant asked taking off his jacket just here i think i said as he began to take off his boots and trousers only i didnt really see her i just heard something but my words came too late grant had already jumped into the river i watched from the trees as grant swam through the cold water then suddenly he was under the water i put my hands to my mouth feeling very worried for both astrid and for grant time and time again grant went under the cold water looking for astrid after a while grant looked at me from the river i cant see anything he said tiredly are you sure it was here you saw her go in i was beginning to feel terrible well actually the thing is i started quietly what asked grant speak up tess i cant hear you i coughed well i said a bit more loudly i didnt actually see her go in at all grant looked at me what well i said i did try to tell you but you at that moment there was the sound of something getting out of the water further up the river grant and i both looked towards the noise so we both saw at the same moment a very large very wet dog which was running through the trees towards us after the dog had gone i looked at grant sorry i said but he said nothing and began to swim towards me through the dark water he was still quiet after hed got out and was putting his clothes on again im sorry grant i said again but he just walked away through the trees i hurried after him ill make you a nice hot cup of coffee i told him finally he spoke no thank you tess he said youd probably fall over and burn me with it i stopped trying then and followed him sadly through the trees until we got to the tents astrids tent was still closed i watched as grant got down on the ground to open it astrid he called softly and the next second the quiet of the night was broken by the sound of a woman screaming what is it what do you want go away its all right astrid grant said quickly its me grant i just wanted to go away astrid screamed again people began looking out of their tents to see what was going on astrid please grant said i just need to no im not interested in you do you understand get away from my tent all right all right grant said quickly closing the tent and getting to his feet then he saw everyone was looking at him its all right he said you can all go back to sleep then he looked at me talk to her will you after all you started this and he began to walk away ok i said feeling fed up he was right i had started all of this why hadnt i stopped to think or checked to see if astrid was back in her tent before i ran to grant like a wild woman astrid i said speaking through her tent its ok dont worry grant was just checking to see if you were safe thats what he says astrid replied through the tent but i have seen the way he looks at women no really astrid i said he was just even you tess astrid said he looks at you that way too you should be careful now good night i want to sleep i stood up slowly good night astrid after all that i found it difficult to get to sleep id made yet another big mistake because of me grant had jumped into a river for no good reason and now astrid thought he was a dangerous man i would have to try to explain it all to her again tomorrow but i wasnt sure she would believe me what was it shed said that grant looked at women that he looked at me was it true i hadnt seen him look at me like that there was something else i hadnt seen before as well it had hurt grant that astrid was afraid of him when hed walked away he hadnt just been angry hed been hurt it was a side of him i hadnt seen before and it made me think about him differently i turned over trying to get more comfortable in my sleeping bag but i still couldnt get to sleep i was thinking about drawing grant now the first drawing when i hadnt seen him as a big cat or a bull id drawn him just as he was a strong man yes a man who always thought he was right yes but a handsome man too that was why id stopped working on that picture it was because i thought it showed the way i felt about him you like him a voice said inside my head and suddenly i knew it was true grant often made me so angry i wanted to throw something at him but as i got to know him better i saw that he could be quite nice when he wanted to be i closed my eyes oh no i said to myself you cant like him like that you cant but i knew that i did chapter ten an unnecessary mountain we were a fairly quiet group the next morning when we set off for the days walk astrid didnt seem to want to talk to anyone i saw that she was making sure she stayed as far away from grant as possible i still wanted to explain to her what had really happened but it seemed a good idea to leave it for a while what was all that noise about last night ellen spoke quietly so the others couldnt hear but i didnt want to talk to her before id had the chance to speak to astrid nothing i said it was all a mistake what sort of mistake ellen asked i smiled at her i think we should forget about it i said tell me about your job ellen looked at me no thank you i came on holiday to forget about my job youre no fun anymore tess youre getting as bad as mr clock up there and she walked away oh dear still id been a tour leader for long enough to know it was impossible to please everybody all of the time however it would be good to please some people some of the time and at that moment everybody seemed unhappy but at least it wasnt raining but because wed all expected rain we were all wearing our raincoats and lots of clothes there were no trees on this part of the days walk and soon we were very hot under the burning sun the mountains were very beautiful but we were all too hot to enjoy them i caught up with sarah and james this weathers a bit of a change isnt it i said and sarah smiled at me weakly i think i liked the rain better she said sarahs feeling a bit tired james told me its tiring walking up a mountain every day were beginning to think this type of holiday was a mistake for our honeymoon we met on a wild country holiday sarah explained thats why we came we thought it would be nice but actually we just want to be alone and not to have to get up early james added everybodys very nice sarah said quickly its not that but nobody seems very happy i knew just what she meant i wasnt feeling very happy myself after last night well i said to james and sarah couldnt you stay in a hotel somewhere for a few nights and meet up with us later we thought of that james told me but we cant afford it were buying a house soon and we need all our money for that although wed still like you to paint us a picture tess yes said sarah of the mountains i smiled at them id love to i said youll have to give me your address ill send it to you when ive done it that would be great said james but in the meantime i said im sorry youre not enjoying your holiday sarah smiled oh well be ok dont worry about us we can always have a second honeymoon later on when were old and grey james smiled and sarah laughed sitting in our armchairs and looking at the mountains out of the window when james kissed her i dropped back to leave them alone they were a really nice couple i liked them a lot i wished i could do something for them up ahead i saw ellen was talking to mr clock grant hadnt said more than two words to me today was ellen having more luck with him probably but then she hadnt made him jump into a river had she i thought back to the evening in the cooking tent before everything had gone so badly wrong it had been fun drawing grant with him saying nice things about my work hed meant it too i knew he really did think i was a good artist and it meant a lot because he had said it this morning at breakfast although id sat quite a long way away from grant id seen every little thing hed done the way he held his spoon the way he put sugar in his coffee everything things were different today i didnt know what to say to grant any more i couldnt just be me anymore i felt like a schoolgirl who likes a boy in the same class as her and the sad thing was i knew grant would just laugh if he knew how i felt up ahead i heard ellen and grant laughing as i looked up at them i saw ellen touch grants arm when grant looked down at her with a smile i knew astrid was right grant liked looking at women just one girlfriend wasnt enough for him id better forget all about grant cooper by the middle of the afternoon i saw the village we were going to stay in that night down below us at the bottom of the mountain but to my surprise grant didnt begin to walk down towards it he started to lead the way up another very high mountain stop grant the old tess said in my head but the new tess said nothing she felt almost afraid to speak to grant it was stupid i knew but i didnt seem to be able to do anything about it i was feeling quite fed up actually i was very hot my legs hurt again and i was tired of watching ellen and grant together she was still touching his arm when she spoke to him and they were still laughing together all the time i was so busy with my dark thoughts that i didnt see that the sky had grown dark too before wed reached the top of the mountain it had started to rain heavily within moments we were wet through oh no said sarah as we all hurried to put on our raincoats this is a terrible holiday grant and ellen had waited for us its not far to the top grant said then we can go back down to the village and put the tents up everybody looked at him david was the one who finally spoke are you saying we didnt have to climb this mountain he asked no said grant we didnt really have to come up here but we were early and you can see a long way from the top we all looked over the side of the mountain all we could see was clouds and rain on a good day anyway grant added come on he said and continued walking up the mountain i wasnt sure everybody would follow him but they did nobody looked very happy when we got to the top and when we began the walk down i saw that davids leg was hurting him after wed put the tents up in the rain everybody stayed in their own tent for a while to rest and change their clothes i lay down and listened to the sound of the rain i was very tired and i think i went to sleep for a while because the next moment i heard somebody a woman shouting and it woke me up i sat up to listen it was ellen she was shouting at grant oh yes you did it had stopped raining now and i could hear her very well dont try to get out of it youve showed me that you like me as a woman you were laughing in that special way and looking at me like that all day whats the matter arent i pretty enough for you do you only like women with long blonde hair or something grant said something but his voice was quieter than ellens and i couldnt hear him but i could certainly hear what ellen said in reply that is not true grant cooper everybody knows you tried to get into astrids tent last night well good luck to her thats what i say shes welcome to you and with that i heard ellen leave grants tent and run to her own then everything was quiet at least it was quiet for a few minutes and then i heard someone else leave their tent when he gave a small cough i realised it was david excuse me grant he said can i have a quick word with you this time i could hear what grant said in reply because he didnt try to speak quietly why not everybody else seems to want to ill come out i heard the sound of grants tent opening what is it david he asked its about this afternoons walk i didnt want to go up a mountain that we didnt need to go up why didnt you tell us we want to choose i dont think its your job to choose for us as leader you should i tell you what said grant sounding angry i wont be the leader any more ok tess can be the leader i can see you all like her much more than you like me i put my head out of my tent in time to see grant walking away he gave me a quick look did you hear that tess over to you and off he went chapter eleven an important phone call nobody felt like cooking that evening and grant hadnt come back so we walked in a quiet unhappy group to the village to find somewhere to eat there was only one hotel but it looked nice enough so we went inside there was a free table by the window so we sat at it and looked at the menu it was still quite early and there werent many people in the restaurant perhaps thats why i noticed the woman behind the bar through the open restaurant door it was the woman from the flower market the woman with the white shoes difficult to believe i know but it was true it was her and she seemed to own the hotel well excuse me i said to everyone i wont be a minute and i went over to speak to the woman with the white shoes id thought of a plan to help sarah and james now that the woman wasnt angry about her shoes she was actually quite nice her name was marie she was certainly surprised when i told her about my idea but after a while she agreed to it i was really pleased at least one good thing might happen today i was just returning to the table to share the good news with sarah and james when the door opened grant came in when he saw us he looked as if he might go out again but there was nowhere else to eat in the village its all right he said walking past us ill go over there out of your way and we all watched as he crossed the room to sit on his own in a corner as he picked up a menu and started to look at it he looked really unhappy the further away the better said ellen yes agreed astrid as for david sarah and james they all just looked fed up and suddenly id had enough now look you lot i said sitting down in front of them this just isnt fair youre being horrible to grant he asked for it said ellen acting like that towards me and astrid and making david go up all those mountains when he didnt have to i looked at her coldly and is it grants fault it rained as well i asked or that this is the wrong holiday for some of you well ellen began but i didnt let her finish no i said just listen to me for a minute all of you they all looked at me nobody spoke astrid i said looking at her you were wrong grant came to your tent to check that you were ok thats all i was worried about you last night you seemed so sad i thought you had well it doesnt matter now what i thought i was worried thats all i didnt know where you were i told grant about it and he tried to help nothing else next i looked at ellen grant tries to be friendly to everyone its part of his job from what i heard you thought it meant more than that youre a lovely woman im sure lots of other men will be interested in you if grant isnt interested in you in that way thats no reason to hate him but ellen started to say but once again i didnt give her the chance to finish david i said looking at him next youre right grant should let you choose not to go up a mountain if you dont have to but on a sunny day it would be beautiful up there david nodded thats true he said sarah and james i said moving on they looked at me what have we done wrong tess sarah asked sounding worried i smiled nothing i said except choose the wrong holiday but ive found a way to put that right at least for a couple of nights how james asked yes how tess sarah added my smile grew even bigger marie i said nodding towards the hotel owner has agreed to let you stay here in the hotel for two nights she has a nice double room you can have sarah and james looked worried but we told you before tess james said we cant afford to pay for a hotel you dont have to pay i told them the room wont cost you anything but why sarah asked marie and i have met before i said i painted a picture of her she hasnt seen it yet its back at the hotel in nice but she liked the drawing i showed her she wants to put the picture up in the hotel i said she could have it if she let you have a room here sarah smiled oh tess she said we cant let you do that james said i smiled at them both i want to do it i said and then i stood up now if youll all excuse me im going to sit with grant i walked away from them feeling very good that id sorted everything out on the other side of the restaurant grant was still looking at the menu then suddenly i saw the hotel phone in the bar behind him and changed my mind grant could wait for a little while i had to speak to my father if i could talk to the group like that then i was strong enough to speak to my father as well dad answered almost straightaway tess how lovely how are you and how are you getting on with grant it wasnt an easy question to answer at that moment so i didnt try to everythings fine dad i said except except he said be brave tess i told myself be brave dad i dont want to work for wild country any more im really sorry but i cant do it i cant take over from you i need to do work thats right for me and working for the company just isnt right for me im going to be a fulltime artist hi after my phone call i went to sit at grants table he was still looking very fed up he looked at me for a moment then went back to studying the menu i thought he must know everything on it by now well done he said flatly for a moment i thought he was talking about the conversation id just had with my father well done for what i asked for winning of course he said people like you better than me so youre clearly a better tour leader than i am i sat and looked at him i wanted to reach out to push the hair away from his eyes he wasnt like a big cat or a bull at that moment he was more like a little boy it was never about winning i told him anyway i get lost remember you keep people happy he said but i cant make them get up on time in the morning i replied you help them to enjoy their holiday he said you help them to climb mountains they didnt know they could climb i said i knew you were the type of person who didnt like people saying nice things about them grant said finally looking at me i smiled at him ok thank you for those nice thoughts i said and its true i am good with people in some ways but im not good at organising them and a good tour leader has to be able to do that im not even good at organising myself thats what ive just been telling my father grant sounded surprised youve spoken to your father i nodded yes just now ive just told him that i dont want to work for wild country anymore grants eyes opened wide youre leaving he said i cant believe it why not i asked you were the one who told me i should be an artist thats what im going to do are you sure tess grant sounded worried now i know i said that but you shouldnt listen to what i say i dont know anything yes i said im sure its what ive wanted to do for ages i just needed to be brave and take that first step you helped me to do that thats all im going to go to art school to study painting grant thought about it for a moment well he said if youre really sure then well done again thats great what did your father say when you told him i made a face remembering the conversation it hadnt been easy for me to do it i hated disappointing my father but talking to him hadnt been quite as difficult as id expected it to be either thats why its taken me so long to say what i want i said to grant because i didnt want to hurt dad but he was ok about me being an artist really he said hed been waiting for me to say something for ages he didnt want to talk about the future himself because he wanted me to be sure i knew what i wanted but thats why he put you and me together on this tour because he thought seeing someone who was good at the job would help me decide what i wanted to do he knew that when i was really sure about being an artist i would be brave enough to speak to him good old dad i thought now how well he knows me and suddenly i felt like crying grant saw that my eyes were wet whats wrong he asked i thought youd be happy i took a handkerchief from my bag and blew my nose i am i said very happy ive got what i wanted havent i grant suddenly looked very serious he took my hand across the table and is that all you want tess he asked to be an artist my face was suddenly red i wanted to turn away from him but i made myself look into his eyes no i said i want i want us to be friends that is that is if you want that too grant didnt speak for a while he just sat there looking at me no he said at last that isnt what i want at all i looked at him feeling suddenly afraid had i really made him as angry as that so angry he didnt even want us to be friends grant still held my hand then he began to smile and i allowed myself to begin to hope that maybe just maybe everything would be ok tess he said youre a terrible tour leader and you often drive me mad you make me jump into rivers and get us lost in the mountains in the rain still smiling he let go of my hand and reached out to touch my face but the reason i dont want to be your friend he went on is because i like you i really like you and i want you to be my girlfriend chapter twelve mademoiselle van gogh it was so hot that the mountains were a smoky blue against the deep blue of the provencal sky down below me a field of flowers was dark purple against the orange buildings of a little village i knew id have to go soon so i worked quickly trying to make the right colours with the paints i had with me then suddenly i felt a strong hand on my shoulder and somebody kissed my cheek come on mademoiselle van gogh said my boyfriend weve got to get moving i put my paintbrush into the water and turned to kiss grant on the mouth ok ok mr clock i said there were shouts behind us come on you love birds lunch is over weve got mountains to climb it was the summer holidays and id returned to provence to work as a tour leader for wild country again or at least half a tour leader because grant was the other half he organised everybody and i kept them happy were a good team the end
