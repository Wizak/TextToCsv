tom the bootblack tom the bootblack chapter i introducing tom the bootblack how do you feel this morning jacob asked a boy of fifteen bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room in a poor tenementhouse distant less than a quarter of a mile from the new york city hall weak tom whined the old man in reply i i aint got much strength would you like some breakfast i i dont know breakfast costs money never you mind about that jacob i can earn money enough for both of us come now youd like some coffee and eggs wouldnt you there was a look of eager appetite in the old mans eyes as he heard the boy speak yes he answered i should like them but we cant afford it dont you be afraid of that ill go and ask mrs flanagan to get some ready at once ive earned thirty cents this morning already jacob and thatll pay for breakfast for the two of us i think i could eat some breakfast myself jacob uttered a feeble remonstrance but the boy did not stop to hear it he went down the rough staircase and knocked at the door of the room below it was opened by a stout wholesomelooking irish woman who saluted the boy heartily well tom and hows your grandfather this mornin hes weak mrs flanagan but hell be the better for some breakfast and so shall i ill go and buy half a dozen eggs if youll be kind enough to cook them and make some coffee for us ill pay you for your trouble of course i will tom and for the eggs you neednt go out for ive got the same in the closet but im short of bread and if youll buy a loaf ill have the coffee and eggs ready in no time while tom is on his way to the bakers shop a few words of explanation and description may be in place first for our hero i have already said he was fifteen let me add that he was stout and strongly built with an open prepossessing face and the air of one who is ready to fight his own battles without calling for assistance his position in life is humble for he is a street bootblack he has served by turns at other vocations but he has found none of them pay so well as this he has energy and enterprise and few of his comrades secure so many customers as he for years he has lived with the old man introduced as jacob and is popularly regarded as his grandson but jacob has never made claim to that relationship nor has he ever volunteered any information to the boy as to what originally brought them together occasionally tom has tried to obtain some information but on such occasions jacob has been very reticent and has appeared for some reason unwilling to speak so by degrees tom has given up asking questions and has been much more concerned about the means of living than about his pedigree jacob has done little or nothing for their common support though at times greatly to the annoyance of tom he has gone out on the street and asked alms tom being highspirited and independent has resented this and has always interfered in a very decided manner to prevent jacobs figuring as a beggar though only a bootblack he has an honest independence of feeling in which any one is justified who works however humbly for his support old jacob is moreover a miser so far as he can be whatever money he may have acquired by begging he has kept at all events he has offered nothing of it for the common expenses but tom has not troubled himself about this he suspects that jacob may have a few dollars secreted somewhere but is perfectly willing he should keep them for his own satisfaction his earnings average over a dollar a day and with this sum he is able to pay the small rent of their humble apartment and buy their food in ten minutes tom reappeared with a loaf under his arm the door of mrs flanagans room was partly open and he entered without ceremony the good woman was bustling about preparing the eggs the coffeepot was already on the stove itll be ready in a minute tom she said a cup of hot coffeell do the poor craythur yer grandfather a power of good so hes fable is he yes mrs flanagan he wont last long to my thinkin do you think hes going to die asked tom thoughtfully yes poor craythur its all he can do to drag himself up and down stairs i shall be sorry to have him die said tom though i dont believe hes any relation to me isnt he your grandfather then asked mrs flanagan in surprise no he never said he was then what makes the two of you live together maybe hes your uncle though he looks too old for that i dont think hes any relation all i know is ive lived with him ever since i was so high and tom indicated with his hand the height of a boy of six then hes never told you anything no ive asked him sometimes but he didnt seem to want to speak when tom reentered the room he found the old man crouching in the corner as at first come jacob he said cheerfully get up ive got some breakfast for you the old mans features lighted up as he inhaled the grateful odor of the coffee and he rose with some effort to his feet and seated himself at the little table on which our hero placed it now jacob said tom cheerfully ill pour you out a cup of coffee mrs flanagan made it and its bully itll put new life into you then what do you say to a plate of eggs and some roll i havent got any butter but you can dip it in your coffee now isnt this a nice breakfast yes tom said the old man surveying the coffee and eggs with eyes of eager desire its nice but we cant afford to live so all the time never you mind about that we can afford it this morning so dont spoil your appetite with thinkin how much it costs now said tom after he had helped the old man i dont mind takin something myself i aint troubled with a delicate appetite specially when ive been up and at work for two hours did you make much tom well i aint made my fortune yet ive earned thirty cents but ill make it up to a dollar before noon youre a good boy tom said the old man approvingly dont be afraid of work id work too if i wasnt so old it costs a sight to live and i dont earn a cent there aint no need of it jacob i can earn enough for the two of us im young and strong you are old and weak when im an old man like you i wont want to work no more i aint so very old said jacob jealously im only turned sixtyfive theres a good many years of life in me yet of course there is jacob said tom though as he looked at his companions thin wasted face and shaking hand he felt very doubtful on this point my father lived to be seventyfive said jacob so will you said tom though to the boy of fifteen sixtyfive appeared a very advanced age and but little younger than eighty ill be stronger soon said jacob the weather aint suited me thats it jacob now let me give you another cup of coffee it goes to the right spot dont it dont you be afraid theres plenty of it so he filled jacobs cup once more and the old man drank the contents with evident relish now dont you feel better asked tom why you look ten years youngern you did before you sat down theres nothing like a bully breakfast to make a feller feel tiptop yes i do feel better said jacob i i think youre right tom if i was rich id always have a good breakfast so you shall now jacob it dont cost much now lie down again and ill take these dishes down to mrs flanagan tom speedily reappeared and said cheerfully if theres nothing more you want jacob ill go out and look out for work mrs flanagan will bring you up some toast at noon and ill be back at six oclock all right tom go to work theres a good boy it costs a sight of money to live tom seized his blackingbox and hurried down stairs he had delayed longer than he intended and was resolved to make up for lost time chapter ii struck down no sooner had tom left the room than the old man rose slowly from his couch and walking feebly to the door bolted it then going to a corner of the room he lifted a plank from the flooring and thrusting his hand beneath drew up a tin box he opened this with a small key which he wore about his neck suspended by a cord and revealed a heap of silver and copper coins filling the box twothirds full upon this his eyes were fixed with eager and gloating satisfaction its all mine he muttered joyfully tom doesnt know about it he mustnt know he might want me to spend it i will count it he took it out by handfuls and began to count it for at least the hundredth time putting together coins of similar value in little piles till there was a circle of silver and copper about him it was a work of time for the old man and probably half an hour was consumed before he had finished his task ninetynine dollars he exclaimed in alarm at the end of the calculation somebody has robbed me i ought to have twentyfive cents more could tom have got at the box maybe i have made a mistake i will count again with nervous fingers he recommenced the count fearing that he had met with a loss he was half through his task when a knock was heard at the door the old man started in agitation and glanced apprehensively at the door whos there he asked in quivering accents its i answered a hearty voice which jacob readily recognized as that of mrs flanagan you cant come in said the old man peevishly what do you want i only came to ask how ye are and if i can do anything for ye no you cant im well no im sick and id rather be left alone all right said the good woman in no wise offended for she pitied the old man if you want anything jist stomp on the floor and ill hear ye and come up yes said jacob hastily now go down thats a good woman i want to go to sleep poor craythur said mrs flanagan to herself its little he enjoys the world which is a blessin as he will soon have to lave it i hope she isnt looking through the keyhole thought jacob in alarm she might see my money but the footsteps of the good woman descending the stairs came to his ears and reassured him its well i locked the door he said to himself i wouldnt want it known that i had all this money or it wouldnt be safe its taken me a long time to get it and it isnt quite a hundred dollars if i had seventyfive cents more he had by this time found the missing quarter it would make just a hundred if tom wouldnt mind i could get it easily by begging i might have it by tomorrow i wonder if he would care much muttered the old man as he put back the coins carefully into the tin box i i think ill go out a little while hell never know it by this time he had locked the box and replaced it beneath the flooring restoring the plank to its original place ill lie down a little while till i feel strong he muttered then ill go out if i go up on broadway tom wont see me he ought not to mind my begging i am too weak to work and its the only way i can get money he lay down on the bed and after his exertion small as it was the rest was grateful to him but the thought haunted him continually that he needed but seventyfive cents to make up his hoard to a hundred dollars and the eager desire prompted him to forsake his rest and go out into the streets after awhile he rose from his bed i am rested enough now he said i think i can go out for a little while i will get back before tom comes home he took an old battered hat from a nail on which it hung and with feeble step left the room grasping the banister to steady his steps as he descended the stairs mrs flanagans door was open and though the old man made but little noise she heard it she lifted both hands in amazement when she saw him shure ye are too wake to go out said she come now go up and lie on the bed till ye are better tomll be mad if he knows ye have gone out ye neednt tell him said jacob hastily i want to breathe the fresh air itll do me good shure youre not fit to go alone ill send my mike wid you hes only six but hes a smart lad id rather go alone said jacob who was afraid the little boy would report his begging i i am stronger than you think i wont be gone long mrs flanagan saw that he was obstinate and she did not press the point but after he had got down stairs she called mike and said mike dear go after the old man and see where he goes but dont you let him see you ill give you a penny to buy candy when you get back mike was easily persuaded for he had the weakness for candy common to boys of his age of whatever grade and he proceeded to follow his mothers directions when jacob got to the foot of the lowest staircase he felt more fatigued than he expected but his resolution remained firm he must have the seventyfive cents before night tomorrow he could rest let him but increase his hoard to a hundred dollars and he would be content it was not without a painful effort that he dragged himself as far as broadway though the distance was scarcely quarter of a mile little mike followed him partly because his mother directed him to do it partly because young as he was he was curious to learn where jacob was going and what he was going to do his curiosity was soon gratified he saw the old man remove his battered hat and hold it out in mute appeal to the passersby it was not long before jacob received ten cents whats the matter with you asked another passerby five minutes later im sick and poor whined jacob well theres something for you and the old man to his joy found his hoard increased twentyfive cents this he put into his pocket thinking that he would be more likely to inspire compassion and obtain fresh contributions if only the ten cents were visible he did not get another contribution as large still more than one passerby attracted by his wretched look dropped something into his hat till the sum he desired was made up he had secured the seventyfive cents necessary to make up the hundred dollars but his craving was not satisfied he thought he would stay half an hour longer and secure a little more he was tired but it would not take long and he could rest long enough afterward an unlucky impulse led him to cross the street to the opposite side which he fancied would be more favorable to his purpose i say unlucky for he was struck down when half way across by some stage horses and trampled under foot there was a rush to his rescue and he was lifted up and carried into a neighboring shop does anybody know who he is or where he lives asked a policeman i know him said little mike who had witnessed the accident and followed the crowd in his name is old jacob and he lives in carters alley is there anybody to take care of him any wife or daughter asked the physician mike explained that he had only a grandson and the physician thereupon directed that he be carried to bellevue hospital while mike ran home to bear the important news to his mother chapter iii a street fight tom of course knew nothing of jacobs accident he fancied him safe at home and was only concerned to make enough money to pay the necessary expenses of both he felt little anxiety on this score as he was of an enterprising disposition and usually got his fair share of business he stationed himself near the astor house and kept an eye on the boots of all who passed promptly offering his services where they appeared needed of course there were long intervals between his customers but in the course of two hours he had made fifty cents which he regarded as doing fairly finally a gentleman rather tall and portly descended the steps of the astor house and bent his steps in toms direction shine yer boots asked tom the gentleman looked down upon the face of the boy and a sudden expression swept over his own as if he were surprised or startled his boots were tolerably clean but after a moments hesitation he said yes tom was instantly on his knees first spreading a piece of carpet about a foot square to kneel upon and set to work with energy how long have you been in this line of business boy asked his customer four or five years answered tom do you like it i have to like it said tom ive got to do somethin for a livin bread and meat dont grow on trees whats your name asked the stranger abruptly tom havent you got but one name tom greys my whole name but everybody calls me tom grey did you say your name was grey asked the stranger in a tone of some excitement yes said tom surprised at the gentlemans tone in his surprise he looked up into his customers face and for the first time took notice of it this was what he saw a square face with a heavy lower jaw grizzled whiskers and cold gray eyes but there was something besides that served to distinguish it from other faces a scar of an inch in length on his right cheek which though years old always looked red under excitement grey repeated the stranger is your father living i dont know said tom if he is hes too busy to call round and see me you mean that you dont know anything about your father thats about so said tom im ready to adopt a rich gentleman as a father if its agreeable and he looked up with a smile in the face of his customer but the latter did not respond to the joke but looked more and more serious that smile he said to himself he is wonderfully like is it possible that this boy can be but here he stopped and left the sentence unfinished are you sure your name is tom asked the stranger why shouldnt it be demanded the boy in natural surprise to be sure returned the gentleman only i have a theory that there is a connection between faces and names and you dont look like my idea of tom this was rather philosophical to be addressed to a new york bootblack but tom was smart enough to comprehend it if i dont look like tom what do i look like he asked john or henry or or gilbert said the gentleman bringing out the last name after a slight pause i like tom best said the boy its short and easy do you live alone or have you any friends asked the stranger i live with an old man but he aint any relation to me whats his name jacob what other name asked the customer quickly tom had by this time completed his task and was standing erect facing the speaker hes got an inquirin mind thought tom but though rather surprised at the questions he had no objection to answer them i dont know he said dont know he never told me maybe its grey like mine some call him my grandfather but he isnt it is he thought the stranger but things are well as they are he knows nothing and need know nothing i am safe enough since between us there is a great gulf of ignorance and more than a thousand miles of space well my boy he said aloud i suppose you want to be paid thats whats the matter answered tom the stranger put in his hand a half dollar and tom plunging his hand in his pocket prepared to give change never mind said his late customer with a wave of his hand thanks said tom and he mentally wished he might be as well paid every day for answering questions tom shouldered his box and walked a few steps down broadway it was some time before another customer appeared and meanwhile another bootblack came up the name of the newcomer was pat walsh he enjoyed a bad reputation among his comrades as one who would take a mean advantage if he dared and was at all times ready to bully a smaller boy he had long cherished an ill feeling toward tom because the latter had interfered on one occasion to protect a smaller boy whom pat tried to cheat out of a job as toms prowess was well known pat had contented himself hitherto with uttering threats which he hesitated to carry into execution it was shrewdly suspected by his companions that he was afraid to contend with tom and they had taunted him with it finding his authority diminishing pat decided to force a quarrel upon tom at the first opportunity he had no great appetite for the fight but felt it to be a disagreeable necessity just as he came up a gentleman approached with a valise in his hand his boots were decidedly dirty and he was hailed as a prize by the bootblacks shine yer boots exclaimed tom and pat simultaneously i dont know but they need brushing said the traveler instantly both bootblacks were on their knees before him ready to proceed to business i dont need both of you he said smiling take me said pat ill give you a bully shine ill give you the bulliest said tom good humoredly i spoke first lave wid yer or ill mash yer said pat better not try it said tom not in the least intimidated the gentleman will choose between us ill choose you said the traveler decidedly more prepossessed by toms appearance than by that of his competitor there was no appeal from this decision and pat rose to his feet his face wearing a very ugly scowl he remained standing near while tom was engaged with his job watching him with an aspect which betokened mischief thank you sir said tom as he received pay for his services the customer had no sooner left the spot than pat strode up to tom i want that money he said menacingly do you returned tom coolly as he thrust it into his vest pocket for unlike the majority of his companions he indulged in the luxury of a vest yes i do it was my job i dont see it i spoke first the gentleman chose me you stuck yourself in where you wasnt wanted give me the money come and take it said tom unconsciously making the same answer that was once returned by a heroic general to an insolent demand for surrender ill do it then said pat who had been nursing his rage till he was grown reckless of consequences he threw down his box and sprang at tom the latter also quickly rid himself of the incumbrance and the two were soon wrestling at close quarters pat by his impetuous onset came near upsetting his adversary but by an effort tom saved himself then commenced a determined contest both boys were unusually strong for their ages and were in fact very evenly matched but at length tom by an adroit movement of the foot tripped his opponent and came down on top of him he did not hold him down for he was fond of fair play but rose immediately you didnt do it i slipped said pat in anger and mortification and he instantly threw himself upon tom again but our hero kept cool while pat was excited and this placed him at an advantage so the second contest terminated like the first cheers from a crowd of boys greeted this second victory cheers to which pat listened with mortification and rage he was half tempted to renew the battle but a cry from the boys a cop a cop warned him of the approach of his natural enemy the policeman and he walked sullenly away breathing threats of future vengeance to which tom paid very little attention five minutes later little mike flanagan came up and pulled tom by the arm whats the matter mike asked tom seeing that the little boy looked excited your grandfathers been run over wid a horse said the little boy not very intelligibly run over exclaimed tom how can that be when he was at home on the bed he went out soon after you and was beggin on broadway where is he now asked tom quickly he was took to the hospital said mike chapter iv at the hospital on a neat bed at the bellevue hospital old jacob was stretched out he had been in considerable pain but opiates had been administered and he was in an uneasy slumber tom presented himself at the office below as soon as he could after hearing of the accident is he much hurt is he in danger he asked anxiously for jacob was nearer to him than any one else he is now sleeping and must not be disturbed come tomorrow and we can tell you more was the reply you can tell me if he was much hurt one leg is broken but we cannot yet tell whether he has received any internal injury all depends upon that tom presented himself the next day this time the physician looked grave we have reason to think that he is injured internally his life is uncertain poor jacob murmured tom moved by pity for the old man is he your grandfather asked the physician no but i have lived with him for some years can i see him yes tom followed the doctor into a long hall lined with beds about midway on the left hand side he recognized the form of his old companion i am sorry to see you here jacob said tom gently im almost dead said the old man peevishly the man drove over me on purpose i hope not i tell you he did said jacob irritably well jacob it cant be helped you must try to get well im an old man im afraid i shall never get well again and he looked eagerly into toms face having heard what he did from the doctor tom was placed in an awkward position he was too honest to give false hopes and he remained silent what did the doctor tell you demanded jacob suspiciously he said he could not tell whether you would get well or not he thought i was going to die said the old man nervously he didnt say that i dont want to die moaned the old man terrified im only sixtyfive my father lived to be seventyfive you may live jacob i im not ready to die ask the doctor to do all he can he will be sure to do that there was a pause the old mans features were convulsed he had not till now thought that he was in danger of dying he was trying to realize the terrible fact tom stood by in silence for he had some idea of jacobs feelings and he pitied him at length the old man turned his face again toward him and said tom what is it jacob i want you to ask the doctor every day if he thinks i am going to die and when he says there is no hope tell me yes jacob do you promise yes i promise there is something i must tell you before i die something important do you hear yes i hear its something you ought to know now you can go i want to sleep perhaps it is something about my father thought tom with vague curiosity it was a matter that he had never troubled himself much about but now it did occur to him that he should like to know a little more about himself he determined to keep faithfully the promise he had made the old man he was destined to have one more adventure before the day closed on leaving the hospital tom directed his course to broadway it was the busiest part of the day and the street was crowded with stages drays and other vehicles making it difficult to cross a humpbacked seamstress stood on the sidewalk looking helplessly across but not daring to venture on the perilous passage there was no policeman in sight i wish i could get across she said loud enough to be heard mother wont know what has become of me tom saw her anxious face and stepped up at once i will take you across miss he said politely will you she asked her face brightening i shall be very much obliged to you my poor mother is sick at home waiting for some medicine i went out to get for her and i have been standing here ten minutes not daring to cross i dont know when broadway has been so full take my arm said tom and dont be afraid she had scarcely taken our heros arm when a rude streetboy called out in derision is that your girl tom ask her what she will take for her hump ill lick you when i come back retorted tom dont mind what he says miss i dont said the seamstress im used to it she added with a patient sigh dont think about it said tom you are not ashamed to be seen with a hunchback there aint no cause by this time tom had skillfully threaded his way with his companion across the street and landed her in safety on the other side i am very much obliged to you she said gratefully youre a gentleman with these words she nodded and walked hastily away a gentleman repeated tom thoughtfully nobody ever called me that before my cloes dont look much like it maybe it aint all in the cloes id like to be a gentleman and he added impulsively i mean to be one some time ill have to change my business fust though gentlemen dont generally black boots for a livin it was a passing thought that came to him by chance his desire to grow up a gentleman but he was more than half in earnest he had not thought much about the future hitherto but now his ambition was kindled and he thought he should like to fill a respectable place in society what road should he take to the success which he coveted chapter v the last interview two weeks passed away tom went about his business as usual but every day he made it a point to call at the hospital to inquire how jacob was getting on at first the answers were moderately encouraging but a turn came and the doctor spoke less hopefully finally tom was told that the old man could not live how soon will he die he asked he may live fortyeight hours but it is possible that the end may come sooner then i must see him and tell him i promised him i would it may be well to do so if he has anything to tell you before he dies no time should be lost when tom approached jacobs bedside he saw from his changed appearance that the doctors had told him truly he was not used to the sight of those who were very sick but soon to an inexperienced observer the signs of approaching death were plain tom in the full vigor of perfect health regarded his old companion with awe and pity how do you feel this morning jacob he asked i am very weak said the old man faintly are you in much pain no the pain has gone away if i can get stronger i shall soon be out again he did not realize that this relief from pain was only a sign that nature had succumbed at last and that death had gained the victory tom hated to dispel the illusion but it must be done jacob he said slowly and sadly i have got something to tell you what is it said the old man in alarm it is something that the doctor told me just now he he didnt say i was going to die asked jacob agitated yes he said you could not live a low and feeble wail burst from the old mans lips i cant die he said im not ready im only sixtyfive he he may be mistaken dont you think i look better this morning you look very sick i dont want to die wailed the old man its only a little while since i was a boy did did he say how long i could live he said you might live fortyeight hours fortyeight hours only two days are you sure he said that yes jacob i wish i could do anything to make you live longer youre a good boy tom i im afraid i havent been a good friend to you yes you have jacob we have always been good friends but i helped do you a great wrong i hope you will forgive me i dont know what it is but i will forgive you jacob then perhaps heaven will forgive me too ill do all i can ill leave you all my money tom did not pay much regard to this promise for he did not know that jacob had any money beyond a few shillings or possibly a few dollars thank you jacob he said but i can earn enough to pay my expenses very well dont trouble yourself about me theres no one else to leave it to said the old man it isnt much but you shall have it here he drew out with trembling fingers the key suspended to a piece of twine which through all his sickness he had carried around his neck he held it in his hand a moment and a spasm convulsed his pale features to give it up seemed like parting with life itself it was a final parting with his treasure to which small though it was his heart clung even in this solemn moment he held it reluctant to give it up though he knew now that he must take this key tom he said it is the key to my box of gold i didnt know you had a box of gold said tom rather surprised it is not much a hundred dollars if i had lived longer i might have got more a hundred dollars jacob i did not think you were so rich it will never do me any good said the old man bitterly i was a fool to go out in the street that day i might have lived to be as old as my father he was seventyfive when he died tom would like to have comforted him but he would give him no hope of life and that was what the old man longed for where is the box of money he asked seeking to divert jacobs mind as well as to gain a necessary piece of information it is under the floor of the room you lift up a board just before you get to the pantry and you will see a tin box underneath you will find something else in it tom it is a paper in which i wrote down all i know about you you said you would forgive me for wronging you yes jacob perhaps you can get back your rights but i am afraid not my rights repeated tom bewildered yes i cant tell you about it i am too weak the paper will tell you the old man began to show signs of exhaustion the excitement of learning his hopeless condition and the conversation which he had already held with tom had overtasked his feeble strength and he showed it by his appearance i am afraid i have staid too long jacob said tom considerately i will go now but i will come back tomorrow morning you wont look for the box till i am gone tom said the old man anxiously i the doctors might be wrong and if i get well i would want it back again no jacob i will not look for it while you are alive promise me said jacob suspicious to the last where money was concerned i promise jacob dont be troubled i would rather have you live than take all the money good boy said jacob faintly as his head sank back on the pillow tom left the hospital ward with one last glance of compassion at the miserable old man who clung to life which had so little that is ordinarily counted agreeable with despairing hope it was the last time he was to see jacob alive the next day when he called to inquire after the old man he was told that he was dead he sank steadily after his last interview with our hero and having parted with the key to his treasure it seemed as if there was nothing left to live for chapter vi the revelation tom had already made up his mind upon one point he would accept the bequest of his old companion since in so doing he was robbing no one better entitled to it so far as he knew the old man had no relatives or friends except himself but he was determined that since jacob had money he should not be buried at the public expense he would take so much of the hundred dollars as might be necessary and place it in the hands of the doctor at bellevue hospital to defray the expenses of jacobs funeral he would say nothing about it however till he had actually found the money it might be a hallucination of jacobs and have no real existence when will he be buried he inquired at the hospital day after tomorrow how much will it cost do not trouble yourself about that said the physician who judged that tom was poor that will be done at the expense of the city but said tom conscientiously he left a little money at least he told me so if i find it i will pay out of it whatever it costs it is not necessary i would rather do it that is if i find the money it didnt do him any good while he was alive and he lost his life in getting a part of it then if you find this money you may pay the expense of the coffin how much will that be from ten to fifteen dollars i will bring you fifteen dollars tomorrow said tom of course tom might easily have saved this money and applied it to his own use but his feeling was one that did him credit as he had for years supported jacob he had of course spent for him much more than the hundred dollars and so might have considered himself justly entitled to all the money but this thought never occurred to him after leaving the hospital tom went home at once it was his duty now to ascertain whether jacob had labored under a delusion or whether he really possessed the money he had spoken of entering the room he locked the door from motives of prudence then following the directions of the old man he went to the part of the room indicated and getting down on his knees soon found the board beneath which the treasure lay carefully removing it he lifted from beneath the box already described by means of the key he opened it and there lay before him bright and glittering the scanty treasure which had been so dear to the old mans heart but to tom it did not seem scanty brought up as he had been in the hard school of poverty it seemed like quite a fortune and he was filled with surprise at jacobs having accumulated so much but the old man had taken advantage of toms absence during the day to go out on frequent begging expeditions whenever he had obtained enough to amount to a gold piece he was in the habit of carrying it to a brokers and effecting an exchange so little by little he had obtained a hundred dollars ninety of which were in gold the remainder in silver tom deliberated what he should do with his treasure he determined until his plans were formed to leave it in the box taking out only fifteen dollars to be carried to the hospital to defray the burial expenses but there was something else besides the money to seek jacob had mentioned a paper in which he had written out something of toms previous history including an account of the manner in which he had wronged him this paper was also easily found it was folded once and lay flat on the bottom of the box it was somewhat discolored but on opening it tom found the writing quite legible it may be a matter of surprise that tom was able to read the manuscript as many in his position would have been unable to do but he had of his own accord for several winters attended the city evening schools and so was not only able to read and write but also had some knowledge of arithmetic and geography i do not claim that tom was a good scholar but he was not wholly ignorant he took the paper from the box and then locking it replaced it in its former place of concealment he then sat down on a chair and began to read the manuscript ten years since it began i was a clerk in the employ of john and james grey in cincinnati they were merchants in prosperous business but john was much the richer of the two james was in fact a poor relation who had been taken in first as a clerk afterward as a partner with a small interest but his profits and share of the business were small compared with those of the senior partner john was a thorough gentleman and a liberal and excellent man i always got on well with him and i shall never forgive myself for wickedly consenting to do harm to him and his i would not have done it if it had not been in a manner forced upon me but i know that this is not a full excuse james grey i never liked he was a more pompous man than his cousin and he was often mistaken for the senior partner because of the airs he put on but john grey only smiled at this and often said jokingly you ought to have been in my place james i am afraid i dont keep up the dignity of the establishment i am too quiet to me who was only a clerk though an old and trusted one james was always supercilious and overbearing he seemed to look down upon me though having only a small interest in the concern i didnt look upon him as very much my superior john grey was far different he always treated me with kindness and politeness and i felt it a pleasure to serve such a man it was a great grief to me when he died i knew well enough that i should feel the change but i did nor dream of what actually followed john greys death took everybody by surprise he was a stout robust man and seemed the picture of health but it was in this habit of body that his danger lay he was found one day on the floor of his chamber dead his death resulting as the doctors said from apoplexy he left considerable property besides his share in the business all this was left to his son then a boy of five years of age the boys name was gilbert you tom are that boy let me tell you how it happened that you the son of a wealthy father and the heir to great wealth are now a poor bootblack in the streets of new york with no prospects before you but a life of labor according to your fathers will the whole property was left to his cousin james grey in trust for you but in case of your death your guardian was to inherit the whole of the property if john grey had known more of the selfish and worthless character of his cousin he would never have made such a will but he had perfect confidence in him and judged him by himself he did not see that he had exposed him to a very strong temptation a temptation which as it proved he was unable to resist mr james grey who was boarding with his wife and son a boy of about your own age immediately moved to your fathers beautiful house and installed himself there taking you under his charge for several months matters went on quietly and i began to think that i had misjudged my new employer but i did not know the trouble that was in store for me first my whole property a few thousand dollars which i had saved had been intrusted to a gentleman in whom i had confidence and by him invested for me he failed dishonestly as i suspect and so all my savings were lost troubles never come singly so they say and so i found out while i was almost crushed under this blow another fell upon me one morning some valuable securities belonging to the firm were missing of course they were sought for and as a matter of form so mr grey said the desks of all in the establishment were searched what was my horror when the missing securities were found in my desk of course this was ruin my reputation my future were in the hands of james grey i could not account for the discovery knowing my innocence but i now feel sure that my employer put the papers in my desk himself instead of arresting me he told me to come up to his house that evening i came i protested my innocence he asked me pointedly if i could prove it i told him no then he said that he had a plan in view if i could aid him he would forgive my offense and would not have me arrested cautiously he unfolded the plan and it was this in consideration of five thousand dollars in gold i was to carry you off by night and sail with you to australia changing your name to tom and must agree nevermore to bring you back to america or let you know who you were of course i knew that this was only a plot to get possession of the property and i told him so he freely admitted it to me but coolly threatened me with the severest punishment of the law for my supposed crime if i disclosed it or refused to aid him well the result of it all was that i agreed to his terms it was arranged as had been agreed on and i left cincinnati secretly with you under my charge arriving in new york i sailed for australia under an assumed name but when i arrived i didnt like the country after a year i took passage in a vessel bound for new york we were wrecked and all my money was lost we were saved by a vessel bound for the same port and at length reached it penniless how we have lived since you know as well as i do it has been a wretched life but i never dared to write to mr grey lest he should have me arrested for embezzling the securities but i have often hoped that retribution would come upon him and that you might be restored to your rights i have heard that he closed up the business and removed farther west having proved by a witness whom he bribed that you had been drowned in the ohio river the body of a poor boy was exhibited as yours if you ever meet james grey you will recognize him by this description he is a large man with a square face gray eyes and a scar on his right cheek an inch long i dont know where he got the scar but it is always red especially when he is excited tom dropped the paper in his amazement why he soliloquized it must be the man whose boots i blacked one morning before the astor house he must have knowed me or he wouldnt have asked so many questions chapter vii tom turns over a new leaf the communication which he had just read gave tom much to think of up to this time he knew nothing of his past history now a clear light was thrown upon it and it remained for him to decide what he would do he knew as much as this that the man who had wronged him was still living where he lived was unknown that was the first thing to discover the next was to make him disgorge the property of which he was in unlawful possession it seemed wonderful to tom to reflect that if he had his rights he would be heir to a large fortune theres a lot of money lyin around loose somewheres that belongs to me said tom to himself blest if it dont seem like a dream id like to set eyes on that old feller with a scar again tom leaned his head on his hand and devoted five minutes to reflection during that brief interval he made up his mind what to do he would leave new york giving up his business into other hands and set his face westward in search of his fraudulent guardian and his fortune he might have been embarrassed about this but for the opportune legacy of old jacob it wasnt very large but it would at all events start him on his journey then he must trust to luck and his own exertions for the rest he was not in the least afraid but that he could get along he had supported himself for years and he knew he could again i may as well warn my young readers here that there is no occasion for them to forsake comfortable homes to follow toms example circumstances alter cases and what was right for tom would not be right for them i have in mind the case of two boys who left comfortable homes in quest of adventure without any good reason and were very glad to get back again in a few days without a penny in their pockets utterly unsuccessful if fortune drives you out do your best but never leave a good home when you are well off or you will repent it ill take some of this money said tom to himself and buy some cloes i aint goin to travel in these rags considerin im heir to a fortune ill dress respectable tom withdrew fifty dollars from the misers hoard then went to the hospital and left fifteen dollars to defray the expenses of jacobs burial its the last i can do for him thought tom i hope if i live to be as old as he was somebodyll do as much for me the thought of his old companion made him sad for the moment but his mind was full of his future plans and he quickly became cheerful again before going to buy new clothes it struck tom that it would be a good plan to take a bath i should not like to say how long it was since he had washed himself all over but it is well known that excessive neatness is not a characteristic of streetboys it had never troubled tom much to have a spot of blacking on his face or to see his hands bearing the traces of the business by which he made his living now however he determined to turn over a new leaf im going to set up for a gentleman he said and i must look respectable there was a hotel near by where warm and cold baths were provided to the general public at twentyfive cents apiece he made his way thither and entered the barber shop adjoining just before him was a gentleman who inquired for a bath and was led into the adjoining apartment when the attendant came back tom went up to him well boy whats wanted he asked i want a warm bath answered tom boldly you exclaimed the attendant surveying the boy in alarm yes said tom dont you think i need it i should say you did returned the other how long since you took one i cant exactly remember said tom did you ever take a bath in your life thats a leadin question said tom i never took any except at the fifth avenoo hotel theyve got bully baths there have they then i think youd better go there now its too far off and im in a hurry im invited to dine with the mayor and i wouldnt like to go dirty if you bathe here we shall charge you double price how much is that fifty cents well i am rich i can afford it money payable in advance all right said tom heres fifty cents im a young man of fortun though i dont look like it ive been bootblackin for a joke when i come in to my money ill get shaved here regular youre a case said the attendant laughing thats so said tom now just show me the bathtub and give me a bar of soap and ill get my moneys worth the attendant led the way to the bathroom first collecting the fifty cents which he had decided to charge the water was turned on and tom went to work energetically to wash off the stains and dirt which in the course of his streetlife he had contrived to accumulate tom never did anything by halves and he set himself to work with a will sparing neither strength nor soap the result was that he effected a very great change for the better i wish id got some better cloes to put on he thought as with reluctance he drew on the ragged attire which had served him for some months getting more ragged and dirty every day ill buy some as soon as i get out he surveyed himself in the mirror and his long unkempt locks attracted his attention i must have my hair cut he decided on his way out he saw a vacant chair and seated himself in it do you want to be shaved asked one of the barbers not today said tom you may cut off some of my wool mind you give me a fashionable cut oh ill take care of that said the journeyman if you do whats right said tom ill recommend all my friends on fifth avenoo to come here is that the fifth avenue style of coat asked the barber pointing to several large holes in toms most prominent article of dress its a dress i wore to a masquerade ball last evenin said tom i went in the character of a bootblack you made a pretty good imitation said the knight of the scissors who had already commenced operations on toms head thats what all the ladies told me said tom they said they wouldnt have knowed me from the genooine article in about twenty minutes the task was completed hows that said the barber tom looked in the mirror and hardly recognized his image so much was it altered by the careful arrangement of his hair if it wasnt for the cloes he said i would think it was another boy he paid his bill and left the hotel the next thing must be some new cloes he said to himself then ill begin to feel respectable chapter viii the effect of a new suit tom bent his steps in the direction of a large and popular clothing establishment and entering looked about for an unoccupied salesman well boy whats wanted asked a young man behind the counter i want some cloes then youve come to the right place did you buy them you have on here asked the salesman with a grin young feller said tom these cloes were bought before you were born so i should think from the looks id make em do for a few years longer only im goin to be married next week have you got any bridal suits step this way i suppose you have got money to pay for them remarked the clerk doubtfully you suppose right just lead the way and ill see what youve got how high are you willing to go anywhere from twentyfive cents to twentyfive dollars our twentyfive cent suits are all out but we can give you some for fifteen dollars and as much more as you like show me some at fifteen tom looked at some suits at this price they were well made but coarse and did not quite come up to his ideas of what was appropriate for a young man of fortune show me some for twentyfive dollars he said these aint good enough to be married in finally tom picked out a dark mixed suit which appeared to be an exact fit the price was twenty dollars which he considered reasonable and at once paid shall i send them home for you asked the clerk regarding our hero with more respect now that he had shown himself a purchaser for cash never mind ill take em myself said tom my carriage is waitin outside so its no trouble he left the store with the clothes under his arm but he was not yet wholly provided he had no shirts stockings or underclothes which he cared to wear in the new life upon which he was entering all must be procured he stopped at a cheap store in nassau street and provided himself with half a dozen of each at a cost of twenty dollars more by this time he found himself so encumbered with bundles that he thought it best to go home he entered the room without attracting attention and proceeded at once to throw off his old rags and array himself in the new clothes including a blue silk necktie which he had purchased when his toilet was complete he surveyed himself with no little complacency for the first time in all the years that he could remember he was attired from top to toe as a young gentleman blest if i couldnt pass myself off for a young fifth avenoodle he said to himself ill go down and see mrs flanagan i wonder if shell know me he descended the stairs and knocked at the door of the goodhearted irishwoman she did not recognize him having no idea that it was tom the bootblack does mrs flanagan live here asked tom slightly disguising his voice yes sir is it washing ye want me to do is there a boy named tom lives here asked our hero he lives up stairs just over this do you know him shure i do i know him as if he was my own bye i dont know about that said tom in his natural voice raising his hat which he had worn slouched down over his eyes you didnt seem to know him when you saw him shure its tom himself exclaimed mrs flanagan why tom dear whats come to you youre lookin quite the gintleman of course i am said tom thats the new business ive gone into where did you get them new cloes tom i bought them with the money old jacob left me and now mrs flanagan im goin to leave you where are you goin tom im goin out west to seek my fortune shure i hope youll find it so do i mrs flanagan i know its there and mean to get it if i can are you goin now not till tomorrow ive got some more things to buy first im sorry to lose you tom ill miss you and old jacob i hope the poor mans better off so do i mrs flanagan i wont hide it from you but he left me a paper tellin me that there is a man out west thats cheated me out of my fortune whats his name grey hes my fathers cousin where does he live i dont know then how will you find him i know how he looks he was in new york a little while ago and i blacked his boots when i come into my fortune ill make you a handsome present mrs flanagan shure i hope youll get it widout the present now i must be goin ive got to buy a carpetbag and umbrella come in and bid me goodby before you go tom yes i will tom went out into the street when it occurred to him that there was one article he had not yet renewed his hat he lost no time in visiting a hat store where he supplied himself with one of fashionable shape he could not resist the temptation also of purchasing a small jaunty cane being naturally a goodlooking boy i am justified in saying that in his new outfit he would have easily passed muster as the son of a man of wealth in fact so effectually was he disguised that he passed some of his old street companions without their recognizing him tom was rather amused and pleased at this as he passed his old rival and enemy pat walsh it struck him that it would be a good joke to employ him to black his shoes of which i neglected to say that he had purchased a new pair pat was just finishing off a customer when tom stepped up shine yer boots asked pat yes boy and be quick about it answered tom assuming a tone of haughty command pat was at once on his knees blacking the shoes of his old rival without the slightest suspicion of his identity humph do you call that a good shine demanded tom when the first shoe was finished i could black it better myself what do you know about blackin boots said pat angrily there aint a boy round here can give you a better shine than that i got my boots blacked yesterday by a boy named tom he gave me a better shine just then pat looked up in his face and started in surprise youre tom yourself he said whered you get them cloes do you dare to compare me to a bootblack said tom my name is gilbert you look like toms twinbrother then said pat bewildered tom didnt reply but walked off in a dignified manner after paying pat swinging his cane in the most approved style dont he look like tom though soliloquized pat bewildered tom enjoyed the joke but didnt venture to laugh till he was out of sight no wonder pat didnt know he thought i aint sure id know myself it id gone to sleep a bootblack and waked up as i am now tom made his purchases took supper at a restaurant and went to bed early it was his last night in the city on the next day he was to start for the west in quest of fortune chapter ix bessie benton tom called the next day at the hospital and left ten dollars finding this to be the right amount for jacobs coffin he took a last look at the old man so long his companion and then feeling that he could do no more went on his way he next went to a railroad office on broadway and bought a throughticket to cincinnati this was the city where according to jacobs story his father had been in business and he himself had been born his inquiries for the uncle who had defrauded him must commence here having taken his seat in the cars he was led to make an examination of his pocketbook he found it by no means well filled a hundred dollars had seemed to him a good deal of money but he had expended half of it for clothes his railway ticket and the money he left at the hospital consumed thirty dollars more and he had therefore but twenty dollars left that aint much to set up as a gentleman on said tom to himself i didnt know it cost so much to get along ill have to go to work afore long tom was not in the least daunted however he had always been accustomed to earn his living and didnt doubt that he could do it now he had little money but he had his wits and two strong arms and he thought he could keep out of the poorhouse no anxious fears for the future marred the pleasure which the journey afforded him with an eye of interest he regarded the rich and productive country through which the train was speeding at the rate of twentyfive miles an hour there is more than one route from new york to cincinnati a fact of which tom knew nothing and it was only by accident that he had selected that which led through buffalo he stopped over a night at this enterprising city and at an early hour entered the cars to go on to the chief city in ohio the passengers were nearly all seated in fact every seat was occupied except that beside tom when a stout elderly gentleman entered the car followed by an attractive young girl of fourteen there dont seem to be any seats bessie he said heres one uncle said the young lady indicating the seat of which our hero occupied half is this seat engaged young man asked the old gentleman tom looked up and seeing that a pretty girl was to sit beside him answered with alacrity no sir then bessie you may as well sit down here i am very sorry you must take this long journey alone i thought till the last moment that mr armstrong was going oh never mind uncle i can get along well enough but it dont seem right i am afraid your father will blame me perhaps said bessie with a little coquettish glance at tom whom she privately thought a very goodlooking boy perhaps this young gentleman will look after me the old gentleman looked dubious and would have preferred a person of more maturity still there was no choice and he said young man are you going to cincinnati yes sir said tom then if it wont be too much trouble i will ask you to look after my niece a little i am unable to go with her myself all right sir ill do it said tom in a confident tone there goes the bell uncle said bessie youd better go or you will be carried along with us the old gentleman bent over and kissed his niece our hero thought he should have been willing to relieve him of the duty the young girl beside him looked so fresh and pretty that though he was too young to fall in love he certainly did feel considerable pleasure in the thought that she was to be his companion in a journey of several hundred miles it gave him a feeling of importance being placed in charge of her and he couldnt help wondering whether he would have got the chance if he had been dressed in his old street suit theres a good deal in clos thought tom philosophically it makes all the difference between a young gentleman and a bootblack would you like to sit by the window he asked by way of being sociable and polite oh no i can see very well from here said the young lady do you come from buffalo no i am from new york i never was there i should like to go very much i have heard that central park is a beautiful place yes its a bully place said tom bessie laughed thats a regular boys word she said miss wiggins our teacher was always horrified when she heard any of us girls use it i remember one day i let it out without thinking and she heard it miss benton said she never again let me hear you employ that inelegant expression that a young lady under my charge should even once have been guilty of such a breach of propriety mortifies me extremely bessie pursed up her pretty lips and imitated the manner of the prim schoolmistress to the great amusement of our hero is that the way she talked he asked yes and she glared at me through her spectacles she looked like a beauty with her tall bony figure and thin face did you ever go to boardingschool no said tom nor to any other he might almost have added you wouldnt like it though boys boardingschools may be better than girls i have been two years at miss wiggins boardingschool in buffalo now im going home on a vacation and i really hope papa wont send me there again do you live in cincinnati yes that is papa does are you going to stay there long i think i shall live there said tom who fancied it would be agreeable to live in the same city with bessie benton oh i hope you will then you could come and see us that would be bully tom was about to say but it occurred to him that it would be in better taste to say i should like to very much have you finished your education asked bessie there wasnt much to finish thought tom but he said aloud maybe ill study a little more where did you study asked the persevering bessie ive been to columbia college said tom after a little pause so he had been up to the college grounds but i am afraid he intended bessie to believe something else then you must know a great deal said bessie do you like latin and greek very much not very much said tom i never went farther than the latin verbs theyre tiresome aint they ill bet they are said tom who wouldnt have known a latin verb from a greek noun i suppose they come easier to boys were you long in college not long i suppose you were a freshman yes said tom hazarding a guess dont the sophomores play all sorts of tricks on the freshmen awful said tom who found it safest to chime in with the remarks of the young lady i had a cousin at yale college continued bessie when he was a freshman the sophomores broke into his room one night blindfolded him and carried him off somewhere then they made him smoke a pipe which made him awful sick and poured a pail of water over his head did they ever do such things to you no they wouldnt dare to said our hero you couldnt help yourself yes i could id put a head on them i dont know what miss wiggins would say if she should hear you talk shed have a fit what did i say he asked innocently you said youd put a head on them so i would only it is a very inelegant expression as miss wiggins says if you dont like it i wont say it any more oh i dont care said bessie laughing you neednt be afraid ill have a fit i aint such a model of propriety as that perhaps i shall be some time when i get to be a stiff old maid like priscilla wiggins you wont be that how do you know said bessie saucily you dont look like it dont i perhaps nobody will marry me she said demurely if nobody else will send for me said tom blushing immediately at his unexpected boldness am i to regard that as a proposal asked bessie her eyes sparkling with fun yes if you want to said tom manfully im sure im very much obliged said the young lady i wont forget it and if nobody else will have me ill send for you shes a trump he thought but fortunately didnt make use of a word which would have been highly objectionable to miss wiggins chapter x tom arrives in cincinnati you havent told me your name yet said bessie after a while gilbert grey said tom the name sounded strange to himself for he had always been called tom but his streetlife was over he had entered upon a new career and it was fitting that he should resume the name to which he had a rightful claim thats a good name said bessie approvingly would you like to know mine i know it already its bessie benton oh you heard me use it do you like it tiptop thats another of your boywords isnt it good i like it well enough im not miss wiggins i am not going to inflict on the reader a full account of all that was said on the journey by bessie and her young protector they chatted upon a variety of topics tom taking care not to be too communicative touching his street experiences he wanted to stand well with bessie and was afraid that she would not be quite so pleased and social with him if she should learn that he had been a knight of the blackingbrush it was early evening when the train reached cincinnati i think papa will be here to meet me said bessie looking out of the car window as they entered the depot uncle telegraphed him from buffalo that i would arrive by this train our hero was sorry they were already at their journeys end he had enjoyed bessies company and he knew that he might never meet her again though he knew nothing of etiquette he did what was proper on the occasion and assisted bessie to ascend the steps upon the platform bessie looked around to find a familiar face oh theres cousin maurice she said here maurice here i am a boy somewhat taller than our hero who no doubt considered himself a young man came forward and was about to kiss bessie but the latter drew back slightly and frustrated his design by giving him her hand instead maurice colored a little and looked vexed where is papa didnt he come she asked quickly he was busy and sent me wont i do as well of course i am glad to see you but i hoped papa would be here the carriage is outside let us hurry said maurice taking her arm wait a minute said bessie releasing her arm she walked up to tom and taking his hand cordially said goodby gilbert im ever so much obliged to you for taking care of me we live at b street i hope you will call in a day or two papa will be glad to see you and he will thank you too toms face flushed with pleasure thank you miss bessie he said id like to do it all over again youll be sure to come yes ill come maurice listened to this conversation with impatient annoyance he liked his pretty cousin enough to be jealous of any one to whom she seemed attentive and he thought her altogether too cordial with this strange boy whos that fellow he asked as they were passing out of the depot i dont know whom you mean the boy you spoke to the young gentleman i spoke to remarked bessie with emphasis was gilbert grey and who is gilbert grey and how did you become acquainted with him uncle henry put me in his charge said bessie ive traveled with him all the way from buffalo a great protector he is sneered maurice he isnt old enough to take charge of a kitten a kitten would be more trouble than i was said bessie she might scratch i never do that you know cousin maurice i should think uncle henry might have found some older person to put you in charge of i am glad he didnt gilbert was real nice you shouldnt call him by his first name it isnt proper pray dont talk about whats proper i heard enough of that from miss wiggins besides hes only a boy you know though to be sure he looks almost as old as you dont be so provoking bessie i am much larger than he are you i didnt see it i am sorry you invited him to the house bessie he only traveled with you a few hours there is no need of becoming intimate with him on that account i want to become intimate with him said bessie with provoking frankness hes very nice he seemed to me rather a low common fellow said maurice irritated you neednt like him if you dont want to said bessie let us talk about something else and she began to make inquiries about home affairs we return to tom whom we left standing on the platform in the depot have a carriage sir asked a hackman where to anywhere you like burnett house if you know of any nice hotel where theyll board me for the pleasure of my company you can take me right along they dont do business that way here never mind then i guess my private carriage is outside tom of course knew nothing of cincinnati but picking out a man with a carpetbag whose dress indicated limited means he followed him he wont stop at any of the tiptop hotels thought our hero i cant afford to go firstclass any more my pocketbook aint so full as it was he followed his unconscious guide nearly a mile the latter finally stopped before a small thirdclass hotel which bore the name ohio house after a slight pause he entered and tom followed him after the man had registered his name tom went up to the desk what do you charge he asked two dollars a day is that the lowest price where a party stays a week its ten dollars was the reply all right said our hero will you register your name tom took the pen and would have put down gilbert grey but as we know his education had been neglected and he was not at all sure as to the proper way of spelling gilbert after a little reflection he put down g grey new york the clerk wrote the number of a room opposite and asked our hero if he would go to his room before supper tom decided that he would and was shown into a stuffy little bedroom which would never have been mistaken even by the most inexperienced for a room in a firstclass hotel however our hero was not very particular he had never been accustomed to luxurious accommodations and he was perfectly satisfied with no you can go said he to the servant ill be down in a jiffy he washed his face and hands for even in the days of his streetlife he had paid more regard to neatness than most of his class opened his carpetbag and took out a clean paper collar which he substituted for the one he wore and after brushing his hair went down stairs he did not have long to wait for his supper nor was he wanting in appetite though the establishment could boast of no french cook the table was spread with substantial dishes which tom attacked vigorously theres nothing like a good square meal when a fellows hungry he said to himself its more than old jacob and i often got i wonder what the old man would say if he knew i was payin two dollars a day out of his money i cant foller it up long thats one sure thing but its no use worrying before its time i guess ill find something to do in a big place like this our hero knew little or nothing about geography or the comparative size of places he fancied that cincinnati was nearly as large as new york at any rate it was large enough to afford a living for a young man of pluck and industry he was no doubt correct in this pluck and industry are pretty sure to make their way in any place whatever its size and these qualities tom certainly possessed he took up a copy of a cincinnati daily and looked over its columns to see if there was any vacant position which he could fill wanted a gentleman of experience and ability as principal of the grammar school salary the first year the pay would suit me pretty well said tom and i guess i could lick some of the bad boys but i could teach em all i know in half a day heres a coachman wanted that wont do either wanted a man with a small capital to enter upon a light genteel business ive got the small capital and its gettin smaller every day perhaps i wouldnt be genteel enough after awhile tom having exhausted the advertisements and found nothing to suit him felt himself growing sleepy and went up to bed chapter xi bessie benton at home tom came down to breakfast rather late the next day but he felt fresh and hopeful having slept off all his fatigue he had money enough left to pay his board for a week and a half and was not under the immediate necessity of obtaining work he felt curious to see the city he was in and devoted the day to wandering about the streets he took pains to find out where b street the residence of bessie benton was he had made up his mind to call there that evening it was a quiet substantial house in a nice street indicating in its appearance the social position of the family about four oclock in the afternoon tom ascended the steps and rang the bell is miss bessie benton at home he inquired of the servant who answered his summons yes who shall i say wishes to see her tom i mean gilbert grey said our hero who came near forgetting his new name walk in sir tom was ushered into a handsome parlor and took his seat on a sofa this is rather ahead of the room old jacob and i used to live in he thought i didnt make many fashionable calls then he was interrupted by the entrance of bessie herself who advanced frankly and welcomed him with evident pleasure im glad you didnt forget to call gilbert she said i wanted to see you again said tom with unconventional frankness im glad you did i want to introduce you to papa is he at home no he wont be home till supper time but of course youll stay to supper i dont know said tom awkwardly papa told me to invite you he expects you then ill stay said tom promptly how do you like the city have you been about much yes ive been goin round all day it isnt as big as new york but i like it just then maurice walton entered the parlor he stopped short on seeing tom not overpleased at the sight of a possible rival this is gilbert mr grey maurice said bessie how dye do returned maurice ungraciously pretty well said tom i hope youre the same you found the way up here pretty quick said maurice rather rudely yes said tom i wanted to see your cousin and you he added slyly perceiving the feelings of maurice where are you stopping at a hotel so i supposed there are several hotels in the city he remarked with a sneer are there asked tom innocently are you stopping at burnetts no that is the most fashionable hotel that is the reason i didnt go there i aint fashionable myself you dont say so sneered maurice are you i hope so here bessie benton burst into a laugh what a vain selfconceited boy you are maurice she said i dont call myself a boy at all said maurice with lofty indignation youre a young gentleman then of course i am at what hotel did you say you stopped he asked a minute later i didnt say said tom bessie laughed again and maurice colored with anger if youd rather not tell he returned its of no consequence its the ohio hotel i never heard of it didnt you it cant be much of a hotel ive seen better myself said tom it dont compare with the fifth avenue in new york did you ever stop there ive been there often tom did not explain that he once blacked boots in front of the hotel for several weeks he did not feel disposed to take maurice too much in his confidence the fact is that maurice was considerably mystified as to toms position and claims to consideration there was of course a certain want of polish about our hero the result of his early associations which led maurice to doubt if tom was not socially his inferior on the other hand toms free and easy allusions to the fifth avenue hotel for instance tended to combat this view he became silent and listened to the conversation between his cousin and tom which was altogether too free and animated to suit his taste i wonder how long hes going to stay he thought isnt it most supper time bessie he asked at length why are you hungry rather said maurice looking significantly at tom hoping that he would take the hint and go he was ignorant of the invitation which had been given and accepted mr grey will stop to supper maurice said bessie oh will he said maurice but his manner was far from showing pleasure he left the room soon after and at six mr benton came in he was a stout pleasantlooking man with a look of bessie about the eyes and he very cordially welcomed our hero my daughter tells me you took good care of her on the way from buffalo mr grey he said i tried to said tom accept my thanks for your attentions you are not very old for a protector he added with a smile but from her account you answered the purpose there wasnt much to do said tom modestly id like to do it again bessie blushed a little and laughed it seems the arrangement was mutually agreeable said the old gentleman are you going to stay long in cincinnati mr grey yes sir i expect to then you must come and see us often i should like to tom was on the point of adding tiptop but stopped just in time here the bell rang for supper and the party adjourned to the diningroom there were seats for four bessie sat opposite her father having on one side maurice on the other tom the latter i am bound to say felt a little embarrassed he knew that the usages of the family he was visiting must be different from those to which he was accustomed and he was afraid he might make some blunder he resolved therefore to watch maurice carefully and do whatever he did eating with a fork he thought odd and not nearly as convenient as a knife still he did it to avoid mistakes maurice watched him hoping to detect him in blunders but to no purpose he was perhaps slightly awkward but committed no breaches of etiquette this is mr grey maurice introduced mr benton at the commencement of the meal i have the honor of knowing mr grey said maurice stiffly there was a slight emphasis on the word honor which mr benton did not notice after supper mr benton said i am obliged to go out on a little business but you young people can amuse yourselves without me perhaps mr grey would like to hear you play bessie perhaps he plays himself suggested maurice with a sneer do you asked bessie i can play on a handorgan answered tom professionally inquired maurice i never was in the business said our hero is it profitable how should i know said maurice angrily they adjourned to a pleasant sittingroom where there was a piano and bessie took her place at the piano i am not much of a player she said but will do my best after a while she began to sing her voice was pleasant but not remarkable i dont like singing alone she said at last mr grey will sing with you said maurice maliciously will you pleaded bessie turning to our hero if youll play that said tom pointing to one of the popular songs of the day which he had caught in the street of course i will i dont claim that tom was a remarkable singer but his voice was of good quality and harmonized well with bessies he sang correctly also and she was much pleased how well you sing gilbert she said cant you sing something else they sang two other popular songs to the great dissatisfaction of maurice who saw himself quite eclipsed by the new arrival isnt he splendid maurice asked bessie after tom had taken leave hes a low fellow said maurice i wish you were half as handsome and agreeable said bessie warmly maurice went to bed in a very unhappy frame of mind tom on the other hand felt as he returned to his unfashionable lodgings that he had never before had so pleasant an evening chapter xii tom gains a little information though our hero was occupied considerably with thoughts of bessie benton he did not lose sight of the two principal objects he had in visiting cincinnati one was to ascertain the whereabouts of his uncle the other to obtain something to do his cash was low and he must find some employment he consulted a copy of the city directory which he found in the office of the hotel but though he found plenty of greys he found but one bearing the name of james grey this one was a carpenter and of course could not be his uncle he must have left the city thought tom i wonder where his place of business was i might find out something there have you any old directories he asked at the office how far back five or six years we have one of six years back will you let me look at that the volume was found after some difficulty and put in toms hands he turned at once to the gs and to his great joy found the name of james grey merchant his place of business was also given thats something thought our hero ill go there at once there was no difficulty in finding the street and number but there was a new name on the sign william ferguson tom entered and asked the first clerk he met if he could see mr ferguson whats your business inquired the subordinate with mr ferguson answered tom promptly wouldnt i do as well how long have you been here what do you want to know that for if youve been here five years ill tell you i havent then i want to see mr ferguson it strikes me you are a young man of some importance i am glad you have found it out said our hero coolly if youre not too much pressed by important business the clerk was leaning back picking his teeth perhaps you wouldnt mind asking mr ferguson if he will see a merchant from new york the clerk laughed youre a hard nut to crack young man he said dont try to crack me then the clerk went into the countingroom and returning quickly told tom he might go in entering tom found himself in the presence of a man of about forty do you wish to see me he asked yes sir i should like to ask if you know anything of mr grey who used to be in business in this place i know a good deal of them there were two i know that sir but one died yes it was john grey my father your father exclaimed the merchant in astonishment yes sir but i thought john greys son died no sir that was a mistake can you tell me where my uncle james lives i dont find his name in the directory no he moved away after selling out the business to me i was head salesman in the establishment under the brothers grey now the business is mine and you dont know where my uncle went he went to minnesota i think but where i cannot tell i dont think it was to st paul or to any large place how long ago was that sir about five years since but i always supposed john greys son was lost you have a strong family look however do i asked tom i dont remember my father where have you been all these years i will tell you sir said tom if you have time to hear the story i didnt know who i was myself till a little while ago proceed i am busy but i have time to listen take a seat tom told the story with which we are already familiar mr ferguson listened with strong intent when it was finished he said young man have you the confession of this jacob with you tom drew it from his inner pocket and submitted it to inspection he awaited the merchants verdict i recognize jacobs handwriting he said at length he was a fellowclerk of mine i remember also that he disappeared at the same time with you the story is a strange one but i am inclined to think it is true what do you intend to do i want to find my uncle i am afraid you will find that difficult he has left no clew in this city where he once lived he sold out all his property and has no interest here you think he went to minnesota yes but i cannot tell where i will go to minnesota then said our hero is it far off it is several hundred miles away and a large place when you get there it costs money to travel are you well supplied ive got about fifteen dollars fifteen dollars repeated the merchant and you expect to undertake such a task on that sum id like to have more money but whats the use of waitin i aint gettin richer have you any situation are you earning any money no sir then i advise you to find something to do in the city and postpone your plans of finding your uncle you are just as likely to hear from him here while at work as if you were traveling in search of him said mr ferguson id just as lief go to work said tom if i could find anything to do mr ferguson reflected a moment then he turned to our hero and said i will think about your case come round tomorrow morning about this time all right sir tom left the countingroom and was rather surprised to meet maurice walton on the main floor of the store what brings you here asked maurice business said tom important sneered maurice very important answered tom coolly i wish i knew more about him thought maurice theres some mystery about him hes impudent enough for half a dozen some might have thought the impudence on the other side but maurice did not see it in that light it occurred to tom that he would call and see the man who advertised for a person with a small capital to enter a light genteel business he found the place after awhile a small back room scantily furnished with a few packages lying on a solitary counter there was a man of about thirtyfive in attendance who seemed to have nothing particular to do are you the one that advertised for a man with a small capital asked tom to enter a light genteel business continued the other briskly yes i am the one well ive got a small capital and thats just the kind of business i want youre rather young have you ever been in business i should think i had ive been in business for six or seven years you must have begun young what kind of business the boot and shoe business mostly answered our hero but i was in the periodical business for awhile well if youve got experience you can succeed in our business how much capital have you tell me about the business first well its the perfumery business weve got up a new and superior kind of perfumery which we sell by agents i want to find some one to take charge of the office while i travel and solicit orders you can take care of the office cant you whats the wages twenty dollars a week thatll about suit me said tom you will receive the money from the agents and take care of it that suits me again but of course we expect you to deposit money with us as security how much do you want five hundred dollars our hero whistled thats ahead of my pile he said how much have you got fifteen dollars but i owe part of it for board then get out of this office do you think i can afford to waste my time in talking to you said the young man angrily youd rather waste my money youll have to hook in some other chap mister ive been round of course it was only a trap to fleece the unsuspecting out of their money tom was posted and only went in to have a little fun he meant to wait and hear what mr ferguson had to propose before forming any decisive plans for the future chapter xiii an adventure the next morning at the time appointed tom called at the establishment of mr ferguson the first he met was maurice walton maurice in fact was the youngest clerk having received the appointment six weeks before through the influence of his uncle did you come round to see me im busy said maurice havent you swept out yet asked tom mischievously do you think i would demean myself by sweeping out returned maurice disgusted i thought that might be your business that would be good business for you perhaps mr ferguson will engage you all right ill accept if hell pay me enough is he in who your boss i dont understand such low terms said maurice loftily then its time you did is mr ferguson in if you can understand that better yes he is but he wont see you why not because his time is too valuable then i wonder why he asked me to come round this morning did he of course he did and if youve got through sweeping out youd better let him know im on hand go yourself thank you for your polite invitation they didnt examine you in good manners when they took you in here did they youre an impertinent fellow thank you you ought to be a good judge of impudence ill see you again soon hope you wont miss me much our hero who it must be confessed was not troubled by bashfulness made a low bow to his opponent and advancing to the countingroom opened the door mr ferguson looked up from his letters take a seat grey he said and ill speak to you in a moment thank you said tom who knew how to be polite when it was proper to be so at the end of fifteen minutes mr ferguson looked up well said he have you formed any plans gilbert i think that is your name no sir except that im goin to try to get a place have you tried yet i called to see a man who offered a light genteel employment to a young man with a small capital i thought mine was small enough so i applied well what came of it the man wasnt willin to sell out for fifteen dollars so i left you seem to be a smart boy suppose i take you into my employment id try to do my duty i really dont need an extra clerk but you are the son of my old employer and to him i feel under considerable obligations ill take you on trial thank you sir when shall i come next monday all right sir ill be on hand where are you boarding at the ohio hotel how much board do you pay ten dollars a week that is too much you ought to get board in a private house for four between now and monday i advise you to look up some decent house that will answer your purpose you cant expect to live luxuriously at first i aint used to firstclass accommodations said tom i see you are a sensible boy cut your coat according to your cloth that is a good maxim when you get older you can live better now about your salary i cant give much at first or my other clerks might complain i will give you five dollars the same that i pay to my youngest clerk maurice walton do you know him questioned mr ferguson in surprise yes sir i took supper at his uncles wednesday evening indeed i did not know you were acquainted with mr benton bessie benton came on from buffalo in my charge really gilbert you seem to be getting on fast you seem quite able to push your own way ive always done it sir you are not bashful new york streetboys aint troubled that way thats well if not carried too far now tell me how much you know if its about learning i can do that in five minutes your education i take it has been neglected i dont know much i didnt have a chance to learn can you read when the words aint too long and write not much then i advise you to take what leisure time you have to remedy the defects in your education id like to sir i was ashamed of knowing so little when i was at mr bentons a good feeling my boy the more you know the better chance you stand to get on in the world i am giving you a low place in my employment if you want to be promoted you must qualify yourself for it ill do it sir said our hero manfully thats good advice and ill foller it success to you my boy you can now go and come back monday morning thank you sir tom left the countingroom in excellent spirits he had found a place and one just such as he liked five dollars a week he foresaw would not pay his expenses but he was sure he could earn more in some way as he was about to leave the store maurice whose curiosity was aroused came to meet him did you get through your important business he said sneeringly not quite im coming here again next monday mr ferguson must be glad to see you im comin tuesday also what every day yes your boss has concluded to take me into the business you aint coming here to work said maurice hastily youve hit the nail on the head weve got enough clerks now im comin to help you sweep out in the mornin maurice was by no means pleased to hear this regarding tom as his social inferior he did not like to be placed on a level with him how much pay are you to get he asked five dollars a week the same as i get yes maurice was disgusted then i shall ask for higher pay go ahead i dont care do you expect to live on your salary no of course not ive got private property how much go and ask the man that calls for the taxes i dont believe it why im payin ten dollars a week for my board finally our hero went out leaving maurice dissatisfied and annoyed first that his rival as he regarded him had obtained a place in the same establishment with himself and next that the newcomer was to receive the same salary he sent in an application the next day for increase of pay but it was dismissed with the curt response that when he earned more he would get it meanwhile tom bent his steps toward the ohio river of course my readers know that cincinnati is on the north bank of the ohio and that just across is a town in kentucky id like to see kentucky said tom to himself i guess ill go across small river steamers convey passengers across the river for a very small sum our hero paid the required fee and went on board its some like goin across to jersey he thought there was the usual variety of passengers men women and children tom sat down beside a young man well dressed but a little strange in his manners it was evident that he had been drinking too much and was under the influence of liquor at present he was perfectly quiet however till they were in the middle of the stream when all at once he climbed the railing and threw himself into the turbid waters of the river illustration tom being an expert swimmer jumped in after the man without hesitation page the passengers seemed paralyzed by the suddenness of the action our hero was the first to recover and being an expert swimmer jumped in after him without hesitation chapter xiv a fashionable boardinghouse when toms head emerged from the yellow and turbid waters he caught sight of the young man and struck out for him grasping him by the arm he succeeded with considerable difficulty in holding him up till a small boat near by picked both up whew sputtered tom spitting out some of the water which he had involuntarily taken into his mouth the young man rescued looked about him stupidly what made you jump into the river asked the boatman i was drunk said the young man frankly upon whom the shock of the falling into the water had produced a favorable effect its lucky this boy was near and jumped after you or you might have been drowned before i got to you the young man turned and looked earnestly at tom so you jumped after me he said i feel as if i did answered tom im as wet as a drowned rat youre a brave boy thank you said tom modestly but i can swim so well that it didnt take much courage i cant swim a stroke then youd better not jump into the water again i dont mean to said the young man smiling where did you learn to swim in the east river wheres that new york look here gentlemen where do you want to be carried asked the boatman back to cincinnati ill pay you for your trouble said the young man i was goin on an explorin expedition to kentucky said our hero you are too wet you must take another day it aint any wetter on one side of the river than the other do you live in kentucky no in cincinnati yes ive lived there a day or two you must change your clothes or you will get cold i havent got any clothes except what ive got on the young man looked rather surprised at this since tom had on a good suit and appeared to be in good circumstances then said he promptly i shall take you home with me and lend you one of my suits it would fit me too much said tom laughing never mind we will stay in the house till your clothes are dry what do you say all right said tom im agreeable when they came to the ohio side of the river the two got off the young man was so well over his fit of drunkenness that he walked quite steadily showing no trace of it in his gait i live a mile and a half away he said but it will be better to walk as we shall be less liable to take cold in our wet clothes or do you feel tired not a bit said tom im used to walkin my coachman dont have much to do youre a genius said the young man im glad to hear it said tom if im a fair specimen geniuses dont know much at any rate you are not such a fool as i am are you a fool any man is a fool that gets drunk i dont know but youre right said tom what makes you do it because im a fool thats all the reason i can give im too weak to resist temptation i never was drunk but once said tom i dont want to be again how did that happen a sailor invited me into a barroom and got me to drink i felt as if my head would burst open the next morning so you didnt get drunk again no i got enough of it what is your name asked the young man interested gilbert grey do you live in this city im goin to i wish you would come and live with me what for because though you are younger you know how to take care of yourself i think you would take care of me too if you pay me good wages said tom im willin to be your guardian i am in earnest said the young man it would do me good to have some one help me keep straight how many times a week would you want me to jump into the water after you asked our hero jocularly because id want to keep a good stock of dry clothes on hand or maybe i might wear a bathin suit all the time i shant try that again said the other smiling i dont like it well enough by this time they reached a handsome brick house in a fine street this is where i board said the young man come in he rang the bell and a servant answered the summons she looked surprised at the appearance of the pair both showing signs of the wetting they had received we met with an accident bridget explained the young man or rather i tumbled into the water and this boy jumped after me faith you look like it mr mordaunt said bridget will i tell mrs white yes ask her if she can send us up some hot coffee in about twenty minutes i am afraid if we dont have some hot drink we will take cold all right sir a hasty glance satisfied tom that it was a firstclass boardinghouse the hall was handsomely furnished and when on reaching the head of the stairs his companion led the way into a spacious room with a chamber connecting our young hero saw a rich carpet elegant furniture a handsome collection of books and some tasteful pictures upon the walls it was evident that mr mordaunt was possessed of ample means now by the way ive forgotten your name yet gilbert grey some call me tom for short now gilbert make yourself at home the best thing we can do is to strip at once and put on dry clothes he went to a wardrobe and brought out two suits of clothes also a supply of underclothing there said he go ahead and change your clothes tom followed directions obediently while his companion was similarly employed of course it was necessary to wash also the clothes were too large for him but still not much as he was a wellgrown boy and mr mordaunt was by no means large how do you like the looks asked the young man as tom surveyed himself in a handsome mirror i expect its me but i aint certain said tom itll take me some time to grow to these clothes they are rather big thats a fact said the young man smiling when the servant comes up with the coffee well send down our suits to be dried will your friends feel anxious about you theres one will i expect said tom who is that your mother no its my intimate friend maurice walton he cant bear me out of his sight or in it either mordaunt laughed so hes very devoted is he you bet he is here there was a knock at the door come in called mordaunt bridget entered with a waiter on which were a coffeepot some cups and saucers sugar etc beside a plate of sandwiches thank you bridget said mordaunt i see you understood what was wanted now if youll take down them wet clothes and dry them for us we will be much obliged ill do it mr mordaunt said the willing handmaiden now gilbert sit down and well have a good cup of coffee apiece said mordaunt youre hungry are you not bathin in such a big tub gave me an appetite said tom but i wouldnt like to get up an appetite that way every day nor i its too much trouble not to speak of the danger how do you find the coffee tiptop its a good deal better than wine eh thats so now gilbert while we are taking lunch i have a little plan to propose to you all right im ready chapter xv tom changes his boardinghouse where are you boarding mordaunt began at the ohio hotel but i dont mean to stay im lookin out some firstclass boardinhouse where they dont charge morn five dollars a week you havent found one yet no come here and room with me dont you pay but five dollars rather more said mordaunt laughing i only get five dollars a week for my valuable services said tom i pay that for board and get my clothes with the balance if i hadnt a fortune of ten dollars to fall back upon id have to go without is that really the way you are situated asked mordaunt seriously yes then said the young man come and board with me and it shant cost you a cent ill have another bed put into the bedroom and well make ourselves as comfortable as we can do you mean it asked tom incredulously certainly and youll pay my board for the sake of my agreeable society just so answered his companion then youre a tiptop feller and i wont refuse such a good offer good thats settled then said the young man with satisfaction now ill tell you my reasons for making you such an offer i am an orphan and with no near relations except an uncle in canada with whose family i am little acquainted i inherited from my father who died just as i reached the age of twentyone a fortune of one hundred thousand dollars whew said our hero thats a big pile of money it was too large for me it took away my ambition and energy and though for two years i have been in a law office pretending to study law i have wasted my time in drinking among unworthy companions the fact is i am of a sociable disposition and i found my room lonely now i want to turn over a new leaf give up drinking and devote myself more to study i want to study too said tom im as ignorant as a horse ill have to study some evenings ill teach you said mordaunt well spend our evenings that way instead of in barrooms all right said our hero that suits me but i ought not to let you pay my board i can well afford it my money is securely invested and brings me in six thousand dollars a year clear i shall have to work from now till im a grayhaired old patriarch before i earn six thousand dollars said tom comically mordaunt laughed i hope it isnt so bad as that he said well do you agree to come here as your guardian yes if you put it in that way you are very kind to me said our hero changing his tone and speaking earnestly i am a poor boy and dont know much im afraid youll be ashamed of introducing me to your friends friends i have no friends that care for me they care for my money and are jolly enough but if i needed help they wouldnt give it i dont know why it is but i like you you saved my life this morning and i would rather have you live with me than any one i know so when your clothes are dry go round to the hotel and bring your trunk here i havent got any trunk said tom i wouldnt have any use for one ive got a carpetbag very well bring that now you must do me a favor all right only if its to lend you a hundred dollar bill im afraid i couldnt do it i hope some time you will be rich enough to grant such favor but that isnt the favor i meant what is it you must let me buy you some more clothes tom was about to object but mordaunt continued remember ive got more money than i know what to do with i owe you something for the wetting i exposed you to i wont resist very hard said tom i spose you want your guardian to look respectable later in the day when their clothes were dry mordaunt took tom to a fashionable clothing store and bought him two suits of clothes of handsome cloth and stylish cut and in addition purchased him a sufficient stock of underclothing he also ordered a trunk to be sent up to the room then it being time they went home to supper mordaunt had already spoken to mrs white about receiving our hero as a boarder of course she was very ready to do so tom felt at first a little embarrassed but this feeling soon wore away he was not a guest but a boarder and was addressed by the landlady and the boarders as mr grey he came near laughing the first time he was called by this name but soon got used to it it was a firstclass boardinghouse there were some dozen boarders all of ample means as tom looked around him and remembered that only a short time previous he had been a new york streetboy and bootblack he could hardly believe that the change was permanent what would they think if they knowed what i was he thought next to him at table sat an elderly young lady who was not in the habit of receiving attentions from gentlemen of marriageable age and was therefore inclined to notice those more youthful do you like the opera mr grey she asked do you asked tom who had never heard an opera in his life new york bootblacks seldom attend such classic entertainments they prefer the old bowery entertainments i dote upon it said miss green enthusiastically so do i said tom much to mordaunts amusement what is your favorite opera asked miss green i havent got any favorite said tom who thought this the best answer as he did not know the name of any i think trovatore splendid its tiptop thats a gentlemans word said miss green laughing i am glad you agree with me do you sing yourself a little said tom shall i come and sing under your window tonight there was a general laugh at this offer oh do said miss green do you often serenade ladies i used to but i had to give it up why mr grey because it was taken for a catconcert and people used to throw bottles at me i couldnt stand that ill promise not to throw any bottles at you mr grey ill let you know when im comin said tom my voice aint in order just at present when it is ill do my best to keep you awake really gilbert said mordaunt when they had left the table and returned to their room you got up quite a flirtation with miss green it will be a good match for you shes got money and isnt more than twice as old as you are but when i got to be fifty shed be a hundred said tom i guess ill leave her for you she has tried her fascinations on me already said mordaunt but she soon concluded there wasnt any chance and gave it up shell be wanting you to take her to the opera as you dote upon it so much the only opera house i ever went to was in the bowery thats what i thought now how shall we spend the evening suppose we take a walk and then come and study a good plan what would you like to study i cant read or write very well i dont know much we will stop at a bookstore on our way and buy such books as you want then ill give you lessons while walking a flashilydressed young man recognizing mordaunt stepped up and slapped him on the shoulder come and play a game of billiards mordaunt he said i cant dacres ive got an engagement with my friend here sorry for it wont he come too no hes young i dont care to take him among such wild fellows as you the last time i played billiards with dacres he won a hundred dollars of me said mordaunt as they passed on it might have been so tonight but now i have your company i am safe on reaching home tom spent an hour and a half in study mordaunt assisting him the young man became interested in his task and went to bed much better satisfied with himself chapter xvi maurice is astonished maurice walton felt very much annoyed at the prospect of having tom for a fellowclerk he felt jealous of him on account of the evident partiality of bessie benton for his society he suspected from toms style of talking that he was low and uneducated and he would have given considerable to know that his hated rival had been a new york bootblack but this knowledge he could not obtain from tom the latter delighted in mystifying him and exciting suspicions which he afterward learned to be groundless bright and early tom made his appearance in front of mr fergusons establishment as he came up one way he met maurice looking sleepy and cross coming from a different direction goodmorning maurice said our hero goodnaturedly have you just got out of bed no answered maurice crossly my name is walton how are you walton mr walton if you please said maurice with dignity dont we feel big this morning mr walton said tom mischievously do you mean to insult me wouldnt think of such a thing mr walton my name is mr grey maurice didnt think proper to answer this remark perhaps because he had nothing in particular to say he opened the warehouse and tom entered i dont know what made mr ferguson take you he said amiably nor i said tom particularly as he had your valuable services very likely he took you out of charity said maurice did he take you out of charity asked tom innocently mr walton how dare you speak of me in that way demanded maurice haughtily it didnt take much courage said tom coolly how dared you speak of me in that way thats different why is it you havent got much money youre almost a beggar where did you find out all that anybody can tell by just looking at you thats the way then have you got much money my uncle has so has my uncle i dont believe it that dont alter the fact how much is he worth over a hundred thousand dollars i dont know how much more where does he live he used to live in this city but hes gone farther west maurice was not decided whether to believe this statement or not he wanted to disbelieve it but was afraid it might be true he tried a different tack where do you board are you at the ohio hotel i hear its a low place thirdclass youre about right it isnt firstclass i suppose you had to go there because it was cheap it was the first hotel i came across but im not there now ive moved have you where are you now no crescent place now maurice knew that crescent place was in a fashionable quarter of the city it astonished him that our hero whose salary was but five dollars a week should live in such a neighborhood twelve crescent place he repeated how much board do you pay thats a secret between me and the landlady said tom if youll come round and see me this evening you can judge for yourself having a strong curiosity about toms circumstances maurice accepted the invitation perhaps there are two crescent places he thought i dont believe he can afford to live in a fashionable boardinghouse mr mordaunt said tom when they were getting ready for supper ive invited a friend to call this evening thats right i shall be glad to see him its that boy that loves me so much maurice walton hes awfully jealous of me tries to snub me all the time then why did you invite such a fellow to call because he thinks i live in a poor place and it will make him mad to find me in such a nice room i see said mordaunt laughing it isnt as a friend you invite him im as much his friend as he is mine what makes him dislike you i dont know except because bessie benton is polite to me and seems to like my company mordaunt laughed that explains it fully he said so you are rivals for the young ladys hand not quite i aint quite ready to be married yet ill wait awhile but bessies a tiptop girl you must introduce me some time all right ill try and get an invitation for you to call with me about eight oclock maurice reached crescent place and scanning the numbers found no he cant live in such a house thought he its ridiculous still he rang the bell and when the servant appeared he asked rather hesitatingly does gilbert grey live here yes sir said the servant will you go up to his room i dont know where his room is will you ask him to come down there is somebody to see you mr grey said the servant after mounting the stairs hes come said our hero in a low voice to mordaunt ill go down and bring him up tom descended the stairs and welcomed maurice im glad youre come mr walton he said come up stairs to my room finding that he did after all live in this handsome house maurice expected that it was on the upper floor and was surprised when tom led the way into a handsome parlor on the second floor my roommate mr mordaunt mr walton said tom introducing the visitor i am glad to make your acquaintance mr walton said mordaunt take a seat and he indicated a luxurious armchair maurice sank into its depths and looked around him with wonder how in the world could a fellow like tom earning a salary of five dollars a week afford to board so luxuriously why it quite eclipsed even his uncles rooms handsome pictures books statuary and choice furniture under the brilliant blaze of an argand burner made a beautiful apartment youve got a nice room he could not help saying wont you look at the bedroom said mordaunt politely maurice looked in and found it in proportion to the parlor gilbert and i manage to make ourselves comfortable said mordaunt we enjoy it ourselves and are glad to have a pleasant place to invite our friends to maurice was astonished but such is the influence of wealth or apparent wealth upon a disposition like his that he thawed and made up his mind that he had better change his manner toward one who was able to afford living in such a style he must have money he thought perhaps its his rich uncle i thought he was lying but i guess its true after all tom saw the change in his manner and it amused him he thinks im somebody after all he said to himself what would he say if he knowed what i used to be how i went round the streets of new york calling out shine yer boots and was glad if i could earn a dollar a day that way i dont believe mordaunt would mind im going to tell him some time and see do you ever play checkers mr walton asked mordaunt sometimes then suppose we try a game or perhaps you will play with him gilbert id rather look on said tom i dont know how to play but maybe ill learn lookin at you very well two games were played and then a waiter appeared from a neighboring restaurant with some cake and icecream of which maurice partook with evident enjoyment his ideas with regard to our hero were quite revolutionized he was a good fellow after all so when he took leave at the close of the evening he readily promised to come again and did not forget to do so hell take more notice of me now said tom laughing hell think im somebody its the way of the world gilbert said mordaunt we must take it as it comes maybe said tom looking at his companion earnestly you wouldnt like to have me room with you if you knew what i used to be what did you used to be asked mordaunt not without curiosity a new york bootblack is it possible dont you want me to go no gilbert my friendship is too strong for that but i want to hear about your former life sit down and tell me all about it mordaunt listened with interest and surprise to the story of his roommate it seems he said in conclusion that there is a fortune somewhere to which you are entitled yes said our hero but my uncle will take pretty good care that i dont get it from your description he doesnt seem to be a credit to the family what are you going to do about it have you any plan mr ferguson advises me to stay here for the present he says i am as likely to hear of my uncle if i stay in cincinnati as if i travel round the country after him i presume he is right as your uncle was formerly in business here he is likely to come here some time on a visit if he does he will be likely to call at your establishment the best thing you can do is to attend to your business learn as much as possible and keep your eyes open i guess youre right said tom i aint very old yet ill try to learn something so that when i come into my fortune i can appear like a gentleman chapter xvii the scarred face we are now about to pass over a space of three years partly because no incidents of importance marked their passage though they wrought an important change in our hero we leave him an uneducated boy of fifteen we meet him again a youth qualified to appear to advantage in any society of course this change was not wrought without persistent effort tom was as we know an unusually smart boy with a quick wit and an aptness to learn but talent avails little unless cultivated our hero however kept up his habit of evening study at first under mordaunts instruction the latter was amazed at the progress of his pupil he seemed to fly along the path of knowledge and to master difficulties almost by intuition at the end of a year he was as good an english scholar as most boys of his age but this did not satisfy him he induced mordaunt to join him in securing the services of a native french teacher and was speedily able to read the language with ease and to speak it a little he also found it for his interest to learn something of german on account of the number of german customers which mr ferguson had to these solid acquirements he added a couple of quarters at a fashionable dancingschool and the result of all was that he not only became a good scholar but was able to appear to advantage in the social gatherings to which mordaunt and himself were frequently invited maurice walton was no longer able to laugh at his rusticity but on the other hand was forced to admit to himself with a twinge of jealousy that the rough uncultured boy of former days had wholly eclipsed him in every desirable accomplishment as well as in the solid branches for maurice spent his evenings in quite a different way from our hero at the billiardsaloon or barroom or in wandering about the streets without object the result was that mr ferguson detecting the difference between the two clerks and recognizing the superior value of gilbert for he has now laid aside his streetname of tom promoted him much more rapidly than maurice the latter received but ten dollars a week after three years service while our hero had been advanced to twenty this was naturally felt by maurice as a bitter grievance and he sometimes complained of it to gilbert himself ferguson treats me meanly he said just after the last rise of gilbert how is that maurice he wont raise my salary he is only going to give me ten dollars a week the same as last year how much is he going to give you twenty just twice as much exclaimed maurice angrily he has no business to make any difference between us i wish he would give you twenty dollars too said gilbert do you asked maurice suspiciously certainly i am none the better off for your getting small pay if you really feel so suppose you ask him to give me more gilbert hesitated i am afraid he would think i was interfering in his affairs just as i thought you were not in earnest in what you said you like to triumph over me because i came here the same time you did and only get half as much maurice spoke in a bitter tone which might partly be excused by his mortification and disappointment you are quite mistaken maurice said gilbert i will believe that when you go to mr ferguson and ask him to raise my salary gilbert reflected a moment and then said suddenly ill do it you will asked maurice surprised yes he may be angry with me but ill risk it only if he refuses you wont blame me no i wont youre such a favorite with him that he may do it for you when will you go now mr ferguson was sitting alone in his countingroom when gilbert entered may i speak with you a moment mr ferguson he asked yes gilbert what is it i hope you will excuse me for interfering in what is none of my business but i promised maurice i would speak to you oh its on maurices business is it said the merchant yes sir he is very much disturbed because you have raised my salary and have not raised his i get twenty dollars a week and he only ten he thinks it unjust does he yes sir will you ask him to step into the office and come back here yourself the two clerks were speedily in the presence of their employer so you think you ought to have a higher salary walton began mr ferguson i dont think grey earns twice as much as i do sir perhaps you think he does not earn any more i dont see why he does then i will tell you you have both been with me about the same length of time you a little longer i think but length of service does not always enhance the value of service grey has devoted his evenings to study he has acquired such a knowledge of german in particular that he can wait upon german customers he has mastered all the details of the business which you have not done you are often late often inattentive and are no better clerk now than you were a year ago that is the reason i am willing to give gilbert higher pay than you if you wish to fare as well as he has done pursue the same course i dont feel like studying in the evening i am too tired said maurice sullenly do as you please about that but there is still another way in which without any more time you can make yourself more valuable and merit increase of pay how is that sir always be on the alert while you are here in the store then in place of an indifferent salesman you may become a good one such as i should be very sorry to lose at present i confess i should not feel it to be a great loss if you withdrew to another establishment maurice listened sullenly it chafed his pride to be thus addressed by his employer in presence of gilbert as they went back to their duty our hero said i did the best i could for you maurice you cant blame me no but i blame him he has no business to be so partial to you all the difference between us is that you can jabber dutch a little that isnt worth ten dollars a week extra hes down on me for something or other i dont know why i dont make any comparison between us maurice said gilbert i am perfectly willing you should get as high pay as i do you are very kind said maurice sarcastically now dont get mad with a fellow said gilbert good humoredly i cant help it but maurice was sullen all day and for some days subsequently he insisted on regarding gilbert as a successful rival and would have injured him if he could it was about this time that our hero had his thoughts suddenly recalled to the uncle who had defrauded him of his birthright walking in vine street one morning he suddenly came face to face with the man whose boots he had brushed more than three years before on the steps of the astor house he knew him at once by the peculiar scar upon his right cheek of which he had taken particular notice when they first met chapter xviii uncle and nephew our hero stopped short and being directly in the path of his uncle the latter was compelled to stop too mr grey said gilbert thats my name said the other who had not yet taken particular notice of the youth who addressed him but as he spoke he looked at him and instantly recognized him gilbert could see that he did by his sudden start and expression of surprise and annoyance he couldnt understand how the new york bootblack had been metamorphosed into the welldressed and gentlemanlylooking young clerk he regretted so soon acknowledging his name and marveled how gilbert could have learned it what business have you with me young man he continued formally i have wanted to meet you for a long time said gilbert indeed said his uncle with a sneer i am rather surprised to hear this not having to my knowledge ever had the honor of seeing you before i am your nephew said gilbert bluntly then he knows said mr grey to himself rather disturbed i confess he said in the same sarcastic tone i am slightly disturbed at being claimed as a near relative by a stranger whom i happen to encounter in the street may i ask how you happen to be my nephew i am the son of your older brother john said gilbert that can hardly be young man my brother had but one son and he died disappeared you mean said gilbert significantly there is no doubt that he died said mr grey positively then he has come to life again for i am he you are an impudent impostor said mr grey hotly but you have missed your mark i am not so easily humbugged i denounce you and your pretensions as alike false let me pass as he said this he attempted to pass gilbert but our hero had no intention of losing sight of his uncle of course you can pass he said but i shall follow you you will demanded his uncle shaking his cane angrily then i will put you in the hands of the police i dont think you will said gilbert with perfect composure why not what is to hinder me i should like to know it wouldnt be good policy for you to do it why not you impudent young rascal because i should let the relationship be known well and why is it that you deny it well said mr grey his attention caught why do i deny it because you are in possession of my fathers property which of right belongs to me said gilbert firmly looking his uncle in the eyes it is your interest to deny the relationship james grey saw that his long injustice had come home to him at last how could this stripling have learned what he had taken such pains to conceal what was he to do was he to admit the boys claims and surrender the estate he could not make up his mind to do it he must stave off the attack if he could this is a ridiculous story he said somebody has been making a fool of you didnt you have an older brother named john yes mr grey admitted unwillingly did he not have a son yes but as i told you he died he only disappeared he was carried away for what object you can tell you are dealing in mysteries i dont know what you are talking about mr grey said this but his troubled look showed that he did not feel as unconcerned as he pretended gilbert continued the man who carried me off was a clerk in your employ his name was jacob morton so he took you to australia did he thats a likely story yes he was supplied with money by you for the purpose but he did not like australia after awhile he returned to new york and there i was brought up in the streets suffering every privation while you were enjoying the property my father left well have you got anything more to say the tale does great credit to your invention three years ago a little more perhaps i saw you in new york i brushed your boots on the steps of the astor house better and better i am expected to recognize a new york bootblack as my nephew it was your fault that i was reduced to be a bootblack how happens it that you are not in the same line of business now perhaps you are jacob died and left me a few dollars with which i came out west before he died he gave me a written paper in which he revealed all the plot into which he entered with you he gave you a paper did he yes from it i learned that i was born in cincinnati and i expected to find you here but i looked in vain after awhile i found my fathers place of business i introduced myself to mr ferguson and he gave me a place in his employ on the strength of your ridiculous story i suppose because he believed me to be the son of his old employer john grey i thought ferguson had more sense than to be duped by such a designing young rascal he tells me that i bear a strong resemblance to my father look in my face uncle james and tell me whether it is not true almost involuntarily james grey fixed his eyes on the frank handsome face of his nephew as he stood intrepidly before him and he was forced however reluctantly to admit to himself that the resemblance was indeed very striking the case was getting more serious than he had expected gilbert had already been recognized as the missing son of john grey and that by a man whose testimony would carry great weight old jacob had testified not only to his identity but to the wrongful compact by which gilbert had been spirited away to suit his uncles rapacity were this publicly known his reputation would be destroyed and he would be deprived of the wealth which he had labored so dishonestly to acquire evidently the claim was not to be disposed of so easily as he had at first supposed what do you call yourself he asked gilbert grey of course you would take the name of the boy you pretend to be then you dont believe i am gilbert grey no i do not i believe that gilbert grey is dead are you willing to come with me to mr fergusons and speak to him about it no i am not i have not time i must leave cincinnati at once then will you tell me where you live no why not because i see that you intend to follow me up and persecute me about this preposterous claim i dont choose to be troubled if i am an impostor you can prove me to be so i dont choose to waste my time in doing it mr grey said gilbert i might as well tell you that i am determined in this matter i know that you have an object in keeping me out of my rights but i am bound to have them i shall place the matter in the hands of a lawyer and he can soon find out by advertising where you live even if you try to keep it secret from me james grey realized the truth of this and he changed his tack you say that you have a paper signed by jacob morton attesting your identity not only signed but written by him i should like to see that paper have you got it with you no but i can lay my hands upon it immediately then bring it to me at the burnet house this afternoon at three oclock i will be in the readingroom of the hotel i will bring it the two then separated gilbert went immediately returned to his place of business resolved to inform mr ferguson whom he looked upon as a good friend that his uncle was found chapter xix diamond cut diamond your uncle in the city said mr ferguson in surprise yes sir i met him only a short time since on vine street how did you know him by the scar on his cheek but i think i would have known him at any rate i have a good memory for faces how did he receive you asked mr ferguson with curiosity he didnt seem very glad to see me answered gilbert smiling he insisted that his nephew is dead and called me an impostor he must have seen the resemblance between you and his brother you will make just such a looking man as your father i hope i shant look like my uncle your father and your uncle did not resemble each other there might have been a slight family likeness but it was very slight so much the better you dont think you shall like your uncle i am sure i shall not first he cheated me out of my property and now because i claim it he calls me an impostor so that was the way the interview terminated was it not exactly when i told him i had old jacobs confession and threatened to put it into the hands of a lawyer he said he would like to see it and asked me to call with it at the burnet house this afternoon humph said mr ferguson thoughtfully did you promise to do it yes sir then i will give you a piece of advice what is it sir dont carry the original paper with you why not sir it is best to be on the safe side your uncle is an unscrupulous man this paper is of the utmost importance to you since it proves your identity and lays bare the conspiracy against you just in proportion as it is valuable to you it is also valuable to your uncle i understand said gilbert nodding you think he has laid a trap for me in order to get hold of the paper it looks very much like it at any rate it is best to be on your guard i dont think he would find it easy to get it away from me said gilbert with the confidence of youth you are too confident gilbert you are but a boy and he is a strong man besides he will want to take it in his hands would you not advise me to carry it then sir not the original can you not make a copy of the paper but i am to call at three you will have time enough it is not long then i shall be obliged to neglect my duties here oh as to that in a matter of such importance i will readily excuse you you can go home at once and get to work thank you sir gilbert lost no time in availing himself of the permission accorded to him reaching his boardinghouse the same one to which the reader has already been introduced he took the important paper from its secure restingplace in his trunk and seating himself at the table began to copy it rapidly when he first entered mr fergusons establishment he could scarcely write at all but he knew how important a good handwriting was to one who aspired to be a business man and he therefore soon commenced taking lessons now he was master of a handsome hand jacob too was a good writer with a handwriting quite similar to his so that without any great effort he succeeded in producing a document very nearly resembling the original now uncle james i am ready to meet you he said to himself with satisfaction as he compared the two papers and then carefully laid away the first in its old place of concealment you are welcome to destroy this if you think it will do you any good it was still early for the paper was not long and gilbert decided to go back to the store and resume his duties until it should be time to start for the burnet house where have you been gilbert asked maurice walton crossly i have been home to my boardinghouse i shouldnt think mr ferguson would like your leaving his business to run home in the middle of the forenoon he advised me to go i suppose you pretended to have a headache or something of that kind said maurice with a sneer no i didnt i was never better in my life what did you go for then it seems to me you are very curious maurice said gilbert goodnaturedly if you must know i went home on a little private business of my own very important i suppose yes it was important mr ferguson is very partial to you thats all i can say he wouldnt let me be away for a couple of hours in the morning even if i did have important business i have no doubt he would i hope you wont be disturbed if i tell you that i am going out again this afternoon and you get twice as much pay as i said maurice with dissatisfaction i say its a shame you must remember maurice that i dont fix the salaries if i could fix it so your salary should be raised at once so as to equal mine its easy to say that said maurice walton discontentedly gilbert in spite of the discontent of his fellowclerk took his hat at halfpast two and left the store he reached the burnet house about ten minutes of three and went at once to the readingroom where he was to meet his uncle mr grey was already in waiting he was seated in an armchair looking over a file of the new york herald i have come mr grey said gilbert as you proposed humph have you the paper yes sir here mr grey showed signs of satisfaction as gilbert was quicksighted enough to perceive we will go up stairs to my room said his uncle rising and laying down the paper we shall be more private there perhaps he thinks he can get hold of the paper better thought our hero though of course he kept his thought to himself follow me said mr grey give me the key to no he said to the hotel clerk gilbert followed him up several flights of stairs till he reached his room enter he said unlocking the door gilbert did so feeling at the same time a queer sensation as he thought of the attempt that might be made at violence however he was not wanting in courage and did not deign to give audience to fear sit down said mr grey abruptly gilbert seated himself near the door his uncle drew up a chair for himself but as our hero noted placed it between him and the door he wants to cut me off from escape he thought never mind hell let me go when he finds he cant make anything by keeping me well said his uncle when they were seated let me know all about this precious plot you have been hatching i am engaged in no plot mr grey said gilbert steadily of course not conspirators are the last to admit the real character of their designs but that dont alter the fact you have laid a plot for getting possession of my property and to this end have forged a paper which you think will help you you are quite mistaken mr grey i have jacob mortons written confession of his agency in carrying me away from cincinnati i knew nothing of it till he spoke to me on this subject and placed the paper in my hands have you the paper with you gilbert didnt answer this question since he could not have said truly that he had jacobs confession with him it was merely his own copy but he drew the paper from his breastpocket and handed it to his uncle mr grey took the paper and ran his eye rapidly over it his countenance changed for he saw that it would have great weight in a court of justice completely substantiating gilberts claims to the estate which he wrongfully held well he said looking up after he had finished reading the paper i have read this document and i have no hesitation in pronouncing it a vile forgery it shall meet the fate it merits so saying he hastily tore it across the middle and proceeded to tear it into still smaller pieces now young man he said sarcastically as i have no further business with you i will bid you a very goodday and he bowed mockingly i think you are mistaken about our business being settled said gilbert quietly your forged document will help you little said mr grey triumphantly i have torn it into a hundred pieces illustration your forged document will help you little said mr grey triumphantly i have torn it into a hundred pieces page it is of no consequence said our hero calmly it is only a copy of the original paper chapter xx baffled but not discouraged the triumphant look on the face of james grey faded and was replaced by one of baffled rage and disappointment its a lie he exclaimed speaking rather what he wished than what he believed you are mistaken said gilbert in the same calm tone the paper you have just torn up was in my own handwriting i have no doubt of that i thought all the time that it was an imposture which you had got up i made a copy of it from the original this morning said our hero why did you not bring the original if there is one because i was afraid you might be tempted to destroy it it seems i was right added gilbert with a glance at the torn pieces of paper which littered the carpet at his feet james grey was terribly provoked he had shown his hand so to speak and gained nothing by it if his nephews story was true the dreaded paper was still in existence and likely to be guarded more carefully than ever gilberts calmness was a strong indication of the correctness of his story were the real paper destroyed he could not help showing agitation do you mean to say that you have another paper than this he demanded i do said our hero you must show me that or i shall not believe you have it i am not quite a fool uncle james said gilbert i know as well as you how valuable that paper is and i am not going to risk it you seem to be a remarkably prudent young man said mr grey with a sneer quite an old head upon young shoulders i ought to be said gilbert i was educated to the streets of new york there i had to knock about for myself and earn my own living at an age when most boys are carefully looked after by their parents i learned to look out for my own interests there i am indebted to you for that kind of training you must not complain now if i use it against you mr grey sat a moment in deep and troubled thought this nephew of his turned out to be a decidedly formidable opponent how could he cope with him have you told any one in this city about these false claims of yours he asked after awhile i have not spoken to any one about false claims said gilbert coldly call them what you will have you spoken of having any claims to my brothers property to any one here i have to whom to mr ferguson james grey frowned mr ferguson was one of the last men to whom he would have wished the communication known he must have laughed at your ridiculous story on the contrary he fully believes it i did not think him so gullible have you spoken to him about my being in the city i have did he know you were to call upon me this afternoon i told him before i came things were evidently getting more serious than mr grey had supposed not only was gilbert a young man who meant business but he was backed by a merchant of standing whose former connection with the grey family made his cooperation and favor of no slight importance james grey saw that he must temporize had he followed out his inclination he would have sprung upon his obdurate nephew and pounded him to a jelly but unfortunately he was in a civilized city where laws are supposed to afford some protection from personal assault and this course therefore was not to be thought of since violence then was not practicable he must have recourse to stratagem and to put gilbert temporarily off his guard he must play a part well young man he said at length i am not prepared at present to pronounce a definite opinion upon your claim of course if really convinced that you were my nephew i would acknowledge you to be such i have some doubts as to that thought gilbert but it does not seem to me very probable that such is the case of course i objected to being duped by an impostor you cannot blame me for that no at first your claim appeared to me preposterous and i pronounced it to be so upon reflection though i strongly doubt its genuineness i am willing to take time to consider it that is fair said gilbert i shall consult with a lawyer on the subject and institute some inquiries of my own then besides my time will be partly occupied with other business on which i have come hither you may come again say in a week and i shall perhaps be able to give you a definite answer very well said gilbert goodmorning goodmorning responded his uncle following him to the door id like to kick you down stairs you young villain he added sotto voce james grey shut the door of his chamber and sat down to think it was certainly an emergency that called for serious thought gilberts claim would strip him of fourfifths of his fortune and reduce him from a rich man to a comparatively poor one i am not safe as long as that paper exists he concluded it must be stolen from the boy in some way but how he felt that he wanted an unscrupulous tool through whose agency he might get possession of old jacobs confession that destroyed he could snap his fingers at gilbert and live undisturbed in the possession of the fortune he wrongfully withheld from him sometimes the devil sends to evil men precisely what they most want and so it turned out in this particular instance that evening mr grey was walking thoughtfully in the street reflecting upon his difficult situation when his sharp ears caught the sound of his nephews name pronounced by two boys or young men in front of him not to keep the reader in suspense they were maurice walton and a friend of his named isaac baker i tell you baker said maurice warmly its the greatest piece of injustice my being paid only half the salary of that sneak gilbert grey i suppose hes a favorite with ferguson isnt he thats just it im as good a clerk as he is any day yet he gets twenty dollars a week while i only get ten its enough to make a fellow swear did you ever speak to ferguson about it yes but that was all the good it did he seems to think theres nobody like grey how did grey get in with him i believe hes a nephew of the man ferguson used to work for besides hes got a way of getting round people hes a humbug and a hypocrite maurice spoke with bitterness and evidently felt strongly on the subject he had another grievance which he did not choose to speak of of which our readers have already had a glimpse his cousin bessie benton persisted in the bad taste of preferring gilbert to him of course they were too young for anything serious but in the social gatherings to which all three were invited bessie was of course the recipient of attentions from both and she had on more than one occasion shown unmistakably her preference for gilbert grey only two evenings previous she had danced with gilbert but when maurice applied had told him her card was full it was not an intentional slight and had he come up earlier he would have been successful in securing her but he chose to regard it as a slight and this naturally embittered him still more partly against his cousin but most of all against gilbert who both in business and with the fair sex seemed to have eclipsed him i suppose under the circumstances you dont like grey much said his companion like him returned maurice with bitter emphasis i should think not hes a mean grasping fellow and i hate him hes got the inside track now but my turn may come some time james grey listened to this conversation with increasing interest it seemed to open a way for him to success come thought he here is just the fellow i want he hates my dangerous nephew and can easily be molded to my purposes i will follow him and as soon as i can speak to him alone i will see if i cannot win him to my side chapter xxi a conspiracy james grey continued to follow maurice walton and his companion until his patience was nearly exhausted at length just as the city clocks were striking ten baker said well walton i must bid you goodnight wont you walk home with me it isnt far out of your way cant do it tonight the fact is i want to see the governor before he retires im hard up and shall try to get a tendollar bill out of him i wish you success as to being hard up i can sympathize with you couldnt you ask him for an extra ten for me i would if there was any chance of getting it but im afraid my own chance is slim enough if i only got greys salary i wouldnt ask favors of anybody but how is a fellow to get along on ten dollars a week just so well goodnight goodnight baker walked off and maurice walton walked on by himself he had taken but a few steps when mr grey quickening his pace laid his hand upon his shoulder mr walton said he maurice turned quickly you must excuse the liberty i have taken in addressing you being a stranger but i heard you when in conversation with the young man who has just left you mention the name of gilbert grey yes sir i mentioned his name said maurice do you know him i have spoken with him but i know very little about him i judge that you do we are in the same store said maurice but we are not intimate friends i infer that you do not like him no i dont nor do i probably mr grey could not have said anything more likely to win young waltons confidence than this frank expression of dislike the fact is continued mr grey i suppose i may speak to you in confidence oh certainly sir said maurice eagerly for he anticipated hearing something to gilberts disadvantage then said mr grey in a low tone i look upon him as an impostor you do repeated young walton what makes you think so i dont like to speak openly in the street can you give me an hour or even half an hour of your time or is it necessary for you to go home at once where are you stopping sir at the burnet house i think i can spare half an hour it is near by thank you i will endeavor to make the interview a profitable one for you i am going to ask a service of you and i am willing to pay handsomely for it upon a young man hard up as maurice was this suggestion was not thrown away i shall be glad to help you sir he said quickly come with me then i will defer saying more till we are seated in my room at the hotel in less than five minutes they were so seated by the gaslight maurice got a fair view of his companion and was led to wonder who he was mr walton said the older man it is only fair that i should give you an equal advantage with myself i know your name you do not know mine let me introduce myself as james grey formerly in business in this city the same the uncle of gilbert grey so he says it was impossible to mistake the tone in which these words were spoken is he not really your nephew asked maurice in surprise james grey shrugged his shoulders he pretends to be but i believe him to be an impostor what makes you think so why should he pretend to be related to you asked maurice excited and eager because i am rich and he has entered into a plot to extort money from me i can make clear his design very briefly he pretends that he is the son of my elder brother if this be true then the property which i possess or a large part of it properly belongs to him but if it isnt true how can he make such a claim my brothers only son disappeared when a mere boy and though his body was not found there is reason to believe that he fell into the ohio river and was drowned at about the same time a clerk in my employ purloined a sum of money and fled this boy has heard of these two incidents and cunningly putting them together comes forward with a trumpedup story to the effect that this clerk jacob morton was hired to carry off my nephew in order that the true heir being out of the way i might succeed to my brothers money it is ridiculous and yet it is cunningly devised i always thought he was artful said maurice you are quite right there he has an astonishing amount of artfulness and unblushing impudence but i have not told you all he produces a paper professing to be written by this jacob morton who he says is dead asserting all that he claims do you think he wrote it himself either that or he has met this clerk somewhere and they have devised a plan for jointly enriching themselves at my expense if this is the case and the paper was really written by jacob morton the man is probably still alive but keeping himself somewhere in concealment what a bold attempt at fraud exclaimed maurice who was completely duped by his companions plausible statements is it not now i want to ask you who know him well what your opinion of him is do you look upon him as honest and straightforward no i dont hes just artful enough to be up to some such game hes deceived mr ferguson and made him think there is no one like him so that there is no chance for me he gets twice the salary that i do although i have been in the business as long as he and yet you look as if you had a good business turn said mr grey with skillful flattery i know as much of business as he does i am sure of that mr ferguson must be a weak man to be so easily duped if it were my case he wouldnt find it so easy to impose upon me i dont know how he does it but he has cut me out entirely mr ferguson wont hear a word against his favorite you are unfortunate but we are in the same position there he has conspired to keep you down and he is now plotting to extort money from me by his preposterous claims do you think he stands any chance no but if he produces this paper of his he might bring a suit against me which would be annoying you know there are some people who are always ready to believe the worst and i dare say he would convince some that his claims were just and that i had acted fraudulently now that would be unpleasant to me though i should be certain to win at law of course what are you going to do about it mr grey to ask your assistance for which i shall be ready to pay but what can i do asked maurice in some astonishment i will tell you said james grey hitching his chair nearer that of his young visitor but of course you will keep my confidence certainly the whole strength of his case lies in this forged paper let me get possession of that and he can do nothing i see now you know where he boards probably yes cant you contrive to get access to his room search for the paper very likely it is in his trunk and when obtained bring it to me i am ready to give a hundred dollars for it i dont know said maurice slowly i am afraid it would be difficult but by no means impossible i will give you ten dollars now and that you may keep whether you succeed or not if you succeed you shall have a hundred dollars besides do you agree as he spoke he held a tendollar bill out temptingly it was a temptation that maurice walton with but fifty cents in his pocket could not resist he wanted money sorely besides he had a chance to win a hundred dollars additional and this would enable him to gratify several wishes which had hitherto seemed unattainable i will do my best he said holding out his hand for the money there was a quiet flash of triumph in the cold gray eye of his older companion as he placed the bill in maurices hands i need not caution you to be secret he said i shall not say a word to any one answered young walton james grey rubbed his hands gleefully as walton left the room the scheme promises well he soliloquized my worthy nephew i may checkmate you yet chapter xxii the theft of the paper had maurice walton been a youth of strict honor he could not have been induced to undertake the theft of the paper however large the sum offered him but his principles were not strict enough to interfere and the hope of injuring gilbert whom he envied and therefore hated made him the more willing to engage in the enterprise a hundred dollars will be very acceptable he said to himself complacently they couldnt be more easily earned now how shall i set about it maurice came to the conclusion that gilbert kept the paper in his trunk this seemed to be the most natural depository to be selected of course then he must contrive some means of opening the trunk he thought of pretending that he had lost the key of his own trunk and asking gilbert for the loan of his but that would draw suspicion upon him when the paper was missed another plan which he finally adopted was to go to a locksmith and ask for a variety of trunk keys on the same pretext in order to try with the liberty of returning those that didnt suit this and other points necessary to success in his scheme were determined upon by maurice and will be made known to the reader as he proceeds a little before ten the next morning maurice left his place in the store and going to mr ferguson asked permission to go home for what reason asked his employer i have a terrible headache said maurice looking as miserable as possible certainly you may go said mr ferguson who was a kindhearted man and who didnt doubt the statement if i feel better i will come back in the afternoon said maurice dont come unless you feel able i know what the headache is and i dont want you to come unless you feel quite able to attend to business thank you sir now for business said maurice as he found himself in the street ill rest my poor head by a ride on the horsecars first however he entered a small shop near by over which was a sign m frink locksmith the locksmith wearing a dirty apron looked up from his work i have lost the key to my trunk said maurice i can make you another said the locksmith i want to open it now havent you got some already made plenty but how will you know the size give me half a dozen to try and i will bring back those that dont suit all right is your lock a large one not very about medium said maurice hazarding a guess the locksmith picked out eight keys of various sizes and handed them to maurice i will bring them back safe said he all right i dont think youll run off with them now for it said maurice i think one of these keys must fit he took the cars to a point only two squares distant from gilberts boardinghouse and walked toward it but in order to change his appearance he applied to his upper lip a false black mustache which he had bought for the purpose and a little discomposed by his dishonest intentions walked up the steps and rang the bell it was opened directly by a servant i am a friend of mr greys said maurice putting on a bold face he told me i might get his operaglass this he said in an easy confident manner which imposed upon the girl do you know his room she asked yes i know it said maurice never mind about going up the servant went back to her work and maurice his heart beating fast went up stairs on his dishonest errand he had no difficulty in getting into the room for the door was not locked the trunks were kept in the bedchamber and he therefore went thither at once one of the trunks was a handsome one made of soleleather this belonged to mordaunt the other was plainer and smaller and no doubt belonged to gilbert maurice got down on his knees and began to try his keys the first did not fit neither did the second nor the third indeed it was only the last that proved to be the right one maurice had feared the failure of his plans when success came so far so good he said and began eagerly to explore the contents first in order came a pile of shirts and underclothing these he hastily removed and peered about for papers in one corner was a book of deposits on a city savingsbank led by curiosity maurice opened it he saw a long line of deposits covering several pages for gilbert had been in the habit of making a weekly deposit even the first year for though his income was small he had nothing to pay for board and this was of course a great help how much has the fellow got thought maurice he made a hurried calculation and to his astonishment and envy learned that our hero had seven hundred and sixty dollars deposited to his credit almost eight hundred dollars and i havent a cent he muttered discontentedly then there came the thought that if he found the paper he might count upon a hundred dollars and his good spirits returned underneath the bankbook were two letters written to him by mordaunt while absent on a pleasuretrip not long before and under these was a sheet of quarto paper which appeared to be written upon that may be the paper thought maurice and he took it in his hands with eager anticipations turning to the end he read the signature jacob morton a slight examination of the contents satisfied him that it was the paper he wanted success success he ejaculated exultingly my hundred dollars are safe now gilbert grey your hopes are dashed to the earth and you wont know who has done it for you there was no need of waiting longer he put back the contents of the trunk hastily with the exception of the paper which he folded and put carefully in his breastpocket then locking the trunk he went down stairs and let himself out by the front door without meeting any one i didnt think id succeed so easily he thought now ill go round to the burnet house and get my hundred dollars it pays to have a headache sometimes arrived at the burnet house he found that mr grey was out and decided to wait for him he remained in the readingroom reading the papers impatient for the return of his employer as he sat there mr grey who had been told at the desk that some one was waiting to see him entered ah my young friend he said affably well have you any news for me yes said maurice what is it hadnt we better go up stairs it may be better but in one word is it success or failure success said maurice good exclaimed james grey his eyes lighting up with joy come up again they found themselves in the same room in which gilbert and his uncle had formerly had their interview the paper said mr grey impatiently youll pay me the money said maurice cautiously if the paper is correct you may be assured of that upon this assurance maurice withdrew the paper from his pocket and passed it over to his companion the latter opened it and glanced over it triumphantly is it right yes it is right it is the forged paper we have put a spoke in the wheel of that impudent young impostor he can do nothing now but you want your money and you shall have it mr grey took out his pocketbook and counted out five twentydollar bills which he put in the hands of his agent now confess he said you never earned money more easily no said maurice but i wouldnt like to go through it again suppose grey had come in while i was at his trunk tell me how you managed it i am curious to know so maurice told the story which amused his auditor not a little especially when he tried on the mustache in his presence you are a regular conspirator he said smiling you absolutely have a genius for intrigue maurice felt complimented by this remark and the fact that he was the possessor of over a hundred dollars put him in very good spirits when do you think gilbert will find out his loss he asked very likely not till he calls on me he will wonder how he met with the loss i must be going mr grey said maurice it is about time for lunch i would invite you to lunch with me but it might lead to suspicions thank you all the same now the boy may do his worst said james grey exultingly he has lost his proof and has nothing but his own assertion to fall back upon i am out of danger chapter xxiii the tables turned as maurice walton left the burnet house he fell in with the one whom he most wished to avoid gilbert was returning to the store after his usual midday lunch he was surprised to see maurice supposing him at home suffering from the headache how do you happen to be here maurice he asked i thought you were at home my head felt so bad that i thought i would come out into the fresh air answered maurice a little confused do you feel better a little i think ill go home and go to bed i hope youll be all right tomorrow i guess so so they separated gilbert who was not inclined to be suspicious not doubting his fellowclerks statements that evening when he returned to his boardinghouse the servant said did your friend find the operaglass what said gilbert shure a friend of yours called and said you had sent him to borrow your operaglass i sent nobody who was it what did he look like he was about your size shure and had a black mustash i dont know who it can be did he go up into my room yes he did he said he knew the way i cant think who it was gilbert went up stairs and to increase the mystery there was his operaglass on the bureau where he usually kept it it was directly in sight so that the visitor must have seen it i cant understand it he said perplexed mordaunt do you know of any friend of mine who has a black mustache frank oswald he is considerably larger than i am the servant said it was some one of my size i cant think of anybody else i dont see why he didnt take the operaglass if he wanted it though it would have been rather bold as i didnt authorize anybody to take it as there seemed no clew to the mystery and as moreover gilbert had no suspicion that the visitor was on an unlawful errand he dismissed it from his mind two days afterward gilbert met his uncle in the street as the week was not up he was about to pass him with a bow when mr grey paused and appeared inclined to speak young man he said can you call on me this evening yes sir i shall leave the city tomorrow and though it is of no consequence to me i suppose you would like to know my decision in regard to the matter you broached the other day i will call said gilbert bowing he looks as if he were going to defy me thought our hero well i am ready for him in the evening he called and was shown up to his uncles room goodevening mr grey he said politely goodevening young sir said the other you did me the honor the other day of claiming relationship with me i did knowing that your claim had no foundation but was only an impudent fabrication instigated by cupidity i beg your pardon sir said gilbert quietly but that statement i deny most positively i have not the slightest doubt that that relationship exists neither has mr ferguson you have succeeded in duping mr ferguson you will find it a harder task to dupe me if you knew me better you would have hesitated before you attempted to humbug me in that barefaced way if you knew me better uncle james i am not your uncle james mr grey then if you knew me better mr grey you would know that i am not capable of making a false claim oh no doubt you are very honest the soul of integrity sneered james grey but every one has his price and as the success of your imposture would make you rich for life you concluded to leave honesty out of the question james grey might at once have referred to his possession of the paper but he could not forbear playing with gilbert as a cat with a mouse enjoying meanwhile the power which he possessed of crushing his claims by a single statement your charge is entirely unjust said gilbert quietly i shall appreciate the money to which i am rightfully entitled to be sure but i want to settle my claim also to my fathers name of which i was so long ignorant if you choose to call yourself grey or green or brown there is no law to prevent you i suppose said mr grey sarcastically but when you a street bootblack try to force your way into a respectable family there is considerable to be said i am not ashamed of having been a bootblack said our hero calmly i was earning an honest living though an humble one and i was not living upon what belonged to another do you mean me interrupted his uncle angrily you must decide whether you are meant mr grey suppose now i decline to consider seriously this very impudent claim of yours what are you going to do about it i shall take legal advice how do you expect to pay a lawyer i shall try to manage it no lawyer will undertake such a discreditable case i happen to be acquainted with one lawyer that will in fact i have mentioned the matter to him and i am acting by his advice now does he tell you that you have a good case he does what does he say is the strongest part of it the statement of jacob morton do you happen to have it with you no sir after the experience of my last call i prefer not to bring it you cant produce it said james grey triumphantly why not because you have no such document you are mistaken there i have the strongest reason for saying that this forged document on which you so much rely is no longer in your possession i should like to know your reason said gilbert struck by his uncles significant manner then i will tell you it is not in your possession because it is in mine what do you mean sir asked gilbert somewhat startled just what i say i have obtained possession of the paper which you so artfully concocted and pretended to be the dying statement of jacob morton what did mr ferguson give it to you asked gilbert amazed mr ferguson what had he to do with it it is in his safe i deposited it there the morning after my interview with you that is a lie exclaimed mr grey in excitement you placed it in your trunk oh said gilbert as light dawned upon him i understand you now before carrying it to mr ferguson i made a copy for reference thinking also that you might want to look at it again that copy i left in my trunk but the original is in mr fergusons safe i dont believe you said james grey furiously it is perfectly true i suppose that the young man who i hear called at my room one day in my absence was your agent and that he stole the paper out of my room you scoundrel roared james grey whose disappointment was in proportion to his former exultation i defy you gilbert saw that it would be of no use to prolong the discussion he bowed quietly and left the room chapter xxiv a sudden departure after james greys triumphant feeling that he had spiked the guns of his young adversary the revulsion and disappointment of defeat were all the more disheartening he would like to have believed his tale a false one but that was not easy on a closer inspection of the paper which maurice walton had brought to him he discovered a watermark in the paper showing that it had only been manufactured the year previous as gilbert had been in cincinnati three years this of course was sufficient to show that the document could not be genuine who would have imagined the fellow so shrewd ejaculated his uncle pacing the room with hurried steps he lost no time in locking up the paper im afraid hes going to be a dangerous enemy then contemptuously what a fool i am a fullgrown man with fifty years experience of the world to be afraid of what a boy can do no he shall not gain his point possession is nine points of the law and possession is mine if he undertakes to oust me he must be careful for i have not lived in luxury and grown accustomed to it for years to resign it quietly now if it is going to be a fight it shall be a desperate one one of the smaller mortifications which mr grey experienced was that of paying maurice walton a hundred and ten dollars without receiving any benefit from the outlay id get the money back if i could he thought but reflection convinced him that this would be impossible besides the best way to secure maurices continued silence was to leave him in undisturbed possession of the money after all theres one good thing about him considered mr grey he hates my rascally nephew for that alone i make him welcome to the money though he has done me no good how should he carry on the campaign that was the first thing to be considered evidently his policy was to be passive he must remain on the defensive leaving the aggressive part of the conflict to his nephew first in the programme he determined to leave cincinnati at once so that no legal process might be served upon him fortunately the boy does not know where i live nor can his employer give him any clew as he too is ignorant of it if he takes the trouble to call upon me again he will find the bird flown james grey was a man of quick action he no sooner came to this determination than he proceeded to carry it out proceeding to the clerks desk he announced his immediate departure then taking care not to order a hotel carriage lest this should afford a clew to his destination he left the hotel with his carpetbag in his hand and took a cab from the next street he was driven direct to the depot and in a few minutes was on his way westward how lucky it was that i took the paper from my trunk thought gilbert as he left the hotel probably it would by this time have been destroyed had it come into my uncles possession i think im a little ahead of him this time gilbert was not intimidated nor were his resolutions shaken by the defiant tone in which his uncle had spoken to him he was a spirited boy and he meant to stick to his rights as he understood them he was not one to be browbeaten or cheated and he resolved to fight out the battle i will call on my uncle tomorrow evening he resolved he will then have had twentyfour hours to think over the situation and if he is a man of sense he will see that he cant get over my proofs when mr ferguson therefore asked him how the business progressed he answered that nothing definite had been settled upon but that he was to have another interview with his uncle in the evening it will take some time to bring him round i think said his employer a man doesnt resign a fine estate without some opposition if you should need any advice at any time you may apply to me freely thank you mr ferguson i certainly will perhaps i may need to do it tomorrow in the evening our hero walked into the hotel and stepping up to the desk inquired if mr grey was in he has gone away was the answer gone exclaimed gilbert in manifest dismay for that possibility had not occurred to him yes he went away yesterday afternoon do you know where he went from what depot i cannot tell you he didnt take a carriage but walked probably he went home will you let me see his name on the register the book was placed before him and gilbert finding the entry of his uncles name saw opposite it st louis mo so he lives in st louis thought our hero it wont be hard to find him then his name is probably in the directory i must go at once to st louis this business ought to be attended to at once of course it was necessary to speak to his employer about leave of absence probably also mr ferguson would be able to give him some valuable advice and he was likely to stand in need of it for the undertaking on which he had entered was of no light character singlehanded he could hardly hope to overcome so experienced and determined an opponent as james grey he sought mr ferguson and gave him a full account of what had happened thus far he concluded by stating the departure of his uncle well gilbert said mr ferguson after he had finished have you thought of anything further or will you let the matter rest never exclaimed our hero with energy i will not rest till i have recovered the property of which my uncle has deprived me that will be difficult i know it but i am not afraid of difficulty it is not impossible he thrust me into the streets of new york to earn my living as a bootblack and i might have been there now if jacob had not revealed to me the story of my birth you dont express yourself much like a streetboy now gilbert no sir i hope i have improved since then i used to be amused sometimes by the expressions you used i dont wonder sir i must have talked like a young barbarian but i am grateful to god for having raised me above my former ignorance it is determined then that you will prosecute your claims how do you propose to do it i must first go to st louis and see my uncle again does he live in st louis yes sir how do you know did he tell you so no sir but i read it on the hotel register at the hotel did he register himself before he first met you no sir where was he before i dont know sir then what reason have you to think that he registered correctly why did he change his hotel i may be wrong but it strikes me that it was intended as a blind to deceive you your uncle is a shrewd man and he would understand the importance of keeping his real residence concealed from one who had in his power to prosecute a claim against him involving nearly his whole fortune then you dont think he lives in st louis mr ferguson i dont think he does gilbert looked blank that interferes with my plans he said i meant to ask a months leave of absence from you and go to st louis and see what i could do that would take money i have saved up about eight hundred dollars said gilbert eight hundred dollars repeated his employer surprised how was it possible for you to save so much i have no board to pay my roommate is rich and i was the means of doing him a service which he repays in that way i congratulate you gilbert it speaks well for your habits that you have laid aside so much money i was about to offer you a loan thank you very much mr ferguson said gilbert gratefully but i dont think i shall need it i shall have money enough but that is not all from what you say i am afraid if i went to st louis it would only be a wildgoose chase stay said mr ferguson after a moments thought an idea strikes me you may gain the knowledge you want with very little trouble mind i say may it is not certain how sir said gilbert eagerly chapter xxv maurice betrays himself in this way answered mr ferguson your uncle did not register his name at the burnet house till after his encounter with you in the street probably his reason for changing his hotel was to prevent your examining the register of the one at which he was previously staying and so ascertaining his real residence the same motive would lead him to give the wrong address in the new hotel yes sir that seems likely but how is that going to help me you must try to ascertain where he formerly stopped go to the principal hotels and examine their registers for a fortnight back probably that will cover all the time in which your uncle is likely to have arrived yes i see said gilbert brightening up it is a good plan and i think it will succeed i hope so for your sake gilbert lost no time in following out his employers suggestion first he went to the gibson house but he examined the books to no purpose he looked back as far as twenty days but could not find the name of james grey he cant have stopped at this hotel he said to himself next he went to the spencer house it occurred to him that possibly his uncles name might be recognized so he asked the clerk has a gentleman named james grey stopped with you lately grey i believe so said the clerk after a moments reflection he left us about a week since yes it is the same said gilbert eagerly was he here long only two or three days this of course made the examination easy in point of fact ten days back gilbert found recorded on the books james grey clayton illinois clayton illinois repeated gilbert thats a place i never heard of i wonder where it is it cant be much of a place can you tell me in what part of illinois clayton is he inquired of the clerk never heard of it said that official indifferently clayton illinois said a gentleman who had just come up to leave his key i can tell you where it is where sir it is a small town on the mississippi river north of alton i should think about thirty or forty miles i never was there but ive passed it while ascending the river on a steamboat thank you sir said our hero as may be supposed he was not a little elated at his discovery in spite of james greys prudent precautions his nephew felt that he had not been shrewd enough st louis had not answered the purpose the insignificant place where he had supposed himself safe from pursuit was now known and gilbert determined that there should be no cessation of hostilities he was resolved to follow up the attack and force his uncle to do him justice meanwhile maurice walton could not but observe that something was going on he noticed gilberts absence from the store and his frequent interviews with mr ferguson and rightly inferred that they had something to do with james grey i wonder if he has found out the loss of the paper he thought he must have discovered it and thats why he is in such a flutter if its spoilt his chances so much the better i owe him a grudge and if ive put a spoke in his wheel i shall be glad one incident having its effect upon the narrative has not yet been recorded when james grey left the hotel carpetbag in hand he chanced to meet maurice just before he took a hack to the depot an idea flashed upon him that maurice might be useful to him as a spy upon his nephew and might be engaged to watch and give him timely notice of his movements he therefore paused and maurice perceived that he wished to speak with him goodday sir he said goodday i am glad to meet you for i have something to say to you that paper you brought me was not the right one not the right one repeated maurice in alarm for he thought mr grey was about to demand back the hundred dollars which he would have been very sorry to surrender no the rascal had been cunning enough to put the original in mr fergusons safe and leave only a copy in his trunk the paper you brought me was the copy does gilbert say so yes perhaps he lies so i thought but the date on the paper confirms his story it wasnt my fault i think i earned the money you can keep it i have no intention of asking it back but i shall want to employ you further to get the paper from the safe can you do it i am afraid not if i were caught doing it i should be dismissed and perhaps arrested if you succeed i will give you another hundred dollars i should like the money watch for a good chance you may be able to do it unobserved are you going to leave the city yes i leave at once suppose i get the paper what shall i do with it send it by mail to my address where is that sir can i rely upon you not to communicate it to gilbert grey it would do him a great deal of good then i certainly wont tell him said maurice decidedly knowing the state of feeling between maurice and his nephew mr grey felt satisfied with this assurance i dont want you even to put it on paper he continued gilbert might get hold of it you can remember it without very well sir it is clayton illinois to the north of alton on the river now can you remember clayton i will think of henry clay that will be a good reminder as to the state you are not very likely to forget that now if you find the paper inclose it in an envelope and mail it to james grey clayton illinois as soon as i receive it i will send you or bring you a hundred dollars very well sir i will try but i am not sure whether i shall succeed its harder than the other job are you suspected of that i dont think so that is not all i shall want to learn about the fellows movements he may be planning some conspiracy of which it is important that i should be apprised now you are in the same office and likely to know what is going on yes sir i want you to watch carefully and whenever you learn anything worthy my knowing write me immediately to the address i have given you see if you remember it clayton illinois for every letter containing information of value i will send you ten dollars i shall not write direct from clayton lest the letter be seen but i will manage to have my letters posted from st louis that is where gilbert supposes i am living perhaps you had better direct to my boardingplace and not to the store a good suggestion give me your address james grey took it down in his memorandum book i believe that is all he said remain faithful to my interests he added and i will take care you do not regret it i shall not regret it if it interferes with gilbert grey if you are his enemy you cannot harm him more than by devoting yourself to my service i will do it james grey now hurried away and maurice went back to the store he thought himself unsuspected of the theft of the paper but he did not long remain so and it was through his own imprudence that it happened the black mustache which he had used as a disguise he thrust carelessly in his vest pocket one day in the store in drawing out his watchkey the mustache came too and dropped on the floor maurice stooped hastily to pick it up but not till gilbert had seen it the latter at once remembered the servants description of the young man who called for his operaglass how long have you had that mustache maurice he asked pointedly i bought it yesterday muttered maurice in confusion i thought you might have had it longer said gilbert quietly maurice did not answer now i know who stole the paper thought our hero i must be on my guard against him he said nothing further but maurice knew that he was suspected and it only incensed him the more against his fellowclerk chapter xxvi maurice and bessie benton gilbert could not help wondering how maurice and mr james grey were brought together and how it happened that the former became his uncles agent and accomplice he knew however that maurice never liked him and guessed that this had been an inducement i wonder he thought if there is any chance of his communicating my plans to mr grey it will be best for me to keep him in ignorance of my destination when therefore he was ready to start he resolved only to tell him that he was going to st louis this was in truth his first destination but as we know he intended to go farther maurice who didnt before know of gilberts plans was surprised when the latter walked up to him and said i must bid you goodby for a time maurice are you going away exclaimed his fellowclerk staring at him in amazement yes i am going away for a short time where to st louis on business for mr ferguson no it is on my own business i suppose it has something to do with his uncle thought maurice but he thought it most prudent not to say this how long do you expect to be gone he asked i dont know it depends on how successful i am bessie benton will miss you said maurice sarcastically so she said answered gilbert quietly appreciating his motive when did you see her asked maurice with a twinge of jealousy last evening this made maurice feel very uncomfortable bessie had grown very pretty and he admired her more than ever but with a strange perversity as he thought she didnt appear to reciprocate the feeling on the other hand she appeared to care a good deal more for gilberts society than for that of maurice it came to him now with a feeling of joy that when gilbert was away bessie would naturally turn to him for companionship i think i shall go up there this evening myself he said it must be explained that maurice no longer boarded at his uncles if you have any message to send i can take it give bessie my love said gilbert a little mischievously knowing that maurice would never carry such a message i will remember you to miss benton said maurice with dignity oh dont take the trouble said gilbert carelessly it isnt at all necessary then i wont just as you please i never saw such an amount of cheek in my life said maurice to himself ive a great mind to drop a hint to bessie she notices him altogether too much so maurice fulfilling his determination of calling that evening managed to introduce the subject gilbert grey called on you last evening didnt he yes he is going away he came to say goodby i shant miss him much why not are you not a good deal together in the store we are together out of it i dont care to keep his company why not he isnt my style if it means that he does not resemble you maurice i think you are right he is very much stuck up really maurice i hope you will excuse my saying it i think that charge could be brought against you more justly do you mean to say i am stuck up asked maurice indignantly perhaps it is only your manner but do you think i seem so more than gilbert you seem very familiar with grey to call him gilbert of course i am familiar with him why shouldnt i be it doesnt show very good taste on your part i dont know about that gilbert is popular in society you know that at parties he never has any difficulty in filling up his card maurice did know that at the parties when both were present gilbert was received with much more favor than himself and this was one of the circumstances that made him angry with his fellowclerk few can pardon a wound to their selflove it only shows that humbugs flourish best in the world he said do you call gilbert a humbug asked bessie her fair face flushed with indignation yes i do then she said spiritedly it only shows your jealousy and envy of him because he is better looking and more popular than you jealousy is hateful i think said the little lady tossing her head with emphasis i hope when i am jealous it will be of somebody better than gilbert grey said maurice angry and mortified because bessie had referred to gilbert as better looking and more popular than himself it seems to me you are making yourself very disagreeable tonight maurice said his cousin pettishly if you knew what an impudent message he sent to you you might change your mind about him what impudent message did he send i dont believe he sent any then youre mistaken he said with his own lips give my love to bessie a smile rippled over the face of bessie benton and there was a little blush too evidently she was not at all displeased at the message was that the impudent message you spoke of she asked yes then i dont see what impudence there is in it what right had he to call you bessie dont you call me bessie thats different i am your cousin well i call him gilbert so were even he had no right to send you his love it isnt proper really maurice i ought to be very much obliged to you for taking such good care of me and teaching me whats proper and what isnt but if you dont think the message a proper one what made you give it to me she asked smiling i wish i hadnt thought maurice who began to see that he had been hurried by his anger into making a mistake i thought you would resent it he said aloud you can give gilbert my love when you write to him said his cousin provokingly i shant write to him and if i did i wouldnt send him that message you are very obliging if you knew as much of gilbert grey as i do you wouldnt think so much of him do you know anything very dreadful about him asked bessie incredulously i know why he has gone to st louis is it to commit murder or robbery or for any other dreadful reason it is to commit robbery dont make a fool of yourself maurice walton said bessie sharply i dont know what else you can call it persisted maurice he is going to try to get possession of some property that dont belong to him i dont believe it he knows of a rich gentleman of the same name and he has forged a paper and is trying to make out that he is his nephew though it is well known that the nephew died years ago is that his reason for going to st louis asked bessie interested yes how do you know did he tell you i have the best authority for my statements said maurice who for reasons known to the reader did not like to tell how he gained the information but i am not at liberty to say more you are very mysterious what i have told you is the truth if you dont call it robbery i do all i have got to say is that if gilbert claims to be anybodys nephew i have no doubt he is he wouldnt forge a paper for anything thats where you and i dont agree i think its rather mean of you maurice walton to come here to slander a friend he isnt my friend perhaps he is yours you are right there said bessie firmly he is my friend perhaps when he gets that fortune youll marry him said maurice sarcastically he hasnt asked me yet said bessie blushing this was too much for maurice he began to see that bessie liked gilbert more than he suspected and that by his blundering he had only helped matters along he sulkily bade his cousin goodnight and returning home bethought himself of his promise to mr grey and though it was late sat down and wrote him a letter chapter xxvii james greys residence about a mile from the bank of the mississippi river in the small town of clayton stood a handsome house it was on a commanding site and could be seen by the travelers bound up the river from the decks of the large riverboats it stood in lonely grandeur with no other houses very near and those that were within a respectful distance from it were far inferior the occupant might be judged to be in his neighborhood a person of some consideration this was the mansion of james grey already introduced to our readers what motives had led him to pitch his tent in such a spot can only be conjectured he came thither directly from the city of cincinnati having lived in a hotel near by while he hurried the erection of this house he came thither with his son his wife was dead and had lived there ever since though from time to time he absented himself on a trip to st louis or in rarer instances cincinnati it is not unlikely that knowing himself to be guilty of a fraudulent appropriation of his nephews property he had chosen to withdraw from the busy world and plant himself in this comparatively obscure place where he was not likely to be visited by any one cognizant of the manner in which he obtained his money indeed until his visit to new york three years before he had not supposed there was any one living so cognizant he had seen a rumor that the vessel in which jacob and his young charge went out to australia was wrecked and he imagined or rather hoped and so persuaded himself that his dangerous nephew and his guilty accomplice were dead but his recognition of the boy who blacked his boots on the steps of the astor house undeceived him as to this point still it seemed altogether unlikely that the boy would ever become aware of his identity if he does thought james grey he is not likely to find me here on the banks of the mississippi fifteen hundred miles away according to the doctrine of probabilities he was doubtless correct it was not likely but then events often bid defiance to the probabilities and such was the case now at the time we introduce mr grey at home he was sitting at breakfast in a handsome breakfastroom from the windows of which the river was visible he held in his hand a copy of a st louis morning paper of the morning previous and was reading its columns while sipping a cup of coffee at his side a boy of seventeen entered the room you are very late jasper said his father consulting his watch cant you get to breakfast earlier than ten oclock sir jasper was dark and effeminate in appearance not strong and sturdy nor had he the look of selfreliance and calm power which characterized our hero who was his cousin he was smooth deceitful and vain running to dissipation as far as he had opportunity i was tired sir he answered what made you tired i didnt get home till late last evening where had you been i was at alton without my permission said his father frowning i am seventeen sir i am old enough to go off by myself by heavens you are not said his father angrily it seems to me sir you are getting mighty independent there is nothing to do here in this hole said jasper disdainfully i get tired of moping here i manage to content myself here said mr grey i dont see how you do it said jasper shrugging his shoulders well what did you do at alton not much i just went up there in the morning and came back at night i didnt have long to stay i missed you at dinner but thought you were out riding i am going out to ride after breakfast by the way father can you give me a little money money i gave you twentyfive dollars three days since i havent got a dime left what did you do with it you young spendthrift gambled on the boat i dare say well i had a little game answered jasper coolly and lost yes i lost of course you are too green to cope with the sharpers that infest those boats havent i forbidden you to play there was nothing else to do you appear to pay very slight regard to my commands in return i shall allow you to know what it is to be penniless for a time wont you give me any money father no i wont jasper looked dark and sullen he was an utterly spoiled boy if one can be called spoiled who had so few good qualities which admitted of being spoiled he inherited his fathers bad traits his selfishness and unscrupulousness in addition to a spirit of deceitfulness and hypocrisy from his mothers nature he was not as censurable as he would have been had he not possessed these bad tendencies he finished his breakfast and went out thats a model son to have a son to be proud of soliloquized his father he is already a gambler a liar and cares for me only as i have it in my power to promote his selfish ends i have let him grow up like an evil weed and i am afraid he will some day disgrace me though himself unscrupulous and bad mr grey would have been glad to have his son better than himself in his secret heart he felt the superiority of gilbert to his cousin yet jasper with all his faults was his son and the wily father schemed to secure to him the property which belonged to his nephew he was interrupted by the entrance of a colored servant pompey had originally been a slave as he showed by his language at times well pompey have you been to the postoffice yes sar i suppose you found a paper for me didnt you no massa didnt see nothing of no paper said pompey but i found this letter and he displayed a letter in a yellow envelope give it to me mr grey took it in his hand and saw that it was postmarked cincinnati the handwriting he did not recognize his curiosity was aroused you can go pompey he said waving his hand im gone massa james grey tore open the letter hastily and turned at once to the signature maurice walton he repeated why thats my young spy it must be about my nephew he read with eager interest dear sir so it commenced you asked me to write you if anything happened i think you will like to know that your nephew gilbert grey if he is your nephew which i doubt has just left here for st louis i suppose from what i can learn that he is in search of you i dont think he has any idea where you really live he has not learned from me for i hate him and i wont tell him anything he wants to know i didnt know but you might happen to be in st louis so i write to put you on your guard i hope you will write to me so that i may know this letter went straight yours respectfully maurice walton he wants me to write to him inclosing ten dollars thought james grey well he shall not be disappointed his information is worth that so my young nephew is on the trail is he he really thinks he is a match for me well well we shall see he mustnt push his inquiries too far or he may find me dangerous and mr greys face assumed a dark and threatening look however he is not likely to find me in this outoftheway place mr grey went into his library and penned a short letter to maurice walton commending him for his watchfulness and inclosing a tendollar greenback he had scarcely finished the letter when pompey entered and said scuse me massa but theres a young gemman below that axes to see you a young gentleman repeated mr grey can it be my nephew flashed through his mind with sudden suspicion bring him up pompey he said aloud chapter xxviii the guest of his enemy while pompey was gone to seek gilbert and invite him to the library james grey gave the time to rapid reflection he saw that our hero was a determined and dangerous opponent he had not credited him with such courage and perseverance he thought that being a mere boy he would be easily intimidated that opposition and difficulty would daunt him but he had hardly reached home and his nephew was already on his track how could he have found out my residence thought he maurice walton wouldnt tell him he must be sharper than i supposed when intimidation and force fail a good general has recourse to strategy james grey was a man of expedients and he rapidly decided upon a change of base when therefore gilbert entered the library expecting an angry reception he was astonished by seeing his uncle rise from his chair and advance to meet him with hand outstretched goodmorning he said smiling how did you find your way here i accidentally learned where you lived mr grey precisely so i was quite sure i had not mentioned my address to you no sir you did not it was an oversight on my part did you have a pleasant journey from cincinnati quite pleasant sir are you traveling on business on business with you sir that is all so i supposed well i am glad to see you we are a small family and lonely i hope you will stay with us a few days as your guest inquired our hero much surprised yes that will enable us to transact this business at our leisure i shouldnt think you would invite me to your house said gilbert in surprise why not you think i am an impostor i dont feel sure of that you said so in the city i thought so in the city said mr grey with apparent frankness since i returned home i have been turning the matter over in my mind and i dont feel so certain about it you may be deceived i know i am not said gilbert firmly of course you think so my young friend we wont dispute about it i only want to find out the truth and if you can prove your claim beyond any question i will do what is right but there must be no doubt of it of course that is fair enough it seemed to me incredible that a son of my brother john should be living and as he left some property i thought that you might be playing a sharp game you mustnt be offended at my plain speaking he added with a smile no sir certainly not i am in favor of plain speaking but i hope you will in time have a more favorable opinion of me i have already or i would not invite you to become my guest have you your luggage with you only a carpetbag where is that at the village hotel that is a poor place you must stay here and i will send for it i dont know what to say said gilbert not yet recovered from his astonishment then i will say for you that you accept without hesitation thank you sir mr grey rang the bell and pompey appeared whats wanted massa send dick to the hotel for this young gentlemans carpetbag yes sar what name sar gilbert grey answered our hero any lation asked pompey with the freedom of a favorite servant mr grey thinks there is a relationship said the uncle now be off and tell dick to make haste by the way though it is early to enter upon business have you brought old jacobs confession asked james grey in an indifferent tone but he awaited the answer with a good deal of interest no sir that is not the genuine paper i have with me a copy that will do as well said the other but he could not wholly hide the disappointment in his voice let me see it if you please gilbert drew the paper from his pocket and handed it without hesitation to his uncle if you have no objection i will keep this for a while and look over it in private certainly sir you may keep it permanently i have the other confound you i know that only too well thought the uncle but he only expressed his thanks quietly you probably know nothing of my family continued james grey though as a possible relation you should do so my wife is dead and i have but one child a boy of about your own age jasper is seventeen i am about eighteen he does not look at all like you or me either he favors his mothers family being quite dark i think also he is more like his mother in disposition than like me i hope you will like him i hope so said our hero politely i cant say he altogether pleases me said james grey he is not as obedient and observant of my wishes as he should be for example he went to alton yesterday without permission and lost all his money on hand by gaming i hope you never gamble gilbert no sir i dont approve of it you are quite right i foresee you will have a good influence on jasper i was about to say on your cousin jasper but i will wait till that is proved i will not call him cousin while there remains a doubt quite right i will give my earliest attention to the matter i hope you will sir as i wish to return to cincinnati if you prove yourself to be my brothers son there will be no need of that for the greater part of my property will go to you you will be independent i should be sorry to deprive you of property sir though i have no objection to becoming rich of course not we all want to be rich i shall not blame you for being my brothers son if it appears that you are so how long can you remain with us i wont set a limit sir do you think i can get away in a week that is a short time i can stay longer if necessary i may need to go to alton to consult my lawyer after examining this paper which i suppose is an exact copy of the original yes sir exact he will give me his opinion which i will at once communicate to you probably it will not be in my power to go to alton for several days i dont wish to hurry you too much mr grey that will be satisfactory to me very well now there is one other thing i wish to speak of of course i cant acknowledge you as my nephew immediately i do not ask it sir it will be better that your claim to be my nephew should not be made public i will tell my son jasper and ask him to treat you as a cousin he will i think be able to make you pass your time agreeably but to the servants you will be mr grey a distant relative very well sir i agree of course just as soon as your claim is substantiated there will be no further need of concealment by the way do you ride yes sir a little i think you will enjoy exploring the country a little with jasper you never were in this neighborhood before no sir it wont do you any harm to have a little vacation by the way how is mr ferguson your employer he is well sir is he aware of the object of your present journey yes sir he was in favor of my undertaking it for which i dont in the least thank him said james grey to himself there was a little more desultory conversation which was interrupted by the entrance of pompey with our heros carpetbag which his fellowservant had brought from the village hotel if it deserved the name pompey you may conduct this young gentleman to his room he may wish to wash before dinner dinner is at one mr grey thank you sir put him in the blue room pompey yes sar gilbert followed him up stairs and into a room finished and furnished throughout in blue it was comfortable and even elegant and our hero saw that he was likely to be well cared for was you a lation sar asked pompey who possessed an inquiring mind as he put down the bag yes said gilbert a near lation asked pompey continuing his catechism i cant tell you how near said our hero in an equivocal manner you must be bout massa jaspers age that is what mr grey says i have not seen jasper yet he went out ridin hes fond of ridin is he a good rider pretty good sar he thinks hes firstrate added pompey laughing do you ride sar a little maybe youll ride out with massa jasper has my mr grey got many horses four sar two are carriage horses and two are for ridin but im ruptin you sar dinner at one oclock i will be punctual i like his looks said pompey hes betterlookin than massa jasper looks like he was bettertempered too chapter xxix gilbert and jasper gilbert went to the window and looked out he was glad to find that it afforded him a prospect of the mississippi a mile distant he could not help speculating on the singular position in which he found himself placed he had come to this place expecting to receive abuse and defiance from his uncle on the other hand he had been politely welcomed and was now a guest he didnt understand it but he was glad of it he was prepared to contend but he would much prefer to compromise in a friendly manner his uncle had wronged him but he was not vindictive meanwhile jasper who had been out to the stables returned to the house and entered his fathers presence he only came in for something he had left in the library but his father detained him stop a minute jasper he said i want to speak to you jasper turned unwillingly for he anticipated some remonstrance or criticism upon his conduct i wanted to go out he said i wish to speak to you on a matter of importance said his father seriously now for a blowing up thought jasper i suppose i must grin and bear it but this time he was mistaken you are going to have company for a few days said james grey who is it asked jasper in surprise a boy of about your own age he is up stairs preparing for dinner at this moment is it any one i know it is not what is his name he calls himself gilbert grey is he any relation he calls himself your cousin why do you say calls himself inquired jasper in some mystification because i do not propose to admit his claim while he is here he will pass as a distant relative i dont understand father is his claim a false one listen jasper for it is fitting that you should know all since you are quite as much interested as i am do you remember your uncle john no i was too young when he died to remember him it was he that was wealthy not i i had a comparatively small interest in the firm but as he died childless i succeeded naturally to his property that made me rich and ever since i have been possessed of large means but if he had left a son all this would have been changed the son would have inherited the bulk of his property and i should have received an inconsiderable legacy do you follow me yes sir but i dont see the force of it my uncle left no son gilbert grey as he calls himself contends that he did leave a son and he claims to be that son but it is a lie said jasper hastily of course but you understand the motive that he may deprive us of the property precisely why dont you kick him out of the house exclaimed jasper indignantly of course he is an impostor and deserves no better treatment i will tell you why he is very artful and has forged a pretended confession and attached to it the signature of an old clerk of our house who disappeared about the time my nephew was lost asserting his identity with the lost boy and charging that i employed him to kidnap the boy in order that i might succeed to the property jasper fixed a fierce glance upon his father he had never loved or respected him particularly and a suspicion entered his mind that the charge might be a true one but if admitted it would reduce him to comparative poverty and he had no intention of suffering his suspicion to appear in this matter at least he and his father were in entire agreement but father he said after a pause cant you prove that it is a forgery possibly but i dont want the matter to come to trial there are always people who out of sentimental sympathy would be led to suspect that the rich uncle was guilty of defrauding the poor boy when did you first hear of his claim father a short time since during my recent visit to cincinnati i defied him then and left the city without letting him know my address but he is evidently shrewd and determined and he has managed in some way which i cannot fathom to discover it he has followed me up and here he is what do you mean to do i find force wont do he is full of courage pluck and determination and so is an enemy to be dreaded i am going to try an opposite course you are not going to give up no certainly not i am going to pretend friendship and having put him off his guard to get rid of his claim as well as i can the property i will never surrender as long as there is a possibility of retaining it he concluded firmly i agree with you there father so you have invited him to stop here yes and the better to carry out my designs i want you to act in a particularly friendly manner i will if i can but i know i shall hate him if you dislike him adopt the course most likely to injure him you are right father i will follow your advice of course anything that i communicate to you in this matter must be kept secret for both our sakes have i your promise you have then come here jasper drew near his father and the latter spoke in a lower voice you are a good rider he said yes i can ride as well as any one of my age in the country said jasper proudly good gilbert grey says he can ride also i am not afraid of his rivalry i am going to send him out to ride with you you will ride your own horse he shall ride bucephalus bucephalus father he is a vicious beast i wouldnt dare to ride him myself and i have no doubt i can ride better than he i would not trust you on him jasper as for gilbert i have no particular reason to feel concerned for his safety the eyes of the father and son met and the glance was that of mutual understanding indeed added mr grey if he should be thrown off and break his neck i shouldnt particularly mind it would rid us both of a dangerous enemy thats so said jasper its a capital idea when shall we ride tomorrow morning if it is pleasant this afternoon you may have the carriage and drive him round the neighborhood be as friendly as you can dont let him suspect anything from your manner i wont you can trust me for that father hush i hear his steps descending the stairs i will introduce you gilbert unsuspicious of the wicked plot that had been entered into against him entered the room at this moment gilbert said his uncle graciously let me introduce to you my son jasper he must be near your own age he has promised to do what he can to make your stay pleasant i am glad to meet you mr grey said jasper advancing with a smile and speaking in a soft voice i have scarcely any companions of my own age and i shall enjoy your society thank you said gilbert i am much obliged to you for your kind reception i dont think we shall be strangers long they talked on various subjects till the bell rang for dinner no fault could be found with jaspers manner which was extremely cordial yet gilbert he could not tell why was not attracted to his cousin chapter xxx deceitful hospitality jasper was now thoroughly enlisted in his fathers plans almost any boy of his age would have shuddered at the prospect of a violent death which through the united agency of his father and himself impended over his young guest but jasper was thoroughly selfish and what his father had communicated to him had inspired in him a feeling of alarm he could not endure the thought of surrendering his inheritance to gilbert and was ready young as he was to go to any extremity rather than to do it according to the suggestion his father had made when dinner was over at which both jasper and his father had exerted themselves to be particularly agreeable the former turning to his cousin said if you like i will take you out in the carriage you might like to see something of the country round here i should like it very much said gilbert but i hope you wont put yourself to too much trouble it will be no trouble i shall enjoy driving with some one who is new to the country it is dull work driving alone i will go with pleasure then and thank you for the offer james grey listened with complacent approval really he thought i didnt imagine jasper could be so polite and agreeable he doesnt often show these qualities in his intercourse with me when gilbert went up to prepare for the excursion jasper lingered behind if i am going to do the agreeable to your company father he said i shall need some money i am cleaned out without a word of remonstrance his father drew thirty dollars from his pocketbook and placed the money in his sons hands do it up handsomely jasper he said dont be unnecessarily extravagant of course but spend your money like a gentleman yes father answered jasper as his fingers closed with satisfaction upon the bills the carriage drove up to the door and the two young men entered during the drive that ensued jasper showed himself very social and communicative he was unwearied in pointing out objects of interest and in fact by his easy and genial manners almost conquered the antipathy which gilbert secretly felt i wonder he said at length leaning back in the carriage and surveying gilbert with curiosity i wonder you never visited us before i did not know where you lived yet we are relations distant relations are we not i have reason to think that we are related i have very few relations none that i know i believe there is a brother of my mother living somewhere in new mexico but with that exception i know of no relations except you where do you live in cincinnati i used to live there why did we not meet then i have only been there for the last three years that is lately i have been in australia and later in new york in australia echoed jasper in considerable surprise yes i was there for a while you have been quite a traveler how nearly are you related to us that matter is not settled yet i am not quite sure whether your father would like me to tell gilbert said this understanding the embarrassment of intimating to a son that his father had defrauded him of the property that was rightfully his he thought it best to let his uncle reveal the secret himself they drove ten miles reaching a considerable town boasting a large hotel let us go in and have a game of billiards suggested jasper very well but you wont find me much of a player i must get father to put a billiard table in the house i like the game but i get no chance to practice they adjourned to the barroom in which there was a solitary table this happened to be unoccupied and they accordingly played two games which lasted about an hour and a half the reader will judge that neither was very expert in the game now said jasper who paid for both games despite gilberts remonstrances we will order a little lunch and then start for home i dont feel hungry nonsense one can always eat besides i want to patronize the hotel did you have a pleasant drive asked james grey meeting them on their return very pleasant responded gilbert i hope jasper was attentive he could not have been more so i am much obliged to him i am glad enough to have company said jasper with an assumption of frank cordiality i dont often enjoy a drive but i did this afternoon i think i shall have to invite gilbert to stay here as our permanent guest said mr grey pleasantly while he spoke gilbert could not help wondering what had come over him to make him so different from what he was in cincinnati there he was rough insulting and abusive now he was the model of courtesy it was hard to believe him the same man gilbert was not very credulous but he was thoroughly deceived by his altered manner i suppose he really believed me an impostor when we met in cincinnati said he to himself now he begins to think that he was mistaken and is trying to make it up to me nevertheless there were one or two things which interfered with this view why should his uncle have schemed so eagerly to get dishonest possession of the confession unless he believed it to be genuine and therefore dangerous that did not seem honorable what had happened since to change him after reflection this was the conclusion to which our hero came his uncle had made up his mind that he gilbert had a strong case and meant to conciliate him in the hope of a favorable compromise otherwise what object could he have in treating him with so much politeness and attention gilbert was a smart boy or perhaps i should say young man but he was not yet acquainted with the ways that are dark and the tricks that are vain to which human craft is often led to resort least of all did he suspect any danger to himself from the uncle and cousin who seemed to vie with each other in ministering to his enjoyment well jasper said his father the next morning as they were seated at breakfast what plans have you for the enjoyment of our guest you ride on horseback dont you gilbert inquired his cousin yes i can ride a little wouldnt you like a gallop after breakfast gilbert responded readily in the affirmative he had taken riding lessons in the city and was accustomed to ride whenever he had a chance in the environs of the city he was in truth an excellent rider having taken lessons of an accomplished teacher who often referred to him as one of the most proficient of his pupils but when jasper questioned him he only answered that he rode a little having a strong disinclination to boast i should think that would be an agreeable plan said mr grey what horses shall you take i will ride on my own i am used to her and dont like to change how will you mount gilbert he might ride on bucephalus isnt bucephalus a little skittish that is what they say at the stable but i am not so easily scared why not use sidney sidney is not very well he has had a bad cold still if gilbert is afraid of mounting bucephalus there was an intentional covert sneer in jaspers tone he can try sidney now gilbert was not timid and did not like to be considered so had he really known the character of the horse designed for him his cousins words would still have decided him to take the risk i am not in the least afraid he said ill ride bucephalus dont you think you had better take the other horse urged james grey hypocritically no sir said gilbert with decision if sidney is sick i would much rather try bucephalus even if he is a trifle spirited a trifle spirited thought his uncle i wouldnt trust myself on the brute for ten thousand dollars if youre ready gilbert well go out to the stable said jasper they left the house and proceeded in the direction of the stable ten to one hell come back hurt james grey said to himself if he comes back at all he added with an evil smile chapter xxxi bucephalus the stable was a handsome building very complete in its appointments for both mr grey and jasper were fond of horses opening the small door at one side the boys saw john the coachman washing the carriage john we want the saddlehorses said jasper gilbert and i are going to ride you will ride your own horse mr jasper yes and your friend will ride sidney no he will take bucephalus john shook his head sidneys better for him he said i wouldnt trust bucephalus john youre a fool said jasper impatiently gilbert isnt a baby i know he isnt mr jasper but all the same i wouldnt advise him riding bucephalus what are you afraid of hes a contrary brute while sidneys as goodnatured as a kitten oh well wed better have a kitten at once gilbert weve got an old cat in the house warranted safe if john thinks it more prudent well saddle her for you a kitten might be too wild and skittish gilbert laughed i think i wont disturb the old cat he said ill try bucephalus better not sir said the coachman of course if you are afraid said jasper with another covert sneer youd better take sidney but in that case i shall probably ride away from you ill take bucephalus said gilbert in decided tones i am not in the least afraid and i think i can keep up with you on that horse i am sure you can john saw that further remonstrance would be unavailing and very reluctantly got ready the mettlesome steed gilbert jumped on his back and put his feet in the stirrups john came to his side and said in a low voice be very careful sir let him have his way and dont chafe or vex him i hope you wont have any trouble i dont think i shall thank you what could possess mr jasper to be so particular to have his friend ride out on the ugly brute thought john as he watched the two galloping up the road he wouldnt trust himself on his back maybe he wont mind it so much if the other gets a broken limb or broken neck i hope there wont be no accident that gilbert as he calls himself looks like a nice gentlemanly lad i think id like him much better than mr jasper who does put on airs and orders me round as if i was a dog john watched the two till a turn in the road concealed them from his view and then went back to his work but his thoughts could not help dwelling on the rash youth who had placed himself at the mercy of this illtempered steed and he heartily wished he could be sure of his safe return we will now follow the two riders and inquire how they sped jasper soon found that gilbert knew how to ride his position was easy and unconstrained and his seat was firm he seemed as much at ease as in a parlor but then bucephalus was behaving well he showed spirit but was obedient to the rein how do you like bucephalus inquired jasper i find no fault with him he is a fine horse what made your coachman so afraid of trusting me on him i hope you wont be angry with john answered jasper laughing but he doubted whether you could ride if you didnt know anything about riding your horse would soon find it out and take advantage of it almost any horse would do that of course i suppose you have ridden bucephalus jasper certainly though not often i am used to my own horse general i call him and i naturally prefer him jasper did not speak the truth he had never ridden bucephalus nor would he have done so for a considerable sum of money though he was by no means a poor rider but gilbert had no reason or thought he had not for doubting his assertion and readily believed that it was only the coachmans doubt of his horsemanship that had given rise to the fears he expressed how long has your father owned bucephalus inquired gilbert only three months who rides him neither of us much the fact is sidney is fathers horse and this is mine we dont need bucephalus but father took him for a debt and means to sell him when he has a good opportunity this was true bucephalus had been taken for a debt and as on account of his illtemper he was of no use to mr grey he proposed to dispose of him at the first favorable opportunity you ride well said jasper after a pause have you ridden much considerably answered gilbert modestly had he not been so modest he might have added that his teacher had pronounced him the best rider he had ever taught but gilbert was no boaster and therefore jasper remained in ignorance of his really superior horsemanship you dont seem to find any trouble in managing him i wish john could see you ride he would see how foolish he was in being afraid for you gilbert was only human and the compliment pleased him he knew he was a good rider and though he was not willing to boast of it he liked to have it appreciated by others he could not read the unspoken thought that was passing through his cousins mind he does well enough now thought jasper but wait till bucephalus wakes up then he will be like a child in his grasp i wouldnt like to be in his shoes then yet to this danger from which he himself shrank in dread he had exposed his cousin when he could easily have saved him from it it was proof of his cold and selfish wickedness that he could do this without being visited by reproaches of conscience for several miles bucephalus behaved unusually well but at length he began to show signs of the insubordinate spirit that possessed him they came to a turn in the road jasper took the turn but bucephalus preferred to go straight on he shook his head viciously and snorted defiantly its coming thought jasper and for the first time he did feel a little pity for his companion wont he turn he asked he dont want to but he will said gilbert coolly he pulled the right rein in a firm decided way bucephalus reared and began to dance round is that your game said gilbert well see who will be master illustration is that your game said gilbert well see who will be master page he sawed away at the horses mouth with no mercy bucephalus was enraged he could hardly understand the presumption of the rider who was daring enough to defy him to his worst he was accustomed to inspire fear in his rider and his spirit was up he indulged in worse antics when he was astonished and maddened by a terrible lashing from the whip in gilberts hand he started off like a shot at a breakneck speed down the road which gilbert wanted him to take in his fury he was not probably aware that he had yielded that point to his master on he rushed with the speed of lightning terrorstruck jasper sitting still on his own horse followed him with his glance he saw gilbert immovable as a rock keeping his seat on the maddened steed never for a moment losing courage or selfpossession he was astonished but he could not help feeling admiration also he rides magnificently he said to himself who would have supposed that he could manage that brute but there was one thing that jasper did not know which i have not yet imparted to the reader gilbert had taken lessons of rarey the famous horsetamer and that gave him a wonderful advantage feeling firm in his seat he let bucephalus continue his breakneck speed till his beating sides and labored breath showed that he was exhausted then turning him unresisting he rode back after a while he met jasper the latter could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the fierce steed cowed and subdued while his cousin seemed perfectly cool and composed thank heaven you are safe ejaculated jasper hypocritically i was very much alarmed about you i have given bucephalus a lesson said gilbert quietly i will ride him again tomorrow i think he is thoroughly subdued now did he ever act in this way when you rode him no answered jasper i dont see what got into him today you rode him splendidly he felt forced to add i am not afraid of horses said gilbert quietly but suppose we turn back i think he has had enough for one day chapter xxxii an unwelcome return i wish i knowd the boy would come to no harm thought john the coachman what made master jasper so anxious to have him ride the ugly brute he wouldnt trust his own neck but maybe it makes a difference when anothers is in danger i aint sure but id rather my frind pat murphy would break his neck than mysilf its human natur to think of your silf first and master jasper is got his shere of human natur im thinkin time passed and still john as he kept about his work could not keep his thoughts off the adventurous youth who had ridden bucephalus from time to time he went outside the stable and shading his eyes with his hand looked up the road but still nothing was to be seen of either of the boys if he can manage the ugly baste he knows how to ride thats sure said john to himself i wish i was certain of that same i do by st patrick what are you looking at john asked a voice near at hand john turned suddenly and perceived that it was mr grey who spoke i was lookin to see if the boys was comin back said john theyll come back in due time you neednt leave off your work for that i wish i knowed that sir knowed what repeated his employer that the young man mr gilbert would come back safe why shouldnt he come back inquired james grey he rode on bucephalus sir suppose he did im afraid the ugly baste will do him some harm i am not afraid bucephalus is a spirited horse i am aware but he is used to riding and doubtless can manage him so is mr jasper used to riding but you couldnt hire him to ride bucephalus he has a horse of his own said mr grey impatiently not liking johns pertinacity of course he prefers to ride on his own horse would you ride him yourself sir asked john shrewdly i have had enough of this said mr grey sternly it is a good rule john to mind your own business and i am forced to remind you of it go into the stable and continue your work i did not know gilbert was going to ride bucephalus but as he has chosen to do it i do not feel in the least anxious i have no doubt he will come back safe there he comes begorra exclaimed john suddenly swinging his hat in joyous excitement alive and kickin sure and the ugly brute as make and quiet as a lamb too where asked mr grey sharing johns excitement but feeling a wicked disappointment in the failure of his evil plans dont you see him sir hes jist at the turnin shure he looks like he had mastered the horse as bowld as a hero it was as john had said side by side at a walk came the two horses with their riders the fierce steed had found his master and looked quiet and subdued never till that day had he been broken till this time he had felt his power now he felt the power of another gilbert seemed perfectly at home on his back and from his manner no one would have supposed that he had had a hard conflict with the brute from which had he not come forth victorious the result might have been death or serious injury hes dangerous thought his uncle a boy who can subdue such a horse must have an unconquerable will while he lives i am not safe to john he said wishing to keep up appearances i told you he would come back safe you only made a fool of yourself by worrying shure he must be a splindid rider sir said john perplexed or else he has the divils own luck the one or the other mr grey waited till the boys came up and john took the liberty of doing the same though he had been bidden to go back to his work how did you enjoy your ride he inquired looking to gilbert i see you rode bucephalus i had a little fight with the horse answered gilbert but i came off best so he undertook to trouble you did he asked mr grey with curiosity yes he thought he was master and undertook first to disobey and afterward to run away with me but i think he met his match didnt you bucephalus said gilbert with a laugh as he stroked the horses neck bucephalus showed signs of pleasure and the fierce glance of his eye was softer and more gentle than mr grey had ever known it shure and im glad you come back safe mr gilbert said john earnestly i dont see how you did it i dont think youll find him so troublesome after this john said our hero dismounting we are better friends than we were eh bucephalus ye must have had a charm said john more than half in earnest i never saw such a change in a creetur before he was a lion when he went out and he comes back a lamb its a great secret said gilbert laughing will it last do you think i think so when a horse is once conquered he remembers it shure thin hes worth twice the sum he was before said john do you want me to charge mr grey for my services asked gilbert laughing shure he could afford to pay you answered john and that handsome how far did you go jasper inquired his father about eight miles sir well you must be tired and hungry come into the house and the cook shall send you up some lunch i am not in the least hungry sir said gilbert we lunched at a hotel in the next town jasper accompanied his father into the house but gilbert remained behind five minutes longer johns goodnatured anxiety for his safety had enlisted his good will and he thought he would like to chat a while with him you seem to be surprised at my coming home safe he said yes sir shure i am youre the only one i know that could manage the ugly brute let alone a horsetamer but jasper has ridden on him dont you think i can manage him as well as jasper mr jasper niver has ridden on bucephalus he told me he had said gilbert in a tone of surprise shure sir you couldnt have understood him do you mean to say that he never rode on the horse no and he wouldnt for a hundred dollars what did he mean then by telling me he had done so are you sure he told you so mr gilbert yes he said he had ridden bucephalus but not often as he preferred his own horse then savin your presince he told a lie but you mustnt tell him i said so i wont betray you but i dont see why he should deceive me said gilbert regarding the coachman with perplexity did mr grey ever ride on him no sir and he wouldnt hed be afraid of his life did you ever ride on him yourself john yes sir i did that same i rid him once too often before i knew where i was i found myself lyin in the road lookin up to the stars of which i saw plenty though it was broad daylight how long ago was that two months ago jist after we got him i haint been on his back since gilbert now began to look serious he was beginning to understand a little better how matters stood i shouldnt think mr grey or jasper would have let me ride him if he was so dangerous he said after a pause nor i said john faith they care less for your neck than their own im thinkin it is lucky i am a good rider or you might never have seen me again i conquered him but it wasnt easy six months ago he would have conquered me alls well that ends well said john philosophically he wont be up to any more of his tantrums when you are on his back im thinkin horses have a good mimery and they know their master i shall not be afraid to ride him now but i must go into the house gilbert entered the house he did not enter his uncles presence at once but went up to his room and seated himself thoughtfully at the window can it be that he meant to risk my life he said to himself i am in his way i know but is he capable of such a crime he could not decide he was not prone to think evil of others yet he felt that it was necessary to be on his guard chapter xxxiii another plot so he mastered bucephalus said james grey when alone with his son he must be a splendid rider i had no idea he was so used to horses said jasper he sat like a rock and did not seem in the least frightened i begin to think he is more dangerous than i at first supposed did he appear to suspect anything when the horse began to behave badly i dont think he did he may be surprised that we should give him that horse when we dont ride it ourselves he doesnt know that he asked me if i ever rode bucephalus and i told him yes but not often as i preferred my own horse that will do if john doesnt undeceive him john is a meddlesome fellow said jasper in a tone of vexation he tried to persuade him not to ride bucephalus john makes a fool of himself i am afraid he will arouse gilberts suspicions if he does we must do what we can to allay them what shall you do now father inquired jasper i have not decided when i have i may not tell you why not asked jasper suspiciously not from any feeling of distrust for we are both in the same boat and equally interested in frustrating your cousins designs but it may be necessary to resort to strong perhaps forcible measures and it may be well that you should be kept in entire ignorance of them it is a serious peril for both of us this claim of gilberts but more so to you i have already enjoyed the estate for a long time in the course of nature i have thirtyfive years less of life to look forward to than you therefore your interest is greater than mine all right father whatever you think best i am ready to agree to but if you need any help that i can give just let me know that shall be understood now you had better go out and look for your cousin it is not best that john and he should be left to themselves too long jasper went out into the stableyards but found that gilbert had already gone into the house thats a mighty foine lad that gilbert said john yes hes a clever fellow responded jasper not very enthusiastically hes as smart as a steeltrap said john earnestly i didnt know steeltraps were very smart said jasper sarcastically he felt instinctively that john considered gilbert smarter than himself and his selfconceit was so great that this troubled him wait till you get into one said john laughing if youd get your little finger into one of them things youd find it was too smart for ye what did gilbert have to say to you but john was too smart to be pumped nothing much he answered he says the ugly brute wont give no more trouble do you think so yourself he wont trouble mr gilbert will he trouble anybody else maybe not hes had a good lesson i wonder whether gilbert told him what i said thought jasper he didnt like to ask for in so doing he would betray himself after a little pause he walked back to the house but he did not see gilbert for some time for the latter was still in his chamber when they met at supper mr grey said i ought to apologize to you gilbert for trusting you to such a horse but he has never cut up such pranks before and i did not realize the danger to which i was exposing you from what jasper says you must have been in peril i suppose i should have been sir if i had not been so accustomed to horses but i have ridden a great deal though i dont think i ever had such a sharp contest before you had better ride sidney tomorrow i dont want you to run any more risk thank you sir but i am not afraid bucephalus has had a lesson and wont try to master me again with your permission i will try him again and hope to have him wholly subdued before i go i shall be glad to have him subjugated i confess as it will greatly enhance his value but i dont want you to run any further risk the danger is quite over mr grey this conversation and the regret frankly expressed by his uncle did considerable to put to rest the suspicion that had been excited in gilberts mind it did look strange to be sure that jasper should have made a false claim to have ridden bucephalus when he hadnt done so but possibly this was because he did not like to have it supposed that he was inferior in courage or in horsemanship at any rate though not quite satisfied he felt that there might be an explanation the next morning the boys went out to ride once more bucephalus justified gilberts prediction and behaved as well as could be expected once he made a start but a sudden twitch of the reins recalled to his mind the defeat of the day before and he quickly relapsed into obedience meanwhile mr grey paced the floor of his library and thought deeply to what means should he resort to avert the danger that menaced his estate he knew enough now of gilbert to understand that he was resolute and determined he might be conciliated but could not be intimidated while he felt that he was battling for his inherited rights would it be worth while to conciliate him mr grey feared that he would require the surrender of the major portion of the estate and to this he was not willing to accede while he was thus perplexed pompey made his appearance and said theres a man wants to see you mr grey a man or a gentleman a man its hugh trimble bring him up some idea must have been started in mr greys mind for his eyes lighted up with a gleam of exultation and he muttered the very thing why didnt i think of it before hugh trimble shuffled into the room a tall shambling figure of a man with a generally disreputable look he was roughly dressed and appeared like a social outlaw he was a tenant of mr greys living on a clearing just on the edge of a forest he had a wife but no children she led a hard life being subjected to ill usage from her husband when as was frequently the case he was under the influence of liquor such was the man who entered the library and evidently ill at ease on finding himself in a room so unfitted to his habits made a clumsy salutation well trimble said mr grey with unusual cordiality how are you getting on bad enough returned trimble i havent got no money for you have you been unlucky im always unlucky growled trimble frowning i was born to bad luck i was perhaps your bad luck will leave you after a time i dont see no signs of that sit down said mr grey with continued cordiality theres a chair next to you hugh trimble seated himself cautiously on the edge of a chair a little surprised at the unexpected attention he was receiving i want to speak to you on an important subject all right sir responded the backwoodsman not without curiosity you say you have been always unlucky yes sir and you dont expect your luck to change i think you said not unless it becomes worse grumbled trimble would you consider it good luck if some one should pay you over a thousand dollars would i id think myself a rich man exclaimed trimble but whos a goin to do it he added in a more subdued voice i will on certain conditions you will give me a thousand dollars exclaimed the backwoodsman opening wide his eyes in astonishment on conditions name em first you must promise that what i tell you shall be kept secret hugh trimble made the promise mr grey now rose and closed the door which was partially open and drawing his chair near that of his visitor conferred with him in a low voice for some twenty minutes at the end of that time he dismissed him with a parting injunction remember what i have told you and above all things be secret when the visitor had departed he stood with his back to the fire and smiled unpleasantly as he repeated i think itll work i think itll work chapter xxxiv a ride through the woods the next morning when the three were seated at the breakfast table mr grey said jasper i think i shall leave you to amuse yourself this morning i propose to invite gilbert to accompany me on a drive all right father where do you intend driving i scarcely know yet there are many pleasant places in the neighborhood which it is worth while to visit i wonder what the old mans up to thought jasper no good to gilbert ill be bound well ive had my turn and its no more than right that he should take his i wont ask any inconvenient questions will that arrangement be agreeable to you asked james grey turning to his young visitor i shall be happy to accompany you mr grey answered our hero politely then it is settled i will order the chaise round to the door at ten oclock i will be ready sir jasper looked at his father curiously as gilbert left the room his look was returned by one equally significant ask no questions it said and jasper sauntered out of the room in mute obedience ten oclock found the chaise before the door gilbert was on hand and so was his uncle jump in gilbert said mr grey our hero did so and james grey followed jasper stood near and looked on he isnt coming back he said to himself i saw it in my fathers eyes he wont dare to kill him i wonder the question which should have produced a feeling of horror only caused a feeling of curiosity and he walked away in the confidence that the dangerous foe to his prospects was to be disposed of somehow it is a pleasant morning for driving said mr grey by way of opening the conversation yes sir very pleasant did you have any more trouble with bucephalus yesterday no sir he has given up the contest i am glad to hear it how large is your estate mr grey this was a simple question but james grey understood it as implying curiosity on the part of our hero to learn how large a property he could claim there are about two hundred acres he answered by the way we have not yet spoken of your claim no sir i have been meaning to go to alton to consult my lawyer i have delayed it longer perhaps than i should tomorrow i will attend to it and report to you the result thank you sir i dont like to hurry you but a decision is so important to my plans in life that i should like the matter decided as soon as possible of course your feeling is only natural indeed i have reason to feel in the same way for if your claim is sustained it will reduce me to comparative poverty and my poor boy also james grey spoke with affected feeling and gilbert responded quickly dont think so meanly of me mr grey as to suppose that i should be willing to reduce you and jasper to poverty i can not give up my rights but i will take care that you are saved from any pecuniary want will you indeed said mr grey to himself with a sneer thank you for nothing young man i intend to provide against that contingency myself what he said aloud was something very different i feel sure that in any event i can rely on your forbearance he said but the decision may be in my favor and in that case i will not be behind you in generosity i will do what i can to further your interests though i do not promise to do as much for you as an own son of course not sir i thank you for your offer mr grey spoke so frankly and fairly he was one of those who could assume a virtue though he had it not that gilbert was partially deceived so far at least as to question the correctness of his former impressions of his uncle nevertheless he could not help calling to mind that this man fairly as he now spoke had in all probability conspired against him dooming him to privation and penury for nearly ten years while he and his son had been living luxuriously on the whole his uncle was a puzzle to him he exhibited such a contrariety of character and disposition that he knew not to what decision it would be right to come respecting it i am going to avoid the village gilbert said his uncle and drive you along a very charming road or rather cartpath threading the woods the trees are now looking very beautiful with their changing foliage and i think you will like it better than the ordinary road you are right sir i should answered gilbert it will give you an idea of our western forests i suppose you are only familiar with those in the east i am not familiar with any i have always lived in the city first in new york and afterward in cincinnati gilbert would have mentioned his residence in australia but he thought that the reference to it might be construed by his uncle into a tacit reproach and therefore forbore they turned from the main road into one not much frequented and speedily entered the forest not a suspicion of his uncles bad faith or of any conspiracy against himself entered the mind of our hero he had not yet fathomed the depth of his uncles wickedness jasper never cares to ride in this direction said mr grey he has no love for nature he has told me that he would rather live in the city yes he would but i am attached to the country i suppose when he grows older that he will insist upon leaving me that will leave me indeed solitary they kept on till they were in the heart of the woods as mr grey had said the road was now but a cartpath bordered on either side by tall straight trees suddenly from a covert of underbrush a ruffian sprang out and seized the horse by the bridle chapter xxxv how gilbert is disposed of what do you want fellow demanded james grey sternly in order to keep up appearances for he recognized his confederate let go that bridle i want money said hugh trimble for of course it was he is this the fashion in which you ask it said mr grey let go my bridle and come round to my house then i will listen to your application and if i find you deserving i will grant your request that dont go down said hugh roughly you rich men take good care of your money i shouldnt stand no chance at your house as much there as here maybe not said the man significantly there youd be master here i am master what do you mean by that i mean that i want five hundred dollars and i mean to have it do you dare to threaten me yes i do you are a rich man i am poor you can spare five hundred dollars without feeling it i dont intend to be forced into giving you money let go that bridle or i will run over you i will stand by you mr grey said gilbert speaking for the first time dont submit to that mans demands young man said hugh youd better not interfere you cant help your father he is not my father no matter what he is youd better keep out of the affair thats the advice i give you i shall stand by him said gilbert spiritedly youve got two against you and youve got two against you said hugh drawing a pistol from a sidepocket what do you say to that my friend what is it that you demand asked mr grey so im your friend now am i retorted hugh with a mocking laugh its the pistol thats done it i reckon i repeat it what do you want five hundred dollars i left my pocketbook at home i will go back and get the money do you take me for a fool you would come back with an officer of the law i promise you that i will lay no trap for you here hugh seemed to hesitate ill tell you what ill do he said finally leave the boy with me as a pledge and ill let you go suppose i dont ill shoot you on the spot james grey turned to gilbert you hear what he says are you willing to remain with him while i go back and get the money gilbert did not fancy the plan and hesitated if there is no other way he said at length my friend said mr grey i will stay with you and send the boy home i wont trust him said hugh who had learned his lesson well besides he cannot get the money as well as you there seems no help for it gilbert said james grey turning to his nephew he insists upon retaining you but it shall not be for long i will at once obtain the money and come back and release you he is armed and we are not we cannot resist him if you think it best said gilbert i am afraid there is no other way my friend suppose i give you my promise to come back will you excuse this young man from stopping no said hugh shortly say no more said gilbert i will remain he jumped lightly from the chaise and hugh released his hold of the bridle when shall you be back he asked at three oclock this afternoon i will be on hand with the boy keep up your courage gilbert said mr grey as he drove away out of sight a smile of triumph overspread his face i didnt think hugh would do his part so well he soliloquized really he is quite an actor so i am rid of my troublesome responsibility at last i hope never again to set eyes upon him on reaching home he stated that gilbert had suddenly received a telegram summoning him to st louis that he had carried him to a landingplace for the river boats and agreed to dispatch his luggage to the planters house in that city by express to keep up appearances he did so dispose of gilberts carpetbag directing it to gilbert grey planters house st louis mo pears like he left mighty suddint said pompey yes he has a friend very sick in st louis explained mr grey im sorry hes gone said john who suspected nothing he was a right fine lad and he managed bucephalus beautiful jasper said nothing but wondered whether gilbert had suffered violence at his fathers hands chapter xxxvi hugh betrays his principal follow me said hugh trimble to gilbert where are you going to lead me never you mind come along gilbert saw that resistance would be useless and he obeyed his companion plunged into the woods looking back occasionally to see that he was following he kept on for about half a mile as near as gilbert could judge when they came to a small clearing in the midst of which was a dilapidated log hut it was no longer occupied but had been deserted by the former occupant who had gone across the mississippi to regions yet unexplored years before go in there said hugh gilbert entered he saw nothing but bare walls all furniture having been removed when it was deserted our hero looked around him curiously and then at his conductor inquiringly he was not long in doubt as to his intention hugh drew a strong cord from his pocket and drew near him what are you going to do asked gilbert tie your hands and feet was the reply gilbert shrank back dont do that he said i aint goin to have you run away growled hugh i wont run away i shall be released this afternoon at any rate and i can stand captivity till then how do you know you will get free this afternoon you promised to let me go when my uncle brought the money your uncle repeated hugh exhibiting surprise fixing his eyes keenly upon our hero yes he is my uncle but he does not acknowledge me yet humph said hugh thoughtfully to himself suppose he does own you what then it is a secret youd better tell me i have a reason for asking i have a claim to the property which my uncle possesses thats it i understand it now what do you understand suppose you was to die what then there would be nobody to disturb my uncle in the possession of his property he wouldnt cry much if you was to die what do you mean asked gilbert unpleasantly impressed by the mans tone he wants you dead thats the long and short of it i cant believe it said gilbert shuddering you can have no cause to say this he cant be so wicked look here young one said hugh ill tell you a secret you take me for a robber dont you yes in course you do now im going to surprise you my stopping your mouth today was all a putup job you dont mean that my uncle engaged you to do it yes i do what was his object he dont mean to come back for you he wants me to kill you you dont mean that said gilbert horrorstruck yes i do hes goin to give me a thousand dollars and you agreed to do it yes i agreed to do it would you stain your hands with murder for a thousand dollars asked gilbert solemnly what can i do im a poor man fortune has gone agin me all my life there aint no other way i can get money if i was well off i wouldnt do it good heaven to think my uncle should be capable of such wickedness its just as bad for him aint it he hires me to kill you for the sake of money whats the odds he is worse than you he knows that i would not strip him of everything even if i succeed whats your chances young one have you got a good case if i hadnt he wouldnt conspire for my death thats so now young chap shall i kill you or not of course i dont want to be killed but you are too strong for me i am in your power swear if i spare your life will you see that i dont lose by it gilbert caught his meaning and snatched at the chance of safety if you let me go you shall have the same amount my uncle promised you and will have no stain of murder on your hands have you got the money nearly all the rest i can raise but i will do better than that on one condition whats that if you will let me call you as a witness to prove that my uncle engaged you to kill me i shall be sure to recover my property and the day i come into possession i will pay you over two thousand dollars hughs eyes sparkled but he answered cautiously wont there be no risk cant they shut me up no you can say that you entered into the plan in order to entrap my uncle will you swear to do that i will then its a bargain now what shall we do first i want you to go with me to st louis but my uncle must not know that i have escaped how can we manage that we can go up north afterward and take the boat from there when we pass this place on the river well stay down below that is a good plan when we get to st louis i will see a lawyer at once and put the matter in his hands i dont like to come before the court said hugh reluctantly but i will if you say so i dont think it will be necessary when my uncle learns that his conspiracy is likely to be made known he will be glad to compromise without a contest you know best if youll come round with me to my hut ill tell the old woman whats up and then well strike for the river you wont go back on me no that isnt my way besides your testimony is too valuable for me ill stand by you if youll stand by me give me your hand ill trust you young one he said before the sun set they were passengers on a river steamer bound for st louis chapter xxxvii a final surrender james grey waited at home in anxious suspense to hear from hugh trimble he felt that it would not be prudent to seek him out lest suspicion attach to himself in case his nephew had been murdered from time to time he realized the risk he had run and wished he had never entered into a conspiracy against gilberts life twentyfour hours passed and still hugh trimble did not appear to claim the thousand dollars promised him for the crime he had consented to perpetrate james grey began to grow nervous his nervousness increased when another day passed and still no tidings on the third day he was about to set out for the woods in defiance of prudence bent on terminating his suspense when he received a letter postmarked st louis it was addressed in a strange hand he opened it curiously but as he read it he turned pallid and when he had mastered its contents he sank into a chair overcome this was the letter st louis october mr james grey i write you as the attorney of gilbert grey claiming to be the son of your deceased elder brother and as such entitled to the large property of which you took possession at your brothers death and which you still hold to his prejudice he is prepared to prove his identity by the written deathbed confession of the clerk whom you employed to abduct him the genuineness of which document he is also in a condition to prove it will not be necessary to go into further particulars since he tells me that he has already conferred with you freely on the subject and put you in possession of all that he is able to prove he is also prepared to show that you so far recognized the strength of his claim that in cincinnati you endeavored to destroy the written confession alluded to and that on a later occasion you entered into a conspiracy with one hugh trimble to murder him promising the said trimble one thousand dollars for so doing to this hugh trimble is ready to swear having repented his wicked compact and enlisted himself on the side of my client though we feel that exposure and punishment for this wicked plot should justly be visited upon you we agree to keep it secret provided you interpose no obstacle to the immediate surrender to my client of the property at present unjustly withheld from him it is desirable that you come to st louis at once and settle this matter yours respectfully anthony bates when james grey reached the conclusion of this letter he realized that his plot had completely failed his tool had turned against him and he was in the power of his nephew there was but one answer to make to this proposition he dared not refuse it he started immediately for st louis and wended his way to the lawyers office he feared he should find his nephew there but was relieved to find himself alone with mr bates to what decision have you come mr grey asked the lawyer what terms do you offer silence provided you surrender the estate at once it will render me penniless at what do you estimate the value of the estate one hundred and fifty thousand dollars this is about the figure at which my client estimated it i am authorized by him to offer you ten thousand dollars in hand and an annual income of two thousand dollars upon the acknowledgment without delay of the rightfulness of his claim it was more than mr grey hoped for he judged his nephew by himself and doubted especially after his attempt upon his life whether he would not leave him to the bitterness of utter poverty i accept the terms he said briefly then the proper papers shall be made out at once now that mr grey offered no further opposition there was no further cause of delay an hour later gilbert had in his possession the legal document which restored him to his rights and made him a rich man his uncle received in exchange a paper assuring to him the provision which gilbert had generously made armed with this he went home without seeing his nephew he was ashamed to face the lad whom he had so basely defrauded and still more basely sought to slay when jasper to whom he had said nothing of the motive of his journey met him he at once detected the trouble in his fathers manner what is the matter father he inquired all is lost jasper said his father what do you mean gilbert has triumphed and i am a comparative beggar then what is to become of me demanded jasper thunderstruck always yourself repeated his father bitterly you have no feeling for me all your anxiety is for yourself i never pretended to be an affectionate son said jasper coolly its my belief that youve mismanaged this matter somewhat youd better have left it in my hands i did the best i could but gilbert is sharp and no baby you might know that from the way in which he tamed bucephalus i wish the brute had broken his neck i dont know said james grey slowly i believe heaven is on his side and we cant fight against heaven perhaps you are content to be a beggar i am not we are not beggars your cousin leaves us ten thousand dollars and assures us an annual income of two thousand dollars that is not bad said jasper with a sigh of relief i hope you dont mean to stay in this dull hole no it would be disagreeable when money matters are fairly settled i propose that we shall leave the country and settle in europe jaspers eyes sparkled the most sensible thing you could decide upon father it isnt so bad after all we can live comfortably on our income abroad not as we have done i dont care i shall get out of this hole and this life a month later jasper and his father sailed for europe they are still living there not happily for jasper is not a model son and his ingratitude and want of ordinary feeling affect his father the more that he is thrown upon his society chiefly for companionship when gilbert had settled his affairs he removed to cincinnati he was received with a warm welcome by mr ferguson who heartily rejoiced in his success maurice walton was filled with envy and disappointment his rival had been lifted so far above him that there could be no longer rivalry gilbert was a young man of fortune while he was a poor clerk on a small salary the worst of it was that there was no hope now of winning bessie benton but had maurice been wiser he might have seen long ago that he had no hope there bessie knew him too well and though she felt a friendly interest in his welfare there was no chance of any warmer feeling she had a partiality for gilbert while he was still poor as years passed it became further developed and i am sure my readers will not be surprised to learn that she now writes her name bessie grey but i have not yet done with my hero as may be supposed he resigned his clerkship in mr fergusons establishment generously asking that maurice be appointed his successor and privately agreeing that if mr ferguson would pay him the same salary he had himself received he would make up any part that he might not earn but i am glad to say that maurice turned over a new leaf and stimulated by the double pay now received became so much more efficient that gilbert was not called upon to make good any deficiency as for gilbert himself at the suggestion of mordaunt his roommate he decided to study law entering the office of the latter now in successful practice in due time he was admitted to the bar he spent a year in cincinnati but was led then to remove to wisconsin bessie benton accompanying him as his wife here he soon began to win reputation and at this moment he holds a position of high official trust in his adopted state we take leave of tom the bootblack trusting that the record of his struggles and final success may inspire all boys who read it to emulate him in bold and manly effort the buried treasure davie cameron was only a poor peasant and the cottage or sheiling where he dwelt was a humble one even for that wild scottish valley but though he had a small habitation and was poor in worldly goods he had a large heart and was rich in that contentment which is better than gold he often averred that he envied not the king on his throne though considering what very poor luck the scottish monarchs have had you may think that wasnt saying much davie was gardener to the laird of lanarkville just as his father had been gardener to a former laird of lanarkville and his grandfather to one still more remote if the testimony of davies old grandmother was to be trusted the ancient glories of the house of lanark had dwindled away from generation to generation so that nowadays there was nothing to be compared with the splendors she had seen when she was a lassie she was greatly scandalized because the present laird not only superintended the affairs of his estate but had even been known to labor with his own hands his forbears wad hae scorned to do the like she would exclaim adding with a mysterious shake of the head but gin the young laird had a that belanged to him he wad na need to dicker and delve like ane o his ain sarvants forsooth the story which lay concealed in these words was this in the year when the then existing laird forsook his home to follow the fortunes of prince charles edward for he was a staunch jacobite he enclosed his treasure in an iron box and buried it in the earth the sole witness and aid to this transaction was his faithful follower hugh cameron at the battle of culloden lanark was killed and hugh received a wound which proved mortal before he died he confided the secret of the buried treasure to his younger brother archie and would fain have directed him to its hidingplace but when he had uttered the words under the rowan tree in his spirit departed and the sentence was left forever unfinished years passed before archie returned again to his home and when he did return there lanark estate had been partially laid waste by english soldiers rowan trees there were in plenty but some had newly sprung up and many old ones had been laid low so that where in all those broad lands the iron box lay concealed it was impossible to determine diligent search was made for it from time to time but without success and when that generation had passed away the tradition came to be regarded as doubtful if not fabulous but old mrs cameron who although not born at the time of the battle of culloden had heard the story in her childhood from her grandfather who was no other than archie himself believed it as she believed the truths of holy writ but then the auld gudewife believed in many other things which her posterity had grown wise enough to reject such as wraiths witches spunkies and the like and if rallied on the subject she would reply indignantly and did na i my ain sel see the fairies dancing in the brikenshaw one halloween moreover mrs cameron held fast to the jacobite principles of her ancestors for one of whom she claimed the honor of having once sheltered the young chevalier in the days of his perilous and weary wanderings in acknowledgment of the act the prince had given him a gold buckle from his hat and promised to bestow upon him the order of knighthood whenever he should come to the throne the order of course was never received but the buckle was still carefully preserved so davie gave no more heed to her family traditions and wild border tales than to her stories of witches and fairies but just classed them all together and when she said to him as he was going to his daily labor on the lairds land ah davie but theres a mickle treasure hid there and wha kens but youll be the lucky finder he replied with a laugh nae doubt nae doubt a mickle treasure o kale and potatoes and who so likely to find it as the lairds gardener and then he shouldered his spade and went off whistling contented wi little and canty wi mair but one day long to be remembered as he was hard at work without a thought of grandmother and her legends his spade struck against something hard which proved to be the root of a tree youre an auld tenant but yell have to quit quoth davie tugging away manfully at the offender it obstinately refused to yield and laying open the earth with his spade he discovered that it had twined itself again and again round some object which he at first supposed to be a stone a closer examination however showed that it was not a stone but a rusty iron box then the dying words of hugh cameron rushed to davies mind and he had no difficulty in completing the sentence which death had cut short under the rowan tree in the garden that it had stood there the only tree of its kind in the days of the rebellion was afterwards shown by consulting an old plan of the estate davies first impulse was to summon a witness to the spot but remembering that the laird had gone to edinburgh for a few days he changed his mind and decided to impart the secret to no one till he came back to leave the box where it was or anywhere else on the premises would be the same thing as to proclaim his discovery as the servants would be sure to find it so he concluded to take it home and conceal it in his own barn now davie was an honest man at least he had always supposed himself to be and if you or i or another had insinuated aught to the contrary he would have been highly indignant and yet it is a fact that as he went out of the garden with the chest on his wheelbarrow along with the garden tools the whole carefully concealed with oat straw he felt like a thief meeting some of his cronies with whom at ordinary times he would have held a jolly crack he now hurried by with a mere gudeeen neebor and when he saw the minister coming that way he crossed the road rather than speak to the godly man as he turned into the lane which led to his own cottage little jamie who had been on the watch for him came running out to beg for a ride on the wheelbarrow and instead of catching him in his arms for a kiss as was his wont he angrily bade him gang hame to his mither the disappointed child looked up in his fathers face and then without saying a word but sobbing bitterly trotted back to the house there was in the barn a closet where davie kept his garden tools and which was seldom entered by any one save himself there he deposited the chest which had already begun to exercise a baleful influence and which was destined to work him still further woe he had intended or he had made himself believe that he intended to restore the box to its owner without opening it but now that it was in his own possession he felt an almost irresistible desire to see what it contained belike its nae treasure after a said he to himself but only some auld trash not worth a groat with that he placed his hand on the lid and shook it gently scarcely dreaming that it would yield without hammer and chisel but both the rusteaten lock and hinges gave way at once and the cover fell to the floor with a startling crash enclosed within the box were the gold and silver plate of the lanark family forth from their long burial they came to glitter once more in the sunlight though the eyes that looked upon them last were years since closed upon all earthly scenes and the soul of him who placed them there had gone let us trust to find a better treasure where neither moth nor rust corrupts nor thieves break through and steal from the time that davie cameron found the buried treasure he was a changed man he who was once so genial and lighthearted was now moody and sullen once home had been to him the pleasantest spot in all the world but burdened with a consciousness of guilt he could not bear to look in the faces of his unsuspecting family and by degrees he fell into the habit of passing his evenings at the alehouse at first he took no part in the carousals of the place but in the nature of things this could not last and in the end he became as reckless and as riotous as any of his companions it was thus he formed an intimacy with andy ferguson that he was a wild and dissipated young man was well known and much was darkly hinted which never came to light this man soon discovered that davie had something on his mind and taking advantage of the confiding mood produced by liberal libations of scotch whiskey and strong beer he succeeded in drawing the secret from him he at once proposed that they should dispose of the treasure and divide the proceeds ridiculing the scruples and laughing at the fears of his more timid companion he avowed his readiness to take all the risk and threatened if he were thwarted in his plans to make the matter public so davie feeling that he was fairly caught within the toils yielded but though tempted weak and erring he was not hardened and the thought of the crime he was about to commit weighed heavily on his spirits he became more irritable than ever and when his wife asked in her cheery way what ails ye davie prithee why sae doure gude man he answered fretfully whisht woman and dinna fash me wi questions but one there was whose presence and whose playful ways never seemed to vex him and that was his pet bairn nannie his wee lammie as he often called her nannie had been well taught in books as the scottish peasantry unlike the same class in ireland usually are she was regularly seen in her place at kirk and knew the assemblys catechism by heart she could repeat whole chapters from the bible and better still had ever ordered her simple life according to its precepts in addition to all these merits she had a sweet innocent face a guileless loving heart and was named by the youth of the neighborhood the bonnie shepherdess it is needless to say that nannie had many admirers among others andy ferguson had not failed to notice her beauty and winning ways he had sometimes given her a bunch of flowers or assisted her in finding a stray lamb attentions which she had received with sweetness and modesty as she would have accepted the same from any other of the shepherd lads but of love he never spoke or hinted until one summer evening he joined her as she was driving home her sheep to the fold after addressing to her all the pretty flattering things which i am told are common on such occasions he plainly asked her to be his wife im but a wee lassie ower young to think o wedding this mony a day she replied and so ye might be gin i were a feckless laddie like rob ainslee or tam o the glen but i hae riches ye ken yell never need to fash yoursel wi wark but just sing like the lanerock fra morn till een little care i for your riches said nannie who for reasons of her own was vexed at this allusion to rob ainslee does na the scripture say a gude name is better to be chosen than gold and wha says aught against my gude name exclaimed he with lowering brow andy ferguson said nannie pausing and looking him in the face it grieves me to gi you or ony creature pain but ye maun speak to me nae mair o love or marriage no never ye maun gang your ain gait an leave me to gae mine as to your gude name does na everybody ken an sorry i am to say it where your evenings are spent and what sort o company ye keep at this andy laughed a loud scornful laugh nae doubt everybody kens that for the maist part my evenings are spent at the twa dogs and as to the company there there is nae sae frequent guest as your honored father and wha led him into sic ways but your ain sel weel does the bible say a man canna touch pitch and not be defiled therewith just to hear her quote scripture ane wad tak her for the minister or a holy elder at least but leuk you here lassie say it was i that put the cup to my neebors lips for you see i can quote scripture too wha was it taught him to be a thief gang awa andy ferguson awa for i will na listen to sic words anent my ain dear father awa i say she repeated waving her little hand as he seemed inclined to follow her sin ye will na believe me gae ask him what he has done wi the lairds siller and gowd just speir him that called andy after her and then he strode away down the glen she hastened on and leaving her few sheep to wander at their will she sought her father she found him sitting on a knoll behind the byre leaning his head on his hands throwing herself on the grass beside him she told him of her interview with andy his offer of marriage and her refusal i hope ye did na anger him said he hastily why father what ill can his anger do us ye wad na hae me marry a neerdoweel like andy and father i hae na told ye all he called ye a thief father a thief i knew it was a lee a wicked lee dinna think your little nannie believed it and then he bade me speir what ye had done wi the lairds siller and gowd to her great grief and surprise her father sunk his face in his hands again with a low groan but answered not a word winna ye speak to me and tell me what it a means said she twining her arms over his shoulder sin ye maun know then it is true a true that he tauld ye o my bonnie bairn said he in a tone of ineffable sadness and then he told her how he had found the treasure and of the sinful compact he had made with andy but ye hae kept it a safe dear father cried nannie joyfully a safe i hae not sae much as taen it frae the box then there is naught to do but take it back to the laird and tell him here is his treasure safe and sound and then hell speir me how i came by it and wherefore i kept it sae lang and a about it and then belike hell shut me up in prison o lassie ye dinna think what yere saying could ye bear to see your puir father shut up in a prison could ye ever hold up your head again for the shame ot better far better be innocent and in prison than guilty and go free o for my sake for your wee lammies sake take back the lairds siller and gowd or if he should na imprison me he continued he will take frae me the place that has been mine and my fathers and my grandfathers afore me i shall na hae where to lay my head na shelter for you my bairn an davie camerons name will be cast out as evil hae ye weel considered a that nannie the future nane can foresee replied she but this i know that it is always safe to do the thing that is right then will the gude god care for us as he cares for the wee birdie that is lilting sae sweetly on yonder thorn and of this be certain dear father that come honor or shame come weal come woe your little nannie will cleave to you as long as life shall last then my blessed bairn it shall be as you say and even as davie uttered these words the clouds lifted all the misery and uncertainty were gone to be succeeded by calmness and resolution rising up from the ground he paused only for a kiss from nannie and went without delay to restore the chest to its rightful owner simply and truthfully he told his story from first to last adding and now i hae brought back wi me the treasure i wrangfully took do wi me as ye list the laird was overjoyed to recover this ancient and valuable family relic and instead of greeting davie with anger and threats of punishment as he had expected came near overwhelming him with gratitude addressing him as my good man but ye dinna understand said the bewildered davie i hae na been gude i een had it in my heart to be a thief a wicked pawkie thief what you intended to do matters less to me than what you have really done answered the goodnatured laird are ye na going to put me in prison or turn me out o my place on the contrary i am going to reward you for the service you have rendered that maun na be cried davie drawing back dinna ask me i seek na reward but to feel that i can once mair look my fellowcreatures in the face an honest man an the story o what i hae suffered shall aye be a warning to me and to my bairns after me to flee frae temptation a happy circle was that which gathered round davies ingle that night the ingle from which the alehouse never again had power to allure him jean the gudewife with her sewing in her hand and the old gray cat at her feet shall be the central figure grandmother sits on one side of the fireplace spinning flax ever and anon bursting out into some old jacobite song and davie himself in the armchair on the other side with jamie on his knee on a low seat close by him is nannie now looking into her fathers face and now glancing beyond for there sits robbie ainslee and so we drop the curtain lloyds fire on the beach lloyd and jem were squatted up among the rocks watching a vessel out to sea it was a cold evening christmas eve the night coming on fast no vessel had any business to be out there among the breakers running in straight on the bar that is if any man aboard of her knew what he was about so lloyd and jem said at least and they had a right to know as they had been born and bred on that bit of rocky island and knew every foot of the sea within a mile as well as they knew their own crabboats and dragnets the vessel was a small schooner such as ran down to the island from town in summer with flour and took back crabs and fish but what can she want now said jem she dont know the coast said lloyd shell be on the rocks in an hour if she dont tack jem went to school over on the mainland in winter there was no need for him to work so hard either the money he made by gunning or fishing he spent for tops and kites but lloyds mother mrs wells who lived in a little brown cottage back of the rocks was not able to keep him and herself without his help for two or three years he had worked as hard as any man on the island there had been another son of mrs wells older than lloyd a young man called john but he had been mate on the swallow that was wrecked on the irish coast four years ago when all the crew were lost never heard of again so there was nobody left but lloyd in winter when there was no fishing he whittled crosses and paperknives out of the cedars trimming them with lichen and sent them over to town for sale in the evenings he would go out for a run and whiff of fresh air he and jem were cruising about when they spied the schooner they sat quite still a good while watching her beating about going out to the open sea and then turning as often and heading toward the coast on which they sat its plain that shes trying to make this island said jem yes sir shell go to pieces if she tries it answered lloyd taking off his cap and putting it on again emphatically yes sir shell go to pieces if there was anybody aboard that knew of cooks crack how could anybody aboard that schooner know of cooks crack said lloyd contemptuously thats so how could they sure enough then the boys blew on their fingers to keep them warm and hustled in closer under the rocks clasping their hands about their knees now to make you town boys understand i must tell you that the schooners in summer landed at the village which was a couple of miles from the point where the boys were the shore off from where they sat was full of hidden rocks and sand bars running out under the froth and swirl of the waves against which no ship could run without having her bottom ripped up but through these rocks there was one narrow opening through which the sea ran clear and deep making a safe channel to the shore this was cooks crack very few of the fishermen knew of it it was not likely therefore that anybody on board of the schooner would be able to pilot her through it shes bound to run ashore said jem whatll we do lloyd all the boys asked lloyd what to do whenever there was any trouble he did not answer at once being busy considering go down to the village jem and let some of the men go out with a boat to them that will be too late to do any good it will be dark before i reach the village and theres no moon nobody could go out after night in that sea besides shes putting in so fast shell be on the rocks in half an hour do you go to the village jem said lloyd quietly he was in dreadful doubt himself as to whether he was right but a captain he knew never should let his crew see that he was in doubt and lloyd knew he must be captain in this case jem had legs to run and a tongue to give a message but he had no head to plan or execute all right said jem goodnaturedly im off when he was gone on the full run lloyd stood thinking there were no men nearer than the village whatever he did he must do alone he was tired of acting a mans part and doing a mans work though the other boys often envied him his head and bones ached most of the time and he was getting a sober old wizened face he wished often that he could have a month of downright play and idleness and no doubt it would have been the very best thing for him however now he had to manage all alone ill go up to supper or mother will be uneasy he said at last he would be back in half an hour and before that he could do nothing the wind drove the schooner back so that she could not reach the rocks under an hour lloyds eyes were sharper than jems he did not tell his mother about the schooner she was a little woman not strong and she was easily frightened lloyd tried to keep all trouble from her as he knew his brother john had done when he was living she was waiting for him come sonny boy heres fish for supper and good corn bread lloyd laughed and washed his hands he joked and talked all the time he was eating though he was terribly anxious about the schooner he would have liked too to have some nourishing tea for his mother or a warmer dress than the thin one she wore but john had been a hearty cheerful fellow keeping up everybodys heart theres no use shoving trouble on to mother thought lloyd after supper he heaped up the fire put her chair in the warmest corner and brought her knitting all ready she had a great basket full of socks and stockings big and little ready to send for sale down to the town are you going out again lloyd when he kissed her its a bitter night down on the beach a bit mother you go to bed early ill be in all right and safe he seemed to have forgotten that it was christmas eve his mother had not she looked after him sorrowfully in old times when his father was alive christmas had been a great holiday for his boys afterward john had made it so for lloyd now she had not a penny to spare to buy him a book or a toy such as other boys had down in the village even the poorest even the new shoes which she had hoped to be able to buy to take the place of his broken boots she had to give up she thought it was but a dull poor life coming for lloyd he was too young to be put to hard hard work with neither chance for learning nor play but as she sat looking in the fire she suddenly remembered how god who held the great moaning sea and the starless night in the hollow of his hand held her too and her boy in the meantime lloyd was down on the beach it was growing dark fast the schooner was beating about uncertainly yet evidently determined to reach the island lloyd had made up his mind there was no way to give her warning all he could do was to guide her if possible into the safe channel he went down to the landing opposite cooks crack and began making a halfcircle of bits of rock and sand to keep off the wind from the fire he meant to make then he began collecting sticks dried grass and bits of old wrecks with which the beach was strewed now making a bonfire no doubt appears to you boys to be only fine fun and you think lloyd a very lucky fellow to have the chance but a bonfire in the street on a summer night or down in a vacant lot is a very different matter from lloyds work alone on a december night with the salt water plashing about his legs and his breath freezing about his mouth besides he knew that the lives of the ships crew depended on what he did or left undone and he was not a man to be sure he was right but a boy only thirteen years old he heaped up the wood on the light pile of drift struck a match and put it to it and in a minute the big flames flashed out all over the dark rocks and the black seething plane of the sea and the wedges of ice that lay along shore it was very cheery at first lloyd gave a grand hurrah and capered about it but one does not care to hurrah and caper alone he thought the schooner would be in now in half an hour theyll make straight for the fire he said but half an hour an hour passed and strain his eyes as he would he could see nothing but inky darkness and hear nothing but the dull swash swash of the tide upon the sand the fire was dying down he went groping up and down the beach for wood and built it up again two hours three it was terribly cold overhead there was neither moon nor star only a flat of black fog descending lower and lower surely the schooner had gone suddenly he heard a cry it was jem why lloyd are you crazy do you know this is the coldest night this year on the island my father says so its not so very cold said lloyd beginning to hop about the fire and sing that schooners due now i should say it heartened him so to hear anybodys voice the schooners gone hours ago i dare say youd have heard from her before now if she meant to run in did the men go out no it was dark when i reached the village too late i say lloyd clapping his hands to keep warm come home this is nonsense i am going now jem was older than lloyd and though lloyd was always captain of the two still he was half frozen and very willing to be tempted do you think its nonsense pushing the logs with his foot doubtfully of course i do im going dont go yet jem lloyd begged it was horribly lonely here in the cold and dark and storm ill wait while i count ten standing first on one leg and then the other lloyd looked out to sea nothing there but blackness and the dreadful incessant moaning the fire was nearly out what was the use of working all night for people who were away out on their homeward journey knowing and caring nothing for him up at the cottage his mother had a nice fire for him a warm bed he began kicking the embers apart it does seem like folly he said but on the other hand what if the schooner were there still with nothing but his fire to guide her to safety there was a chance of that the merest chance but there was one ill stay jem you can go home jem hesitated a moment and then started at a quick run for home his steps sounded very dreary beating along the shore lloyd went to work to collect more wood he had to grope among the icy mass along shore to find his way the tide was rising and the frozen spray half blinded him besides he was not warmly clothed now i am not going to tell you a painful story so i will not dwell on this long night the longest in lloyd wells life perhaps though he lived to be an old man no sound came to him from the sea to show that the schooner was there or that his work was of use but still he did not once give it up all night he groped and tugged at the scattered bits of wood piled them up keeping himself in motion not daring to close his eyes knowing that if he did he would never waken all night long but at last he stumbled and sank and did not rise again the cold and weariness were too much for the lad if his heart was that of a man as he fell he heard a grating sound on the beach voices shouts was it the schooner had he saved them he woke in his mothers bed she was leaning over him crying laughing at once there was a man beside her with his arm about her waist stooping over lloyd patting his pale little face a tall bronzed man but the eyes and mouth were those of the little photograph framed in black that hung over his mothers bed lloyd tried to raise his head john he cried o john john took him in his strong arms and cried over him big man as he was yes ive got back lloyd ive had a rough time of it these three years but im home now with plenty of money in my pocket thank god and ill take the load off of your shoulders my boy and mothers youre going to have time to live like other boys lloyd and well begin tomorrow by keeping such a christmas as was never known well buy out half the stores in the village it was his old way of rattling on but he could not keep the choking from his throat lloyds mother sat down and held her two boys hands in hers and said nothing were you in the schooner asked lloyd when he found strength to speak yes your fire saved us lloyd i am glad of that i wonder what jem will say now laughed lloyd but his mother was thinking how god had held both her boys in the hollow of his hand that night the end
