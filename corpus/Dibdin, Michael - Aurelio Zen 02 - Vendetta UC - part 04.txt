 thursday all the talk at the cafe the next morning was of the over night swoop by the police and carabinieri on leftist sym pathizers in milan turin and genoa about time too was the dentists comment but one of the craftsmen from the basement workshops disagreed the real terrorists dont have anything to do vith those sinistrini its just the cops trying to make a good impres sion a week from now theyll all have been turned loose again and well be back where we started the barman ernesto and the dentist looked at zen who maintained a stony silence the reason for this was neither professional reserve nor disapproval of the craftsmans cynical tone zen simply wasnt paying any attention to the conversation he had problems of his own that were too pressing to allow him the luxury of discussing other peoples problems which were quite literally closer to home once again he had stayed up until the small hours of the morning trying without success to find the missing link that would explain the events of the previous days noi only had he not succeeded he wasnt even sure that success was possible the temptation to fit everything into a neat pattern he knew should be resisted it might well be that two or more quite unrelated patterns were at work one thing was sure during the three hours he had been absent from home the night before someone had entered his flat and left an envelope filled with shotgun pellets on the sideboard in the hallway zen had locked the front door on leaving and it had still been locked on his return questioning his mother obliquely to avoid frightening her he had confirmed that she had not let anyone in the only other person with a key was maria grazia before leaving for work zen had interrogated her without result the key was kept in her handbag which hadnt been lost or stolen her family were all strict catholics of the type who would have guilt pangs about picking up a hundred lire coin they found in the street it was out of the question that any of them might have been bribed to pass on the key to a third party zen also questioned giuseppe who had duplicate keys to all the apartments he was equally categorical in his denials and given the fanatical vigilance with which he carried out his duties it seemed unlikely that the intruder could have gained access in this way which left only the metallic scraping zens mother had reported hearing the night before it had come from the other side of the room she said where the large wardrobe stood it now seemed clear that the noise had been made by someone picking the lock of the door leading to the fire escape only to find that it was blocked by the wardrobe which had been placed in front of it since this attempt had failed the intruder had returned during zens absence the evening before and tried the riskier option of picking the lock of the front door almost the most disturbing thing about the incident was what had not happened nothing had been stolen nothing had been disarranged apart from the envelope the intruder had left no sign whatever of his presence he had come to leave a message and perhaps the most important element of that message was that he had done nothing else as a demonstration of power of arrogant selfconfidence it made zen think of the villa burolo killer i can come and go whenever i wish was the message this time i have chosen simply to deliver an envelope next time who knows determined that there should not be a next time zen had made maria grazia swear by santa rita of cascia whose image she wore as a lucky charm that she would bolt the front door after his departure and not leave the apartment until he returned but what about the shopping she protested ill get something from the tavola calda zen snapped impatiently its not important cowed by her employers unaccustomed brusqueness maria grazia timidly reminded him that she would have to leave by six oclock at the latest in order to deal with her own familys needs ill be back by then he replied just dont leave the apartment unattended not even for a moment under stand keep the door bolted and dont open it except for me as soon as he got to work zen called the vehicle regis tration department and requested details of the red alfa romeo he had seen in the street the night before it was a long shot but there was something about the car that made him suspicious although he wasnt quite clear what it was the information he received was not encouraging the owner of the vehicle turned out to be one rino attilio lusetti with an address in the fashionable parioli area north of the villa borghese a phone call to the questura elicited the information that lusetti had no criminal record by now zen knew that this was a wildgoose chase but having nothing better to do he looked up lusetti in the telephone directory and rang the number an uneducated female voice informed him that dottor lusetti was at the university after a series of abortive phone calls to various departments of this institution zen eventually discovered that the car which had been parked near his house for the two previous nights was owned by the professor of philology in the faculty of humanities at the university of rome giorgio de angelis wandered into zens cubicle while he was making the last of these calls problems he asked as zen hung up zen shrugged just a private matter someone keeps parking his car in front of my door give his windscreen a good coat of varnish de angelis advised polyurethanes the best weatherproof durable opaque an absolute bastard to get off zen nodded whats this youve been telling romizi about a train that goes round in circles de angelis laughed raucously throwing his head back and showing his teeth then he glanced round the screens to check that the official in question wasnt within earshot that fucking romizi hed believe anything you know he loves anchovy paste but hes a tight bastard so hes always moaning about how much it costs so i said to him listen do you want to know how to make it yourself you get a cat right you feed the cat on anchovies and olive oil nothing else what comes out the other end is anchovy paste he didnt believe you did he i dont know i wouldnt be surprised if he gives it a try i just wish i could be there what id give to see him spreading cat shit on a cracker as de angelis burst out laughing again a movement nearby attracted zens attention he turned to find vin cenzo fabri looking at them through a gap in the screens he was wearing a canary yellow pullover and a pale blue tie with a marooh sports jacket and slacks and chunky handstiched shoes expensive leisurewear was fabris hallmark matching his gestures slow and calm and his deep melodious voice im so relaxed so laid back the look said just a lazy old softy who wants an easy time zen who still wore a suit to work felt by comparison like an oldfashioned ministerial apparatchik a dull dedi cated workaholic the irony was that vincenzo fabri was the most fiercely ambitious person zen had come across in the whole of his career eis conversation was larded with references to country clubs horses tennis sailing and holidays in brazil fabri wanted all that and more he wanted villas and cars and yachts and clothes and women compared to the oscar burolos of the world fabri was a thirdrater of course he wasnt interested in the real thing power influence prestige all he wanted were the trinkets and trappings the toys and the bangles but he wanted them so badly zen who no longer wanted any thing very much except tania biacis didnt know whether to envy or despise fabri for the childlike voracity of his desires giorgio fabri called softly beckoring to de angelis his expression was one of amused complicity as though he wanted to share a secret with the only man in the world who could really appreciate it at the same moment the phone on zens desk began to warble yes is this ah thats to say am i speaking to ah dottor aurelio zen fabri who had ignored zens presence until now was staring at him insistently whilst he murmured something in de angeliss ear speaking ah this is ah thats to say im calling from ah palazzo sisti the voice paused significantly zen grunted neutrally he knew that he had heard of palazzo sisti but he had no idea in what context theres been some ah interest in the possibility of seeing whether it might be feasible to arrange the rest of the sentence was lost on zen as tania biacis suddenly appeared beside him saying something which was garbled by the obscure formulations of his caller zen covered the mouthpiece of the phone with one hand sorry immediately tania said emphatically as though she had already said it once too often she looked tired and drawn and there were dark rings under her eyes are you all right zen asked her me what have i got to do with it the phrase was delivered like a slap in the face from the uncovered earpiece of the phone the callers voice squawked on like a radio programme no one is listening to so youll see to that will you tania insisted see to what the video tape they were extremely unpleasant about it i said youd call them back within the hour i dont see why i should have to deal with it its got nothing what ever to do with me she turned angrily away pushing past de angelis who was on his way back to his desk he looked gjum and preoccupied his former high spirits quite doused fabri had disappeared again zen uncovered the phone im sory i was inter rupted so thats agreed is it the voice said it was a question in form only well ill expect you in about twenty minutes the line went dead zen thought briefly about calling archives but what was the point it was obvious what had happened fabri had told them that the tape of the burolo killings was blank and they were urgently trying to contact zen to find out what had happened to the original this was no doubt the news that he had been gleefully passing on to de angelis but how had fabri found out so quickly that zen had been the previous borrower presumably archives must have told him unless of course unless it had been the video tape and not a wallet or pocketbook that had been the thiefs target all along it would have been a simple matter for fabri to find some pickpocket who would have been only too glad to do a favour for such an influential man once the tape was in his hands fabri had put in an urgent request for the tape at archives ensuring that zen was officially com promised now he would no doubt sell the original to the highest bidder thus making himself a small fortune and at the same time creating a scandal which might well lead to criminal charges being brought against his enemy it was a masterpiece of unscrupulousness against which zen was absolutely defenceless as he emerged from the portals of the ministry and made his way down the steps and through the steel barrier under the eye of the armed sentries zen wondered if he was letting his imagination run away with him in the warm hazy sunlight the whole thing suddenly seemed a bit farfetched he lit a cigarette as he waited for the taxi he had ordered he had decided against using an official car since the caller had left him in some doubt as to whether or not this was an official visit in fact he had left him in doubt about almost everything including his name the only thing zen knew for certain was that the call had come from palazzo sisti the significance of this was still obscure to zen but the name was evidently familiar enough to the taxi driver who switched on his meter without requesting further directions they drove down the shallow valley between the vimi nale and quirinale hills leaving behind the broad utilitarian boulevards of the nineteenthcentury suburbs across piazza venezia and into the cramped crooked intestines of the ancient centre zen stared blankly out of the window lost in troubled thoughts whatever the truth about the video tape there was still the other threat hanging over him the form of the message he had received the night before had been disturbing enough but its content was even more so according to signora berto lini her husband had received threats before his death there were tokens signs she h d said for example an envelope pushed through our letterbox with nothing inside but a lot of tiny little metal balls like caviare only hard it was no doubt symptomatic of their respective lifestyles that the contents of the envelope had made zen think of cake decorations and signora bertolini of caviare but there was little doubt that they had been the same and a few days after receiving his message judge giulio bertolini had been killed by just such little metal balls fired at high velocity from a shotgun zen had no intention of letting his imagination run away with him to the extent of supposing that there was any direct connection between the two events what he did suspect was that someone probably vincenzo fabri was trying to put the wind up him to knock him off balance so that he would be too agitated to think clearly and perceive the real nature of the threat to him no doubt fabris thief had first attempted to enter zens flat to steal the video and having been foiled by the blocked emergency exit had picked zens pocket in the bus queue the following morning then fabri had seen the newscast in which the judges widow spoke about the envelope and with typical opportunism had seen a way to further ensure the success of his scheme by keeping zen preoccupied with false alarms on another front the taxi wound slowly through the back streets just north of the tiber finally drawing up in a small piazza by the standards of its period palazzo sisti was modest in scale but it made up for this by a wealth of architectural detail the sisti clan had clearly known their place in the complex hierarchy of sixteenthcentury roman society but had wished to demonstrate that despite this their taste and distinction was no whit inferior to that of the farnese or barberini families but neither their taste nor their mod esty had availed them anything in the long run and today their creation could well have been just another white elephant that had been divided up into flats and offices if it had not been for the two armed carabinieri sitting in their jeep on the other side of the piazza and the large white banner stretched across the faqade of the building bearing the slogan a fairer alternative and the initials of one of the smaller political parties which made up the governments majority in parliament zen nodded slowly of course that was where he had heard the name before palazzo sisti was used by news casters to refer to the party leadership just as piazza del gesu indicated the christian democrats this particular party had been much in the news recently the reason being that prominent among its leaders was a certain ex minister of public works who was rumoured to have enjoyed a close and mutually profitable relationship with oscar burolo prior to the latters untimely demise the entrance was as dark as a tunnel wide and high enough to accommodate a carriage and team lit only by a single dim lantern suspended from the curved ceiling at the other end it opened into a small courtyard tightly packed with limousines whose drivers dressed in neat cheap suits like funeral attendants were standing around swapping gossip and polishing the chrome a glass door to the left suddenly opened and an elderly man no bigger than a large dwarf scuttled out yes he called brusquely to zen a young woman carrying a large pile of files followed him out of the lodge well she demanded i dont know the porter cried exasperatedly under stand i dont know its your job to know dont tell me what my job is very well you tell me zen walked over to them excuse me they both turned to glare at him aurelio zen from the ministry of the interior the porter shrugged what about it im expected who by if i knew that i wouldnt need to waste my time talking to a prick like you would i the woman burst into hoots of laughter a phone started to ring shrilly in the lodge throwing them both a look of deep disgust the porter went to answer it yes yes dottore yes dottore no he just got here very good dottore right away emerging from his lodge the porter jerked his thumb at a flight of stairs opposite first floor theyre expecting you and the youth section the young woman asked how many times do i have to tell you i dont know the staircase was a genteel cascade of indolently curving marble which made the one at the ministry look vulgar and cheap as zen reached the firstfloor landing a figure he had taken to be a statue detached itself from the niche where it had been standing and walked towards him the man had an air of having been assembled like franken steins monster from a set of parts each of which might have looked quite all right in another context but didnt get along at all weli together he stopped some distance away his gaze running over zens clothing im not carrying one zen told him never do in fact the man looked at him as though he had spoken in a foreign language you see its no use carrying a gun unless youre pre pared to use it zen went on discursively if youre not it just makes matters worse it gives you a false sense of security and makes everyone else nervous so youre better off without it really the man stared at zen expressionlessly for a moment then turned his back this way he led zen along a corridor which at first sight appeared to extend further than the length of the building this illusion was explained when it became clear that the two men walking towards them were in fact their own reflec tions in the huge mirror that covered the end wall the corridor was lit at intervals by tall windows giving on to the courtyard opposite each window a double door of polished walnut gleamed sweetly in the mellow light zens escort knocked at one of the doors and stood listening intently holding the wrought silver handle come a distant voice instructed the room was long and relatively narrow one wall was covered by an enormous tapestry so faded that it was impossible to make out anything except the general impression of a hunting scene facing this stood a glass fronted bookcase where an array of more or less massive tomes lay slumbering in a manner that suggested they had not been disturbed for a considerable time at the far end of the room a young man was sitting at an antique desk in front of a window that reached all the way up to the distant ceiling as zen came in he put down the sheaf of typed pages he had been perusing and walked round the desk his hand held out in greeting good morning dottore so glad that you felt able to see your way clear to ah he was in his early thirties slim and refined with thin straight lips delicate features and eyes that goggled slightly as though they were perpetually astonished by what they saw his fastidious gestures and diffident man ner gave him the air of a fin de siecle aesthete rather than a political animal he waved zen towards a chair made of thin struts of some precious wood with a woven cane seat it looked extremely valuable and horribly fragile zen lowered him self on to it apprehensively the young man returned to the other side of the desk where he remained standing for a moment with hands outspread like a priest at the altar first of all dottore let me express on behalf of the interest and ah thats to say the really quite extra ordinary excitement aroused by your ah he picked up the pages he had been reading and let them fall back to the desk again as a knock resounded in the cavernous space behind come the young man enunciated a waiter appeared carrying a tray with two coffee cups ah yes i took the liberty of ah he waggled his forefinger at the two cups and which one is with the red rim the waiter told him the young man sighed expressively as the door closed again unfortunately caffeine for certain people zen took his cup of undecaffeinated espresso and unwrapped the two lumps of sugar supplied by the bar studying the interesting facts about the world of nature printed on the wrapper while he waited for his host to proceed as you are no doubt aware dottore this has been a sad and difficult time for us naturally we already knew what your report makes abundantly clear namely that the evi dence against renato favelloni is both flimsy and entirely circumstantial there is not the slightest question that his innocence would eventually be established by due process of law zen noted the conditional as the coffee seared its way down his throat but by then alas the damage will have been done the young man continued his seemingly compulsive hesi tations and rephrasings had now been set aside like a disguise that has served its purpose if mud is thrown as viciously as it has been and will be some of it is bound to stick not just to favelloni himself but to all those who were in any way associated with him or who had occasion to ah call on his services at some time this is the prob lem we face dottore i trust you will not judge me indis creet if i add that it is one we were beginning to despair of solving imagine then the emotions elicited by your report so much hope so many interesting new perspec tives light at the end of the tunnel as onorevole saw fit to put it zen set his empty cup back in its saucer on the leather surface of the desk my report was merely a resume of the investigations carried out by others exactly that was precisely its strength if you had been one of our ah contacts at the ministry your findings would have excited considerably less interest to be per fectly frank we have been let down before by people who promised us this that and the other and then couldnt deliver why only a few days ago we asked our man there to obtain a copy of the video tape showing the tragic events at the villa burolo a simple enough request you would think but even that proved beyond the powers of the individual in question nor was this the first time that he had disappointed us so we felt it was time to bring in someone fresh with the proper qualifications someone with a track record in this sort of work and i must say that so far we have had no reason to regret our decision of course the real test is still to come but already we have been very favourably impressed by the way in which your report both exposed the inherent weaknesses of the case against favelloni and revealed the existence of various equally possible scenarios which for purely political reasons have never been properly investigated the young man stood quite still for a moment his slen der fingers steepled as though in prayer the task we now face is to ensure that we do not suffer as much damage from this innocent man being brought to trial and acquitted as we would do if he were really guilty in a word this show trial of renato favelloni and by implication of lonorevole himself engineered by our enemies must be blocked before it starts your report makes it perfectly clear that the evidence against favelloni has been cobbled together from a mass of disjointed and unrelated fragments those same fragments with a little initiative and enterprise could be used to make an even more convincing case against one of the other suspects you mention perched precariously on the low fragile chair zen felt like a spectator in the front row of the stalls trying to make out what was happening on stage the young mans expression seemed to suggest that the next move was up to zen but he was unwilling to make it until he had a clearer idea of what was involved do you mind if i smoke he asked finally the young man impatiently waved assent which of the other suspects did you have in mind zen murmured casually as he lit up well it seems to us that there are a number of avenues which might be explored with profit for example well burolos son for example but he was in boston at the time he could have hired someone he wouldnt have known how anyway sons dont go around putting out contracts on their fathers because they want them to study law instead of music the young man acknowledged the point with a pro longed blink i agree that such a hypothesis would have needed a good deal of work before it became credible but the possi bility remains open in fact however enzo burolo has close links with one of our allies in the government so it would in any case have been inopportune to pursue the matter i cited it merely as one example among many another which appears to us considerably more fruitful is the fellow burolo employed to look after those absurd lions he bought zen breathed out a cloud of smoke pizzoni he had an alibi too yes he had an alibi and what does that mean that halfadozen of the local peasantry have been bribed or bullied to lie about seeing him in the bar that evening why should anyone want to protect pizzoni he was a nobody an outsider the young man leaned forward across the desk supposing that wasnt the case supposing i were to tell you that the mans real name was not pizzoni but padedda and that he was not from the abruzzi as his papers claim but from sardinia from a village in the gennargentu mountains not far from nuoro what would you say to that zen flicked ash into a pewter bowl that might or might not have been intended for this purpose well in the first instance id want to know why you havent informed the authorities investigating the case the young man turned away to face the window the tall panes of glass were covered with a thick patina cf grime which reflected his features clearly zen saw him smile as though at the fatuity of this comment when ones opponent is cheating only a fool continues to play by the rules he recited quietly as though quoting this piece of information came to light as a result of research carried out privately on our behalf we know only too well what would happen if we communicated it to the judiciary the magistrates have decided to charge favel loni for reasons which had nothing to do with the facts of the case they arent going to review that decision unless some dramatic new development forces them to do so isolated inconvenient facts which do not directly bear on the case they are preparipg would simply be swept under the carpet he swung round to confront zen rather than squander our advantage in this way we propose to launch our own initiative reopening the investigation that was so hastily slammed shut for ill judged political reasons and who better to conduct this operation than the man whose incisive and comprehen sive review of the case has given us all fresh hope zen crushed out his cigarette carelessly burning his fingertip on the hot ash in my official capacity absolutely dottore thats the whole point every thing must be open and above board in that case i would need a directive from my department youll get one dont worry about that your orders will be communicated to you in the usual way through the usual channels the purpose of this briefing is simply and purely to ensure that you understand the situation from the moment you leave here today you will have no further contact with us youll be posted to sardinia as a matter of absolute routine you will visit the scene of the crime interview witnesses interrogate suspects as always you will naturally have at your dis posal the full facilities of the local force in the course of your investigations you will discover concrete evidence demolishing pizzonis alibi and linking him to the mur der of oscar burolo all this will take no more than a few days at the most you will then submit your find ings to the judiciary in the normal way while we for our part ensure that their implications are not lost on anyone concerned zen stared across the room at a detail in the corner of the tapestry showing a nymph taking refuge from the hunters in a grotto why me the young mans finely manicured hands spread open in a gesture of benediction as i said dottore you have a good track record once your accomplishments in the miletti case had been brought to our attention well quite frankly the facts spoke for themselves zen gaped at him the miletti case im sure you will recall that your methods attracted ah a certain amount of criticism at the time the young man remarked with a touch of indulgent jocularity i believe that in certain quarters they were even condemned as irregular and improper what no one could deny was that you got results the conspiracy against the miletti family was smashed at a single stroke by your arrest of that foreign woman their enemies were completely discon certed and by the time they reformed to cope with this unexpected development the critical moment had passed and it was too late he came round the desk towering above zen the parallel with the present case is obvious here too timing is of the essence as i say the truth would in any case emerge in due course but not before lonorevoles reputation had been foully smeared we have no intention of allowing that to happen which is why we are entrus ting you with this delicate and critical mission in short were counting on you to apply in sardinia the same methods which proved so effective in perugia zen said nothing after a few moments a slight crease appeared on the young mans brow i need hardly add that a successful outcome to this affair is also in your own best interests im sure youre only too well aware of how swiftly ones position in a organization such as the ministry can change often with out one even being aware of it your triumph in the miletti case might easily be undermined by those who take ah a narrowminded view of things the size of the criminalpol squad is constantly under review and given the attrition rate amongst senior police officials in places such as palermo the possibility of transfers cannot be ruled out on the other hand success in the burolo case would consolidate your position beyond question he reached behind him and depressed a lever on the intercom lino dottor zen is just leaving once again zen felt the pale cool touch of the young mans hand it really was most good of you to come dottore i trust that your work has not been thats to say that no serious disruption will make itself felt in the appearance of the stocky lino rescued them both from these incoherent politenesses like a man in a dream zen walked back through the dim vastness of the room to the walnut door which lino closed behind them as softly as the lid of an expensive coffin this way thats very good zen remarked as they set off along the corridor have they trained you to say anything else lino turned round looking tough you want your teeth kicked in that depends on whether you want to be turned into lowgrade dog food because thats whats liable to happen to anyone round here who fails to treat me with the proper respect bullshit on the contrary chum all i have to do is mention that i dont like your face and by tomorrow you wont have a face lino sneered youre crazy he said without total conviction thats not what ionorevole thinks now beat it ill find my own way out for a moment lino tried bravely to stare zen out but doubt had leaked into his eyes and he had to give up the attempt crazy he repeated turning away with a contemptuous sniff zen left the portal of palazzo sisti with a confident unfaltering stride a man with places to go to and people to see the moment he was out of sight around the nearest corner his manner changed beyond all recognition he might now have been taken for a member of one of the geriatric tourist groups that descend on rome once the high season is over far from having an urgent goal in mind he turned right and left at random obeying im pulses of which he wasnt even aware and which in any case were of no importance all that mattered was to let the tension seep slowly out of his body draining out through the soles of his feet as they traversed the grimy undulating cobbles scattering pigeons and sending the feral cats scuttling for cover under parked cars in due course he emerged into an open space which he recognized with pleasure as the piazza campo dei fiori almost venetian in its intimacy and hence one of zens favourite spots in rome the morning vegetable market created a gentle bustle of activity that was supremely restful he made his way across the cobbles strewn with discarded leaves and stalks past zinc bathtubs and buckets full of ashes from the wooden boxes burned earlier against the morning chill now the sun was high enough to flood most of the piazza with its light the stallholders were still hard at work washing and trimming salad greens under the communal tap elderly women in heavy dark overcoats with fur collars walked from stall to stall looking doubtfully at the produce zen walked over to a wine shop he knew where he ordered a glass of vino novello he leaned against the door post smoking a cigarette and sipping the frothy young wine which had still been in the grapes when oscar burolo and his guests were murdered a gang of labourers working on a house nearby were shouting from one level of scaffolding to another in a dialect so dense that zen could understand nothing except that god and the virgin mary were coming in for the usual steady stream of abuse a neat compact group of japanese tourists passed by accompanied by two burly italian bodyguards the female guide clutching a furled pink umbrella was giving a run ning commentary in which zen was surprised to make out the name giordano bruno like a fish sighted under water she pointed with her umbrella to the centre of the square where the statue of the philosopher stood on a plinth its base covered with the usual incomprehensible graffiti nearby an old woman bent double like a wooden doll hinged at the hips was feeding last nights spaghetti to a gang of mangy cats zen thought nostalgically of the cats of his native city carved or living monumental or obscure the countless avatars of the lion of the republic itself in venice cats were the familiars of the city as much a part of it as the stones and the water but the cats of rome were just vermin to be periodically exterminated it somehow seemed typical of the gulf which separated the two cities for while zen liked campo dei fiori he could never forget that the statue at its centre commemorated a philosopher who was burnt alive on that spot at about the same time that the gracious and exquisite palazzo sisti was taking shape a few hundred metres away as he took his empty glass back inside zen found himself drawn to the scene at the bar one of the labourers wearing dusty blue overalls and a hat made from newspaper like an inverted toy boat was knocking back a glass of the local white wine further along two businessmen stood talking in low voices on the bar before them were their empty glasses a saucer filled with nuts and cocktail biscuits two folded newspapers and a removable incar cassette player zen turned away that was what had attracted his atten tion but why nothing was more normal no one left a cassette deck in their car any more unless they wanted to have the windows smashed in and the unit stolen it wasnt until zen stepped into the band of shadow cast by the houses on the other side of the piazza that the point of the incident suddenly became clear to him he had seen a cassette player in a parked car recently in a brandnew luxury car parked in a secluded street late at night such negligence coupled with the scratches and dents in the bodywork and the use of the floor as an ashtray suggested a possibility that really should have occurred to him long before still better late than never he thought orwere there cases where that reassuring formula didnt hold where late was just too late and there were no second chances back at the ministry zen phoned the questura and asked whether professor lusettis red alfa romeo appeared on their list of stolen vehicles thanks to the recent computerization of this department he had his answer within seconds the car in question had been reported stolen ten days earlier he put the receiver down then lifted it again and dialled another number after some time the ringing tone was replaced by a robotic voice thank you for calling paragon security consultants the office is closed for lunch until three oclock if you wish to leave a message please speak now its aurelio gilberto i was hoping to aurelio how are things zen stared at the receiver as thought it had stung him but i thought that was a recorded message thats what i wanted you to think at least not you but any of the five thousand people i dont want to speak to at this moment why dont you get a real answering machine i have but i cant use it just at the moment one of my competitors has found a way to fake the electronic tone i can send down the line to have it play back the recorded messages to a distant phone the result is that he downloaded a hundred million lires worth of business as well as making me look an idiot anyway what can i do for you well i was hoping we could have a talk i dont sup pose youre free for lunch today actually thats a bit well i dont know come to think of it that might work quite well yes listen ill see you at licios do you know where it is ill find it zen pressed the rest down to get a dialling tone then rang his home and asked maria grazia if everything was all right everythings fine now she assured him but this morning madonra i was terrified zen tightened his grip on the receiver what happened it was frightful awful the signora didnt notice any thing thanks be to god but i was looking straight at the window when it happened when what happened why this man suddenly appeared where at the window zen took a deep breath all right now listen i want you to describe him to me as carefully as you can all rightwhat did he look like maria grazia made a reflective noise well lets see he was young dark quite tall handsome twenty years ago maybe id have what did he do do nothing he just disappeared i went over and had a look sure enough there he was in one of those cages he was trying to mend it but he couldnt in the end they had to take it off the wall and put up a new one a new what for the love of christ stunned by this blasphemy the housekeeper mur mured why the streetlamp the one that was forever turning itself on and off but when i saw him floating there in midair i got such a shock i didnt know what to think it looked like an apparition only i dont know if you can have apparitions of men it always seems to be women doesnt it one of my cousins claimed she saw santa rita once but it turned out she made it all up shed got the idea from an article in gente about these little girls who zen repeated his earlier instructions about keeping the front door bolted and not leaving his mother alone and hung up on his way downstairs he met giorgio de angelis coming up the calabrian looked morose anything the matter zen asked him de angelis glanced quickly up and down the stairs then gripped zens arm impulsively if youre into anything you shouldnt be get out fast he let go of zens arm and continued on his way what do you mean zen called after him de angelis just kept on walking zen hurried up the steps after him why did you say that he demanded breathlessly the calabrian paused allowing him to catch him up whats going on zen demanded de angelis shook his head slowly i dont know aurelio i dont want to know but whatever it is stop doing it or dont start what are you talking about de angelis looked again up and down the stairs fabri came to see me this morning he advised me to keep away from you when i asked why he said that you were being measured for the drop the two men looked at one another in silence thank you zen murmured almost inaudibly de angelis nodded fractionally then he continued up the steps while zen turned to begin the long walk down i never used to dream like saying i never used to go mad the others do it every night jerking and tossing sweating like pigs groaning and crying out i had a terible dream last night i dreamt id killed someone and they were coming to arrest me theyd guessed where i was hiding it was horrible so real youd think that might teach them something about this world of theirs that also seems so real then one night it happened to me in the dream i was like the others living in the light fearing the dark i had done something wrong i never knew whaf killed someone perhaps as a punish ment they locked me up in the darkness not my darkness gentle and consoling but a cold dank airless pit a narrow tube of stone like a dry well the executioner was my father he rammed me down arms bound to rny sides and capped the tomb with huge blocks of masonry i lay tightly wedged the stones pressing in on me from every side in front of my eyes was a chink through which i could just see the outside world where people passed by about their business unaware of my terrible plight air seeped in through the hole but not enough not enough air i was slowly suffocating smothered beneath that intolerable dead weight of rock i screamed and screamed but no sound penetrated to the people outside they passed by smiling and nodding and hat ting to each other just as though nothing was happening it was only a dream of course
