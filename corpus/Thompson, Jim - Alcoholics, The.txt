the alcoholics by jim thompson copyright his real name was pasteur semelweiss murphy so naturally he called himself dr peter s murphy rather his patients and colleagues knew him by that name in his own mind he called himself names as hideous and hopeless as the agony of which they were born you he would snarl savagely you goofylooking bean pole you lanky longdrawn sonofabitch you scrawny redhaired imbecile doctor murphy had always spoken to doctor murphy with disparagement and invective but never with such frequence and intensity as since he had become the proprietor of el healtho modern treatment for alcoholics not until then had he called himself dishonest never before in the endless annals of murphy vs murphy had the defendant been charged with gross incompetence and yet and this was odd the knowledge that he was about to be divorced from el healtho no later barring miracles than the close of business today did nothfiig to modify or mollify the prosecution on the contrary tonight he would shut down the sanitarium and along with everything else he would stand accused of failure of bollixing a job of screwing up the works by god out good el healtho perches on a cliff overlooking the pacific in the southerly limits of the city of los angeles it is a rambling stucco and tile structure styled in that school of architecture known as spanish mediterranean to its adherents and california gothic to its detractors originally the home of a silent motionpictuie actor whose taste whatever else may be said about it proved considerably better than his voice as a matter of fact it was not particularly unpleasing to the eye unless that eye were doctor murphys his long scrawny shanks clad in a pair of fadedred swim trunks the good doctor squatted on the beach and stared blindly at the pacific april sunlight in his eyes arctic ice in his heart he had been swimming for three hours when a great breaker had caught him up in its arms and hurled him rolling and spinning and halfdrowned onto the sand it had cast him up and out and it should have by god he was enough even to make the ocean puke simultaneously burying him beneath a hundredodd pounds of slithery seaweed lying there breathless in the dank tentacled mess he had remembered those searing lines from from wells yes the outline of history to this stage has civilization progressed from the slime of the tidal beaches and there had been a masochistic satisfaction in remembering in associating the words with his own sorry state a hundred million years of life and in what had it resulted well it was obvious wasnt it a pile of crap a willless thing floating on the tide lacking the elementary grace to sink out of sight doctor murphy had entered the ocean with the intention of drowning himself he felt that it would be a good idea a cleancut scientific approach to an otherwise insoluble problem and a secret voice had advised him that here was triumph not surrender not exit but ingress he was not sure of the soundness of his hunch nor the veracity of the voice perhaps it would not have been a good idea perhaps his voyage would have terminated in the phosphorescent muck of the ocean bottom but well that was the point you see the fact that he wasnt sure how in hell could a man know whether his ideas were good if he never tried them out and if a man wasnt willing to act on his ideas if he didnt have the guts to act on em why in the hell did he have to keep having em just once he spoke to the pacific his blue eyes frosty if i could just once for once in my goddam life life had teased and taunted doctor murphy severely it had constantly confronted him with problems then presented him with solutions a single solution to each which he was incapable of using it had begun this evil teasing years before long before he became dr peter s murphy and was merely a frecklefaced brat ol doc murphys kid pasty even then life was giving him problems and answers thatstheonlyway answers leaving the rest of the world undisturbed was a dog beaten to death life brought the matter immediately to doc murphys kid advising him exactly what should be done if anything was to be done at all the other townsfolk were undisturbed the incident was regrettable sad but best forgotten they were allowed to forget it but not pasty murphy he had to do something and the one adequate thing the only thing he could not do he could procure the horsewhip yes he could find exactly the right place to lie in wait and he could stand up silently in the darkness bringing the whip back over his shoulder but that was all he could do that was as far as he could go he could not knock the dogbeater senseless then beat the dogbeaters rotten ass to the color of eggplant once while he was interning at bellevue dr pasteur sem that is dr peter s murphy had lined up the most delectable piece in all manhattan she was a nurse and she wasnt selling the stuff you understand but she required a great deal of working on well young doc murphy had worked on that babe for months and finally his victory seemed as imminent as it was inevitable one firm and final move and the jackpot would be his so with twenty dollars saved and another twenty borrowed he took her to a nightclub and their waiter oh damn his whitetied soul had shamed and snubbed them unmercifully he had made doc look like a cheapskate a boob a shrimp a guy contemptible and unworthy of the prize he sought doc had laid his steak knife on the table with the tip pointing outward casually he had placed his elbow against the handle then he waited firmly intending to deprive that waiter permanently of what he himself had but couldnt use his opportunity came and went in the end he and the girl slunk out of the nightclub leaving the waiter triumphant and unharmed a couple of hundred yards away now around a curve in the beach a neat blue trailer was parked doc turned and looked at it just as a man leaned out the door and waved to him beckoned to him doc groaned and cursed he did not want to talk to judson exnavy corpsman now the night attendant night nurse night everything at el healtho he didnt want any lectures from judson no matter how politely and subtly those lectures were delivered he considered thumbing his nose at the night man why not who was the doctor in this place he or judson then he stood up and shambled toward the trailer though his night shift was over and he would necessarily be going to bed in a few minutes judson had replaced his white uniform with spotless tan slacks and a shortsleeved sport shirt looking at him in his neatness his cleanliness looking at the mans chiseled black face with its serene intelligent eyes doc felt awkward and dirty and shabby and somehow shamed judson was a negro he deserved better than his job judson served coffee on a small table set up on the sand he offered cigarettes made polite comment on the pleasantness of the morning doc waited warily i dont like to mention it doctor but the hell you dont snarled doctor murphy well go on get it off your chest judson looked at him gravely silently the doctor grunted a word of apology i know i talked pretty rough to rufus and it was the wrong thing to do but dammit jud look at the stunts he pulls if i take my eyes off of him for a minute hes well you know how he is i know nodded judson but its only because he wants to better himself hes ambitious so hes ambitious snapped doc he wants to learn fine why cant he go about it the right way why cant he be uh well more like you probably because he isnt me judson suggested pleasantly or are you of the opinion all negroes are born with equal abilities and receive equal opportunities oh go to hell said doc wearily as a matter of fact said judson i hadnt intended to say anything about rufus i didnt see any need to i knew you were at least as much disturbed by what you said to him as he was the hell i was lied doc i told him exactly what i should have what i really wanted to talk about was mr van twyne do you think he should be here doctor a prefrontal lobotomy case this is an alcoholic sanitarium said doctor murphy hes an alcoholic i see well he is hes worse than an alcoholic hes a psychopathic drunk any other guy a guy without dough would be in the bughouse or alcatraz for the stunts hes pulled hes damned lucky that the courts gave him this chance let him have the prefrontal instead of the operation was performed in new york doctor thats bad where the hell would you go for a prefrontal to new york said judson and i would remain there afterwards under the care of the surgeons who performed it certainly i would not allow myself to be transported across the country a few days later to an obscure er docs pale nevertanning face had reddened im a horsedoctor he demanded im a diplomamill quack why dammit if id wanted to turn this place into a curejoint if id been willing to sell silver salts and nux vomica at fifty dollars a shot id be rolling in dough instead of of no one judson was saying has more appreciation for your integrity and what youve tried to do here than i doctor thats why i couldnt undertand will he be with us long i dont know doctor murphy said curtly what kind of night did he have very bad up until around midnight restive completely unresponsive to sedation it was actually painful to watch him he tried to talk to me but having had none of the retraining he should have had save it why didnt you call me i was on the point of doing so when i discovered the trouble i took off his sheets and judson explained angry fires danced in the doctors eyes that clumsy bitch he swore yes said judson its hard to understand how a registered nurse could be so clumsy how anyone whos had the slightest patient training could be well the doctor studied him frowning youre all wet if you think shes a fake i checked her references myself i dont doubt that shes rn doctor i might say however that good references are rather easily come by but i dont are you trying to tell me that only one thing people work in places like these for only two reasons out of altruism because like you they are genuinely interested in helping the alcoholic me now get this said doctor murphy if every goddam alcoholic in the world dropped dead tomorrow it would tickle me pink i mean it by god i hate every damned one of em judson laughed softly doctor murphy glowered at him thats one reason the negro continued and not im afraid a very common one the other well that might be broken down into two reasons because they cannot hold jobs elsewhere or because the alcoholic sanitarium with a clientele which shuns publicity gives them a better than even chance to satisfy abnormal appetites but you surely dont think only this doctor mainly this that the world being as it is it is a rather terrible thing to condemn a man like van twyne to live in it a helpless idiot whos condemning him how do you know he wouldnt be an idiot anyway the prefrontal is a hell of a long way from being perfected its a lastditch operation something you have when theres nothing left to lose where do you get that stuff im condemning him judson shrugged he picked up the doctors cup with a polite may i doc swung his hand palm open slapping the cup far out into the water how about it he raged kicking back his campstool do you think i like this any damned stinking part of it havent i sunk a fortune in this place without having a dime left to show for it havent i worked my ass off with nothing but a highpaid bunch of whiners and incompetents to help me judson shook his head sympathetically he was very fond of doctor murphy now get this said the doctor his voice hoarse i didnt have humphrey van twyne iii flown across country his family did i didnt solicit him as a patient his family had him brought here i didnt want to treat him here they their own family doctor insisted on it what the hell who am i to tell them what to do what if i did tell them theyd just dump him in another place i dont think so said judson i dont think they could you dont think period said doctor murphy you dont know what im up against if i dont get he broke off the sentence abruptly something would turn up something had to turn up he couldnt admit to the cold facts that he would have to raise fifteen thousand dollars today or go out of business and that the van twynes were the only possible means of raising it im the guy who has to do the thinking he continued i have to do the doing suppose im wrong suppose i weigh all the factors in the case and make my decision and it turns out to be wrong so what im not infallible im a doctor not god goddammit im not god judson turned his head and looked up the cliff he looked back at the doctor and nodded gravely you are he said so far as hes concerned while judson and the doctor debated the one calm and implacable the other stubborn and angry still another person wrestled with the problem represented by humphrey van twyne iii this was rufus rufus also negro the day attendant at el healtho rufus was considerably afraid of humphrey van twyne iii the man with no brains as he thought of him being an occupant of room four the politely anonymous term for the sanitariums padded cell the man required a great deal of waiting on and much of that waitingon was required of rufus and while the man appeared docile enough rufus was quite sure that he wasnt he knew something of the mans history even without brains a person who pursued such whims as biting folks noses off was in rufus opinion a decided menace he did not show this fear of course at least he hoped he didnt for a medical man to show fear of a patient would be unseemly and rufus definitely was in his own mind a fully qualified practitioner he held doctors degrees from the west coast college of astrocosmicology and the arkansas institute of metaphysical science he had also done postgraduate work in swedish massage in view of these honors and the fact that he did practice medicine at every opportunity and despite the most dogged and profane protests his lack of medical education seemed of no moment whatsoever seated in the kitchen of el healtho with two plates of ham and eggs in him and his fourth cup of breakfast coffee before him rufus thought about the man in room four unconsciously flexing the muscles in his large chocolatecolored hands he could he decided take care of the man if he had to but he sure hoped he wouldnt have to physical contests with the patients were frowned upon and rufus a devotee of the sciences opposed them on principle it was just plumb too bad he thought ruefully that doctor murphy would not let him treat the case he had almost got to the day before all his equipment had been readied and he had had the mans winding sheets unwrapped to the waist and then doctor murphy had stalked in and asked what in the hell he had thought he was doing rufus had explained given his diagnosis he was convinced he said that segments of the mans perverted brain remained in his system and were making him restless obviously a series of colonic irrigations was indicated doctor murphy had kicked over the pan of warm soapy water he had told rufus to stick his goddam shitgun up his own butt and he had declared that if rufus didnt stop his silly goddam horsing around he personally would kick his rufus goddam ass all the way into beverly hills pretty thought rufus gloomily savoring his coffee a pretty way for one professional man to address another oh very pretty then he became aware that josephine the cook was watching him and he exchanged his downcast manner for one of frowning studiousness he appealed to josephines evernear hysteria drawing a toy stethoscope from the pocket of his white jacket he blew through first one end then the other then draped them around his neck propping his chin up with one hand he slid the other inside his jacket thus assuming a pose at once napoleonic and convenient for scratching josephine started to giggle back in the era surrounding world war i the general had been prominently mentioned as a vicepresidential candidate back in the days of the roaring twenties he had served as chairman of the board of a hundredmillion dollar corporation back in the early thirties three press services and a nationwide chain of newspapers had quoted his opinion yes and his firm belief that we have but to tighten our belts my fellow citizens and place our trust in almighty god and we shall emerge from this crisis more strong and triumphant than ever back in the early forties the early days of world war ii he had as a matter of fact he had done nothing nothing wrong nothing that might not have been excused even rewarded at a different time it was not so much what he had done but when he had done it the artist time had painted him into a picture of chaos distorting the nominally normal concealing virtue and exaggerating defect he had been in the public eye for years he remained in it now the one figure in the picture that everyone recognized through the refracted light of familiarity he became a symbol for pearl harbor for bataan for the philippines for the accidental shootingdown of friendly planes perhaps the general had extended his lines too far perhaps his losses had been too high for the results achieved perhaps and perhaps not it did not matter time spun the wheel and the arrow stopped at the general he was not merely culpable of one doubtful action or several but for the whole terrifying tragedy of war just as he had done nothing nothing wrong so nothing nothing really wrong had been done to him he was not under arrest on the flight back to washington he was not courtmartialed there was no official demand for his resignation true there were official news releases to the effect that a detailed study of his conduct was being made and that proper action would be taken at the proper time the stories flowed into the newspapers for months never actually accusatory only reciting the statistics of lives lost of men killed and wounded and captured and stating that the generals responsibility was under study the tides of the war changed and the flow of stories to the newspapers ceased but the generals case remained under study and he remained under suspension drawing no pay he asked for a trial he demanded one that put him back in the newspapers for a day in boldface frontpage boxes ironic in tone in editorialpage cartoons a bespurred and drooling idiot shaking a bloody fist beneath the nose of john q public but he did not get a trial nothing as has been noted was ever done to the general the war ended the powers that were turned fretful annoyed eyes on the generals case restore him to rank give him a clean bill of health impossible the public would never accept it the general himself had become impossible a common drunk my dear fellow actually and did you see the article he wrote for that shoddy magazine pure viciousness couldnt have got any real money from that outfit somewhere somehow in his almost fifty years of military service a small error had been made in the generals papers it was so small and so obviously an error a matter of a t struck over a p to form the anomalous abbreviation term that it had been dismissed by everyone the general included but now when something had to be done with him but nothing to him the error provided a way out the error had occurred in the chronicling of his promotion from captain to major thus it affected the higher rank and all other ranks up to his present one a little confusing well it was a rather confused matter briefly however it boiled down to this the term in the papers was by unanimous agreement interpreted to mean temp his rank was temporary in other words all his ranks had been temporary down to the grade of captain being by age subject to retirement he was retired without prejudice and with utter propriety at his last permanent rank upon threequarters of a captains monthly stipend so the case was adjusted honorably and even with kindness for as a person high in authority had pointed out the beggar managed to stay stiff enough as it was with more money he would simply drink himself to death this morning the morning of the day annaled and mayhap analyzed here he sat on the flagstoned patio of the sanitarium his steamer chair drawn up close to the seaside guard rail so that he might better watch docs progress up the cliff from the beach to some the fact that the doctor chose to scramble perilously and laboriously up the rocks instead of ascending the stairs might have seemed idiotic but the general did not so regard it there was very little if anything that doctor murphy could do which in the generals varicosed brokencelled mind would be open to criticism a very fine man the general murmured must remember to to to a very fine man doctor murphy swung over the guard rail rested a moment then moved across the patio mopping his bony face with a thin wiry arm he stooped down in front of the general gently replacing the houseslippers on the chilled bare feet then dragging up a hassock to sit on he grinned shrewdly but respectfully into the old mans face short night eh general what the general blinked uncertainly oh no no i slept very well doctor good said doctor murphy youre convinced then youve decided i was right about that letter well uh the general fumbled in the pocket of his bathrobe i was going to ask i wonder if youd mind doctor murphy extricated the letter from the robe and carefully unfolded it there you are he said right down in black and white we have enjoyed reading your manuscript and thank you for allowing us to consider it isnt that what it says isnt that what it means how in the world can you make anything else out of it uh you think that isnt a mere formality that theyre only being polite ha said doctor murphy not their way eh said the general hopefully pretty curt lot on the whole the doctor nodded vigorously any time those people say they enjoy something they mean it but uh they didnt take it they were unable to they enjoyed it and they appreciated your sending it to em but well you can read it for yourself we are unable to use it at the present time at the present understand let em wait a while general just hang on to the manuscript well perhaps youd better give it a good workingover put in those anecdotes you were telling me then send it to em and see how fast they snap it up by golly the general retrieved the letter and tucked it carefully into his pocket ill do it doctor by george ill his voice faded and the faint glow in his eyes dimmed he would do it but he coughed nervously nodding to the serving table at the side of his chair as you can see doctor i have just had a hearty breakfast scrambled eggs wheat cakes mil confound it sir what are you smirking about sorry general you were saying i was saying doctor murphy that i had just had a hearty breakfast and that i strongly felt the need for a drink by way of anchorage now thats what i like about you general said doc thats the trait i like about all alcoholics the thing that distinguishes them from the common gutterdrunk theyll try to outwit you but theyll almost never lie to you i dont you say you had a hearty breakfast you dont say you ate it you didnt did you general your choice of words wasnt accidental the general smiled reluctantly his eyes straying to the serving table lit up again youre too sharp for me doctor i dont know why i keep trying to deceive you now i dont want to monopolize your time so if youll just instruct rufus to refill my cigar lighter ill what do you intend to do with the fluid what would one do with it the doctor waited now it was lighter fluid he brought his hands down on his thighs with a weary slap and stood up arsenic mixes well with milk too he said and it acts a lot faster howll it be if i send you a shot of that it might said the general be a good idea doc stared down at the bowed head his friendly concern for the old man mingling with his irritating but everabsorbing interest in the problem which the man presented the generals existence was outright defiance of all the known rules of medical science his existence and that of practically every other patron of el healtho everyone knew that when the alcohol in the bloodstream reached a small fraction of one percent the person through whom that bloodstream flowed became a corpse his heart stopped he smothered everyone knew that alcohol rose up the spinal canal to the brain pressing harder and harder against the fragile cells until they exploded and their owner became an imbecile everyone knew these things everyone but the alcoholics of course they did die their brains did become damaged to the point of idiocy but alcohol more often than not was only one factor in those deaths and that damage they were run over while drunk they were beaten and kicked with irreparable damage to the brain in drunken brawls everything happened to them except the one thing which a logical science declared should happen of his own personal knowledge doctor murphy had known but one man who had died of alcoholism one might justifiably feel that violent death overtook the alcoholic before his affliction had the opportunity but how if that were true could such elderly alcoholics as the general be explained the general had drunk a full quart of whiskey in thirty minutes the alcohol in his bloodstream had been sufficient to ignite at the touch of a match yet he did not die and his health for his age was far better than average his brain was wet at least important areas of it were wet to an ordinarily disabling extent yet he was very very far from being an idiot doc wondered and wondered by god why he wondered for as far as he could see el healtho was damned well washed up he might be wrong certainly he intended to take another look at his financial books after breakfast but hell he knew without looking hed been looking for months when he should have been out looking for a practice van twyne would his family now take the next cautious step toward the goal which murphy stood in front of they would they would do it today through the medium of their family physician and if el healtho was washed up if in short he did intend to tell the van twynes and their money to go to hell if that was the case why had he argued so bitterly with judson dammit oh dammit to hell anyway skip it let it ride a while here was the general and the general seemed in favor of a drink of arsenic ill send it right out to you he said but youll have to promise you wont vomit it up excellent murmured the general allowing doc murphy to assist him from the chair oh uh by the way doctor im afraid my account may be slightly in arrears who says so demanded the doctor belligerently you telling me how to run my business and then he jumped so suddenly that the general was almost thrown over backwards for he had heard screams before he had heard screams that were screams but he had never heard anything like this the terrifying cry that could only be coming from room four lucretia baker rn had had a very good nights sleep not in months not in fact since her sudden dismissal from a cerebral palsy case had she slept so well and she awakened well before six thoroughly refreshed and relaxed rejoicing in the apparent certainty of many more such pleasant nights to come it had been an inspiration to take employment in this place not once during the several weeks of that employment had a day passed without its delighting interlude it might be nothing more nothing more than an eyelid twisted beneath a professionally inquiring thumb or it might be nothing more than boiling bouillon forced between lips too weak to protest but once there had been a hypodermic driving all the way to the bone and and last night ah last night throwing open the french doors of her room she stood naked in the coolgray light of dawn drinking in the tangy air of the pacific she looked out past the balcony and down the cliff seeing the hunched redtipped speck that was doctor murphy reveling in the childish ageold joy of seeing without being seen in her imagination a very vivid muchpracticed instrument she mounted the balustrade of the balcony and called to him sweetly in the voice of circe sweet but imperious a salaambo commanding the barbarian and he came to her scrambling up the rocks and suddenly he was there his feet and hands somehow bound stretched helplessly on the bed she bent over him she let her full breasts brush back and forth across his face well she whispered dont you like me ith there thumpthing wrong doctor she shivered delightedly the scene changed now it was she who lay bound and helpless and it was the doctor who bent over her and if she was helpless well if a person was helpless how could she a brief wave of sickness nausea swept over her her imagination vivid and muchpracticed as it was would go no further she sat down on the bed and lighted a cigarette she tried to reason with herself to squeeze out past the door of inhibition which always when she was on the point of escape crushed so cruelly and firmly against her a doctor would be all right doctors had always been all right wasnt it a doctor who had been nice to mama all those years when no one else had been nice well there you were doctors were different doctors were all right she showered in lukewarm water then turned the cold faucet on full letting it beat for minutes against the molded curves of buttocks and belly she took a great many cold showers and usually they helped she supposed anyway that she might have felt much more unease without them but even if it had helped this morning that help fell far short of the aid she needed less than thirty minutes before she had felt relaxed and joyous ready for anything now there was no joy in her only the old neversatisfied hunger and it was as if she had never rested and it was his fault it was always their fault it had been their fault with mama the mean wicked dirty things they had killed mama always demanding and giving nothing in return miss baker dressed in her clean white uniform her spotless white shoes and stockings eyes sparkling strangely she pinned a white blueedged cap upon her brown brushed bright hair last night was just a beginning it was just a sample of what she would give him it was his fault and and why wait until tonight in the long hospital day there is no firm conjunction of one shift with another their edges come together raggedly notably with the ending of the night and the beginning of the day feet drag there is much thoughtful drinking of coffee departures are prompt arrivals late or present only in the flesh six oclock for all practical purposes means sixfifteen or sixthirty no harm comes of this circumstance patients who have not rested well are now fatigued and asleep those who have rested are well able to wait upon the satisfaction of their needs and wants and naturally where a real emergency exists it will be promptly if sleepily provided for patient is in convulsions oh god another one well give him paraldehyde two ounces paraldehyde orally acth intravenously patient is in a coma caffeine benzedrine oxygen patients heart has stopped nicotinic acid jab your finger up his butt patient is violent hyocsin restraints then nothing then that is all brother we can only sprinkle talcum over the cancer convulse if you must remain in your coma let your heart stutter and stop you wont die not permanently only for a few hours days a week the great crazycolored snakes will coil around you crawl lazily from your eyes your ears and mouth and nose and you will slide around the wall of your room clawing and striking and screaming and your heart will fail and your eyes glaze and your limbs will stiffen and you will be dead but not dead only dying and for such a short time brother think you need only die this death for a maximum of a week and then it will all be over until the next time but to return to lucretia baker rn the sanitarium was still silent as she crept out of her room the halls were still empty she breathed quietly listening and heard only the faint faraway clatter of josephine and her kitchen utensils she closed her door without a sound there were only three rooms in this wing of the house her own the diathermy and xray chamber and room four moving swiftly down the hall her footsteps silent on the ribbed rubber matting she paused briefly in front of a heavy oak door with a single nickeled numeral then she pulled the bolt there was no lock on the inside and thrust all her weight against it she opened it just enough to allow her to enter and once inside she blocked it open with a small wooden doorstop she had brought from her own room that would allow her to leave quickly to hear anyone coming up the stairs and she didnt need to worry about him he couldnt call for anyone the room was windowless the walls and floor were of underpadded canvas the one item of furniture was a low formicatopped table its legs bolted to the floor he lay on the table an oval oblong of damp white sheets held in place by the straps which also held him motionless miss baker inspected the wrappings and was momentarily frightened someone had redone them that judson would he but they wouldnt think that why would anyone think that about her she looked down at the whitebandaged head held level with the cocoon of sheets by a stack of pifiows van twynes eyes were open they looked unblinkingly into hers in a blank uncomprehending stare then they blinked and something crept up through the blankness he recognized her he knew what shed done but he would not remember long and at any rate he was virtually as powerless to speak as a newborn baby he was a baby in fact a big old mean helpless baby couldnt even talk the nasty lazy thing terror was crowding into his eyes stretching the lids making the whites greater and greater they rolled in his head wildly and his lips moved his mouth opened and closed in silence miss baker laughed merrily she took a folded handtowel from her pocket oh yes yes she had come wellprepared and placed it over his mouth he tried to bite into it but she knew exactly what to do about that she gripped his nose between her thumb and forefinger and squeezed the nostrils shut he began to smother thatll fixth you you nathty thing miss baker whispered thtupid thats what you are lazy bad thtupid man dont even know your own name do you she had to force herself to remove the gag to take away her fingers the sweet agony in her loins was racing to a climax and in a few more seconds oh thweet heaven just a few more she would but she did not have those seconds the mean stupid thing was strangling she looked down at him all fairness now her own pleasure merely a necessary potential of a job to be done tell me your name she whispered if you dont tell me your name ill have to she waited she lowered the towel she reached for his nose very well in that cathe i have no choice but to the smothering began again again miss bakers body trembled with a hot orgiastic tide ttell me she panted she was breathing for both of them tell me your name and the billion uncohered images of van twynes subconscious hurled frenziedly against themselves they struggled upward seeking a new exit for the one that was strangely absent they broke through into nothingness into a patterniess uncharted void just as the exit had been missing so now was the pattern unguided unrelated each struggled and shrieked for command and yet gradually a kind of order a kind of superchaos emerged from the chaos name he tried the images coming from way way back huhhuh huhhuhwhoooah name name things words and his mind sweating huhhuhhuhcat man cat man name a rush a void a meaningful meaninglessness huhhuhhuh sugar honey darling dear mamas little mannowilayme goddamlilsnob on daddy daddy what you do to me i said so didnt i well who the hell are you

remember them all right dont you and why not ha ha how could you forget miss bakers small body was limp the fever was gone from her eyes and her breathing was regular the sheets were bound tight terribly tight tired but happy she turned away from the table stooped to remove the doorstop and then it happened balls shrieked humphrey van twyne iii balls balls balls miss baker jumped bumping her head against the edge of the door she whirled panicstricken and took a few steps toward the table she ran toward the door again what how could he he was mean nasty and theyd get her and she hadnt done a thing only tried to he shrieked and kept shrieking that one terrible word shrieked deafeningly as though he would never stop she snatched up the doorstop squeezed through the slowly closing door and ran madly down the hall she was barely inside her own room when doctor murphy and rufus the former in the lead came pounding up the stairs she leaned fearfully against her door listening listening to the sudden starting and stopping of the shrieks as the door to room four was opened and closed theyd know she thought terrified hed know that room was soundproof hed know that shed been in there but maybe shed have to try maybe he wouldnt think of that oh god dont let him think of it minutes passed were they talking about her deciding what should be done with her then she heard the door of room four open and she opened her own and stepped firmly out into the hallway rufus bobbed his head as he passed her carrying a whiteenamel hypodermic tray doctor murphy sauntered along behind him still wearing his bathing trunks he smiled at her engagingly some fun eh im awfully thorry to be late doctor but you thee my alarm didnt go off no harm done shrugged the doctor wasnt that some yelling though funny id have sworn he didnt have so much as a whisper in him yeth said miss baker it ith odd ithnt it funny that we could hear him too perhaps the noise leaked out through the ventilating system never known it to do it before but do you suppose it did miss baker well i thuppoth it oh i forgot you probably looked in on him for a moment didnt you miss baker well i did feel no no no oh no thir i the doctor snapped his fingers of course not you were still in bed well i uh i wasnt in bed egthackly i was getting dressed and doctor murphy picked up her right hand he opened the finger of his left hand and placed a small square of cambric in her palm folding her hand around that must have dropped that he said when you were there last night he grinned at her started down the stairs see me right after breakfast eh miss baker yeth thir said lucretia baker her voice a thin whisper rright right after breakfast doctor murphy doctor murphy went down the steps to the first landing turned left down a narrow wrought ironrailed mezzanine and proceeded to the southernmost wing of the house where his own room was located he dressed whistling feeling unusually pleased with himself all his impulses had inclined him to shove nurse baker into her room shake her until her teeth rattled paddle her little round butt until she couldnt sit down herd her out of the house and hurl her clothes after her that was what he had wanted to do and a man less strongwilled a man lacking the perfect selfcontrol which he had so definitely demonstrated would have done that which of course would have been the worst thing he could do she was a sick woman reason had told him that as it cried down the rage that prompted him to smack her so for once oh hell not just once he didnt blow up very often he held onto his temper in the face of genuine outrage he had done exactly the right thing she was sick the sick should be cured not punished he had taken the first step toward that cure he had shown the damned nasty little stinker this sick woman that he was wise to her goddam that he was aware of her ailment and yet was not angry with her he had edged the matter out of the shadowed and secret recesses of her mind another such nudge or two and it would be out in the open if she didnt fly into a defensive rage doctor murphy carelessly knotted a tie around the neck of his shortsleeved sport shirt raked his fingers through his hair until it assumed some semblance of order and stuffed a couple of clean handkerchiefs into his pockets he let his grin fade deliberately and stared pugnaciously at himself in the mirror washed up who you talking about bud well you got fifteen grand in your keister anything to keep the bank from tossing you out of here with a few days grace period now look i dont have time to argue with you ive got work to do see ive got to be thinking out something on this sick woman or is she just a degenerate ive got all these alcoholics oh sure sure and what the hells all that going to get you whatll it who the hell said it would get me anything listen you stupid jerk face the facts do you want to keep this place going or not damned if i know why you would but do you know the answer to that then theres just one thing for you to do start thinking about a nice round sum from the van twyne farm you think id do that just because the familys fed up afraid to give him the thirtyseventy chance the operation entitles him to you think id keep a man buried here alive a hopeless imbecile just because his family is willing to pay for it i said i wasnt going to think about it now and by god im not doctor murphy gave his image a stern conclusive nod he turned toward the door a young man stood there leaning against the casing grinning at him sorry to walk in on you doc he said guess you didnt hear me knock i see said doctor murphy and did it occur to you to wait until i did hear you he was appearances to the contrary something of a stickler for formality he liked good manners except when they were sodden he usually found those good manners practiced by alcoholics and this man was very far from sodden it was unlikely that his system still retained any of the alcohol which had been in it upon his arrival the day before the young man chuckled brushing aside the rebuke youve got to fix me up doc boy if i dont get a drink fast im going to fall apart the doctor nodded slowly he suddenly appeared to be charmed and intrigued by his visitor had quite a bender eh well i guess when you advertising men hang one on you really hang it on the young man said they did and how dont have to worry about your job eh if they dont like it at that place theres plenty of other places that will well i dont want to brag doc but i can tell you this drunk or sober i can still do a hell of a lot better than he proceeded to brag while the doctor casually pushed up the sleeve of his hospital bathrobe and took his pulse he had no doubt that the young mans boasts were true or almost true alcoholics had to be good they lost time from their jobs they were guilty of disgusting and atrocious acts thus if they were to survive in their professions or jobs to be tolerated by the world they so frequently outraged they had to work and think harder than normal people so this man probably was very good at his work now he probably was very much in demand five or ten years from now well that would be another matter a mans ability availed him nothing if he could not stop drinking long enough to use it all his talents were worthless if people were afraid to hire him first trip to a sanitarium mr uh sloan make it jeff doc yep first trip usually you know i dont want any more after the second or third day im not sick at my stomach exactly just feel like ive had enough but this time i uhhuh i think i understand jeff so ill tell you what youll have to do get sobered up completely rest for a couple days until your nerves are straightened out then get back to your job and never take another drink as long as you live jeff sloan laughed youre kidding doc i can handle it didnt i tell you this was the first time i youll never be able to handle it again and this wont be the last time but ive got to drink its part of my job i have to meet a lot of people and doc murphy couldnt decide whether he was angry or sad a little of both he guessed his nose wrinkled sniffing the air suspiciously well i suppose if you must have a drink a big one doc ill give you an ounce now if you want more later you can have it followed by the young man he walked down the mezzanine until he came to the padlocked door of a onetime linen closet he unlocked it and stepped inside he emerged with a shotglass full of one hundredproof bourbon jeff sloan gulped it eagerly doc handed him a small ivorycolored pill no he said answering the suspicious question in the others eyes it wont make you sick at your stomach it wont put you to sleep sloan tossed the pill into his mouth he expressed effusive thanks for the drink and headed down the hall toward his room a few steps away he turned grinning and brushed his hand across his forehead in a gesture of exaggerated dismay say thats the real stuff doc what brand is it think ill lay in a few bottles when i get home ill write it down for you said doctor murphy smoothly he relocked the door of the closet carefully testing the lock afterwards he went down the stairs started to enter the dining room then turned abruptly in the opposite direction he had almost forgotten about the general the old boy had or had had a constitution like iron but it was being seriously strained the general was lying on a table in a small examination room doc took his blood pressure then since he had no stethoscope with him he laid his ear against the old soldiers chest and listened to his heart he straightened again frowning indecisively well doctor would you say i was alive oh nothing as bad as that said the doctor i was just wondering what to embalm you with mmm the general pursed his lips thoughtfully if i might make a suggestion i believe that one of the timetested fluids is doc laughed tapered the laugh into a severe frown he was going to have to stop clowning with the patients dammit what the hell was he running a circus or a sanitarium it was all right to joke a little but this incessant gabbing and horsing around was going out the window as of right now he rang the bell for rufus stepping out into the hall when he heard the attendant approach the general is pretty rundown he said dropping his voice hows our plasma holding up well uh uh rufus started to scratch his head then quickly dropped his hand as docs eye caught his whynt we sock him with insoolim doctuh at start im to eatin good dont think he can take an insulin shock said the doctor nodding appreciation for the suggestion rufus had plenty on the ball if hed only use it all that had got him sore with rufus was the latters bollixing around with that correspondence school crap instead of using his very good common sense guess wed better make it plasma how about gooclothes we travenize him huh doctuh give him nice gooclothes brekfuss glucose snapped doctor murphy cant you remember anything at all not gooclothes for christs sake glucose gluco yes suh said rufus quickly i go get it right away you will not and stop telling me what to do dammit his system wont burn up a good load of glucose so oh he said tiredly no plasma they didnt wouldnt fill our order yes suh sure would stop tradin with that outfit if i was you doctuh aint a bit dependable no more yeah well doctuh maybe well men generals same type an an if he wouldnt mind takin blood from doc murphy let out a happy roar mind why in hell should he why why indeed called a reedy voice from the examination chamber he would on the contrary be delighted grateful and uh flattered rufus beamed doctor murphy clapped him on the back go on and get breakfast over with general you lie there and rest well see you in thirty minutes or so and miss baker down yet no suh she havin some coffee in her room good i mean uh well good they walked down the hall together the doctor apologizing very handsomely he felt for his tirade of the day before the trouble with rufus he declared was that rufus couldnt take a joke not that rufus hadnt deserved an a asseating understand but but hell murph oh oh doc paused in front of a partly opened door put my breakfast on the table rufus ill murph come in here at once you hideous beast rufus went on doctor murphy went in he sat down on the edge of the womans bed listened to a throaty tearful and seemingly interminable denunciation of himself his employees his hospital the motion picture industry the incometax bureau the republicans the democrats the everything that manic depressive alcoholic susan kenfield could think of all delivered with beautiful if occasionally inappropriate gestures her hair was snowwhite but her great brown eyes her face and her body were those of a woman in her early thirties at least one would have to look at her long and closely to suspect that they were not just how old she was doc could only guess probably around forty he believed since she had been playing character parts for more than twenty years the throaty perfectly enunciated flood of words began to ebb doc patted her affectionately on the bottom feel better now anything else on your mind well well that perfectly beastly judson murph i lay here losing my mind for want of sleep and all i asked for was one teeny nembutal he couldnt give it to you suzy you were loaded already well and you you heartless beast you didnt even kiss me goodnight well that said doctor murphy will never do he smacked her soundly on one firm alabaster cheek he drew away firmly as her arms sought to circle his shoulders now ive got to beat it suzy you murph yeah murph lover you are going to help me arent you oh darling i knew i could count on jesus christ snarled doc how hammy can you get hammy are you accusing me you must help me dearest i warn you ill kill myself ill with what theres nothing on the market that would kill an old bag like you if there was id make you a present of it a bbag miss kenfield rolled her great eyes imploring the heavens to witness this heresy this socalled man of mercy calls me a a she choked on the terrible word doctor murphy spoke it for her a bag why goddam you suzy if you werent so damned heavy id toss your tail right out that window hheavy miss kenfield wept heavy oh yyou fiend yyou did i get you drunk hell no i couldnt get you drunk if i wanted to you were never by god more sober than you cad beast did i get you pregnant no again all ive ever got out of you is a big fat headache yes all by god your goddamned fees havent been enough to pay for my aspirin and yet youve got the guts to come to me and ask for an abortion you know what you can do suzy go yourself i wish i had sniffled susan kenfield doctor murphy snorted and headed for the door reaching the threshold he paused and wheeled around by the way suzy how far along are you whats the difference miss kenfield shrugged two three months i guess you guess i really dont see how it could be more than that murph i mean well after all she patted her abdomen it would have to stick out more wouldnt it mmm doc grunted noncommittally and his eyes swept over her body small boned compact yet lushly curving with a frame like that how long since your last period two or three months said the actress promptly i mean i did it about three months ago but not very good not like i usually do it when uhhuh i see the doctor grunted again at suzys age a women was apt to have irregular periods in any event some women had been known to menstruate up to the month they gave birth why did you come to me with this suzy you know your way around why come to me with an abortion when you could go to any one of a dozen doctors who would jump at the chance to do the job but lover i miss kenfield hesitated and her eyes shifted from the doctors for the merest fraction of a second then they met his again brimming with love and trust wide with innocent honesty but why wouldnt i come to you lover why should i go to anyone else when i have my own dearest darling murph to doctor murphy said a single obscene word and walked out slamming the door as susan kenfields endearments changed suddenly to profane yells of reproach she was lying well not exactly lying perhaps but covering up something holding back on the facts that was obvious but it was also obvious that now was not the moment to get the truth out of her it would take more time than he had to give at this hour of the day he entered the dining room drew back a chair and sat down at the table and looked at the four patients present jeff sloan the advertising man was there looking decidedly wan and dabbling disinterestedly at his food then there was bernie edmonds prematurely gray preternaturally youthful somehow spruce and smartappearing even in bathrobe and pajamas not so many years ago bernie had won the pulitzer prize for international reporting not so many years ago he had been managing editor of a leading new york newspaper and the author of two bestselling books on world affairs now he was a parttime rewrite man on one of the los angeles papers and there was every indication that he was about to be severed from that position seated on bernies right were the twin holcomb brothers john and gerald fiftyish plumpish baldish the brothers holcomb owned one of the more successful hollywood literary agencies far too successful in doctor murphys opinion for their own good they had become leaders in the field back in the early days of pictures and long before their alcoholism had reached the point of incapacitating them the functions of the agency had been delegated to employees whose high pay and equally high degree of competence were legends in the industry now g j holcomb inc maintained branch offices in the major cities of the world and gerald and john holcomb with a sixfigure income and no demands on their time maintained more or less permanent living quarters in el healtho sanitarium they had been released after ten days of treatment early in the current week last night after an absence of less than fortyeight hours they had returned hopelessly helplessly drunk sodden to the gills logically they should not have been able to get out of bed this morning they should have been too hungover and shaky and sick to budge from their room yet here they were feeling quite chipper apparently and they had actually eaten a considerable part of their breakfast doctor murphy could only account for their conduct in one way turning his head slightly he called to rufus yes suh our friends here doc nodded to the holcombs have some whiskey hidden in their room see if you can find it yes suh did you hear the man brother whiskey in our room now why would he think that it was john holcomb why indeed said gerald holcomb a very rash impulsive man if you ask my opinion pay him no mind brother theres something in the atmosphere here said bernie edmonds it makes the best of us jumpy ive noticed it in myself you know seem to be very nervous and shaky every time i come here he and the brothers holcomb discussed this nominal phenomenon gravely with jeff sloan throwing in an occasional deadpan gibe doctor murphy suddenly shoved back his plate why do you do it he said thats what i dont get why the hell you do it you come here to stop drinking because youve drunk so much youre goddam near dead and yet you spend all the time youre in here trying to get a drink why im damned if i get it bernie edmonds wagged his gray head thoughtfully ive never been able to understand it he said his tone indicating that the problem was not one of personal concern its a very interesting question said gerald holcomb in much the same tone brother and i were discussing it only a night or so ago you remember brother i do indeed nodded john holcomb i believe we made a mental note to ask our good friend here the doctor about it but since he seems to be as baffled as we are mr sloan do you have an opinion jeff sloan shrugged the only opinion i have right now is that im going to fall apart if i dont have a drink how about it doc as long as were on the subject youve had one said doctor murphy shortly and he thought dammit are they all crazy or am i they act like just one doc i only had an ounce whats an ounce of whiskey for a man with a bad case of shakes all you need all youd better have well said bernie edmonds blandly every case is different of course but my own experience has been that a little whiskey is like a little knowledge actually dangerous you know less medicative than uh aggravative aggravative holcomb is that a good word if it isnt said john it should be at any rate bernie i certainly agree with your sentiment a beautiful and concise restatement of an ancient truth said gerald to wit a man cant fly on one wing i believe were all in agreement here doctor mr sloan needs and should have another drink give him one yourself snapped the doctor i know damned well did you find it rufus no suh sure aint no whiskey in that room said rufus but all right said doctor murphy how about it doc said sloan make it a good shot this time huh doc murphy looked at him he had given sloan an antabuse pill and it takes no great amount of whiskey in combination with antabuse to prove damnnear fatal all right said the doctor rufus bring mr sloan an ounce and a half of bourbon he held out his keys rufus took them returned after a moment with the drink and doc carefully returned the keys to his pocket now im warning you sloan you shouldnt take that drink youre going to wish you hadnt and youd be a lot better off without it jeff sloan nodded i dont doubt you a bit doctor he said and he swallowed the drink at a gulp doctor murphy shoved back his chair and stood up he strode out of the room and out the front door bernie bowed his head at sloan in a gesture of appreciation nice going a very nice act docs thoroughly convinced that youre about to suffer the agonies of the damned and does he love it grinned sloan ill have to do some more eyefluttering and sweating for him if i play it just right suffer in just the right amount i may be able to make him for three or four more shots youre positive you didnt swallow any of the antabuse said john holcomb it doesnt take much of it to youre telling me said sloan ive had that stuff before couldnt sit down couldnt lie stifi couldnt get my breath and my heart kept fluttering and stopping i wasnt sick you know just so damned uncomfortable and uneasy that i wished i could die and get it over with but i thought doc watched you take it oh i put it in my mouth all right but i tongued it into my hand when i took my drink he demonstrated the trick while the holcombs and bernie looked on admiringly then gerald glanced meaningfully at john and the two of them glanced at bernie and all three stood up if youll excuse me mr sloan oh sure said jeff easily you fellows go right ahead im feeling no pain for the moment the brothers murmured appreciation for sloans tact and understanding bernie edmonds felt constrained to explain the situation we the holcombs i should say have less than a quart as long as you can get it out of doc youd probably better do it sure said sloan ill manage what about this old guy the general i spotted him out on the terrace this morning looked like a man who could use a slug if i ever saw one thats right said bernie i dont see how we can give the general a drink hed wind up by taking the whole bottle and doc would well i dont like to think about what doc would do its too bad but i understand sloan nodded well ill see you gentlemen after a while glowing comfortably from the whiskey he arose from his chair and sauntered across the room he stepped through the french doors and out onto a flagstoned patio overlooking the front yard must cost something to maintain a place like this sloan thought idly but for thirty bucks a day thirty bucks plus extras per patient doctor murphy could doubtless afford it for that kind of money he could afford something much better than this and sloan thought critically keep it up much better of course the place wasnt filled to capacity but it wouldnt have to be say there were only seven patients such as was the case now well seven times thirty was two hundred and ten more than that when you figured extras but call it two hundred and ten two ten times three sixtyfive why hell it figured out to around eighty grand a year and if half of that wasnt profit then he jeff sloan didnt know his tail from a turnip his eyes narrowed suddenly in a kind of goodnatured disgust as he saw the doctor emerge from a clump of shrubbery near the far end of the lawn he had been down on his hands and knees a doctor mind you crawling on his hands and knees and he arose holding a bottle he held it up to the light shook it then hurried it away in the direction of the trees then head down he came striding up a curving grayeled walk to the patio sloan stepped down off the flagstone to meet him oh doctor murphy id like to talk to you about huh the doctor looked up startled then roughly brushed past the advertising man later havent time for you now now just a minute said sloan this is i said i didnt have time sloan but this is important it itll keep then doc murphy flung over his shoulder and he disappeared through the french doors jeff took an angry stride or two after him then redfaced kicking surlily at the gravel he moved around the house to the rear terrace the good feeling the sharpness of mind he had know a moment ago was beginning to leave him now he felt shamed cheap and more than that damned good and sore he wasnt drunk was he hed been entirely polite and businesslike hadnt he well then where did that bird get off at treating him like some spring street bum moodily he sat down on the terrace and lighted a cigarette sat staring out at the ocean of course he had insisted on having whiskey this morning hed tricked murphy into giving him two drinks but murphy didnt know he was being tricked and hed been pretty tricky himself and and anyway anyone was apt to need a couple of quick ones when he got up in the morning and and the guy had been goddam rude right from the start if he hadnt tried to throw his weight around he sloan wouldnt have might not have taken even one drink rationalizing pushing down the unpleasant facts which his subconscious mind sought to present to him jeff talked himself into a mood of warm selfrighteousness this murphy would have to be shown that was all let these other characters take his guff if they wanted to but jeff sloan would show him show him uh something hed think of something just as soon as he got another drink or two he sauntered into the house and down the hall wonder ing how he could broach the matter to the holcombs in a way at once polite and insistent they struck him as being pretty cold fish if they wanted to be bernie edmonds too for all his airy geniality they were old friends acquaintances at least and he was an outsider and but surely they wouldnt turn him down fact was theyd already promised to take care of him they might have done it hoping hed refuse as he had refused but they had offered and when he explained why he couldnt hit up the doctor for the time being he walked more slowly hearing the doctors voice through the open door of a room ahead of him all right general you just lie here for another hour sit tight too rufus dont do any stirring around for the next fifteen minutes yes suh get all that milk down you miss baker you put plenty of corn syrup in it yeth doctor good good jeff sloan came parallel with the door and looked in the old boy the general was stretched out on the bed with his eyes closed while doctor murphy affixed a bandage to his right arm rufus his body bared to the waist was slumped forward in a chair sipping from a glass which nurse baker held for him the position of her body slightly hiked the white skirt of her uniform and sloan got a glimpse of creamy pink flesh then the doctor had turned and was looking at him with a mixture of emotions in which resignation predominated all right sloan still after a drink eh as a matter of fact jeff began coldly had he said he wanted a drink hadnt he only wanted to discuss a strictly business proposition well as a matter of fact jeff swallowed heavily yes the doctor frowned i dont know how in the hell youre but okay got your keys with you miss baker yeth thir get mr sloan a drink then give him uh well two ounces and check his reactions after he takes it check him very carefully understand yeth doctor and ill see you in my office as soon as youre finished yyeth thir jeff sloan followed her up the hall wondering how a trick as cute as this had been allowed to run around loose so long he considered the possibility of arranging a date for a few days hence after he was back in circulation but intriguing as the idea was he couldnt really get his mind on it for the moment hed have to think about it later after hed had after hed demonstrated a thing or two to doc murphy he watched fidgeting while she unlocked the liquor closet and filled a twoounce glass he was so anxious for the drink that he almost forgot to simulate the symptoms which the whiskey was supposed to bring on he gulped the drink sighed with relief and shuddered happily then aware suddenly that she was watching him he remembered and he staggered and brushed at his brow miss bakers hand shot out steadying him she felt his pulse she looked up into his face looked quickly away again and released his wrist turning she relocked the liquor closet feeling all right mithter thloan well not all right exactly but perhapth youd better lie down a while well uh maybe i had at that a trifle worriedly he watched her round the corner of the hall and head down the stairs she must have known hed have sworn for a moment that she was going to say something and right at the moment murphy didnt have him bulled a bit understand but right at the moment seated in his office his long legs hooked about the scuffed base of his swivel chair doctor murphy slowly closed the doubleentry ledger and shoved it into a drawer of his rolltop desk well that at least had been one thing he was right about there wasnt a chance of keeping open without the van twyne money without the fifteen thousand cash on the line which only they could and would provide hed been right about that but it was about the only thing he was right about as for everything else he seemed to be off on the wrong foot entirely hed missed a trick with susan kenuield something damned important obviously or she wouldnt be covering it up the general hadnt responded well to the transfusion he hadnt been able to find the holcombs whiskey and bernie edmonds who had been sobering up nicely would be getting drunk all over again jeff sloan wasnt reacting as he should to the antabuse nor and this could be of even greater importance to the psychological cold shoulder sloan had seemed to need a good hard punch in his ego he had it seemed needed to be shown that a man loses everything including the respect and consideration of others in succumbing to alcohol but what had seemed like a good idea was in jeffs case apparently a bad one hed got angry stubborn but in the wrong way instead of getting sore at himself sloan was angry with him murphy well doc murphy nodded casually as miss baker entered the office hed have to try another angle if he had the time meanwhile here was an even more serious problem she came briskly across the room and laid the bed charts on the desk waited standing respectfully as he turned through them umm he looked up and motioned to a chair sit down miss baker id like to talk to you about what about sloan anyway how did the drink set with him lucretia baker hesitated fear spreading through her stomach it theemed to uh stagger him doctor how about his pulse well it didnt theem to be very irregular i dont get it said doc murphy i just dont get it well he shook his head well have to keep an eye on him you know theres no antidote for antabuse yeth thir i know miss baker had begun to relax the doctor hadnt said a word about about anything he was being just as sweet as anyone could be and he still trusted her and depended on her so doubtless before it was too late she had better state her suspicions concerning mr sloan nurse miss baker wha thir said miss baker he was frowning almost scowling at her obviously she had been guilty of the one sin which a doctor considers well nigh unforgivable in a nurse inattention while he is talking i beg your pardon doctor i was was skip it said doctor murphy curtly i asked you if you werent on duty yesterday evening when the holcombs checked in yeth thir said miss baker a trifle breathlessly i checked them in myself thats what i thought did you happen to notice the whiskey they brought in with them why of courth not if id theen but you didnt thee see doctor murphy faltered and corrected himself you didnt because you didnt stay in the room with them while they undressed why not lucretia baker dropped her eyes she couldnt explain why it was possible for her to view a patient undressed but impossible to watch him undressing im thorry doctor she said ill be more careful hereafter well doc murphy took a resolute grip on his temper thats about all we can do i guess i wouldnt mind so much if it wasnt for sloan its useless naturally to ask them to cooperate with me after the amount of whiskey hes taken and survived they wouldnt believe id given him antabuse theyd figure the same as he would that i was just trying to keep him from having a drink yeth thir for that matter fretted the doctor if theres any way of scaring an alcoholic out of a drink id like to know what it is theyre scareproof when it comes to whiskey you can tell em one more drink will stop their clock but theyll go right ahead and take it theyll have it no matter how much it costs them why we had a patient here it was a few months before you joined us who his voice trailed off into silence and he sat staring straight into miss bakers eyes into their thousandmilesaway blankness he waited and watched his thin face tightening with annoyance and the thought of what she had done was tinder for the fuel of his disappointments and frustrations a bonedry fuse needing only one tiny spark to ignite a man could only take so much he why a lot of doctors would have pressed criminal charges but he not only had said and done nothing but was trying to help her and why what for so that she could sit and sleep with her eyes open while he was talking to her the spark came a full two minutes after he had ceased speaking miss bakers soft lips moved yeth thir she murmured doctor murphys eyes flashed the freckles suddenly stood out on his pale face like so many copper pennies wha said miss baker and then save for vague gurgling sounds she was silent for her chin and jaws were in the grip of doc murphys strong right hand and her mouth was being forced open open up he said grimly wider now stick out your tongue miss baker gasped struggled and went limp she opened her mouth to its widest and extended her tongue to its utmost doctor murphy picked up a thin wooden tongue depressor and began probing then as suddenly as he had taken his grip he released it and tossed the depressor aside theres no reason for you to lisp he said why do you do it why i i miss baker scrubbed at her mouth with the back of her hand i always done it eh well there might have been a reason for it at one time but there isnt now not the slightest id cut it out if i were you miss baker nodded yyeth yes say it yes yes said the nurse clearly and firmly there said doc murphy leaning back in his chair see how easy it is now watch yourself on that after this its harmless enough in itself but where theres no reason for it as in your case its a manifestation of something which might not be uh desirable its a recessive factor subconsciously youre trying to move back into infancy look at it this way just what did you have back there in infancy aside from an absence of responsibility not much is it compared to what you have or could have as an adult miss bakers smile was as friendly as his own more than that there was something so womanly sweet about it that doc murphy felt a pleasant prickling of his scalp now i hope i havent been youve been wonderful said lucretia baker softly just wonderful its so nithe nice of you to take such an interest in me forget it said doc havent done anything suppose we have another talk later in the afternoon oh id love to breathed miss baker and a little hastily the doctor dismissed her he watched her leave disturbed a trifle uneasy but not unpleasantly so judging by her reaction he had managed the interview very well he had been a little rough perhaps at the beginning but apparently it was just what she needed perhaps if hed got rough years ago with that little nurse at bellevue and this baker babe looked a lot like her come to think of it ah well doctor murphy shook his head in selfreproof that was out that had nothing to do with his interest in lucretia baker it damned well couldnt have he was a pretty free and easy guy admittedly too free and easy but he wasnt crazy and next to diddling a woman patient there wasnt a surer way for a doctor to jam himself up than to play around with his nurse you just couldnt do those things no more than you could beat a guy with a bullwhip or stab a waiter in the belly meanwhile as she paused outside the office to collect herself miss bakers thoughts were as confused as the doctors own she was no longer fearful there was no room for fear with every cell of her brain and body flooded with anger it was a kind of scattergun anger its main impact diverted somehow from its nominal and original target there was a shield of authority between it and him the doctor impregnable authority as yet at least he had not given her the ammunition to penetrate it he had struck painfully into her defenses inciting her to fury but giving her no focus for it jutht wait she promised herself jutht wait and thee what he does but it was impossible to wait for that she had to do something now right this minute if she didnt find some way someone to yeeow whoooeee the cry the yell rather came from the kitchen and it was followed by sundry other wild yells and grunts and shrieks all mingled with the clamor of crashing cookware and crockery miss bakers eyes sparkled head erect back straight as a ramrod she stepped softly out of the office areaway and across the dining room and through the swinging doors to the kitchen the peaktide of cook josephines hysteria had passed now it was at an ebb leaving her slumped down on a stool quaking shivering and chuckling her head buried on one arm the other slowly raising and dropping a frying pan against a shattered mass of onetime plates miss baker stepped up to her side jutht what she said ith going on here for a moment the cooks body was completely motionless then slowly she looked up her eyes still red with laughter even as they widened with apprehension i will not put up with thth jothephine will not do you underthand it hath got to thtop well it stopped aint it josephine muttered with sullen courage i aint doin nothin you the one thats makin all the noise miss baker stiffened look at me jothephine josephine looked unwillingly shiftily at first then steadily she looked down into the heartshaped face into the wide and clear gray eyes with their silksoft lashes into gentleness and innocence and for the moment her unreasoning instinctive fear of the nurse gave way to puzzlement how come she said and she so far forgot herself as to scratch her head how come you so so mean mean but she wasnt never ever no matter what anyone said what they might say now it was a lie foolish ridiculous deliberately hurtful for the truth was not here in the now of life she had been less than three years old when her father died and he did not exist in her memory as a man or more specifically as man he was protection he was shelter he was warmth and comfort and soothing words but he was not man man was mr leemy it was a little more than a year after your dear fathers death when she and mama had gone to live with mr leemy mama had explained that the move was necessary how often she had used that word a kind of close sesame above definition and argument and then mama had gone on in violation of all precedent to say that they were really very fortunate to repeat almost stubbornly it seemed that mr leemy was really a very fine man a splendid man regardless of what people say and the next day they moved the next day for mama had delayed telling her until the last moment she met mr leemy and so great was her disappointment that she almost burst out crying she did not cry of course one didnt cry over things that were necessary she only stood paralyzed shocked and confused trying to reconcile splendid and fine and all the rest with this with man he sat in the dimlylit library of the house his two canes hooked over either arm of his chair the chair drawn up before the stingy coals of the fireplace he sat crouched like a spider it seemed something that was all bulging torso and puffed fishwhite face his thin pipestem legs tapering spiderishly into shoes that were little larger than her own and mama had dragged her forward then pushed her a little to the front and mr leemy had put out one of his puffed decaysmelling hands and pinched her on the arm involuntarily she jerked away donth she said donth mr leemy decided to be amused you must be a little boy thats the way little boys talk no yeth thir she said taking another step backward trying to reach mamas hand oh you are a little boy then thats too bad i hoped you were a little girl i like little girls dont i ma mrs baker i know what they like dont i mama murmured indistinctly mr leemy tried to pinch her again and failed and his teasing became edged little boy he said thats the way little boys talk too bad yes sir its certainly too bad you arent a little girl i like little girls and little girls like me dont you want to be a little girl so and at last at merciful last mama had said im afraid the childs a little overwrought say goodnight to mr leemy darling ill bet she cant even say goodnight he said you cant say it like a little girl can you and mama was starting to pull her away by then but she took the time to answer she had to convince him she had to make sure that he would not like her as he liked little girls no thir she said goodnighthe thereafter she had had very little contact with mr leemy the house was large and there was only mama the housekeeper to do the work so there was always something to be done by way of helping mama in some part of the house where he was not mr leemy took his meals on a tray in his room or the library she and mama ate alone she was sent to bed early in her own room and she was made to understand that once there it was necessary to stay mr leemy because of his legs occupied a downstairs bedroom so they saw very little of each other sometimes she was almost able to persuade herself that he didnt exist sometimes that is in those few years before she entered school never after that there were whisperings and snickerings and frank questions about bogey men the teachers looked at her peculiarly often with distaste more often and more hateful to bear with pity and once at recess when she was coming up the stairs from the girls basement she heard a group of teachers talking on the landing above talking about mama and mr leemy almost three months passed before she ascertained the truth for herself the false and ugly truth of adulthood as opposed to the sparkling and wholly splendid truth of her infancy three months of thinking and preparing herelf of waiting on a necessity so urgent as to outweigh the prohibition against leaving her room at night it came the compelling excuse she had waited for it came yet she continued to wait for a few nights until a night when she heard a soft creaking of the stair treads and a moment or two later the squeaking rattle of the library doors as they rolled open and shut again she waited nearly ten minutes some four hundred heart beats then noting that she was slightly feverish and she actually was she had been so for several days and that her water glass was empty she went quietly down the stairs and into the kitchen and drew a drink from the tap she had had to get the drink of water and as a person incipiently ill it was certainly wise to pause midway on the long steep flight of stairs to sit down and rest for a for as long as was necessary she had polished the library transom no later than yesterday doing it well as she did everything the spotless glass seemed to magnify the bloated body of mr leemy seated as always before his stingy fire it framed him as in a picture its oblong outline thrusting him into prominence even as it thrust everything outside its periphery into oblivion she could not see mama her head swayed and her eyes drooped shut for a moment when she opened them again mr leemy was hoisting himself from the chair with his canes he was standing and her view of him was cut off at the waist he braced himself with one cane and lifted the other and she still could not see mama but she could him see the slick wetness of his mouth his glazed eyes as he slashed with the cane at at whatever was there on the floor she could see the cane swing up and down jerkily faster and faster that should have been enough the thought that it must be that there could be nothing more after this that in surviving this she had survived all was her sole anchor in sanity during her remaining years in mr leemys house if it had been all perhaps but it wasnt there was one final bit of evidence in the damning case against man and this probably was the worst of all because it stripped all those years of meaning it handed out shame and ugliness exacted unquestioning submission and exchanged futility no time of peace no comfort and security all the sweeter for past sacrifice and hardship yes mama was mr leemys sole heir as he had promised she would be but his estate had never been the vast abundance that everyone supposed and at the time of his death it was worse than worthless he had lived it up as the saying is there were large unpaid bills even the house and its furnishings were mortgaged to the hilt she and mama had been allowed to move into an old tenant shack at the rear of the main house and the doctors warfield old will and young will the only people in town who had ever been nice to her and mama the doctors treated mama for nothing and gave her lucretia some afterschool work at their office and so she had managed to finish high school a few weeks before mama died that was undoubtedly all for the best as the doctors said mama was losing her mind there was something incurably wrong with her insides josephine stared at miss baker troubledly her brow puckered in anxious concern at the moment she would have given one of her unpaid weeks wages for some long john the conqueror root or better still a pinch of goofer dust if a person ever needed a sprinkling of goofer dust and needed it bad miss baker was undoubtedly it miss baker was plenty mean all right she was a pureevil eye but obviously no one who looked as miss baker was looking so poorlypale like some poor scaredsick chil could be responsible for her affliction plenty of folks had the evil eye put on em plain nice folks they were but someone made conjure against em and from then on and until the hex was removed well those folks was in a bad way rather gingerly josephine touched miss bakers arm she was mightily afraid but it was ones bounden duty to assist innocent sufferers from the evil eye she touched the nurses arm more firmly then gently grasped her by the elbow and lowered her to the stool you be all right she said you gonna be all right now miz baker you drink some nice hot coffee miss baker looked blankly down at the cup she took a scalding sip of coffee and her eyes began to clear very pleasant but it must be getting quite late she would have to get dressed and something something would have to be done with her hair it well it seemed to be pulling there at the back of her neck and it was pulling irritably she brushed at it her hand came down on josephines it almost struck the knife with which josephine had been about to remove a lock of hair the coffee cup dropped from her startled fingers and into her lap she jumped to her feet screaming and streaming what are you doing what were you doing to me nothin said josephine seeing that the eye had reassumed its wicked reign wasnt doin nothin she said backing away no maam not me you were too dont you suppose i what are you holding behind you me you mean me miz baker jothephine let me thee your handth josephine shrugged her lower lip pushed out in injured innocence she brought her hands around in front of her and held them out aw right she mumbled you like to see hans there they is just plain ol hans seems like to me but i aint arguin dont make me no mm i just soon that said miss baker her cheeks crimsoning will be juth about enough jothephine you were doing thumthing to i dont argue about nothin said josephine i show you my feets you want to see em all i ask is you stan right there sos at coffee runs down on your shoes stead of my floor an miss baker looked down at her ruined uniform she fled out of the kitchen and up the stairs sorrowfully for success had been in her grasp josephine reached behind her and removed the knife from its improvised holster of apron strings holding it to her mouth she breathed a cleansing film of moisture onto the blade and polished it against her bosom she took meat from the refrigerator and began slicing it for lunch josephine sighed her thoughts moving from the apparently hopeless project represented by miss baker to the incredible density of doctor murphys mind to the latest proof of that density the condition of susan kenfield that was somethin josephine chuckled sourly yes sir that was really somethin she wished ol mam had been with her peering out through the kitchen servingwindow when theyd brought miz kenfield in ol man or granny blue gum granny who was batblind and stonedeaf because it helped if you could see and hear but you didnt really have to it was mostly the smell that you went by that smell and how could folks say it wasnt there just because they couldnt smell it that didnt tell no lies josephine picked up a slice of meat stuffed it into her mouth and chewed reflectively maybe huhuh her head moved in a silent but positive negative theyd laugh at her didnt want her to laugh but they were always waiting for a chance to laugh at her so let em find out for themselves it sure wouldnt be long until they did find out any old time now miz kenfield would be poppin that baby bernie edmonds stepped back from the slightly opened door of the holcombs double room the thumb and forefinger of his right hand curved together in a symbol of success gone on by he grinned looks like he was headed for the terrace i thought you were a little brusque with him said john holcomb didnt you think so brother weell said gerald holcomb i suppose one might say bernie was unnecessarily firm but the young man has been succeeding reasonably well on his own we dont want to dull his incentive true oh very true brother said john and of course we had considerably more whiskey at the time we made our offer he chuckled and turned to gerald will you do the honors brother im afraid i havent enough left to divide a pleasure brother said gerald rising he undid the belt of his pajamas and let them drop to his knees a full pint of whiskey was fastened to the inside of his right thigh with a strip of adhesive tape he removed the tape measured half of the whiskey into the glasses which bernie had taken from beneath the bed and readjusted the bottle and his pajamas they toasted each other they were friends for the moment they were relaxed comfortable they were not three but one and defenses were unnecessary john holcomb lifted one plump buttock from his chair and rubbed it tenderly you get a shot in the tail yesterday brother from the nurse i mean did i said gerald what about you bernie huhuh bernie rolled his head doc took care of me ill tell you about that nurse he proceeded to tell them his opinion being that no shots should be taken from miss baker in a position which prevented one from watching her probably doesnt get enough he concluded one look at a mans ass and she loses control the brothers laughed they raised their glasses again and again each stole a glance at the remainder of his drink there was no thought in any of their minds of complaining to doctor murphy about nurse bakers roughness el healtho was far superior to any of the many other sanitariums they had patronized miss baker despite the occasional painfulness of her ministrations was far superior to any of the establishments previous nurses finally but foremost in importance was the fact that alcoholics can be even less choosy than beggars they seem to be born with an abundance of tolerance for the defects of others and they quickly acquire more they have to yes murmured john holcomb absently it must be very trying this dealing with drunks day in and out cant really blame a person for getting rough and tough i dont see why a really good man like doc stays in the game said gerald well bernie edmonds revolved the whiskey in his glass its a kind of personal thing with doc sort of a crusade you know you didnt know his father died of the booze no said the brothers thats right made quite an impression on doc and i cant say that i blame him the father he was a doctor too and a pretty good one but hed been going down hill a long time lost all his practice friends money and his wife had given up the ghost and died well so he got on this last big toot got the whole town down on him but good and wound up in jail they didnt know anything about alcoholism in those days of course he was just a dammed ornery drunk so into the jug he went until he snapped out of it no treatment no nothing hed been in four days when doc our boy that is fought and begged his way in and he made such a fuss that they finally called in a doctor too late if it hadnt been too late in the beginning doc says they gave him enough morphine to coldcock a cow and it didnt have any more effect than baking powder he went right on shaking shook himself to death figuratively speaking of course literally ruptured himself inside according to doc even unjointed a number of his bones well said john if doc says so its so he wouldnt waste time trying to scare an alcoholic its true all right doc was sore at me when he told me but i know it wasnt a scare yarn ive read of similar cases john said it was almost enough to make a man swear off reading bernie remarked that it was strange how talking could dry the membranes of a mans throat gerald lowered his pajamas again emptied the rest of the whiskey into their glasses and shoved the bottle under the bed they toasted each other as john lowered his drink his eyes met his brothers in tentative inquiry gerald nodded and took another small sip by the way bernie yeah how uh how are things going with you hows the job i dont said bernie think i have one cant say that i care really it was a pretty lousy job what uh john holcomb squirmed and suddenly grimaced with pain damn that woman anyhow uh brother and i dont want to offend you but if a small loan bernie laughed shortly you havent been very successful in offending me in that department but i guess not id rather not id rather you didnt tempt me oh come now said gerald whats a few dollars between what would i do with it said bernie what would i do with a few thousand the same thing ive always done not always bernie it seems like always no thanks very much holcombs but no thanks now if you can give me a job and i dont mean any old job the kind that doesnt matter whether you screw up or not and you know it doesnt matter so jesus he ploughed his fingers through his graywhite head how long its been since there was anything to do i cared about doing since i could feel important since i was any place where i didnt feel watched where even the janitor felt he had the right to smell my breath he gulped the rest of his drink shuddered and hastily lighted a cigarette he inhaled deeply exhaled laughed next week he said east lynne as i was about to say bernie said john brother and i would like very much to have you with us but its the agencys policy and no one regretted more than we the necessity to establish it its our policy never to employ alcoholics never no matter who they are wonderful chuckled bernie edmonds its not said gerald seriously its simply one of those circumstances such as you mentioned a moment ago which is a certain way regardless of whether it should be look at it this way we hire an alcoholic for a responsible position and he works out fine we hire a half a dozen and they work out fine but the seventh one the seventh does not in one day he loses us more and this is no exaggeration its happened more than we can make in a quarter he loses us more than the other six have earned for us and we never know when one of the other six or all of em will pull the same stunt we just cant take the chance brother and i ourselves never go near the office when were drinking never john nodded thats one reason well you see our position bernie if we cant trust ourselves a point concerning which there is not the slightest doubt how can we trust another alcoholic sure said bernie i was only kidding about the job i dont know what in hell id do around an agency wait a minute bernie gerald stood up brother and i feel very badly about this isnt there something we cant think of a thing said bernie why dont you try another book im sure if you can give us something to show around ten thousand words say and an outline we can get you an interesting advance bernie paused several seconds passed while the brothers watched him anxiously and then he shook his head what would i write about i dont do fiction im completely out of touch with the world scene anyone or any thing that could be built into a book no im afraid not think it over urged john dont be in too big a hurry to say no there must be some way is there some way said bernie to turn the clock back to about see you at lunch gentlemen he winked at them and shoulders thrown back carpet shoes slipslapping jauntily left the room jeff sloan had had a very bad morning it might not have seemed so to others but that has nothing to do with the case only the person affected has the right to judge the goodness or badness of his situation jeff would have described his as pretty damned lousy hed had one vitamin shot last night a vitamin shot and something to make him sleep that was all and well it was their place to see that he did take the antabuse wasnt it it was their place to keep him from drinking that was why he was paying thirty bucks a day if he had to do it himself why give them anything he had come here to get squared away and they werent doing a damned thing for him just keeping him here letting him louse around in a crummy old bathrobe he couldnt understand why this place had been recommended so highly why his employers had insisted on sending him here by god he couldnt understand it it wasnt as if there werent any other sanitariums for alcoholics there were plenty of em places that guaranteed to cure you of drinking and they didnt charge any thirty bucks a day either he pulled a chair back into an alcove for a brisk breeze was sweeping in from the ocean his robe drawn tightly around him he hunched down in the chair his normally goodhumored countenance almost laughably peevish he would have liked very much to obtain his clothes and check out of el healtho but to do so was impractical if not impossible his employers would doubtless be phoning to inquire about his condition and if he wasnt here if he was sufficiently recovered to leave here theyd expect him back on the job he wasnt quite up to that yet moreover doctor murphy quite likely would refuse to release him he pondered this last probability phrasing it mentally as a situation in which they locked you up in jail and charged you for staying there could they get away with it maybe maybe not legally but you werent in a very good position to kick up a fuss certainly insisting on his release should not be done except in an extremity the whiskey was dying in him black doubts a fearful sense of insecurity he had never known before edged into his mind was he really as good at his job as hed boasted was he any good at all or were they just keeping him on out of pity he laughed impatiently irritably oh hell everyone knew what jeff sloan could do ask anyone in the trade and but could he keep on doing it what would he do if he couldnt hed never done anything else he wasnt a copywriter or an artist or an accountant or anything like that all he knew was how to get his teeth into an idea and give it the old push to throw it into em and make em like it and and he sure hadnt gone over very big around here first the doc had brushed him off and then bernie and the holcombs and that could have been a brushoff from the kenfield dame she could have heard him coming and pulled the sick act to duck him she and the general both something might have been said like well watch out for that sloan character hell bore you in spades jeff mopped his forehead with the sleeve of his robe this was crazy he was just feeling low he was making a lot out of nothing the thing to do was was well why not what hed thought about this morning murphy acted like one of those dontgiveadamn guys like he didnt care whether school kept or not and a man like that was a good man to talk deal to if he could just pin him down long enough to make a proposition get him to set a figure and then do a little talking and phoning around as soon as he got out of here well that would show em it would show murphy if but the alcoholics depressed mood pulls him two ways while it insists that great deeds must be done by way of proving himself it insidiously resists his doing them it tells him simultaneously that he must and cant that he is certain to fail but must succeed it is a maddening sensation jeff to whom it was new and who was undergoing a relatively light form of it was almost at the point of yelling when rufus came upon him rufus had observed him from a small staircase window noting with satisfaction that the alcove in which jeff was sitting would prevent his being seen from almost every other point in the house such opportunities seldom came rufus way and he promptly took advantage of this one mr sloan i believe he said with such crispness as he was capable of how are you feeling suh why uh jeff looked at him uncertainly and halfrose from his chair why all right i guess sit still please and kinly lean back rufus pulled the stethoscope from his pocket adjusted the earpieces and slid the detector inside jeffs pajamas he listened gravely his eyes professionally serious as they stared into jeffs he stood back at last and returned the stethoscope to his pocket his pursed lips and drawntogether brows obviously indicative of disconcerting knowledge well jeff laughed nervously your heart always been like that said rufus like like what theres never been anything wrong with my heart that i know of rufus shook his head searching for some safe but authentic temporization well now o course it could be simple sympathetic a reaction to some other condition kinly open your mouth suh jeff opened his mouth he was a little puzzled he had thought rufus only a flunky about the place a waiter and man of all work yet here he was assuming the functions of a doctor would they have an interne around such a place everything about this place was cockeyed if this guy didnt seem to act quite right and jeff couldnt say why he didnt seem to well it was only natural rufus looked down at him frowning stroking his chin with one hand magine youre pretty constipated arent you suh he said hopefully not so you could notice it said jeff magine your head aches pretty bad dont it well yes but look now uh jeff hesitated for a doctor this bird was a little rough in the english department but stand up please but if you dont mind id up said rufus firmly jeff sloan stood up rufus placed a hamlike hand against each side of his head and began to move them in a gentle pushpull motion feels better dont it suh makes it feel kinda nice an easy jeff his head wobbling from side to side backward and forward agreed that it did feel better rufus hands pressed tighter their motion grew faster jus relax he said jus let it go an i give you a justment he gave a sudden quick jerk there was a loud pop from the immediate vicinity of jeff sloans neck he yelled pulled violently out of rufus grasp and fell back against the house god almighty he gasped his head bent over and slightly to the front of his left shoulder yyouve broken my neck no ssuh no i aint suh a premonition of impending disaster set rufus insides atremble you jus aint let me finish the justment suh ats all i give it one more teenyweensie twist an jesus he grunted how stupid can a guy get im goddam lucky i got a head on my neck at all jeff glared at him his head poised at a ludicrous angle he stamped off the terrace and into the house boy hed had it all he needed now was to have some of these jokers give him the horse laugh fortunately for the physical welfare of anyone who might have encountered him as well as his pride he arrived at his room unobserved he closed the door placed a chair against it and sank down on the bed he started to lie back and a sharp twinge brought him suddenly upright he tried again on his side he tried it on the other side he tried it on his stomach groaning a little desperate he sat up again he managed to light a cigarette and smoked moodily moving the cigarette back and forth to his lips with a wide sweeping motion he flung it to the floor cursing pushed himself up off the bed and went into the bathroom god he groaned staring at his lopsidedness in the bathroom mirror why couldnt he have seen that the guy was a screwball he knew he was only a flunky knew he must be and yet by god hed gone right ahead and he started to turn on the water then saw that a hand towel was lying in the sink he picked it up and huh he gasped and his head snapped up in surprise his neck popped again and he grunted out an ouch and then he was looking into the mirror again moving his head to and fro laughing in sheer delight it was all right the damned thing had slipped back into place that little jump hed given when hed seen what was in the sink what do you know he said tenderly and lifted it up baby you are a life saver he sniffed it he sipped cautiously he drank and said whuff and wow a hundred proof by gosh a full tumbler better than half a pint of hundred proof whiskey he drank again the why of the miracle brushed aside in the urgent need to enjoy it to hell with why who cared about why it wasnt some kind of crappy trick it wasnt doped up it was real honesttohannah whiskey drinkin whiskey and he could feel the old lead flowing back into his pencil already a life saver murmured jeff and he meant it literally he sipped at the whiskey until the glass was approximately twothirds full then he dripped water into it until the level reached the top again he took another sip held it in his mouth a moment savoring it judiciously he nodded with satisfaction very shrewd he thought congratulating himself on the discovery unaware that the trick was the oldest in the alcoholics repertoire you could get that highproof taste in your mouth then cut your drink back to its original size and it was almost impossible to tell that it had been cut within reasonable limits you could have your whiskey and drink it too he carried the glass into the bedroom pushed the chair more tightly against the door and sat down on the bed again he sipped and smoked selfconfidence and optimism surging through his body in a nervewarming lilting tide that was one thing about going without a drink for a while when you did get one it really did you some good he grinned unconsciously out of sheer high spirits boy he thought was i moaning low and not a reason in the world for it either no one had tried to brush him off bernie and those other guys were all right they must have put this whiskey over here for him maybe he ought to step over there and but suppose they hadnt done it suppose he should thank them and well aside from the fact that he didnt have enough to share that he damned well wasnt going to share it would be kind of embarrassing they might think he was needling them about the way theyd acted if they hadnt given it to him come to think of it hadnt bernie mentioned the brand the holcombs had he had and that brand wasnt hundred proof this stuff now this must if he knew anything at all about whiskey be some of the sanitariums stuff he hesitated letting his fingers loosen a little on the glass and faintly from the dining room came the tinkle of the luncheon chimes he relaxed his grip a little more and the glass slipped slightly and abruptly he tightened his fingers again and jerked the whiskey up to his mouth and took a generous guip there was one good drink left a little less than a third of a glass jeff put it under the bed against the inside of one of the legs he jerked the chair away from the door staggered and righted himself and went out doctor murphy always ate with his patients those of them at least who were able to get to the dining room it was often a nuisance to do so nervewracking and timeconsuming but he felt that it was necessary and worth the effort much could be discovered about the condition of a patient by his appetite or lack of it and his manner of eating also by eating with them he could still any alcoholic suspicions that he looked down on them or was enjoying better food than they with the exception of susan kenfield and of course humphrey van twyne they were all at the table today even the general was there very erect and urbane and so shaky that he could hardly get a spoonful of soup to his mouth doc murphy studied him from the corner of his eye he slipped something into rufus hand and whispered to him a minute later the generals coffee cup was removed and another set before him he drank and his tremblings quieted and he began to eat doc sighed silently it was all wrong it was murder but you had to choose slow murder or quick starvation when a man had only one thing to live for bad though it might be how could you strip him of it completely he dropped the problem and moved on to another everpresent and always hateful money mentally and detesting himself for doing it he began to add and subtract divide and multiply to figure over and over always arriving at the same hopeless result the general nothing next to nothing no more than enough to take care of his medicines bernie edmonds nothing susan kenfield not now suzy was always broke and abysmally in debt after a binge not now and now was all that counted the holcombs yes right on the dot they would even be good for a generous loan which of course he couldnt ask for or accept you couldnt be in debt to an alcoholic whom you had to treat inevitably the debt would influence the treatment jeff sloane yes van twyne doctor murphys calculations ceased abruptly he caught rufus attention and whispered to him again rufus who had been hovering about jeff sloan with a mixture of curiosity and relief looked aghast me doctuh you mean you want me to feed at yes said doctor murphy whats the matter you were anxious enough to fool around up there yesterday yes suh but i wasnt foolin around his mouth doc grimaced go on now hes the same as a child perfectly harmless how many times do i have to tell you that yes suh you tell me that but do you tell him miss baker started to rise from her chair i can do it doctor im all rufus can do it ive got some case reports i want you to type up but i can do that and rufus snapped doctor murphy move yes suh right away after a while suh jus soon as i take care all you josephine can do anything thats left to do now get moving rufus moved his great shoulders slumped in dejection miss baker murmured an inaudible word of apology and left the table frowning doc watched her enter the areaway to his office he hadnt acted very subtly in the matter but hed had to head her off at any rate there wasnt much sense in being circuitous now when he was going to have to go straight to the mark this afternoon he lighted a cigarette and picked up his coffee cup glanced casually around the table as he smoked and sipped the holcombs had eaten almost nothing which must mean that they were out of whiskey and were retaining their inner glow as long as possible by refraining from eating bernie had eaten most of his soup and part of a sandwich which must mean since the holcombs had been his source of whiskey that he was resigned to sobering up and getting the agony over with he was trying to face up to his problem doc was rather pleased with bernie bernie could have remained alcoholically eased for several hours yet but he had chosen to square away with reality now necessity of course had helped to dictate the choice what he would do if he got hold of more whiskey was another matter but he would get no more the holcombs would get no more jeff sloan sloan had taken a few spoonfuls of soup then sat back and begun smoking he was sweating and his face was flushed but otherwise he seemed at ease there was a sureness about his movements a kind of arrogant geniality in his manner which was strangely incompatible in a man who had mixed whiskey with the most violent of alcoholallergy compounds strange incredible but alcoholic behavior had a way of being incredible sloan was a superegoist hed keep going as long as he was able to stand up which couldnt of course be much longer certainly he couldnt have had any more whiskey regardless of his willtoresist a very little more and hed be dead or as near death as a man could be without dying how hed managed to get away with what he had with every sip turning into poison how he could have made the attempt to move in on the holcombs how a man could fight and beg for something that was killing him doc put down his coffee cup and turned slightly in his chair how are you feeling sloan he said im feeling all right said jeff how are you feeling murphy the holcombs turned as a unit and stared at him bernie frowned and the general looked a little shocked whats the matter jeffs voice rang loud through the room he didnt call me mister did he didnt say howre ya jeff did he thats right said doc quickly im sorry youre sure youre feeling all right jeff dont you think youd better make a stab at your lunch no said jeff well doc laid his napkin on the table if you gentlemen will excuse me wait a minute said jeff i want to talk to you uhhuh well im afraid i dont want any whiskey thats all you think about isnt it all you think i think about this is business want to talk a little business i see in that case wed better go into my office hadnt we not necessary just want to know what youll take for this place cash on the barrelhead doctor murphy forced a laugh got a buyer for me well thanks but im afraid i couldnt sell it after all what would i do if i didnt have a place for you gentlemen to visit me you mean said jeff what would you do for another gravy train he looked around the table grinning pleased with his shrewdness and gradually the grin stiffened and disappeared just a statement of fact he said surlily manner of speaking couldnt swing it if it wasnt a good deal he waited he went on again stubbornly sullenly well it is couldnt help but be figure it out yourselves not kicking glad it is that way cant make money where there isnt any to make doc can get you guys guys like us to shell out fifty bucks a day instead o thirty im all for it its got to be an a racket or i couldnt thats right said doctor murphy bernie will you see the general back to his room i want him to lie down a while now wait a minute said jeff im talk yes said bernie lets wait and see what else mr sloan has to say go right ahead mr sloan youre doing me a lot of good a little more of your babble and ill be about ready to go on the wagon bbut jeff kicked back his chair his face suddenly livid think im drunk do you well let me i hope you are said bernie i dont see how you could be but i hope so id hate to think that you were so goddam imbecilic as to believe that dammit tell him doc bernies voice choked up with disgust how many of us do you ever get any dough out of how long has it been since i paid you anything bernie snapped doc icily you have no right to then ill tell him i but jeff sloan was not there to tell he had left the table he was leaving the room sick sober with shame hating himself hating and despising them as they must hate and despise him why had they let him go on why hadnt they shut him up before he had to hate them to move the smothering shroud of hatred from himself to them he closed the door of his room behind him and almost snatched the drink from under the bed god hed have to get out of here some way get to a bar get back to the apartment with a fifth if he could just get out of here hed show em a the door crashed open the drink sailed from his hand and doctor murphy was gripping him by the shoulders shaking him yelling at him how much how much have you had nnot vvery m jeff couldnt get the words out not with his teeth rattling like castanets doc released his shoulders and grabbed his left arm he jerked up the sleeve and pressed a thumb against his pulse dont get excited now take it easy just tell me how much how why damn you sloan he breathed ive been half off my rocker worrying about you youve had me going around in circles wondering how in the hell you were doing it you took five years off my life just now and by god he roared i ought to murder you sloan and then he dropped down on the bed his head buried in his hands and rocked and whooped with laughter got a cigarette on you he said jeff sloan gave him one hastily he struck a match and held it thanks doc puffed out a cloud of smoke you know id have sworn you took that pill i was sure the boys hadnt given you anything to drink well jeff hesitated more than anything else he wanted to play square with doc to do nothing that would endanger this wonderful friendliness that had reached down to pull him from outer darkness but it would sound so funny saying hed found the whiskey in the sink and he couldnt be positive that the boys hadnt well let it go said doc sit down how are you feeling by now like to have a good big shot gosh you mean i jeff sat down i uh guess not sure you would said doc you feel like you made a horrible horses ass of yourself which you did of courseand you want a drink to forget it well thats all right want it just dont take it incidentally whats your attitude toward the booze now still think you can handle it well i it certainly hit me hard this time the little bit i had this morning why doc i can ive polished off a couple of pints in an youll never be able to do it again said doctor murphy or maybe i should say youd better not do it unless youre prepared to face much worse situations than you created a while ago youve crossed the line as we say in alcoholic circles youve lost your license to drink from now on every drink you take will affect you a little worse than the last one i tell you that bernie or the holcombs or the general or any other alcoholic will tell you the same thing why do they drink then said jeff that i dont know i can point to certain things which are factors in their drinking but i cant answer the basic questions i can tell you this its ten times harder for a man bernies age to stop drinking than it would be for you tell me why do you want to drink anyway why jeff shook his head i dont know exactly never thought much about it theres a lot of drinking in my line of work and well you get all keyed up and cant let down or you need a little lift when no said doc those are excuses theyre not the reason theres only one reason any alcoholic ever drinks because hes afraid i know i seem to be contradicting myself there i do know why bernie and the others keep on drinking but i dont know the why of that why what makes them afraid that is why they keep on trying to bolster their courage with whiskey when it does nothing for them any more and does so much against them i dont know doc said jeff carefully not bragging but im considered a i know but whatever youre considered ironnerved a pinchhitter a guy who knocks em cold and wraps em up it isnt enough for you youre afraid youve got to keep showing people the more you show em the more you have to and when you cant well maybe no maybe jeff youre that way what you have to do is accept the fact and accept yourself as you are right now your fears are illusory they have no actual basis for existence but if you keep on drinking youll have very real cause for fear youll be afraid to meet people afraid theyll snub you or talk about you your work will start slipping and the more it slips the greater the tendency for it to keep slipping in short youll not only think youre a bum but youll be one and with all respect to my patients im not using the word too loosely jeff grinned halfheartedly i dont doubt you at all doc i know i certainly acted pretty stupid but yes well its i dont mean that im any stronger or better than these other fellows but well i dont think my own case is quite the i see said doc quietly fighting down a wild desire to laugh or weep it hadnt done any good it never did they were intelligent people and you laid it on the line for em and they listened and nodded and threw in a word now and then and when you were through i see he repeated bernie edmonds they didnt come any better than bernie and the general and the holcombs you know who they are all big men smart men and they cant handle it but you can well now jeff squirmed i didnt say that doc i know ill certainly have to watch myself from now on be doggone careful when i drink but but youre not an alcoholic a real alcoholic youve just been drinking too much and all you have to do is cut down on it well you could be right ill have your clothes brought back to you and you can leave leave jeff sat up sharply bbut i am a little shaky yet doc oh you can fix that said doctor murphy put a few stiff ones under your belt just enough to get straightened out on you know and youll be all right but i want you to do me a little favor before you go ive got a problem i want to discuss with you in confidence the strictest confidence understand and get your advice on ive been needing to talk it over with someone but theres no one here but these alcoholics and he shrugged deprecatingly and stood up jeff also arose slowly his eyes searching the doctors face look doc im not i dont think ive made myself exactly clear sure you have youre not an alcoholic and i need to talk this over with a nonalcoholic someone whose advice will be unprejudiced and dependable you dont mind helping me out do you itll only take a few minutes and then you can leave but jeff still hesitated trying to discover some vestige of irony in the doctors countenance or words there seemed to be none for that matter there may well have been none certainly doctor murphy knew the futility of trying to convince a man by any method against his will all right doc said jeff i dont know ill explain said the doctor and he led the way out of the room and up the stairs they reached the heavy door of room four and doc pushed the door swung open and they stepped in and oh my god he groaned humphrey van twyne iii still lay motionless in his cocoon of winding sheets raised slightly off the horizontal now by the tilting upward of the table slab on the far side of the table the side furthest from the door was a small serving stand which rufus was facing his back to humphrey van twyne the index finger of his left hand was clenched tightly between van twynes teeth doctor murphy took in the component parts of the picture in one swift glance obviously rufus had turned toward the serving stand while he was still giving van twyne a bite of food and van twyne had snapped down on his finger thus holding his hand behind him holding him helpless the big negro was trembling with strain and fear doc stepped swiftly around in front of him looked reassuringly into the ashen face have you loose in a moment he whispered how bad has he got you into the flesh dddont think sso suh i jjust rrreachin ovah sure might have happened to anyone and you handled it just right now just hang on and doc turned wheeled around jeff standing wideeyed and pale and looked down into van twynes unwinking idiots eyes he raised a hand dropped it again useless to pinch his nostrils shut he could still breathe through his mouth and his instinctive animal reaction to a seeming attack would be to clamp down on that finger doctor murphy raised his hand again his left one and laid it gently against van twynes head he began stroking the bandages softly soothingly good boy he murmured good fine nice good boy good good good rufus move back this way as far as you can but dont move your finger good nice fine good good good boy docs hand moved up to van twynes forehead rested there a moment caressingly and slid slowly downward until it was lying over the mans eyes good good boy sleepybye good boy nice fine good sleepy rufus a fine good rufus this good good boy has all right rufus rufus pulled his finger slid free and he staggered forward and went down on his knees doc helped him to his feet stood with an arm hugging the negros shoulders as he nodded to jeff sloan rufus showed a great deal of intelligence there he said quietly he analyzed his problem realized that it was something requiring outside help hed rather have done without it naturally hed made a mistake and wound up in an embarrassing and painful position but he knew what had to be done and he did it if he hadnt if hed refused to face the facts and wait for help hed have lost a finger we might even have found him dead up here bled to death doc examined the finger and saw that the skin while deeply toothmarked was unbroken he advised antiseptic and a hotwater immersion helped rufus through the door with his tray and serving stand and turned back to jeff that rufus be grinned fondly i blow my top with him on the average of twice a day but i wouldnt trade him for any two people ive got he may screw things up but he never lets you down he has so very little but he pours it all out for you and scrapes his insides for more if you and i did as much with what we have our opportunities and knowledge and backgrounds well doc shrugged and drew jeff closer to the table this is it he said this is what i wanted to talk to you about jeffs gaze veered away from the expressionless white face its eyes again wide in an unblinking unseeing stare his voice was a barely audible whisper wwho is ithe i think you must have heard of him hes been out of circulation for some time but im sure you must have heard of him humphrey van twyne iii him but yeah said jeff his lips curling ive heard of that crum mmmm you think he was responsible for what he did then he was the way he was because he liked it that way he was just one of the bad guys as a sevenyearold would say of a movie villain well all i know is jeff colored i guess maybe he wasnt he wasnt mr van twyne here was simply an alcoholic who refused to admit his malady and who had unlimited funds for indulging it ever think how nice it would be when you had a hangover if you didnt have to go to work if you could call up a dame say and keep the party going if you could tell the whole world where to get off and give it a kick in the ass if it didnt move fast enough well be glad you werent able to jeff swallowed his eyes drawn unwillingly to the thing on the table is he crazy oh no being crazy presumes an intelligence and van twyne hasnt any he probably retains some memory of adult life but its doubtful that he relates it to himself generally speaking hes on the mental level of an infant why jeff nodded why do you keep him like that is he dangerous somewhat a baby will bite and strike and a baby of this size could be rather painful but the danger is mainly to himself you know might masturbate himself raw or eat his own excrement things of that kind jeff shook his head what are you going to do with him that said doctor murphy is what i wanted to ask you about what to do he began to talk outlining the story of humphrey van twyne and the facts of his own dilemma he spoke calmly almost casually neither ornamenting nor understating the awesome and terrifying facets of the situation talking as though the responsibility were not his but jeffs and jeff listened moistening his lips now and then fine beads of sweat oozing through the pores of his forehead well thats it doc concluded and he glanced down into van twynes inscrutable face it would be odd if he understood any of that wouldnt it of course he hasnt had much sayso about his own movements for quite a while but it would still seem strange hearing yourself discussed and disposed of and having no voice in the matter jeff didnt seem to have heard him he spoke stubbornly a little querulously hes got nothing to do with me hell hes one guy in a million there isnt a man in a million whod wind up in this spot thats right doc agreed very few alcoholics are able to hand it out as long as humphrey did they get it handed back to em in a way that stops the dishingout process someone kicks their brains out or they get pulled in for drunkdriving or manslaughter or robbery they burn themselves up in their beds or starve or freeze in some doorway or perhaps they wind up in a nut house but im afraid youve got me wrong jeff im not trying to frighten you ill bet jeff grinned weakly i mean it alcoholics cant be frightened away from drinking their own fear of self until they can recognize it for the baseless and unreasonable thing it is is much greater than their fear of anything else no you cant frighten em and since youre not one since youre not immediately concerned with the disease it would be less than pointless to try to frighten you i brought you up here for just one reason to get your idea on what i should do well jeff hesitated theres really no other way none and i havent any more time oh id be allowed to hang on a few days and wind things up but practically speaking this is my last day unless ill have to make my decision by late afternoon get the money by then or ill be out of business and youre sure you cant do anything for this guy if how could i its by no means certain that the men who operated on him specialists can do much for him the question is ethicalities aside should he have that chance or should my patients youve only met a few of the total have a chance franidy i dont seem to have accomplished much with them im just about as far from the answer to alcoholism as i was in the beginning but what makes you so sure doc what said doc irritably ive just got through explaining that he broke off looking at jeff and jeff grinned back at him grinned in a way that was at once baffled and serious and glad you know something doc im never going to take another drink as long as i live doc blinked and his mouth twisted wryly well naturally im glad you recognize the danger but if i had a dollar for every alcoholic who told me but im not going to said jeff whether im an alcoholic or not well i guess i dont like that word very much so lets just say im a guy who cant drink and isnt going to drink docs heart began to pound a great smile spread over his bony face just one man just to pull one of them back to know that it hadnt all been wasted but if you could do it with one what made you change your mind jeff i dont know i know in a way but i cant quite put it into words not now anyway maybe i youre not going to make me leave this afternoon youre damned right im not vowed doctor murphy you and i have some more talking to do well i think id be all right if i left but i want a chance to talk to the boys bernie and the general fix things up with them for the way i acted at lunch doc started to nod he caught himself he had to be sure as sure as it was possible to be well i dont know about that he said after all bernie was pretty insulting to you they all acted pretty lousy for that matter letting you make a fool of yourself and then bawling you out or giving you the silent treatment why should you jeff laughed openly you know damned well i should if i didnt id be all hot and bothered and worried the same way ive been a hundred other times when docs hand came down on his back with a resounding whack jeff if you dont make it then it cant be made if you dont do it i think ill ill make it said jeff i believe you will by god i believe you will now lets get out of here and jeff hesitated what about him doc he said and docs face went blank for a moment oh be said slow yeah were you leveling with me did you really expect me to tell you what to do i i dont know said doctor murphy but as long as i did ask you i dont know doc i god i wouldnt want to say i mean whatever you yes said doc i know what you mean the several case reports had been typed and laid on his desk but miss baker was still sitting at the small typewriting stand when doctor murphy entered his office she sat very erect her small whiteshod feet squarely on the floor her hands folded neatly in her lap she looked a little like a shy child in a strange house placed in one spot and afraid to move out of it doc sat down at his desk and looked through the reports pretended rather to look through them he already knew their context by heart he knew that miss bakers letterperfect typing would need no checking what he did not know was how to begin with her he looked up at last nervously trying to sound informal and jovial and succeeding largely in sounding brusque well he said no use in sitting there in the corner by yourself miss baker was on her feet instantly then she stood looking at him politely waiting for further directions over here said doctor murphy i want to talk to you miss baker yeth thir said miss baker oh im sorry sir now lets not make a project out of it said doc gruffly just sit down and uh relax miss baker sat down in the chair at the side of his desk but she did not appear to relax she sat as she had at the typewriter starch stiff hands folded in her lap her neat sweet features fixed in a small smile of polite wariness now nurse he said i think were considerably overdue for a talk the situation here has been uh rather unsettled and it still is very unsettled so i felt that if we were going to get certain matters cleared up make any attempt to clear them up wed better be getting started yeth i mean say it said doctor murphy i dont expect you to overcome a lifelong trait in a few hours just spit it out any way it comes to your mouth and then leave it lay dont keep correcting yourself miss baker murmured yeth thir doc said i dont mean to be uh and miss baker said yeth thir and he scowled and fumbled for a cigarette he lighted it halfway down its length and cursed under his breath he took one puff and ground it out in the ash tray grinding it into the metal until it was almost pulverized his eyes strayed from the tray and as though moved by an unseen magnet came to rest on miss bakers knees at the exact spot where her knees were exposed by the split of her uniform absently they moved up the uniform exploring small pinkrevealing gaps along the way they moved on and up then paused again pitched temporary camp in the halfhidden environs of two creamandpeaches gently undulant mounds they moved up they were jerked up suddenly by another pair of eyes the owner of the eyes raised her hands from her lap and resecured the neckline of her uniform there was prim reproof in the gesture fear and reproof yet with it something else a kind of unconscious invitation a sort of mocking selfassurance thats settled it said and so are you that takes care of everything now miss baker said doctor murphy as i was about to say yeth thir miss baker slowly crossed her legs oh she knew all right she was scared out of her pants but she knew what she had and she was throwing it out at him knowing damned well that he couldnt do anything any more than than hed ever done anything any more than he could have given that dogbeater what he needed or that waiter or that other nurse well she had his number all right she knew she could slap him silly with it and there wasnt a goddam thing he could do about it you could lose your license for a hell of a lot less than that yeth doctor yes said doctor murphy as i was saying im rather short on time and theres every likelihood that im going to have even less so id like to get right to the point i want to know something about you your background your associates your uh i thee well i believe there ithnt much to add to the information ive already given you i thats not what i mean im talking about your personal life you were an only child kept pretty close to home were you yeth miss baker nodded you might thay i was how did you get along with such childhood contacts as you had were you reasonably wellliked did you feel at ease accepted miss baker hesitated she moved her head in a motion that indicated both yes and no well thuch friends as i had doctor i see said doctor murphy and those friends i suppose included boys well ath many boyth ath girlth uhhuh said doc and his eyes narrowed slightly no friends at all and was that her choice or theirs had she being unable to accept the company of males tried to rationalize the abnormality by also rejecting females well skip it hit the center of the target and the rest would crumble you had no childhood sweethearts miss baker no thit have you ever had a date with a young man no thir why not well i juth well i thuppoth there wath juth never anyone i cared oh come now said doctor murphy we cant be too exacting in these things people who might not appear too prepossessing at first glance can be very attractive when you get to know them better all you have to do is give them a chance to let you like them there was a small but very disconcerting smile on the rosepink lips she shifted a little in the chair her legs still crossed absently arching her breasts smoothing the uniform over them before she settled down again yeth doctor yes said doctor murphy youre not living a normal life because youre not well when we suppress and ignore our normal instincts too long they become twisted permanently twisted if we dont take decisive counteraction youre young you wont have too much of a job on your hands if you tackle it now so tackle it miss baker and dont lose any time about it will you do that well juth how do you mean doctor men you know what a man is dont you doctor murphy tapped himself on the chest im one believe it or not well what do you say then lets get started on the job huh will you do that well i hardly know how it doesnt matter about hows or whys just make yourself available get out to a show or a lecture or some such thing and if you handle yourself right dont act standoffish or cold or frightened well the rest will take care of itself youll be surprised how easy it will be will you try it just once even though it does go against your grain do it for my sake well miss baker hesitated i gueth i could good thats the spirit what time when would you like to go doctor oh doctor murphy shrugged why dont youwhat when would i like to yeth thir said miss baker demurely you did thay leth didnt you you thaid i should do it for your why you doc stammered you know damned good and well i his mouth snapped shut tightened into a thin white line it was always this way by god miss baker said doctor murphy uncross your legs well said miss baker and her own mouth snapped shut ill have you know youll do what i tell you thats what youll do youll sit there until im through talking to you and you will not try any more of the nonsense you pulled a moment ago do you understand me miss baker she was frightened shamed on the point of tears but when there is nothing to do but fight that is what you do i understhand ive taken just about all im going oh no you havent said doctor murphy grimly you havent begun to why did you lie to me about jeff sloan why did you let me go on thinking hed taken that antabuse pretend that he was reacting to it when you knew damned well that he hadnt and wasnt i didnt thay he you did it by implication you did it deliberately to make me worry to give me some trouble as if i didnt have enough already and why did you do that ill tell you because of what youd done you knew i knew about it and you were afraid all hell was going to pop so you screwed me up at what you thought would be your last opportunity i will not said miss baker starting to rise i will not lithen to thuch vulgar so im vulgar am i well let me tell you what you are a dirty sneaky little sadist binding that poor helpless bastards scrotum up in the sheets oh yes you did id hate to think what the poor devil went through before judson spotted the trouble and what were you doing in there this morning something goddam rotten to make him yell like that good god girl you cant go on this way the longer you keep at it the worse youll get sooner or later youll do something that yyou you having the unsthpeakable nerve to lecture me a whithkey doctor a a racketeer now wait a minute doc was outraged by the unfairness of the attack why damn you you know i dontyou know this is the one sanitarium where an alcoholic can oh yeth youre an angel you are miss bakers eyes sparkled with malicious triumph well what about thith poor mr van twyne that youre tho contherned about thinth when doth a prefrontal lobotomy cathe belong in a plathe like thith where do you get off at shut up said doctor murphy i will not thut up you tharted thith now im going to to shut up said the doctor now immediately because if you do not my dear lucretia he tapped her slowly on the knee emphasizing each word am going to wallop that sadistic little ass of yours so hard you wont be able to sit down for the next six weeks miss baker gasped yyou big six weeks lucretia said doctor murphy and dont think i wont love doing it now you were about to say something miss baker wasnt about to apparently she sat lips compressed breast rising and falling in frustrated fury doc nodded satisfied and turned to his desk he wrote out a check and tossed it into her lap you didnt resign he said i fired you now pack up your duds and get out of here and dont take too much time or ill give you some assistance stretched out on the office couch doctor murphy opened one reluctant eye and glanced at his wristwatch after two oclock less than three hours a little more than two hours and a half before the van twynes physician doctor perthborg would arrive before his decision would have to be made and he was as uncertain as to what that decision should be as he had ever been he just hadnt had time to think it through there seemed never to be time to think anything through doc sighed and swung his feet to the floor sat with his elbows on knees staring glumly at the carpet judson had the right idea all right not to live in the place to have certain times for talking and administering to the patients and then barring emergencies to keep to yourself con serve your energies for major problems that was the idea dont chase all to hell over everywhere dissipating your time on a thousand and one things which if they needed taking care of at all could just as well be handled by someone else the trouble doc decided entering a new complaint in the case of murphy vs murphy was that he was a goddam knowitall he thought he knew everything and that no one else knew anything had to go around sticking his nose in the job sniffing and scowling and worrying scolding and asking questions getting everyone so mixed up they couldnt find their ass with both hands well if he did decide to hold on here there was going to be one hell of a change hed make a round of the patients in the morning and another in the evening meals would be served at certain hours and no others and if they didnt eat then they could damn said doctor murphy suddenly and he leaped up and strode into the kitchen josephine was seated at the kitchen worktable sipping a cup of coffee before beginning the job of preparing dinner her face became noticeably glum at the doctors appearance and her greeting was as barren of enthusiasm as a pawnbroker examining a dimestore ring what you she said want now nothing much doc forced a laugh nothing at all really just a little milk toast and some softscrambled eggs better fry em in butter and put just a dash of cayenne in them and oh yes a pot of hot tea josephine grunted nothin at all she mumbled aint nothin really at all at aint who it for anyway miss kenfield said doc and hesitated by the way would you mind taking it to her rufus has his hands full with the men patients i got my hands full too said josephine how come miz baker don do it miss baker isnt with us any more shes getting ready to leave now she gettin ready to leave now josephine displayed interest at last how come she do at never mind if youll just you fire her i bet said josephine how come you got to do it you got to do it right now couldnt wait no little while i could not said doctor murphy and i will not discuss it now please please fix miss kenfields lunch and take it to her she aint goin to eat it nohow please said doc just this once please do what i ask you without arguing about it aint arguin said josephine just tellin you she aint goin eat it you want to do at woman a favor doctuh you give her nice big hot toddy hee hee she cackled at fix her up doctor murphy glowered helplessly all right he said i give up just forget the whole thing i should have known better than to ask ive never known it to fail by god by christ in heaven ive never known it to fail i ask you for some simple little thing and what you cussin an fussin about said i was goin to do it said josephine well do it then aint no hurry said josephine she ain goin to eat it nohow doc turned and stamped out of the kitchen josephines shoulders shook with impish silent laughter then sobering she looked thoughtfully up at the ceiling she was relieved in a way that miss baker was departing but in another sense troubled and saddened by the fact she knew the regret that all conscientious people know when they have left unaccomplished some necessary task which they and they alone are capable of accomplishing she had tried of course but her effort upon reflection appeared pitifully weak in any event tryin wasnt doin and miss baker unwitting and innocent handmaiden to the evil eye stood in imperative need of having something done about her once she left here nothing could rather would be done because no one would know they didnt have the gift of knowin so miss baker would continue in her innocently evil way inevitably suffering the consequences of the wickedness which she could not help but commit and it all could have been avoided so easily it might josephine decided resolutely still be avoided she arose from the table plodded across the floor to the kitchen cabinet and opened a utensil drawer scanning its contents thoughtfully she selected a razoredged paringknife and a small hardwood potato masher she hefted the last implement hesitated frowning then shrugged and dropped it and the knife into the capacious pockets of her apron meanwhile doctor murphy was completing a restless tour of the sanitarium he had found the generals room empty also jeff sloans and bernie edmonds but judging by the murmur of voices muted by the closed door of the holcombs double room they were all in there together and they seemed to be having a very good time for themselves it was a circumstance ordinarily to be regarded with considerable suspicion but doc could think of no cause for alarm in the present case it was only natural that jeff having offended them all at luncheon would be gathered into the group with alcoholic wholeheartedness once he had apologized they never did anything by halfstages these alcoholics hypersensitive themselves they would not be content with a mere acceptance of jeffs apologies they would be in there now doubtless reciting terrible social misadventures of their own proving that jeffs faux pas was nothing at all by comparison and it was good for them all to be together like this so long as they didnt have any whiskey as they naturally didnt it helped to pass the time the friendly enemy of alcoholics it took their mind off of drinking anyway well jeff wouldnt be drinking he wouldnt be in a group that was drinking doc fidgeted indecisively then faintly he heard a laugh and he grinned with relief and proceeded down the hall rufus there wasnt another person in the world who laughed like that with rufus and jeff in there everything was bound to be all right he stopped at susan kenfields door and knocked there was a groaned profane inquiry as to his identity and he pushed the door open and entered susan kenfield lay on her stomach the sheet almost covering her head her face buried in the pillows she moaned as doctor murphy sat down on the edge of the bed then turning slowly she pushed herself up with her hands and sat up dying she said dying like some poor trapped beast and never a hand turned to help me tortured alone wracked with pain perishing of thirst umm said doc ill get you a drink of water water what the hell do i want with water miss kenfield trembled with outrage a voice crying in the wilderness i ask for bread and he gives me a stone speaking of bread said doctor murphy im having joseephine bring in some lunch raw chicken livers with strawberry gravy miss kenfield gasped she flung her hands over her mouth and bent forward her body jerking convulsively youd better behave said doc snap out of it now and stop acting like a baby josephines bringing something good something youll be able to eat while were waiting for it i want to ask you a few questions go way murph miss kenfield groaned just go away and let me die in peace cut it out suzy doc scoffed every time you come off a drunk you think youre going to die now but murph ive never felt this way before its as though something were squeezing me down there i dont know quite how to describe it but uhhuh doctor murphy nodded so youre pregnant along with the hangover youre very much pregnant suzy which is why youre sobering up fast and getting out of here im not an obstetrician i havent delivered a baby since i interned and the nurses handled most of the work then miss kenfield laughed weakly youre trying to frighten me murph just look at me now you know good and well i couldnt be that pregnant well doc hesitated his eyes traveling up from the rounded flesh of her abdomen to the lush overfull breasts she looked it seemed to him no different from usual no different than she had at the time of her last trip to the sanitarium three or four months ago well perhaps she was a little heavier a little bloated but shed been on this bat for three weeks and three weeks of guzzling highcalorie booze youre just mean susan kenfield declared you wont give me an abortion yourself and you bet your sweet stupid life i wont and youre trying to frighten me out of having someone else do it well dont think i wont everyones not as mean and beastly as you are why havent you said doc found someone already i none of your business said miss kenfield i told you why murph darling i wouldnt trust any doctor but you why suzy murph youre getting tiresome pet now be a sweet doctor and let me have a drink mmm why doctor murphy repeated she looked away from him nervously after a moment she moved her shoulders in a shrug of indifference well she said still averting her gaze from his i just havent thats all you did try another doctor didnt you suzy and he turned you down weell miss kenfield shrugged again he was such a stupid man murph he tried to tell me ive got a damned good idea what he told you said doctor murphy when did you go to him no wait a minute when did you first go to a doctor with this deal how long ago just well it was just before i started drinking this time that was the last one you went to im talking about the first one and dont tell me you only went to one dont tell me you havent been to every goddam abortionist in town why murph miss kenfield widened her eyes in surprised innocence what in the world makes you think i i dont know why in hell i didnt see it before snapped doc you came to me because the guys in the racket wouldnt touch the job with a tenfoot pole they were afraid to all right suzy lets have it and youd better give it to me straight if you value that stupid life of yours when how many months ago did you first try to get this abortion performed about uh about the actress bit her lip tremulously you wont be cross with me darling they were such sillies murph why anyone could see im not suzy i about four months ago four months doctor murphy literally howled you were too far along for an abortion four months ago and yet you you offered sufficient inducement any abortionist would have operated on susan kenfield up to the third month of pregnancy and there were an incautious few who would have risked her life with an abortion at four months but there were none so moneyhungry as to abort a woman more than four months pregnant so suzy must have been more than four months along four months ago suzy said doc wearily i dont know why the hell i dont murder you but murph how could i possibly you arent the first woman not to show it there was a college girl down in one of the coastal towns a few years ago she had two babies without ever missing a class and without even her parents getting wise killed em and buried em on a vacant lot miss kenfield shivered delicately doctor murphy gave her a scornful glance you wouldnt do that would you youre too damned good like hell well the hell with it the hell with you youre eating lunch and then youre getting out of here i mean it by god right this afternoon murph wailed miss kenfield wwhat will i do ill be ruined those filthy gossip columnists will find out and ill be kicked out of pictures and if they were going to kick you out theyd have done it long ago this baby may be the very thing thatll keep you in itll take your mind off yourself give you something to live for besides getting drunk im sso sick murph so terribly sick yes said doctor murphy and youre going he broke off the sentence and stood up stricken suddenly with the old the inescapable feeling of selfguilt she was an alcoholic shed come to him for help and what had she got nothing nothing at all from the man whose specialty was treating alcoholics because he was an ignoramus a failure im sorry suzy he said quietly just sit tight here until i can step down the hall and get my bag ill give you something to make you feel better ccan i could i have a drink ddarling not now wwhen doc shook his head thatll be a problem for your doctor do whatever he tells you to do but miss kenfield looked up her tearstained face startled and hurt but murph youre my not any more suzy after you leave here today im not seeing you again he turned and walked out of the room closing the door on her protests down the hall a few steps he unlocked the laboratory and snapped open his worn leather medicine kit he looked down into its contents absently wondering what was best to give suzy wondering wondering he heard josephines heavy shuffling tread in the hallway it ceased and he heard the scrape of a tray as it was braced against wood and the turn of a doorknob and then when he recalled it afterwards it was as a nightmare a hideous hagridden dream enduring for years yet somehow packed into seconds the terror struck so quickly and yet lasted an eternity first there was a muffled whoop then another less muffled and a third not muffled at all completely unrestrained gargantuan in its hysteria they rolled out like shapeless offkey notes in some unearthly scale each louder and higher than the other mounting to their awful crescendo they held there a moment then they started down the scale again and with them minor notes in the unheavenly discord were other sounds the wild clatter of dishes silverware the metallic reverberating thud of a tray and a scream a scream that was part curse part prayer part frantic cry for help from susan kenfield thats it doc thought that did it but the knowledge of what had happened and its certain aftermath was in its nightmarish way lacking intrinsic impact it was the black norm in a black world it had happened it had had to happen there was no escape from it there was nothing to be done about it he saw that his hands were trembling and that seemed not to matter either because there was nothing he could do or was going to do he snapped the leather bag shut closing each snap separately he looked at the dropend examination table and it seemed only right and wise that he should raise the end of the table and stretch out to let everything go as it would go anyway he didnt do it of course habit was too strong but it was not sufficiently strong to dispel completely the nightmares dead lethargic hand it gripped his arms slowing their motions it clutched and dragged at his feet instinctively instinctively since there seemed no reason to do so he fought to shake it off and the struggle angered him and the anger helped he left the laboratory and went down the hall again he pushed open susan kenfields door and went in josephine was bent over the bed and her great body obscured all of suzys except her two widespread convulsively twitching ankles he spoke to josephine laid a hand on her shoulder and the hand was impatiently shrugged off casually he moved around to the other side of the bed susans eyes were wide open but fixed in a trancelike somnolent gaze a deep gasping and throaty snore emerged from her gaping mouth her hands were thrown back locked tight around the bed rail absently doctor murphy watched the heaving and undulant torso he watched the slow steady dilation of the labia water yellow and red streaked was seeping through them very definitely it wouldnt be long now well josephine was glaring at him you jus goin to stand there get some more sheets under her its its all right about the bed said doc we mustnt do anything to disturb her josephine grunted the grunt tapered into a soothing croon as she laid a hand on susans forehead don you mind now honey everything goin to be all right ol josephine takin care o you and she done midwived more babiesn you can shake a stick at she doctuh aint you know nothin to do atall the exasperation of her voice was like the prick of a needle he nodded curtly and strode into the bathroom he stoppered the sink and tub and turned on the hot water he snatched a white metal tray from the bag and emptied a flask of alcohol into it scissors a knife forceps clamps no no clamps hed never had any use for them he dumped scissors knife and forceps into the tray then dug a quarter from his pocket and tossed it in also he scrubbed his hands shook them dry and closed the water taps with his elbow he carried the tray into the bedroom and received a grunt of approval from josephine all right he said shortly ill take over says who inquired josephine but she chuckled this my line doctuh this all my familys line any takin over to be done reckon i better do it doc hesitated uncomfortably josephine chuckled again don you worry about me im all washed good an i know zackly what else to do you jus get me all them towels out of the bathroom an now get em now susan kenfields body had risen from the bed in a sudden contortive thrust the snoring sound changed to a low moaning scream and a flood of water a pink tide gushed from her loins and doctor murphy was into the bathroom and out again seemingly without moving from his tracks he was reaching under the thrusting thighs wiping away the mess mopping the vulva clean of its obscuring slime and josephine laughed with gentle chiding humor got your hans all dirty again aint you you reckon maybe i better cotch the baby well i sho now josephine grinned sympathetically thisn aint goin to be no trouble atall mama like thisn it slide right out like a eel fm a slippery elm you want to do somethin you rinse them towels out we goin to need em again doc wasnt sure but he had the impression later that he had argued with her he had wanted to call rufus he had wondered profanely where rufus was he had wanted to call miss baker another doctor an ambulance or so at least was his later impression but argument or no he lost little time in following josephines suggestion he rinsed the towels out in the tub pulled the stopper and turned on the tap again he hurried back into the bedroom susans moans formed a kind of rhythm now a rhythm timed to the undulant heavings of her body the distended and dilated labia formed an almost perfect circle several inches in diameter and a moist round object was pressing its way slowly through the pinkrimmed periphery of the circle aint i tol you so breathed josephine jus like a eel from a slippery elm susan gave the greatest heave of all she screamed sobbed and was silent and josephines hands dipped expertly catching and lifting the baby away from the propelling outrush of afterbirth she shifted the baby onto one of her great workworn palms with the other she swiftly fingered away the mucous from its mouth and nostrils then she shifted it again turned it on its stomach and smacked it smartly on its red wizened bottom and its red wizened face puckered and the tiny mouth opened and there was a kittenlike wail now aint he a dandy lil man said josephine we just do him one lil job an doctor murphy snipped the umbilical cord placed the disinfected coin over the childs umbilicus and taped it into place he didnt know that it was necessary certainly there seemed to be no indication of an incipient navel rupture but it would do no harm and it seemed imperative to do something he had had practically nothing to do with the delivery susan deep in the exhausted postbirth sleep required nothing you know he confessed shakily its a hell of a thing to admit but thats about all i remembered the coin on the navel i mean suah josephine nodded seriously aint never no harm in it mammy allus use a coin when she had one well doc wiped his face with his sleeve ill get an obstet a baby nurse out here just as quiddy as i can im sony to put you through all this but if you can take care of no one put me through nothin said josephine i jus do it on my own now you skedaddle on out o here better lay down from the looks of you an i take care of everything the baby wailed again and jerked in her palms josephine swayed it gently nodding to the doctor i take care o him she said i take care o her you take care o yoself and everything be fine an dandy his long legs dangling from the end of the laboratory examination table doctor murphy shifted his position for perhaps the thousandth time in less than an hour and at last abandoned the idea of resting he wasnt tired why the hell should he be tired there was too much on his mind josephine she must have known all along that suzy was on the point of giving birth she must have to have moved as quickly as she had when suzys time came shed known exactly what to do probably hell there was no probably about it she would have handled everything by herself if he hadnt shown up capably without fuss or flurry shed known that the birth was going to be normal that suzy and the baby would be all right shed known everything that he was supposed to know and hadnt doc grinned wryly watching the smoke squirm against the white walls of the laboratory josephine illiterate superstitious yet with more real knowledge of obstetrics than a topflight practitioner josephine reared in ignorance by the same civilization which would punish her so severely if she tried to practice her skill josephine would never preside in a hospital delivery room she would never be admitted to one even as a nurse and it was too bad a tragedy but well life god knew was full of tragedies the general with nothing to live for but drink and his impossible book susan kenfield a great talent slowly drowning in booze the holcombs with so much of everything that they had nothing humphrey van twyne bernie edmonds lucretia baker all tragedies all of them not to mention a certain doctor named murphy who being too stupid and stubborn to submit to the unchangeable was the biggest tragedy of the lot the facts were before him werent they he couldnt sacrifice van twyne without sacrificing the integrity which had got him into this spot he couldnt simultaneously be a snide and a samaritan you were either a quack or you werent you had certain inviolable standards or you didnt have it couldnt be both ways if you permitted yourself to condemn a man to almost certain idiocy then you lacked the character to fight the battle of alcoholism something inside you would be changed no matter how you might rationalize and try to justify your actions youd lose something that you had to have those were the facts that was the situation and it wasnt debatable he had to do something that couldnt be done if he intended to keep this place operating doc slid from the table and walked to the sink began dousing cold water over his face those were the facts and yet ridiculously he couldnt bring himself to the only possible decision he hadnt been able to this morning and now with his success with jeff sloan his seeming success rather since you could never be sure of anything when it came to alcoholics he was further than ever from the decision he almost wished that jeff had oh hell he didnt really wish it but it would have made things a lot simpler it was strange how the less you had to fight and hope for the harder you fought and hoped he heard josephine approaching and he stepped back from the door drying his face she tapped on the panel and he called for her to come in well doc he smiled how are our patients they doin just fine josephine beamed miz kenfield wake up an get one look atat funny lil ol chile an take him right into bed with her nurse cant get him away from her why why that wont do doc frowned she ought to be resting and the baby baby ought to be with its mammy said josephine an ats right where he is an dont you worry none about miz kenfield ats one mighty strengthy woman doctuh she be alive an kickin long time after you an mes dead an gone but its unheard of for who unheard of it you know where i was bon doctuh right out in the cotton patch an mammy went right on pickin afterwards picked moren three hunnerd pounds at day an then she carried me back to the house an fix suppah for the fambly thats a little different your mother was used to hard work and wasnt used to half o what miz kenfield is said josephine no suh mammy never be able to take what she taken you shoot at lil ol miz kenfield out o a cannon doctuh i bet it dont even make a dent in her doc laughed unwillingly suzys activity so soon after giving birth seemed dangerously phenomenal she want to see you doctuh oh said doctor murphy you said she was getting along all right what does she want something to drink didnt ask for nothin jus wants to see you she say you aint goin to have nothin more to do with her and it kinda make her feel bad doc blinked well he said slowly all i meant by that was he paused feeling for the moment the same stir of excitement that jeffs promise to forswear drinking had given him suzy would never have a better excuse than she had now to drink or stay sober depending on whether she thought only of her own ordeal or the child that had derived from it if she was going to pull herself together shed do it now or never and since she hadnt asked for a drink naturally she hadnt asked josephine for whiskey josephine she knew would have to ask him and he could deny the request without arguing about it so she was putting on this little act pretending to be worried about his feelings toward her and as soon as he stuck his bead in the door shed go into part two of the act no they didnt change after they got as far along as suzy not when they were psychos as well as alcoholics about all you could do was what he had announced doing earlier this afternoon get her out of here as quickly as possible and see that she stayed out ill see that she gets a drink he said and ill drop in on her a little later everything else okay rufus help you clean things up they all cleaned up said josephine yes suh every thing okay rufus take care of the nurse see that she has everything she needs nurse all taken care of said josephine quickly and doctor murphy misunderstood the shortness of her reply i cant tell you how much i appreciate what youve done josephine i wish i could could do something in return but the way things are now sho now josephine was embarrassed aint no call to feel at way an looky doctuh yes about money i jus soon you allus owe me some it kinda give me my edge you see me an my crazy laughin dont set too well with folks they keep me around they givin me somethin they keep me owin them so so men you we keep even huh doctuh you owe me somethin an i owe you doctor murphy grinned ill be glad to oblige you josephine now about the nurse i know youre entirely capable of taking care of miss kenfield and her baby but you have so many other things to do i an i bettah start doin em said josephine you want me to bring you some coffee or somethin doctuh whynt you go up to your room an i bring you a tray why doc looked at her why thats very nice of you josephine but she pulled the door open and nodded to him made a small shooing motion with her hand doctor murphy remained where he was josephine he said where is rufus rufus he around somewhere now you come along doctuh an an well said josephine and she edged through the door herself i bettah be gettin busy where is he josephine whats going on here yes suh said josephine suah got to be gettin busy didnt reelize how late it was the door closed after her doctor murphy rocked indecisively on his toes he cast a weary almost longing glance at the table why not why not let them all go their rotten irresponsible way as without knowing the details he knew they were doing they had the jump on him by almost two hours with that much of a start it would take days days which he wouldnt have to undo the damage oh he knew what had happened all right just as basically there is but one major danger in a powder magazine there is only one in a sanitarium for alcoholics rufus was still with them all of them together in that one room and theyd been too occupied with themselves to notice the noisy goingson of the afternoon so it could be only the one thing but curiosity began to puncture doctor murphys lassitude curiosity and hope where had they got the stuff and rufus and jeff how could they the answer part of the answer rather came to him immediately the holcombs had used up their supply no one had visited them and they of course hadnt been outside the sanitarium so it had had to come from in here and there was only one person aside from himself who had a key to the liquor closet nurse baker doc cursed murderously goddam her yes and goddam jeff sloan jeff his success the guy who wasnt going to drink any more and rufus rufus knew better than this rufus would know it was all wrong nothing was to be expected from the others but how could jeff do this grab at the first drink that was offered to him he didnt doc muttered knowing full well that jeff could and had damn him he just couldnt and he left the laboratory moved swiftly and silently down the hall he came to the holcombs door without breaking his stride he entered the room he stood there for a moment just inside the door before they became aware of his presence now i insist the general was saying jeff fix a drink for our good friend rufus i insist that rufus join us sure said jeff busily mixing drinks at the dresser ill take care of him not me no suh rufus chuckled uneasily i aint crazy im jus black jeff grinned appreciatively and looked around and his eyes met doctor murphys well he said look whos here guys what kept you so long doc doc looked at him silently he stared tightlipped around the room ignoring the generals genial greeting the holcombs welcoming nods bernie edmonds gestured to a chair youre just in time murph jeff what about a drink for doc and rufus said the general special occasion yknow wouldnt be complete without rufus by the way doc said john holcomb what was all the rumpus about did suzy finally go into dts i thought i heard a baby crying said gerald holcomb uh he laughed uncomfortably maybe youd better give me a thorough checkup he looked at them one by one weighing them and finding them hideously wanting he looked down at the scuffed toes of his shoes ridiculously in contrast with the waxed parquet floor it was no wonder they thought they could get away with murder it was no wonder that miss baker thought she could he gave them a palace to live in he treated them like kings no more than that like friends for them he made a bum of himself and who was to blame if they treated him like a bum jeff cleared his throat look doc i you didnt mean for us to have this is that it doc shrugged there was a vague halfformed thought in the back of his mind the entangled threads of several thoughts what was the occasion why wasnt jeff apologetic about his backslide how had they drunk so long with so little visible effect but to hell with all that beneath one of the beds back against the wall he could see the glint of two empty bottles and jeff was pouring from a full quart that was all that mattered well how about it jeff demanded frowning dont just stand there doc after all we didnt ask for the stuff but you couldnt turn it down could you doc spoke for the first time you couldnt do that could you now thats hardly fair murph bernie protested im sure were all sorry if miss baker acted without authority but you can hardly blame a group of alcoholics for youre sorry said doc youre always sorry youre not to blame you never are you sit in here guzzling all morning you and jerry and john and jeff he gets drunk on his own puts more away than you do and the general the only reason he doesnt get stiff is that he cant get out of bed he doesnt lose any time as soon as hes on his feet none of you ever misses a chance and if you dont have a chance you make one and then youre sorry and youre not to blame well skip it i dont give a good goddam what you do he took out his keyring removed a key from it and tossed it to rufus thats to the liquor closet he said ask miss kenfield how much she wants to drink and give her whatever she asks and bring back some more for our friends here as much as they want rufus scratched his head his white teeth gleamed in a bewildered uneasy grin you say what i think you did doctuh i said it you dont mind do you you can tear yourelf away from here for a few minutes im sure these gentlemen will excuse you i uh no suh i aint got nothin to do here just been kinda lookin on didnt know quite what to do so i just well now you know gentlemen is there anything else i can do for you you might sit down said gerald holcomb quietly brother cant you persuade the good doctor to be patient with us a little longer im sure that when he understands all hell be inclined to forgive i probably would doctor murphy cut in id probably wind up by pinning a medal on you im stupid enough so lets just save time and say that you can do as you please get as drunk as you please and it wont make a damned bit of difference to me im through with you through with this whole ridiculous heartbreaking business as of tomorrow gentlemen el healtho will be no more ive had enough there was a moment of stunned silence the general rose shakily from his chair but rnmy book doctor what about my book thats your problem youre all your own problems from now on general bbut but were have fun said doctor murphy and he gave them an ironic salute then as they all started talking at once as jeff seemed on the point of exploding he walked out and slammed the door that took care of them now to take care of her he went up the steps slowly giving his anger time to build focusing it on the lissome and lisping person who was its logical target after all while it was only natural to be disgusted and disappointed with jeff and the others to give them up as a hopeless job it was childish to be angry with them it was as foolish as it was futile to scold them for lacking will power you might feel they could have resisted if theyd really tried but there you were posing a contradiction men dont resist the thing that has become allimportant to them they werent accountable miss baker was icyeyed his thin face flushed and taut he strode down the mezzanine and his rage grew with every step she hadnt left yet he knew no cab had called at the sanitarium and this fact somehow was the most maddening of all the nerve of the dame telling him where to head in feeding booze to his patients and then hanging around thought she could get away with it did she thought hed be afraid to do anything he stopped in front of her door listened a moment and raised his fist then grinning wickedly be lowered it and took out his keys he selected one small and flat and multiplenotched and slid it into the lock silently he turned it simultaneously turning the knob he stepped inside and and he stopped his adams apple traveled up and down his throat in an awed gulp of course hed had an idea what she was like beneath that white starched uniform hed known she must be stacked like a brick backhouse in windy country but having an idea of what she was like and seeing the reality the bare reality was something else again so much so that doctor murphy felt a dangerous almost paralyzing weakness creeping over him she was sprawled on the bed on her stomach completely nude a lush ivorycolored figurine her outspread legs tapering up into perfect thighs emphasized the flaring pearshaped lines of her buttocks her firm full breasts pressed against the pillows exaggerating the delicious curve of her back doc gulped a second time with an effort he tore his eyes away from her incuriously a little dazed he saw the halfpacked suitcases saw what appeared to be the remnants of a torn blouse and slip helplessly he looked back at the bed again it was too much that much in one dame all that in five feet and a hundred pounds well it ought to be illegal he moved forward grimly slowly massaging the palm of his right hand against his trousers he came even with the bed he raised his hand he swung his open palm came down upon her bottom with an explosive riflelike craaack there was a smothered scream then a louder one as miss bakers face came out of the pifiow she scrambled and stumbled to her feet stood jiggling and swaying on the bed at once trying to massage her painwracked posterior and to shield her body from his gaze doc laughed contemptuously some fun eh lucretia almost as much fun as giving whiskey to alcoholics yyou get out of here gasped miss baker you get out or ill ill he bent forward swiftly and grabbed at her ankle miss baker stumbled back against the wall gget away yyou you know she wouldnt let me leave you know i dont dare to who wouldnt what the hell are you talking about josephine and dont tell me you didnt put her up to it miss baker gestured to her head and hastily lowered her hand again hhitting me ttrying to thtab me you know i you had it coming ill bet whatd you do to her nothing not a thing help screamed miss baker for docs hand had closed around her ankle he dragged her forward screaming and sobbing clawing at the bedclothes she jerked and kicked herself free flung herself back toward the wall doc cursed and made a dive for her now he grunted now by god his strong hands pinned her arms he jerked her around holding her helpless against him they lay there panting her sweetsmelling hair in his face her breasts crushed against his chest her legs locked and held by his she squirmed she squirmed again and docs arms suddenly became nerveless there was no use in stopping now of course this was more than enough to wind him up permanently criminal assault assault with attempt to commit rape it wouldnt make any difference now so he might as well go ahead he might as well but he couldnt do it he took a final halfhearted clout at her bottom and started to rise and miss baker wiggled frantically to escape the blow and somehow he was never quite sure how it happened she was lying beneath him all the soft warm wonder of her body was cushioning his and she was weeping in a curious helpless way and her fluttering frantic hands seemed to caress rather than claw and the doctor murphy that was surrendered to the doctor murphy who had never been allowed to be the doc who had felt impelled to beat the dogbeater jab the impudent waiter collect from that little bellevue teaser that doc the one who had never been permitted to resolve a situation in the one satisfactory way possible took over miss bakers eyes widened in sudden terror they closed again and her breasts arched and trembled with a kind of shivering sob she gasped she groaned she cried out faintly it was all over seemingly almost as soon as it began so long had the submerged doc been denied then having had his way he fled leaving the other doc his cautious safe and sane victim to face the inevitable and horrendous music he sat on the edge of the bed gloomy shaky sick with shame and foreboding he couldnt bring himself to look at her he couldnt speak he could only sit and stare at the floor stare rather into the future with its certain disgrace a prison sentence the loss of his license the loss of everything oh she could do it all right he wasnt exaggerating the seriousness of the situation a virgin just as hed known she must be and it wouldnt be any trouble at all to hang it onto him it would be useless to fight even if he had felt like fighting well he said at last and waited well why dont you say something do something and get it over with silence oh he said well ill get out then you can call the cops silence still ill call them for you if you like ill do you want me to get you a doctor i thilly said miss baker you thilly thilly man i already have a doctor her arms went around him he was starting down the steps moving in a blissful pinkclouded glow before the cold sun of circumstance again pushed into his horizon back there with her everything had been simple now seeing a sullen rufus lingering at the bottom of the stairs reality punctured the dream she mattered none the less to him but she could not be the all of his world in her he had added one more complication to the hopelessly snarled skeins of his life nothing whatsoever had been solved he was broke he was or soon would be a doctor without a practice a doctor who had failed at the only thing he had ever wanted to do well he looked at rufus coldly everyone getting nice and stiff no suh they aint gettin nice and stiff said rufus an they aint goin to i done picked up that bottle an put it back in the closet an miss kenfield aint drinkin nothin either she say rufus looked doc squarely in the eye she say to tell you you just as stupid as you is ugly doctor murphy reddened i think he began sternly that you had better then the full impact of the negros words struck him and he grasped rufus by the shoulder did you say that they that she yes suh nodded rufus im sorry about the baby doctuh i mean not bein on hand when you must have needed me but i didnt know an to hell with that how much did those guys have to drink this afternoon just at one drink you saw the one they was waitin to have with you mistah jeff he didnt have none just fixed em for the general an mistah bernie an mistah holcomb doctor murphy stared incredulously now wait a minute i saw two empty bottles under the oh said doc of course yes suh reckon them mustve been old ones but doc spread his hands helplessly whats it all about what were they all doing there together they talkin about the book how they goin to make it into somethin that is somethin miz baker come in while they talkin an she say oh ats fine an they can all have a drink and she gives em that quart she say she tell you the good news an you be right in an rufus paused reproachfully what you spect anyway what you spect me to do she my boss you always tellin me to min my own business an do what im told you always fussin about me buttin in on things i dont know nothin about but the book said doc what book do you mean at book the general wrote what you spect me to do doctuh tell miz baker she aint doin right run an ask you if she is they wasnt drinking nothin just talkin an waitin for you to come looked to me like at was what id better do dont do no nothin dont do no thinkin just stay there an wait for you rufus doc hesitated im sorry rufus you did exactly the right thing miss baker uh miss baker acted a little thoughtlessly and she owes you an apology also and youll have it from her rufus but yes suh rufus looked at him anxiously everything all right then you aint goin to close up the sanitarium i dont doc turned away leaving the sentence unfinished he did know of course and he should have given rufus and the others some warning before this but as long as he had waited this long i want to know more about that book he said have mr sloan come to my office will you he waitin for you there now doctuh you say you aint really ill talk to you later said doctor murphy and he hastened across the dining room and entered his office jeff was seated on the lounge thumbing through a medical magazine he arose as doc came into the room his boyish goodnatured face set in an expression of defiant reproach boy he said do you ever go off halfcocked just because you see a guy with a glass i know i know ive talked to rufus doc dropped down on the lounge drawing jeff down with him now whats all this about the generals book why were going to go to town with it thats what said jeff bernies going to rewrite it under the generals byline of course and ill do the promoting and the holcombs will handle the sale on their own outside of their agency im telling you its a natural doc everyones heard of the general with bernie to put his stuff in shape and the rest of us to push and peddle it ill bet we have a millioncopy sale doc nodded slowly you might at that he said i think you will what im wondering is yeah why didnt i think of something like this myself its been right in front of me all along ive watched the general sliding further and further downhill every day ive watched the same thing happen to john and gerald and bernie all essentially because of the lack of any real interest in life and i didnt know what to do about it i had all the pieces in my hands and i was too damned stupid to put them together you now youre in here less than two days and you i saw it jeff shrugged why not im not outside the boat looking in im right in there with the others but ill tell you something doc he tapped doctor murphy on the knee before a guy can see anything hes got to have his eyes opened hes got to want to see doc shook his head im afraid youre giving me too much credit jeff naturally i like to think that what i said helped but ive talked myself blue in the face to hundreds of other patients and for all the good it did well how do you know it didnt do any good how do you know it wont do some good eventually well ill tell you the way i see it doc its kind of like my game you call on a guy with a proposition and maybe you hit him with exactly the right line at the right time like you did me and he goes for it but the chances are that you wont you have to keep pounding at him day after day and even then you miss out on the deal but that doesnt mean doc that absolutely doesnt mean that you havent done any good hell remember you if youve done your job right hell pick you up on your deal later or maybe hell mention you to a friend who is ripe for your proposition doc sighed and shifted on the lounge the point is jeff that i dont know my job not in anything resembling the way that you know yours its all pretty much hit or miss shooting in the dark you dont know where to aim or what to aim with so said jeff whats the difference you just aim at and with everything jeff you just dont understand yes i do doc said jeff earnestly i can be a pretty lousy bastard when im drinking but theres nothing wrong with my head yet you asked me earlier today why id decided not to drink any more and i couldnt tell you now i can its because you believed i could and would stop yes doctor murphy turned on him sharply how do you figure that you believed i could and you believe these other patients can youre sure that eventually you can get them back on the track dont you see doc you have to believe or you wouldnt be doing what you are you wouldnt have gone into this kind of practice in the first place umm said doc and what if im all wet for believing that way but you know youre not everyone else might think so even the alcoholic himself may have given himself up as hopeless but you dont you stay right in there pitching giving it everything youve got because you believe youre going to win out do you see how important that is doc to have someone to believe in you do you see how it would be if you gave up if you stopped believing along with everyone else doc grimaced wryly you arent a very hardbitten case jeff you might have made the decision to stop drinking by yourself leave me out of it then what about the others i feel that ive got to know them pretty well todaybetter than you maybe because theyll let their hair down with another drunk you cant give up now doc just when youre on the point of succeeding those guys would hit the bottom and keep right on going you think then docs tone was deliberately cynical that theyll be all right now they wont drink any more and the prince will marry the princess and theyll all live happily forever after i think said jeff that theyre nearer to being permanently sober than theyve ever been before i think theyve stopped sliding and started climbing i think theyll start sliding fast if you throw in the sponge here well doc spoke the one word and was silent they were pretty badly upset doc i told them you didnt mean what you said that everything would be all right as soon as you understood what had happened did you i did said jeff look doc he frowned what gives with this miss baker anyway why did she give them that booze why crack down on the boys because of something she did that was my fault said doc curtly miss baker has been ifi and i knew it she should be all right from now on well jeff looked at him puzzledly i guess i dont get it doc everythings fine and yet you you doctor murphy leaped to his feet ive had enough get me thats whats the matter its just been one goddam headache after another and now i cant take any more youve heard the news about suzy kenfield well thats a small sample of what ive been up against ever since i opened this place she might have died the baby might have died and all because she didnt and doesnt give a damn about anything so long as she can stay sozzled i tell you we all went in to see the baby said jeff miss kenfield said shed never felt better in her life sure the damned selfish bitch is indestructible but im not i we were there said jeff when rufus offered her the whiskey all right he said ive worked for years without making an inch of headway and now everythings popping at once of course it may all be a fluke but i dont think so you know it isnt doc all right i know it and i wish i didnt it would be easier if knew that id failed it would have been better for my patients if id done a complete flop as it is well just when theyre getting their foot on the ladder i yank it out from under them but doc why you know why jeff i cant do that to van twyne i wouldnt be any good as a doctor if i did do it but jeff hesitated uncertainly i know how you feel but you didnt have your mind made up then when you took me up to see him you were undecided then when you didnt have any real reason to go on here and now that you do have he paused again looking down at the floor uncomfortably im not trying to talk you into it understand i cant do it jeff ive known all along that i couldnt so long as i had any time at all left even a few hours i ducked the facts ive tried to kid myself that there was some other way out now my times run out and i know there isnt any other way its that way or none so it has to be none well said jeff iwell he repeated yes said doc ive screwed it up good its pretty generally known that i was having a hard time financially but no ones known how bad things really were alcoholics are sensitive as hell the majority of my patients are on their uppers i was afraid that if i told them the truth theyd hesitate about coming to me so ive just gone on getting in deeper and deeper and now youre sure there isnt some way doc ive told you positive dammit said doctor murphy how many times do i have to tell you van twyne was my only chance that was why he was brought here get me no said jeff blankly i dont his familys got a finger in every financial pie on the west coast real estate banks every damned thing they looked around for a good reputable sanitarium to bury humphrey in and when they came to mine they stopped looking they knew how much this place meant to me they knew i had to have big dough right away or else and they knew that if i didnt get it from them i just wouldnt doc paused abruptly his eyes narrowed if i didnt get it from them he murmured if i did get it from them and yeah doc nothing said doc thats a pretty dirty thing to do to you doc forcing a choice like that on you yes said doctor murphy i thought it was myself he slapped the cigarette ash from his knees and stood up hands jammed in his pockets he stood in front of the window looking down across the shrubbery and gardens and lawn to the highway a car was turning into the driveway at the foot of the slope the afternoon sun sparkled blindingly on its long black hood and the chrome flashed and sparkled like the dazzling limitless millions which in a way it represented doctor amos perthborg was arriving doctor perthborg physician to the van twyne family doc turned away from the window youll have to excuse me now jeff sure said jeff and turned slowly toward the door i hate to keep asking you doc but are you dead sure there isnt some way to the van twynes thats the only way shall iwhat shall i tell the guys doc dont tell them anything tell them i was too busy to see you but doc thats you heard me said doctor murphy and he drooped a lid over one bright blue eye now get the hell out of here long long before when a youngster with the impossible name of pasteur semelweiss murphy was still in knee pants the annual income of dr amos perthborg was approaching the sixfigure mark not you will understand because his practice was a particularly large one and notvery definitely not because of his excellence as a physician it was rather because of an attribute which many claim but which happily very few possess the trait of making no move which did not somehow contribute to his personal advancement among his unsuspecting friends and associates and they were in the main unsuspecting doctor perthborg was regarded as whimsically eccentric a man guided by his heart rather than his head and to those whose lookingahead was limited to days and weeks instead of doctor perthborgs year and decades it did often seem that he was so easily is the straightforward disguised by complex society so easily is the straight path confused with the ambling terrain it traverses during the economic depression amos perthborg had lent thousands of dollars to beginning practitioners lent it without note or collateral and often at the necessity of borrowing himself at a time when his own professional position was none too secure he had boldly denounced the president of the county medical society as an incompetent fee splitter which though it is hardly pertinent the president was compared to the supplicant young doctors he had literally booted out of his office the ones he had aided comprised a mere handful and these a thoughtful observer would have noted had been selected more for their catholicity than say precocity there was a heart man an orthopedist a gynecologist a pediatrician a brain surgeon an eyeearnoseandthroat specialist and so on they were good but not brilliant men doctor perthborg distrusted brilliance as consultants they had proved useful and lucrative for a great many years not only by doing the work he was paid to do for a fraction of his fee but in stamping his flagrant and sometimes fatal errors with their professional approval as for the president of the medical society he had been old and the old lose the will to fight and it is a basic principle of elementary politics never to vote no on a moral issue the incumbent had been booted out of his post doctor perthborg elected by acclamation virtuously refused the honor his purpose had been accomplished he said he did not care to profit by it he did profit by it needless to say he had received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of free advertising and he winnowed the results carefully narrowing them down to the choicest fiscally strongest clientele moreover having scared the daylights out of any competition he and his proteges were left with practically a clear field in the consultant racket only for a time of course greed being eternal and fear ephemeral but a very good time it was it was during this period that doctor perthborg began his long association with the van twyne family barbara huylinger darcy van twyne had got herself pregnant doctor perthborgs consultants consulted with doctor perthborg and agreed that she could not give birth without serious risk to her life she should in other words be aborted she was whereupon she reassumed the many duties incumbent upon a champion woman golfer tennis player swimmer and high diver that as has been noted was the beginning of the van twyneperthborg association the ending ah the ending just where doctor perthborg had begun to wonder would the ending be you had moved in a straight line and got to where you were going the men you had moved to move yourself now approached your own stature and far from being disturbed you were pleased and gratified you were friends insofar as you were capable of friendship they wanted nothing from you nor you from them there was no past that was you then after three score of your allotted three and a half portly in a purely comfortable way comfortably active comfortably rich you had got what you wantedwealth position family you had moved in a straight line to worryfree honorable comfort and a beadyeyed old witch ancient yet seemingly ageless who had not got all that she wanted and never would damn her came along and booted you in the tail and you couldnt plead with her because there was nothing to appeal to and you couldnt reason with her because she wouldnt argue you could only move in the direction she indicated seated across the desk from doctor murphy doctor perthborg looked unhappy and was considerably unhappier than he looked he had a feeling that however things turned out the result for him would be disastrous yet there was nothing to do but go ahead if he did not if he so much as caviled that was her word the disaster would be immediate doctor perthborg beamed and nodded at doctor murphy edging politely toward the subject of his visit but actually he did not see doc his minds eye was turned on the image of her hawknosed bitter mouthed beadyeyed a driedup witch of a woman perched in a chair that was like a throne imperious far more wealthy perhaps than her namesake but my dear victoria you honestly cant expect me to ive told you what i expected and dont dearvictoria me you sanctimonious old fake you make me sick to my stomach but but its completely unethical in a sense its murder surely you wouldnt want your own grandson murdered id like nothing better unfortunately im compelled to think of the publicity i cant i wont do it very well what wwhat will you do victoria about you well i believe we are not dissimilar in character what would you do amos if you were in the position to do what i can doctor perthborg removed his pincenez and rubbed them against the lapel of his twohundred dollar suit he reaffixed them on his nose and leaned forward folding his fleshy face into a sympathetic mask and humphrey he said how is the poor boy doctor would you like to see him oh no no not at all doctor perthborg protested that wont be necessary i have complete confidence in you doctor why said doctor murphy uh why sure why im a psychiatrist with a limited gp practice you underestimate yourself doctor ive had glowing reports on your ability ability as a brain surgeon doctor perthborgs lips compressed his cheeks puffed out and for a moment he resembled nothing quite so much as an angry toad somehow however he managed to smother his annoyance he spoke to doctor murphy kindly though on a note of gentle reproof love he intoned thats what our boy needs doctor after all and i know youre not the ignoramus in these matters you pretend to bewhat else can be done for him how many lobotomy cases are ever able to resume normal lives even under the skillful care of the worlds greatest specialist not many eh we know the record of the specialists doctor many failures few ah so pitifully few successes so lets do it our way the way of heart and soul lets keep the boy here in the bosom of his family and give him doctor perthborg paused icily am i amusing you doctor i was never said doctor murphy less amused in my life admittedly the recovery ratio on prefrontals is tragically low as a psychiatrist i dont feel that the operation is ever warranted however we had no alternative doctor im not sure that i agree but let that pass humphrey went through the operation now hes entitled to a chance the only place he can get it is where the lobotomy was performed the painegwaltney clinic in new york i disagree doctor no said doctor murphy you dont but well let that pass too we have some pretty good local men specialists let me call one in no said doctor perthborg let me call in a nonspecialist then any reputable practitioner no no doctor murphy nodded grimly you cant have a quack presiding at humphreys funeral sooner or later thered be one hell of a scandal you have to have a good man and no one thats any good would touch the case come doctor doctor perthborg smiled firmly a good man has touched the case yourself one of the best downtoearth physicians we have in this blessed state franidy im a little surprised even disappointed at his attitude this belaboring of the inevitable i had every reason to feel it seemed to me that we were pretty much in agreement on you took me by surprise doctor murphy nodded and i dont mind saying that the proposition was tempting its either that or give up my work here and very valuable work doctor important vital i think so so im probably much more sorry than you are to say what i have to i dont want the case either you have humphrey removed from here at once or i will bbut doctor perthborg turned pale ccant you cant do that doctor why cant i whats to prevent me from sending him to the county hospital the county doctor perthborg got a grip on himself doctor is it i thought we were being quite generous but is it a question of money its a question of responsibility either i share it with someone someone with a good professional reputation or its no deal but youve already said that no one who was uh did you have someone in mind doctor im not sure that the idea would be agreeable to mr van twyne but if you could suggest someone of your own discretion can you i ask one of my associates to to doctor murphy grinned at him too good for that huh theyre too good but im not no no its just that i dont know of anyone who meets the necessary qualifications but if theres anyone you can i was hoping said doctor murphy that he would suggest himself in fact i was so sure he would that i took the liberty of having this prepared he turned over the sheet of paper on his desk and pushed it toward doctor perthborg the doctor picked it up gingerly ummm he cleared his throat i feel that this is superfluous doctor entirely unnecessary obviously by implication that is mr van twyne was placed in your care with my full approval there could be no question in the mind of anyone that you were acting without authority but you dont care to make it a matter of record but it is a matter of record the check for your fee constitutes a record not in my book it isnt said doctor murphy the implications are all onesided for fifteen thousand dollars i give an implied promise to help humphrey i promise something and accept payment for something which i cant possibly deliver you and the van twynes are in the clear you accepted my professional word mine alone and i let you down huh uh doctor perthborg not for me now doctor you know we havent the slightest intention of you havent now no but its not hard to imagine what youd do if it was a case of your necks or mine but this doctor perthborg looked down unhappily at the paper the wording of it doctor as the duly authorized physician to humphrey van twyne iii and having thoroughly examined and studied the aforementioned patient i am in complete agreement with and hereby agree to the recommendations made by dr pasteur semeiweiss murphy consulting physicianincharge well said doctor murphy what recommendations what am i agreeing to i cant go out on a limb like this doctor murphy shrugged well lets reword it then be specific give me your ideas on what should be done for humphrey but i dont know doc grinned at him doctor perthborg sighed reluctantly he uncapped his fountain pen and scrawled his signature at the bottom of the page there you are doctor and heres your check youll notice ive had it certified very thoughtful of you murmured doctor murphy so if youll just sign this receipt doctor murphy leaned back in his chair hands clasped behind his head he stared thoughtfully up at the ceiling you know ive been thinking doctor establishments such as mine are always somewhat suspect so ive been thinking yes said doctor perthborg shortly well the van twyne philanthropies are well known and its only logical that the family should have a deep interest in alcoholism that being the case and assuming that this situation has a strong potential for unpleasantness suppose i accept that check as a donation rather than a fee doctor murphy continued to stare at the ceiling he was afraid to look away from it certain that doctor perthborg would take one cold calculating glance at his face and read the plan that was in his mind he waited for hours it seemed the silence became unbearable then he heard a slow thoughtful exhalation and the squeak of a chair and the brief scratching of pen against paper an excellent idea said doctor perthborg i think the one word will cover it dont you doctor murphy thought it would he was sure ha ha that it would just the word donation across the corner of the check that ha hathat would take care of everything doctor perthborg looked at him with cynical amusement he shook hands and said goodday and as he drove away he permitted himself a scornful and wondering laugh the pitiful damned fool practically going into hysterics when he got his hands on that fifteen thousand why if hed been half the man that he doctor perthborg was hed have put on the squeeze for two times fifteen thousand meanwhile doctor murphy remained in his office he remained at his desk staring rather dazedly at the check there it was hed never thought he could get away with it he felt unnerved exhausted wanting to yell with sheer relief yet lacking the energy to do it the check rattled in his trembling fingers and he dropped it hastily he gulped and brushed at his eyes fifteen grand the sanitarium could coast a long time on that and humphrey van twyne would have his chancethe one in a thousand chance for normality usefulness happiness but it had been too much he had given everything he had to get this far and this far was really nothing as yet he had done nothing the last conclusive step was yet to be taken a step across the abyss or into it the door opened and closed gently miss baker came firmly across the room ith there ith there anything i can do doctor i dont know doctor murphy barely looked up i mean no i guess not just thinking trying to think something through if ith i hope it doethnt conthern what i thaid about jothephine shes really a very sweet perthon and i thimply mithunderthtood what she wath no said doc josephines all right mithter thloan did he tell you i put a full glath of whithkey in hith room today right after lunch doctor murphy glanced at her sharply then he shrugged so it doesnt matter everythings all right now you sloan the general bernie the holcombs doc laughed tiredly i dont know how the hell it happened because ive been a bigger damned fool than usual but everythings all right everything and everyone but yeth doctor doc shook his head of course they didnt want publicity and thered certainly be plenty if they decided to get tough theyd be shown up for the rotten bunch of stinkers they were thered be a scandal that would make humphreys past exploits seem like sunday school stuff so the odds were all that they wouldnt do anything theyd take their licking and the day might even come if humphrey turned out okay when theyd thank him for it but but you could never be sure which way an outfit like that would jump the fact that it was against their interests to kick up a fuss didnt mean that they might not do it undoubtedly there was a strong streak of nuttiness in the entire family if they got sore enough they could make him wish hed never been born they could get his license pulled hound him from place to place break him and keep him broken and the fact that theyd be in the soup too wouldnt help him any he didnt think theyd do it they were too damned selfish too shrewd to hurt themselves to get at another but he couldnt be sure he didnt know and he wouldnt know until it was too late to back up suddenly he was almost terrified doctor she was looking down at the check now and somehow she seemed to know she already knew he was a damned fool and the check was enough to fill in the picture you crathy man she breathed you know youre crathy she moved unbidden to the filing cabinet she consulted a white address card and returned to the desk thath the painegwaltney clinic forest hills new york straight telegram doctor straight telegram said doctor murphy and he dictated returning humphrey van twyne your care also airmailing photostat of carteblanche authority from van twyne agent urge you spare no expense how many words is that lucretia nineteen counting van twyne ath one word shall i try to cut add two said doctor murphy good luck the long sanitarium day was ended excorpsman judson had ascended the long stairs from the beach and the great kitchen of el healtho was dark and silent and in their quarters josephine and rufus slept the sleep of the just in the double room of the holcomb brothers the general remarked that chronically opposed as he was to leaving pleasant company he would have to ask to be excused for the first time in years he was honestly sleepy and john stated that oddly enough he and brother also felt like sleeping and bernie and jeff confessed to the same almostforgotten sensation and they all smiled at one another happily and said goodnight in her room susan kenfield said kitchykoo you darling lovely adorable hideous little bastard then she released him to the somewhat shocked nurse and peacefully closed her eyes in room four humphrey van twyne urinated in his winding sheets and for a moment there was a flicker of intelligence in the chiseled white mask of his face eons ages ago there had been a void black empty awesome and then there had been this sudden wet warmth and then then on the rear terrace looking down upon the phosphorescent highway of moonlight which stretched endlessly into the pacific miss baker said she just knew everything would be all right and doctor murphy said well he thought so too and itd damned well better be we have a new patient doctor i think youd better see him bad pretty well into delirium beaten up and rolled apparently i had to pay his cab fare damn okay ill be right with you he ran to catch up with judson better rig up a saline drip whats his name anyway his job couldnt quite get his name doctor but he was babbling something about being a writer well well wash out his bloodstream get him back to work as soon as possible thats what all these birds need something to keep grab him they grabbed him together the pukesmeared wildeyed wreck who staggered suddenly into the corridor he struggled for a moment then went limp in their arms sobbing helplessly ttomcats he wept ssonsbitches tthirtyfour ffeet tall an n goteighteen tails n n yeah said doctor murphy n oysters for eyeballs doctor murphy chuckled grimly yes sir he said well knock him out wash him out and get him back to work ive got a job all picked out for this character a job i dont ccats sobbed the writer n every damn one a lyric ssoprano doctor murphy regarded him fondly a gradea nut he
