planet of adventure table of contents book one city of the chasch book two servants of the wankh book three the dirdir book four the pnume the phume chapter one in the warehouse at the edge of the sivishe salt flats aila woudiver sat perched on a stool a chain connected the iron collar around his neck to a high cable he could walk from his table to the closet against the wall where he slept the chain sliding behind him aila woudiver was a prisoner on his own premises insult added to injury which by all accounts should have provoked him to spasms of toothchattering fury but he sat placidly on the stool great buttocks sagging to either side like saddlebags wearing an absurd smile of saintly forbearance beside the spaceship which occupied the greater part of the warehouse adam reith stood watching woudivers abnegation was more unsettling than rage reith hoped that whatever schemes woudiver was hatching would not mature too quickly the spaceship was nearly operative in a week more or less reith hoped to depart old tschai woudiver occupied himself with tatwork now and then holding it up to admire the patternthe very essence of patient affability traz coming into the warehouse scowled toward woudiver and asserted the philosophy of the emblem nomads his forebears kill him this moment kill him and have an end reith gave an equivocal grunt hes chained by the neck he does us no harm hell find a means have you forgotten his tricks i cant kill him in cold blood traz gave a croak of disgust and stamped from the warehouse anacho the dirdirman declared for once i agree with the young stepperunner kill the great beast woudiver divining the substance of the conversation displayed his gentle smile he had lost weight so reith noticed the oncebloated cheeks hung in wattles the great upper lip drooped like a beak over the pointed little chin see him smirk hissed anacho if he could hed boil us in nervefire kill him now reith made another sound of moderation in a week well be gone what can he do chained and helpless he is woudiver even so we cant slaughter him like an animal anacho threw up his hands and followed traz outside the warehouse reith went into the ship and for a few minutes watched the technicians they worked at the exquisitely delicate job of balancing the power pumps reith could offer no assistance dirdir technology like the dirdir psyche was beyond his comprehension both derived from intuitive certainties or so he suspected there was little evidence of purposeful rationality in any aspect of dirdir existence long shafts of brown light slanted through the high windows the time was almost sunset woudiver thoughtfully put aside his fancywork he gave reith a companionable nod and went off to his little room against the wall the chain dragging behind him in a rattling halfcatenary the technicians emerged from the ship as did fio haro the master mechanic all went off to their supper reith touched the unlovely hull pressing his hands against the steel as if he could not credit its reality a weekthen space and return to earth the prospect seemed a dream earth had become the world remote and bizarre reith went to the larder for a chunk of black sausage which he took to the doorway carina low in the sky bathed the salt flats in ale colored light projecting long shadows behind every tussock the two black figures which of late had appeared at sunset were nowhere to be seen the view held a certain mournful beauty to the north the city of sivishe was a crumble of old masonry tinted tawny by the slanting sunlight west across ajzan sound stood the spires of the dirdir city hei and looming above all the glass box reith went to join traz and anacho they sat on a bench tossing pebbles into a puddle traz bluntedfeatured taciturn solid of bone and muscle anacho thin as an eel six inches taller than reith pallid of skin long and keen of feature as loquacious as traz was terse traz disapproved of anachos airs anacho considered traz crass and undiscriminating occasionally however they agreedas now on the need to destroy aila woudiver reith for his own part felt more concern for the dirdir from their spires they could almost look through the portals of the warehouse at the work within the dirdir inactivity seemed as unnatural as aila woudivers smile and to reith implied a dreadful stealth why dont they do something reith complained gnawing at the black sausage they must know were here impossible to predict dirdir conduct anacho replied they have lost interest in you what are men to them but vermin they prefer to chivy the pnume from their burrows you are no longer the subject of tsaugsh this is my supposition reith was not wholly reassured what of the phung or pnume whatever they are that come to watch us they arent there for their health he referred to the two black shapes which had been appearing of late on the salt flats always they came to stand against the sunset gaunt figures wearing black cloaks and widebrimmed black hats phung go alone they are not phung said traz pnume never appear by daylight and never so close to hei for fear of the dirdir anacho said so thenthey are pnumekin or more likely gzhindra on the occasion of their first appearance the creatures stood gazing toward the warehouse until carina fell behind the palisades then they vanished into the gloom their interest seemed more than casual reith was disturbed by the surveillance but could conceive of no remedy for it the next day was blurred by mist and drizzle the salt flats remained vacant on the day following the sun shone once more and at sundown the dark shapes came to stare toward the shed again afflicting reith with disquietude surveillance portended unpleasant events this on tschai was an axiom of existence carina hung low if theyre coming said anacho now is the time reith searched the salt flats through his scanscope theres nothing out there but tussocks and swampbush not even a lizard traz pointed over his shoulder there they are hmrnf said reith i just looked there he raised the magnification of the scanscope until the jump of his pulse caused the figures to jerk and bounce the faces backlit could not be distinguished they have hands said reith they are pnumekin anacho took the instrument after a moment he said they are gzhindra pnumekin expelled from the tunnels to trade with the pnume you must deal through the gzhindra the pnume will never dicker for themselves why should they come here we want no dealings with the pnume but they want dealings with us or so it seems perhaps theyre waiting for woudiver to appear traz suggested at sunset and sunset alone to traz came a sudden thought he moved away from the warehouse and somewhat past woudivers old office an eccentric little shack of broken brick and flints and looked back toward the warehouse he walked a hundred yards further out upon the salt flats and again looked back he gestured to reith and anacho who went out to join him observe the warehouse said traz youll now see who deals with the gzhindra from the black timber wall a glint of golden light jumped and flickered behind that light said traz is aila woudivers room the fat yellow shulk is signaling declared anacho in a fervent whisper reith drew a deep breath and controlled his fury foolish to expect anything else from woudiver who lived with intrigue as a fish lives with water in a measured voice he spoke to anacho can you read the signals yes ordinary stopandgo code suitable compensation for services time is now at hand the flickering light vanished thats all hes seen us through the crack reith muttered or he has no more light said traz for carina had dropped behind the palisades looking across the salt flats reith found that the gzhindra had gone as mysteriously as they had come we had better go talk to woudiver said reith hell tell anything but the truth said anacho i expect as much said reith we may be informed by what he doesnt tell us they went into the shed woudiver once again busy with his tatwork showed the three his affable smile it must be close to suppertime not for you said reith what exclaimed woudiver no food come now let us not carry our little joke too far why do you signal the gzhindra beyond a lifting of the hairless eyebrows woudiver evinced neither surprise nor guilt a business affair i occasionally deal with the underfolk what sort of dealings this and that one thing and another tonight i apologized for failing to meet certain commitments do you begrudge me my good reputation what commitments did you fail to meet come now chided woudiver you must allow my few little secrets i allow you nothing said reith im well aware that you plot mischief bah what a canard how should i plot anything trussed up by a chain i assure you that i do not regard my present condition as dignified if anything goes wrong said reith youll be hoisted six feet off the ground by the same chain youll have no dignity whatever woudiver made a gesture of waggish distaste and looked off across the room excellent progress seems to have been made no thanks to you ah you minimize my aid who provided the hull at great pains and small profit who arranged and organized who supplied invaluable acumen the same man that took all our money and betrayed us into the glass box said reith he went to sit across the room traz and anacho joined him the three watched woudiver now sulking in the absence of his supper we should kill him traz said flatly he plans evil for all of us i dont doubt that said reith but why should he deal with the pnume the dirdir would seem the parties most concerned they know im an earthman they may or may not be aware of the spaceship if they know they dont care said anacho they have no interest in other folk the pnume another matter they would know everything and they are most curious regarding the dirdir the dirdir in turn discover the pnume tunnels and flood them with gas woudiver called out you have forgotten my supper ive forgotten nothing said reith well then bring forth my food tonight i wish a whiteroot salad a stew of lentils garganflesh and slue a plate of good black cheese and my usual wine traz gave a bark of scornful laughter reith inquired why should we coddle your gut when you plot against us order your meals from the gzhindra woudivers face sagged he beat his hands upon his knees so now they torture poor aila woudiver who was only constant to his faith what a miserable destiny to live and suffer on this terrible planet reith turned away in disgust by birth halfdirdirman woudiver vigorously affirmed the doctrine of bifold genesis which traced the origin of dirdir and dirdirman to twin cells in a primeval egg on the planet sibol from such a viewpoint reith must seem an irresponsible iconoclast to be thwarted at all costs on the other hand woudivers crimes could not all be ascribed to doctrinal ardor recalling certain instances of lechery and selfindulgence reiths twinges of pity disappeared for five minutes longer woudiver groaned and complained and then became suddenly quiet for a period he watched reith and his companions he spoke and reith thought to detect a secret glee your project approaches completionthanks to aila woudiver his craft and his poor store of sequins unfeelingly sequestered i agree that the project approaches completion said reith when do you propose to depart tschai as soon as possible remarkable declared woudiver with unctuous fervor reith thought that his eyes sparkled with amusement but then you are a remarkable man woudivers voice took on a sudden resonance as if he could no longer restrain his inner mirth still on occasion it is better to be modest and ordinary what do you think of that i dont know what youre talking about true said woudiver that is correct since you feel disposed for conversation said reith why not tell me something about the gzhindra what is there to tell they are sad creatures doomed to trudge the surface though they stand in fear of the open have you ever wondered why pnume pnumekin phung and gzhindra all wear hats with broad brims i suppose that it is their habit of dress true but the deeper reason is the brims hide the sky what impels these particular gzhindra out under the sky which oppresses them like all men said woudiver somewhat pompously they hope they yearn in what precise regard in any absolute or ultimate sense said woudiver i am of course ignorant all men are mysteries even you perplex me adam reith you harry me with capricious cruelty you pour my money into an insane scheme you ignore every protest every plea of moderation why i ask myself why why if it were not all so preposterous i could indeed believe you a man of another world you still havent told me what the gzhindra want said reith with vast dignity woudiver rose to his feet the chain from the iron collar swung and jangled you had best take up this matter with the gzhindra themselves he went to his table and after a final cryptic glance toward reith took up his tatting chapter two reith twitched and trembled in a nightmare he dreamt that he lay on his usual couch in woudivers old office the room was pervaded by a curious yellowgreen glow woudiver stood across the room chatting with a pair of motionless men in black capes and broadbrimmed black hats reith strained to move but his muscles were limp the yellowgreen light waxed and waned woudiver was now frosted with an uncanny silverblue incandescence the typical nightmare of helplessness and futility thought reith he made desperate efforts to awake but only started a clammy sweat woudiver and the gzhindra gazed down at him woudiver surprisingly wore his iron collar but the chain had been broken or melted a foot from his neck he seemed complacent and unconcerned the woudiver of old the gzhindra showed no expression other than intentness their features were long narrow and very regular their skin pallid ivory shone with the luster of silk one carried a folded cloth the other stood with hands behind his back woudiver suddenly loomed enormous he called out adam reith adam reith where is your home reith struggled against his impotence a weird and desolate dream one that he would long remember the planet earth he croaked the planet earth woudivers face expanded and contracted are other earthmen on tschai yes the gzhindra jerked forward woudiver called in a hornlike voice where where are the earthmen all men are earthmen woudiver stood back mouth drooping in saturnine disgust you were born on the planet earth yes woudiver floated back in triumph he gestured largely to the gzhindra a rarity a nonesuch we will take him the gzhindra unfolded the cloth which reith to his helpless horror saw to be a sack without ceremony the gzhindra pulled it up over his legs tucked him within until only his head protruded then with astonishing ease one of the gzhindra threw the sack over his back while the other tossed a pouch to woudiver the dream began to fade the yellowgreen light became spotty and blurred the door flew suddenly open to reveal traz woudiver jumped back in horror traz raised his catapult and fired into woudivers face an astonishing gush of blood spewed forthgreen blood and wherever droplets fell they glistened yellow the dream went dim reith slept reith awoke in a state of extreme discomfort his legs were cramped a vile arsenical reek pervaded his head he sensed pressure and motion groping he felt coarse cloth dismal knowledge came upon him the dream was real he indeed rode in a sack ah the resourceful woudiver reith became weak with emotion woudiver had negotiated with the gzhindra he had arranged that reith be drugged probably through a seepage of narcotic gas the gzhindra were now carrying him off to unknown places for unknown purposes for a period reith sagged in the sack numb and sick woudiver even while chained by the neck had worked his mischief reith collected the final fragments of his dream he had seen woudiver with his face split apart pumping green blood woudiver had paid for his trick reith found it hard to think the sack swung and he felt a rhythmic thud apparently the sack was being carried on a pole by sheer luck he wore his clothes the night previously he had flung himself down on his cot fully dressed was it possible that he still carried his knife his pouch was gone the pocket of his jacket seemed to be empty and he dared not grope lest he signal the fact of his consciousness to the gzhindra he pressed his face close to the sack hoping to see through the coarse weave unsuccessfully the time was yet night he thought that they traveled uneven terrain an indeterminate time went by with reith as helpless as a baby in the womb how many strange events the nights of old tschai had known and now another with himself a participant he felt ashamed and demeaned he quivered with rage if he could get his hands on his captors what a vengeance he would take the gzhindra halted and for a moment stood perfectly quiet then the sack was lowered to the ground reith listened but heard no voices no whispers no footsteps it seemed as if he were alone he reached to his pocket hoping to find a knife a tool an edge he found nothing he tested the fabric with his fingernails the wave was coarse and harsh and would not rip an intimation told him that the gzhindra had returned he lay quiet the gzhindra stood nearby and he thought that he heard whispering the sack moved it was lifted and carried reith began to sweat something was about to happen the sack swung he dangled from a rope he felt the sensation of descent down down down how far he could not estimate he halted with a jerk to swing slowly back and forth from high above came the reverberation of a gong a low melancholy sound reith kicked and pushed he became frantic victim to a claustrophobic spasm he panted and sweated and could hardly catch his breath this was how it felt to go crazy sobbing and hissing he took command of himself he searched his jacket to no avail no metal no cutting edge he clenched his mind forced himself to think the gong was a signal someone or something had been summoned he groped around the sack hoping to find a break no success he needed metal sharpness a blade an edge from head to toe he took stock his belt with vast difficulty he pulled it loose and used the sharp pin on the buckle to score the fabric he achieved a tear thrusting and straining he ripped the material and finally thrust forth his head and shoulders never in his life had he known such exultation if he died within the moment at least he had defeated the sack conceivably he might score other victories he looked along a rude rough cavern dimly illuminated by a few bluewhite buttons of light the floor almost brushed the bottom of the bag reith recalled the descent and final jerk with a qualm he heaved himself out of the sack to stand trembling with cramp and fatigue listening to dead underground silence he thought to hear a far sound something someone was astir above him the cavern rose in a chimney the rope merging with the darkness somewhere up there must be an opening into the outer worldbut how far in the bag he had swung with a cycle of ten or twelve seconds which by rough calculation gave a figure of considerably more than a hundred feet reith looked down the cavern and listened someone would be coming in answer to the gong he looked up the rope at the top was the outer world he took hold of the rope started to climb up he went into the dark heaving and clinging up up up the sack and the cavern became part of a lost world he was enveloped in darkness his hands burned his shoulders grew warm and weak then he reached the top of the rope groping fumbling he discovered that it passed through a slot in a metal plate which rested upon a pair of heavy metal beams the plate seemed a kind of trapdoor which clearly could not be opened while his weight hung on the rope his strength was failing he wrapped the rope around his legs and reached out with an arm to one side he felt a metal shelf it was the web of the beam supporting the trapdoor a foot or more wide he rested a momenttime was growing short then lurched out with his leg and tried to heave himself across for a sickening instant he felt himself falling he strained desperately with his heart thumping he dragged himself across to the web of the beam here sick and miserable he lay panting a minute passed hardly long enough for the rope to become still below four bobbing lights approached reith balanced himself and heaved up at the metal plate it was solid and heavy he might as well have been shoving at the mountainside once again he thrust with all his might without the slightest effect the lights were below carried by four dark shapes reith pressed back against the vertical section of the beam the four below moved slowly in eerie silence like creatures underwater they went to examine the sack and found it empty reith could hear whispers and mutters they looked all around the lights blinking and flickering by some kind of mutual impulse all stared up reith pressed himself flat against the metal and hid the pallid blotch of his face the glow of the lights played past him upon the trapdoor which he saw to be locked by four twistlatches controlled from above the lights veering away searched the sides of the shaft the folk below stood in puzzled consultation after a final inspection of the cavern a last flicker of light up the shaft they returned the way they had come flashing their lights from side to side reith huddled high in the dark wondering whether he might not still be dreaming but the sad desolate circumstances were real enough he was trapped he could not raise the door above him it might not be opened again for weeks unthinkable to crouch batlike waiting for better or worse reith made up his mind he looked down the passage the lights bobbing willothewisps were already far and dim he slid down the rope and set off in pursuit running with long gliding steps he had a single notion a desperate hope rather than a plan to isolate one of the dark figures and somehow force him to lead the way to the surface above burned the first of the dim blue buttons casting a glow dimmer than moonlight but sufficient to show a way winding between rock buttresses advancing alternately from either side reith presently caught up with the four who moved slowly investigating the passage to either side in a hesitant perplexed fashion reith began to feel an insane exhilaration as if he were already dead and invulnerable he thought to pick up a pebble and toss it at the dark figures hysteria the notion instantly sobered him if he wanted to survive he must take a grip on himself the four moved with uneasy deliberation whispering and muttering among themselves dodging from one pocket of shadow to another reith approached as closely as he dared to be ready in case one should detach himself except for a fleeting glimpse in the dungeons at pera he had never seen a pnume these from what reith could observe of their posture and gait seemed human the passage opened into a cavern with almost purposeful roughnessor perhaps the rudeness concealed a delicacy beyond reiths understanding as in the case of a shoulder of quartz thrusting forth to display a coruscation of pyrite crystals the area seemed to be a junction a node a place of importance with three other passages leading away an area at the center had been floored with smooth stone slabs light somewhat stronger than that in the cavern issued from luminous grains in the overhead rock a fifth individual stood to the side like the others he wore a black cloak and widebrimmed black hat reith flat as a cockroach slid forward into a pocket of dense shadow close by the chamber the fifth individual was also a pnumekin reith could see his long visage dismal white and bleak for an interval he took no notice of the first four and they appeared not to see him a curious ritual of mutual disregard which aroused reiths interest gradually the five seemed to wander together none looking directly at the others there came a hushed murmur of voices reith strained to listen they spoke the universal tongue of tschai so much he could understand from the intonations the four reported the circumstances attendant upon finding the empty sack the fifth an official or monitor made the smallest possible indication of dismay it seemed that restraint unobtrusiveness delicacy of allusion were key aspects of subtschai existence they wandered across the chamber and into the cavern close by reith who pressed himself against the wall the group halted not ten feet distant and reith could now hear the conversation one spoke in a careful even voice delivery this is not known nothing was found another said the passage was empty if defalcation occurred before the bag was lowered here would be an explanation imprecision said the monitor the bag would not then have been lowered imprecision exists in either case the passage was clear and empty he must still be there said the tunnel monitor he cannot be anywhere else unless a secret adit enters the passage of which he knows the monitor stood straight arms at his sides the presence of such an adit is not known to me the explanation is remotely conceivable you must make a new and absolutely thorough search i will inquire as to the possibility of such a secret adit the passagetenders returned slowly along the cavern lights flickering up and down back and forth the monitor stood looking after them reith tensed himself a critical moment turning in one direction the monitor must certainly see reith not six feet away if he turned in the other direction reith was temporarily secure reith considered an attack upon the man but the four were still close at hand a cry a sound a scuffle would attract their attention reith contained himself the monitor turned away from reith walking softly he crossed the chamber and entered one of the side passages reith followed running on the balls of his feet he peered down the passage each wall was a ledge of pyroxilite remarkable crystals thrust forth from either side some a foot in diameter faceted like brilliants russetbrown blackbrown greenishblack they had been artfully cleaned and polished to show to best advantage enormous effort had been spent in this corridor the crystals offered convenient objects behind which to take concealment reith set off at a soundless lope after the gliding pnumekin hoping to take him unawares and put him in fear of his life a primitive and desperate plan but reith could think of nothing better the pnumekin halted and reith jumped nervously behind a shoulder of glossy olive crystals the pnumekin after a glance up and down the passage reached to the wall pushed at a small crystal touched another a segment of the wall fell aside the pnumekin stepped through the portal closed the passage was empty reith was now angry with himself why had he paused when the pnumekin had halted reith should have been upon him he looked up and down the corridor no one in sight he went on at a fast trot and after a hundred yards came abruptly upon the rim of a great shaft far below gleamed dim yellow lights and a motion of bulky objects which reith could not identify reith returned to the door through which the pnumekin had disappeared he paused his mind racing with angry schemes for a desperate wretch like himself any course of action was risky but the sure way to disaster was inaction reith reached out and worked at the rock as he had seen the pnumekin do the door fell aside reith drew back ready for anything he looked into a chamber thirty feet in diameter a conference room or so reith deduced from the round central table the benches the shelves and cabinets he stepped through the opening and the door closed behind him he looked around the chamber lightgrains powdered the ceiling the walls had been meticulously chipped and ground to enhance the crystalline structure of the rock to the right an arched corridor plastered in white led away to the left were shelves cabinets a closet from the corridor came a dull staccato knocking a sound which carried a message of urgency reith already as taut as a burglar looked around in a panic for a place to hide he ran to the closet slid the door ajar pushed aside the black cloaks hanging from hooks and squeezed within the cloaks and the black hats at the back gave off a musty odor reiths stomach gave a jerk he huddled back and slid the door shut putting his eye to a crack he looked out into the room time stood still reiths stomach began to jerk with tension the pnumekin monitor returned to the chamber to stand as if in deep thought the queer widebrimmed hat shadowed his austere features which reith noted were almost classically regular reith thought of the other mancomposites of tschai all more or less mutated toward their hostrace the dirdirmensinister absurdities the stupid and brutish chaschmen the venal overcivilized wankhmen the essential humanity of all these except perhaps in the case of the dirdirman immaculates remained intact the pnumekin on the other hand had undergone no perceptible physical evolvement but their psyches had altered they seemed as remote as specters the creature across the roomreith could not think of him as a man stood quiet without a twitch to his features just inconveniently too distant for a lurch and a lunge out of the closet reith began to feel cramped he shifted his position producing a small sound in a cold sweat he pressed his eye to the crack the pnumekin stood absorbed in reverie reith willed him to approach urged him closer closer closer a thought came to disturb him suppose the creature refused to heed a threat against his life perhaps it lacked the ability to feel fear the portal swung ajar another pnumekin entered one of the passagetenders the two looked aside ignoring each other the newcomer spoke in a soft voice as if musing aloud the delivery cannot be found the passage and shaft have been scrutinized the tunnel monitor made no response silence of an eerie dreamlike quality ensued the passagetender spoke again he could not have passed us delivery was not made or else he escaped by an adit unknown to us these are the alternative possibilities the monitor spoke the information is noted transit control should be instituted at ziad level zuddanziad at ferstan node six at lullil node and at foreverness station such will be the situation a pnume came into the chamber using an aperture beyond reiths range of vision the pnumekin paid no heed not so much as glancing aside reith studied the oddly jointed creature the first pnume he had seen except for a darkling glimpse in the dungeons of pera it stood about the height of a man and within its voluminous black cloak seemed slight even frail a black hat shaded its eyesockets its visage the cast and color of a horses skull was expressionless under the lower edge a complicated set of rasping and chewing parts surrounded a nearinvisible mouth the articulation of the creatures legs worked in reverse to that of the human it moved forward with the motion of a man walking backwards the narrow feet were bare and mottled dark red and black three arched toes tapped the ground as a nervous man might tap his fingers the pnumekin tunnel monitor spoke softly into the air an abnormal situation when an item of delivery is no more than an empty sack the passage and the shaft have been scrutinized the item either was not delivered or it made evasion by using a secret adit of quality seven or higher silence from the pnume in a husky muffled murmur came words verification of delivery cannot be made the possibility of a classified adit exists above quality ten and beyond the scope of my secrets we may properly solicit information from the section warden the tunnel monitor spoke in a voice of tentative inquiry the delivery then is an item of interest the pnumes toes drummed the floor with the delicacy of a pianists fingers it is for foreverness a creature from contemporary manplanet decision was made to take it reith cramped in the locker wondered why the decision had been delayed so long he eased his position gritting his teeth against the possibility of a sound when once again he put his eye to the crack the pnume had departed the monitor and the passagetender stood quietly taking no notice of each other time passed how long reith could not judge his muscles throbbed and ached and now he feared to shift his position he took a long slow breath and composed himself to patience at odd intervals the pnumekin spoke in murmurs looking aside all the while as if they addressed the air reith distinguished a phrase or two the condition of manplanet there is no knowing barbarians surface dwellers mad as gzhindra valuable item invisible the pnume reappeared followed by another a creature tall and gaunt stepping with the soft tread of a fox it carried a rectangular case which it placed with delicate precision upon a bench three feet in front of reith then it seemed to lose itself in reverie a moment passed the passagetender of lowest status spoke first when a delivery is signaled by the gong the bag is usually heavy an empty bag is cause for perplexity delivery evidently was not made or the item gained access to a secret adit over ten in quality the warden turned aside and spreading wide its black cloak touched the locks of the leather case the two pnumekin and the first pnume interested themselves in the crystals of the wall opening the case the warden brought forth a portfolio bound in limp blue leather the warden spread it apart with reverent care turned pages studied a tangle of colored lines the warden closed the portfolio replaced it in the case after a moment of musing he spoke in a voice so breathy and soft that reith had difficulty understanding him an ancient adit of quality fourteen exists it courses nine hundred yards northward descends and enters the jha nu the pnumekin were silent the first pnume spoke if the item came into the jha nu he might traverse the balcony descend by omafive into the upper great lateral he could then turn aside into blue rise or even zhu overlook and so reach the ghaun the warden spoke all this only if the item has knowledge of the secrets if we assume his use of a quality fourteen adit then we can assume the rest the manner by which our secrets have been disseminatedif this is the caseis not clear perplexing murmured the passagetender the monitor said if a ghiant knows quality fourteen secrets how can these be safe from the dirdir the toes of both pnume arched and tapped the stone floor the circumstances are not yet clear remarked the warden a study of the adit will provide exact information the lowstatus passagetenders were first to leave the room the monitor apparently lost in reflection sidled after them leaving the two pnume standing still and rigid as a pair of insects the first pnume went off padding on soft forwardkicking strides the warden remained reith wondered if he should not burst forth and attempt to overpower the warden he restrained himself if the pnume shared the fantastic strength of the phung reith would be at a terrible disadvantage another consideration would the pnume become pliant with pressure reith could not know he suspected not the warden took up the leather case and turned a deliberate stare to all quarters of the chamber it appeared to listen moving with uncharacteristic abruptness it carried the case to an expanse of blank wall reith watched in fascination the warden slid forward its foot delicately touched three knobs of rock with its toes a section of wall fell back revealing a cavity into which the warden tucked the case the rock slid back the wall was solid the warden went off after the others chapter three the room was empty reith stumbled forth from the closet he hobbled across the room the wall showed no crack no seam the workmanship was of microscopic accuracy reith bent low touched the three protuberances the rock moved back and aside reith brought forth the case after the briefest of hesitations he opened the case removed the portfolio from the closet he brought a carton of small dark bottles approximately the same weight as the portfolio which he closed into the case and replaced all into the cavity he touched the knobs the cavity closed the wall was solid rock reith stood in the center of the room holding the portfolio obviously a valuable article if he were able to evade detection and capture if he were able to decipher the pnume cartography all of which seemed intrinsically unlikely he might conceivably discover a route to the surface from the closet he brought a cloak which he draped about himself and a hat somewhat too small but which by dint of twisting and stretching he managed to pull low over his head the pnumekin habit of furtive unobtrusiveness would serve him well no one would attempt greater furtiveness less obtrusiveness than himself now he must leave the immediate area and find some secluded spot where he might examine the portfolio at his leisure he tucked the portfolio into his jacket and set off along the white plastered corridor putting one foot softly in front of the other as he had seen the pnumekin do the corridor stretched long and empty ahead at last opening upon a balcony which overlooked a long room from which came a hum and shuffle of activity the floor of the chamber was twenty feet below on the walls were charts and ideograms in the center pnumekin children took instruction reith had come upon a pnumekin school standing back in the shadows reith was able to look down without fear of detection he saw three groups of children both male and female twenty to each group like their elders they wore black cloaks and hats with flattened crowns the small white faces were peaked and pinched and almost laughably earnest none spoke staring into empty air they marched softly and solemnly through a drill or exercise they were attended by three pnumekin women of indefinite age cloaked like the males and distinguishable only by lesser stature and somewhat less harshness of feature the children padded on and on through the exercise the silence broken only by the shuffle of their feet nothing could be learned here thought reith he looked in both directions then set off to the left an arched tunnel gave upon another balcony which overlooked a chamber even larger than the first a refectory tables and benches were ranked down the middle but the chamber was vacant except for two pnumekin who sat widely separated crouched low over bowls of gruel reith became aware of his own hunger he heard a sound along the balcony came a pair of pnumekin one behind the other reiths heart began to thump so loudly he feared they would surely hear the sound as they approached he pulled down his head hunched his shoulders moved forward in what he hoped to be the typical pnumekin gait the two passed by eyes averted thoughts on matters far removed with somewhat more assurance reith continued along the passage which almost immediately expanded to become a roughly circular node the junction for three corridors a staircase cut from the natural gray rock curved down to the level below the corridors were desolate and dim reith thought them unpromising he hesitated feeling tired and futile the charts he decided were of no great help he needed the assistance willing or otherwise of a pnumekin he was also very hungry gingerly he went to the staircase and after ten seconds of indecision descended begrudging every step which took him farther from the surface he came out into a small anteroom beside the refectory a portal nearby gave upon what appeared to be a kitchen reith looked in cautiously a number of pnumekin worked at counters presumably preparing food for the children in the exercise room reith backed regretfully away and went off down a side passage this was dim and quiet with only a few lightgrains in the high ceiling after a hundred feet the passage jogged to the side and came to an abrupt end at the brink of a dropoff from below the sound of running water more than likely a disposalplace for waste and garbage reith reflected he halted wondering where to go and what to do then returned to the anteroom here he discovered a small storage chamber in which were stacked bags sacks and cartons food thought reith he hesitated the chamber must frequently be used by the cooks from the exercise room came the children walking in single file eyes fixed drearily on the floor reith backed into the storage room the children would discern his strangeness far more readily than adults he crouched at the back of the room behind a pile of stacked cartons by no means the most secure of hiding places but not altogether precarious even if someone entered the chamber he stood a good chance of evading attention reith relaxed somewhat he brought forth the portfolio and folded back the limp blue leather cover the pages were a beautiful soft vellum the cartography was printed with most meticulous care in black red brown green and pale blue but the patterns and lines conveyed no information the legend was set forth in undecipherable characters regretfully reith folded the portfolio and tucked it into his jacket from a counter in front of the kitchen the children took bowls and carried them into the refectory reith watched through a cranny between the cartons more than ever aware of hunger and thirst he investigated the contents of a sack to find dried pilgrimpod a leathery wafer highly nutritious but not particularly appetizing the cartons beside him contained tubes of a greasy black paste rancid and sharp to the taste apparently a condiment reith turned his attention to the serving counter the last of the children had carried their bowls into the refectory the serving area was vacant but on the counter remained half a dozen bowls and flasks reith acted without conscious calculation he emerged from the storage room hunched his shoulders went to the counter took a bowl and a flask and retreated hurriedly to his hiding place the bowl contained pilgrimpod gruel cooked with raisinlike nubbins slivers of pale meat two stalks of a celerylike vegetable the flask held a pint of faintly effervescent beer with a pleasantly astringent bite to the flask was clipped a packet of six round wafers which reith tasted but found unpalatable he ate the gruel and drank the beer and congratulated himself on his decisiveness to the serving area came six older children slender young people detached and broodingly selfsufficient peering between the cartons reith decided that all were female five passed by the counter taking bowls and flasks the last to come by finding nothing to eat stood in puzzlement reith watched with the guilty awareness that he had stolen and devoured her supper the first five went into the refectory leaving the one girl waiting uncertainly by the counter five minutes passed she spoke no word standing with her eyes fixed on the floor at last unseen hands set another bowl and flask down on the counter the pnumekin girl took the food and went slowly into the refectory reith became uneasy he decided to return up the stairs to select one of the passages and hope to meet some lone knowledgeable pnumekin who could be overpowered and put in fear for his life he rose to his feet but now the children began to leave the refectory and reith stood back one by one on noiseless feet they filed into the exercise room once more reith looked forth and once more retreated as now the five older girls issued from the refectory they were alike as mannequins from the factory slender and straight with skins as pale and thin as paper arched coalblack eyebrows and regular if somewhat peaked features they wore the usual black cloaks and black hats which accentuated the quaint and eerie nonearthliness of the earthly bodies they might have been five versions of the same person although reith even as the idea crossed his mind knew that each made sure distinctions too subtle for his knowing between herself and the others each felt her personal existence to be the central movement of the cosmos the serving area was empty reith stepped forth and on long quick strides crossed to the stairs only just in time from the kitchen came one of the cooks to go to the storage room had reith delayed another moment he would have been discovered heart beating fast he started up the stairs he stopped short and stood holding his breath from above came a soft sound the padpadpad of footsteps reith froze in his tracks the sounds became louder down the stairs came the mottled red and black feet of a pnume then the flutter of black cloth reith hurriedly retreated to stand indecisively at the foot of the stairs where to go he looked about frantically in the storage room the cook ladled pilgrimpod from a sack the children occupied the exercisechamber reith had a single choice he hunched his shoulders and stalked softly into the refectory at a middle table sat a pnumekin girl she whose supper he had commandeered reith took what he considered the most inconspicuous seat and sat sweating his disguise was makeshift a single direct glance would reveal his identity silent minutes passed the pnumekin girl lingered over the packet of wafers which she seemed especially to enjoy at last she rose to her feet and started to leave the chamber reith lowered his head too sharply too abruptlya discordant movement the girl turned a startled glance in his direction and even now habit was strong she looked past him without directly focusing her eyes but she saw she knew for an instant she remained frozen her face loose and incredulous then she uttered a soft cry of terror and started to run from the room reith was instantly upon her to stifle her with his hand and thrust her against the wall be quiet reith muttered dont make any noise do you understand she stared at him in a kind of horrified daze reith gave her a shake dont make a sound do you understand nod your head she managed to jerk her head reith took away his hand listen he whispered listen carefully i am a man of the surface i was kidnapped and brought down here i escaped and now i want to return to the surface do you hear me she made no response do you understand answer he gave the thin shoulders another shake yes do you know how to reach the surface she shifted her gaze to stare at the floor reith darted a glance toward the serving area if one of the cooks should happen to look into the refectory all was lost and the pnume who had descended the stairs what of him and the balcony reith had forgotten the balcony with a sick thrill of fear he searched the high shadows no one stood watching but they could remain here no longer not another minute he grasped the girl by the arm come along not a sound remember or ill have to hurt you he pulled her along the wall to the entrance the serving area was empty from the kitchen came a grinding sound and a clatter of metal of the pnume there was no sign up the stairs whispered reith she made a sound of protest reith clapped his hand over her mouth and dragged her to the staircase up do as i say and you wont be harmed she spoke in a soft even voice go away i want to go away reith declared in a passionate mutter i dont know where to go i cant help you youve got to help me up the stairs quick now suddenly she turned and ran up the stairs so light on her feet that she seemed to float reith was taken by surprise he sprang after her but she outdistanced him and sped down one of the corridors in desperation she fled in equal desperation reith pursued and after fifty feet caught her he thrust her against the wall where she stood panting reith looked up and down the corridor no one was in sight to his vast relief do you want to die he hissed in her ear no then do exactly what i tell you growled reith he hoped that the threat convinced her and indeed her face sagged her eyes became wide and dark she tried to speak and finally asked what do you want me to do first lead the way to a quiet place where no one comes with sagging shoulders she turned away and proceeded along the corridor reith asked suspiciously where are you taking me to the punishment place a moment later she turned into a side corridor which almost at once ended in a round chamber the girl went to a pair of black flint cabochons looking over her shoulder like a fairytale witch she pushed the black bulbs a portal opened upon black space the girl stepped through with reith close behind she touched a switch from a lightpanel came a wan illumination they stood on a ledge at the edge of a brink a crazy insectleg derrick tilted over profound darkness from the end hung a rope reith looked at the girl she looked silently back at him with a kind of halffrightened halfsullen indifference holding to the derrick reith looked gingerly over the brink a cold draft blew up into his face and he turned away the girl stood motionless reith suspected that the sudden convulsion of events had put her into a state of shock the tight hat constricted his head he pulled it off the girl shrank back against the wall why do you take off the hat it hurts my head said reith the girl flicked her glance past him and away into the darkness she asked in a soft muffled voice what do you want me to do take me to the surface as fast as you can the girl made no answer reith wondered if she had heard him he tried to look into her face she turned away reith twitched off her hat a strange eerie face looked at him the bloodless mouth quivering in panic she was older than her underdeveloped figure suggested though reith could not accurately have estimated her age her features were wan and dreary so regular as to be nondescript her hair a short black mat clung to her scalp like a cap of felt reith thought that she seemed anemic and neurasthenic at once human and nonhuman female and sexless why do you do that she asked in a hushed murmur for no particular reason curiosity perhaps it is intimate she muttered and put her hands up to her thin cheeks reith shrugged uninterested in her modesty i want you to take me to the surface i cant why not she made no answer arent you afraid of me reith asked gently not as much as the pit the pit is yonder and convenient she gave him a startled glance would you throw me into the pit reith spoke in what he hoped to be a menacing voice i am a fugitive i intend to reach the surface i dont dare help you her voice was soft and matteroffact the zuzhma kastchai would punish me she looked at the derrick the dark is terrible we are afraid of the dark sometimes the rope is cut and the person is never heard again reith stood baffled the girl reading a dire meaning into his silence said in a meek voice even if i wished to help you how could i i know only the way to the blue rise popout where i would not be allowed unless she added as an afterthought i declared myself a gzhindra you of course would be taken reiths scheme began to topple around his head then take me to some other exit i know of none those are secrets not taught at my level come over here under the light said reith look at this he brought forth the portfolio opened it and set it before her show me where we are now the girl looked she made a choking sound and began to tremble what is this something i took from a pnume these are the master charts my life is done i will be thrown into the pit please dont complicate such a simple matter said reith look at the charts find a route to the surface take me there then do as you like no one will know the difference the girl stared with a wild unreasoning gaze reith gave her thin shoulder a shake whats wrong with you her voice came in a toneless mutter i have seen secrets reith was in no mood to commiserate with troubles so abstract and unreal very well youve seen the charts the damage is done now look again and find a way to the surface a strange expression came over the thin face reith wondered if she had gone mad for a fact of all the pnumekin walking the corridors what wry providence had directed him to an emotionally unstable girl she was looking at him for the first time directly and searchingly you are a ghian i live on the surface certainly what is it like is it terrible the surface of tschai it has its deficiencies i now must be a gzhindra its better than living down here in the dark the girl said in her dull voice i must go to the ghaun the sooner the better said reith look at this map again show me where we are i cant look moaned the girl i dare not look come now snapped reith its only paper only paper it crawls with secrets class twenty secrets my mind is too small reith suspected incipient hysteria although her voice had remained a soft monotone to become a gzhindra you must reach the surface to reach the surface we must find an exit the more secret the better here we have secret charts we are in luck she became quiet and even glanced from the corner of her eyes toward the portfolio how did you get this i took it from a pnume he pushed the portfolio toward her can you read the symbols i am trained to read gingerly she leaned over the portfolio to jerk instantly back in fear and revulsion reith forced himself to patience you have never seen a map before i have a level of four i know class four secrets i have seen class four maps this is class twenty but you can read this map yes the word came with sour distaste but i dare not only a ghian would think to examine such a powerful document her voice trailed away to a murmur let alone steal it what will the pnume do when they find it is gone the girl looked off over the gulf dark dark dark i will fall forever through the dark reith began to grow restive the girl seemed able to concentrate only on those ideas rising from her own mind he directed her attention to the map what do the colors signify the levels and stages and these symbols doors portals secret ways touchplates communication stations rises popouts observation posts show me where we are now reluctantly she focused her eyes not this sheet turn back back back here she pointed her finger a cautious two inches from the paper there the black mark is the pit the pink line is the ledge show me the nearest route to the surface that would belet me look reith managed a distant and reflective smile once diverted from her woes which were real enough reith admitted the girl became instantly intense and even forgot the exposure of her face bluerise popout is here to get there one would go by this lateral then up this pale orange ramp but it is a crowded area with administrative wickets you would be taken and i likewise now that i have seen the secrets the question of responsibility and guilt flickered through reiths mind but he put it aside cataclysm had come to his life like the plague it had infected her as well perhaps similar ideas circulated in her mind she darted a quick sidelong glance again how did you come in from the ghaun the gzhindra let me down in a sack i cut my way out before the pnumekin came i hope they decide that the gzhindra lowered an empty sack with one of the great charts missing no person of the shelters would touch it the zuzhma kastchai will never rest until both you and i are dead i become ever more anxious to escape said reith i also remarked the girl with ingenuous simplicity i do not wish to fall reith watched her a moment or two wondering that she appeared to bear him no rancor it was as if he had come to her as an elemental calamitya storm a lightningbolt a floodagainst which resentment argument entreaty would have been equally useless already he thought a subtle change had come over her attitude she bent to inspect the chart somewhat less gingerly than before she pointed to a pale brown y theres the palisades exit where trading is done with the ghian i have never been so far could we go up at this point never the zuzhma kastchai guard against the dirdir there is continual vigilance reith pointed to the other pale brown ys these are other openings to the surface yes but if they believe you to be at large they will block off here and here and hereshe pointedand all these openings are barred and these in exa section as well then we must go somewhere else to other sectors the girls face twitched i know nothing of such places look at the map she did his bidding running her finger close above the mesh of colored lines but not yet daring to touch the paper itself i see here a secret way quality eighteen it runs from the passage out yonder to parallel twelve and it shortens the way by a half then we might go along any of these adits to the freight docks reith rose to his feet he pulled the hat over his face do i look like a pnumekin she gave him a brief unsympathetic inspection your face is strange your skin is dark from the ghaun weather take some dust and wipe it on your face reith did as he was bid the girl watched with an expressionless gaze reith wondered what went on in her mind she had declared herself an outcast a gzhindra without overmuch agony of the spirit or did she contrive a subtle betrayal betrayal was perhaps unfair reith reflected she had pledged him no faith she owed him no loyalty indeed something considerably the reverse so how could he control her after they set forth through the passages reith pondered and studied her while she became increasingly agitated why do you look at me like that reith held out the blue portfolio to her carry this under your cloak where it wont be seen the girl swayed back aghast no you must i dont dare the zuzhma kastchai conceal the charts under your cloak said reith in a measured voice im a desperate man and ill stop at nothing to return to the surface with limp fingers she took the portfolio turning her back and glancing warily over her shoulder at reith she tucked the portfolio out of sight under her cloak come then she croaked if we are taken it is how life must go never in my dreaming did i expect to be a gzhindra she opened the portal and looked out into the round chamber the way is clear remember walk softly do not lean forward we must pass through fer junction and there will be persons at their affairs the zuzhma kastchai wander everywhere if we meet one of these halt step into the shadows or face the wall this is the respectful way do not move quickly do not jerk your arms she stepped out into the round room and set off along the passage reith followed five or six paces behind trying to simulate the pnumekin gait he had forced the girl to carry the charts even so he was at her mercy she could run screaming to the first pnumekin they came upon and hope for mercy from the pnume the situation was unpredictable they walked half a mile up a ramp down another and into a main adit at twentyfoot intervals the narrow doorways opened into the rock beside each was a fluted pedestal with a flat polished upper surface the function of which reith could not calculate the passage widened and they entered fer junction a large hexagonal hall with a dozen polished marble pillars supporting the ceiling in dim little booths around the periphery sat pnumekin writing in ledgers or occasionally holding vague and seemingly indecisive colloquies with other pnumekin who had come to seek them out the girl wandered to the side and halted reith stopped as well she glanced at him then looked thoughtfully toward a pnumekin in the center of the room a tall haggard man with an unusually alert posture reith stepped into the shadow of a pillar and watched the girl her face was blank as a plate but reith knew her to be reviewing the circumstances which had overwhelmed her pale existence and his life depended on the balance of her fears the bottomless gulf against the windy brown skies of the surface slowly she moved toward reith and joined him in the shadow of the pillar for the moment at least she had made her decision the tall man yonder he is a listening monitor notice how he observes all nothing escapes him for a period reith stood watching the listening monitor becoming each minute more disinclined to cross the chamber he muttered to the girl do you know another route to the freight docks she pondered the matter having committed herself to flight her personality had become somewhat more focused as if danger had drawn her up out of the dreaming inversion of her former existence i think she said dubiously that another route passes by way of the work halls but it is a long way and other listening monitors are on hand hmmf reith turned to watch the listening monitor of fer junction notice he said presently he turns to look this way and that when his back is toward us ill move to the next pillar and you come after me a moment later the monitor swung around reith stepped out into the chamber sauntered to the nearest of the marble pillars the girl came slowly after him still somewhat indecisively or so it seemed to reith reith could not now peer around the pillar without the risk of attracting the monitors attention tell me when he looks away he muttered to the girl now reith gained the next pillar and using a file of slowmoving pnumekin as a screen continued on to the next now a single open area remained the monitor swung about abruptly and reith ducked back behind the pillar a deadly game of peekaboo from a passage to the side a pnume entered the chamber coming softly on forwardpadding legs the girl hissed under her breath the silent critic take care she drifted away head downcast as if in an abstraction the pnume halted not fifty feet from reith who turned his back only a few strides remained to the north of the passage reiths shoulder blades twitched he could bear to stand by the pillar no longer feeling every eye in the chamber pressing upon him he crossed the open area with each step he expected a cry of outrage an alarm the silence became oppressive only by great effort could he control the urge to look over his shoulder he reached the mouth of the passage and turned a cautious glance over his shoulderto stare full into the eye sockets of the pnume with pounding heart reith turned slowly and proceeded the girl had gone ahead he called to her in a soft voice run ahead find the class eighteen passage she turned back a startled glance the silent critic is close at hand i may not run if he saw he would think it boisterous conduct never mind the decorum said reith find the opening as fast as possible she quickened her step with reith coming behind after fifty yards he risked a glance to the rear no one followed the corridor branched the girl stopped short i think we go to the left but i am not sure look at the chart with vast distaste she turned her back and brought the portfolio from under her cloak she could not bring herself to handle it and gave it to reith as if it were hot he turned the pages till she said stop while she studied the colored lines reith kept his gaze to the rear far back where the passage met fer junction a dark shape appeared in the opening reith every nerve jerking willed the girl to haste to the left then at mark twoonetwo a blue tile style twentyfour i must consult the legend here it is four press points threeonefourtwo hurry reith said through gritted teeth she turned a startled look back down the passage zuzhma kastchai reith also looked back trying to simulate the pnumekin gait the pnume padded slowly forward but with no particular sense of purpose or so it seemed to reith he moved off along the passage and overtook the girl as she walked she counted the number marks at the base of the wall seventyfive eighty eightyfive reith looked back there were now two black shapes in the corridor from somewhere a second pnume had appeared one hundred ninetyfive two hundred two hundred and five the blue tile filmed with an antique redpurple luster was only a foot from the floor the girl found presspoints and touched them the outline of a door appeared the door slid open the girl began to shake it is quality eighteen i should not enter the silent critic is following us said reith she gasped and stepped into the passage it was narrow and dim and haunted by a faintly rancid odor reith had come to associate with the pnume the door slid shut the girl pushed up a shutter and put her eye to the lens of a peephole the silent critic is coming it suspects boisterous conduct and wants to issue a punishment no there are two he has summoned a warden she stood rigid eye pressed to the peephole reith waited on tenterhooks what are they doing they look along the corridor they wonder why we are not in view lets get moving said reith we cant stand here waiting the warden will know this passage if they come in never mind that reith set out along the passage and the girl came behind him a queer sight they made thought reith loping through the dark in the flapping black cloaks and lowcrowned hats the girl quickly became tired and further diminished her speed by looking over her shoulder she gave a croak of resignation and halted they have entered the passage reith looked behind the door stood ajar in the gap the two pnume were silhouetted for an instant they stood rigid like queer black dolls then they jerked into motion they see us said the girl and stood with her head hanging it will be the pit well then let us go to meet them in all meekness stand against the wall said reith dont move they must come to us there are only two you will be helpless reith made no comment he picked up a fistsize rock which had fallen from the ceiling and stood waiting you can do nothing moaned the girl use meekness placid conduct the pnume came quickly by forwardkicking steps the white undershot jaws twitching ten feet away they halted to contemplate the two who stood against the wall for a halfminute none of the group moved or made a sound the silent critic slowly raised its thin arm to point with two bony fingers go back reith made no move the girl stood with eyes glazed and mouth sagging the pnume spoke again in a husky fluting voice go back the girl started to stumble off along the passage reith made no motion the pnume watched him nonplussed they exchanged a sibilant whisper then the silent critic spoke again go the warden said in an almost inaudible murmur you are the item which escaped delivery the silent critic padding forward reached forth its arm reith hurled the rock with all his strength it struck full in the creatures bonewhite face a crunch and the creature tottered back to the wall to stand jerking and raising one leg up and down in a most eccentric manner the warden making a throaty gasping sound bounded forward reith jumped back snatched off his cloak and in an insane flourish threw it over the pnumes head for a moment the creature seemed not to notice and came forward arms outspread then it began to dance and stamp reith moved cautiously in and away looking for an instant of advantage and the two in their soundless gyrations performed a peculiar and grotesque ballet while the silent critic watched indifferently reith seized the wardens arm it felt like an iron pipe the other arm swung about two harsh fingerends tore across reiths face reith felt nothing he heaved swung the warden into the wall it rebounded and moved quickly upon reith reith slapped tentatively at the long pale face it felt cool and hard the strength of the creature was inhuman he must evade its grip which put him in something of a quandary if he struck the creature with his fists he would only break his hands step by step the warden padded forward legs bending forward reith threw himself to the ground kicked out at the creatures feet to topple it off balance it fell reith jumped up to evade the expected attack of the silent critic but it remained leaning gravely against the wall viewing the battle with the detachment of a bystander reith was puzzled and distracted by its attitude as a result the warden seized his ankle with the toes of one foot and with an amazing extension reached the other foot toward reiths neck reith kicked the creature in the crotch it was like kicking the crotch of a tree reith sprained his foot the toes gripped his neck reith seized the leg twisted applied leverage the pnume was forced around on its face reith scrambled down upon its back seizing the head he gave it a sudden terrible jerk backward a bone or stiff membrane gave elastically then snapped the warden thrashed here and there in wild palpitations by chance it gained its feet and with its head dangling backward bounded across the tunnel it struck the silent critic who slumped to the ground dead reiths eyes bulged dead reith leaned against the wall gasping for breath wherever the pnume had touched him was a bruise blood flowed down his face his elbow was wrenched his foot was sprained but two pnume lay dead a little distance away the girl crouched in a shockinduced trance reith stumbled forward touched her shoulder im alive youre alive your face bleeds reith wiped his face with the hem of his cloak he went to look down at the corpses drawing back his lips he searched the bodies but found nothing to interest him i suppose wed better keep on going said reith the girl turned and set off down the tunnel reith followed the pnume corpses remained to lie in the dimness the girls steps began to lag are you tired asked reith his solicitude puzzled her she looked at him warily no well i am lets rest for a while he lowered himself to the floor groaning and complaining after a moments hesitation she settled herself primly across the passage reith studied her with perplexity she had put the struggle with the pnume completely out of her mind or so it seemed her shadowed face was composed astonishing thought reith her life had come apart her future must seem a succession of terrifying question marks yet here she sat her face blank as that of a marionette with no apparent distress she spoke softly why do you look at me like that i was thinking he said that considering the circumstances you appear remarkably unconcerned she made no immediate reply there was a heavy silence in the dim passage then she said i float upon the current of life how should i question where it carries me it would be impudent to think of preferences existence after all is a privilege given a very few reith leaned back against the wall a very few how so the girl became uneasy her white fingers twisted how it goes on the ghaun i dont know perhaps you do things differently in the shelters the motherwomen spawn twelve times and no more than half sometimes lesssurvive she continued in a voice of didactic reflection i have heard that all the women of the ghaun are motherwomen is this true i cant believe it if each spawned twelve times and even if six went to the pit the ghaun would boil with living flesh it seems unreasonable she added as a possibly disconnected afterthought i am glad that i will never be a motherwoman again reith was puzzled how can you be sure youre young yet the girls face twitched with what might have been embarrassment cant you see do i look to be a motherwoman i dont know what your motherwomen look like they bulge at the chest and hips arent ghian mothers the same some say the pnume decide who will be motherwomen and take them to the creche there they lie in the dark and spawn alone they and the other mothers what of the fathers no need for fathers in the shelters all is secure protection is not needed reith began to entertain an old suspicion on the surface he said affairs go somewhat differently she leaned forward and her face displayed as much animation as reith had yet noticed i have always wondered about life on the ghaun who chooses the motherwomen where do they spawn reith evaded the question its a complicated situation in due course i suppose youll learn something about it if you live long enough meanwhile i am adam reith what is your name name i am a female yes but what is your personal name the girl considered on the invoices persons are listed by group area and zone my group is zith of athan area in the pagaz zone my ranking is zith athan pagaz zap its not much of a name still it suits you at reiths jocularity the girl looked blank tell me how the gzhindra live i saw them standing out on the wastelands they pumped narcotic gas into the room where i slept i woke up in a sack they lowered me into a shaft thats all i know of the gzhindra there must be better ways to live zap as reith now thought of her evinced disapproval they are persons after all and not wild things reith had no comment to make her innocence was so vast that any information whatever could only cause her shock and confusion youll find many kinds of people on the surface it is very strange the girl said in a vague soft voice suddenly all is changed she sat looking off into the darkness the others will wonder where i have gone someone will do my work what was your work i instructed children in decorum what of your spare time i grew crystals in the new east fourth range do you talk with your friends sometimes in the dormitory do you have friends among the men under the shadow of the hat the black eyebrows rose in displeasure its boisterous to talk to men sitting here with me is boisterous she said nothing the idea probably had not yet occurred to her thought reith now she considered herself a fallen woman on the surface he said life goes differently and sometimes becomes very boisterous indeed assuming that we survive to reach the surface he brought out the blue portfolio as if by reflex zap drew herself back reith paid no heed squinting through the dim light he studied the tangle of colored lines he put his finger down somewhat tentatively here it seems to me is where we are now no response from zap reith aching nervous and exhausted started to reprimand her for disinterest then caught his tongue she was not here of her own volition he reminded himself she deserved neither reprimands nor resentment by his actions he had made himself responsible for her reith gave a grunt of annoyance he drew a deep breath and said in his most polite voice if i recall correctly this passage leads over here he pointedand comes out into this pink avenue am i right zap looked down askance yes this is a most secret way notice it connects athan with zaltra otherwise one must go far around by way of feierj node grudgingly she came closer and brought her finger to within inches of the vellum this gray mark is where we want to go to the freightdock at the end of the supply arterial by feierj it would be impossible since the route leads through the dormitories and the metalspinning areas reith looked wistfully at the little red circles which marked the popouts they seem so close so easy they will certainly be guarded what is this long black line that is the freight canal and is the best route away from pagaz zone and this bright green spot she peered and drew a quick breath it is the way to foreverness a class twenty secret she sat back and huddled her chin into her knees reith returned to the charts he felt her gaze and looked up to find her studying him intently she licked her colorless mouth why are you such an important item i dont know why im an item at all though this was not precisely true they want you for foreverness are you of some strange race in a way said reith he heaved himself painfully to his feet are you ready we might as well be going she rose without comment and they set off along the dim passage they walked a mile and came to a white wall with a black iron door at the center zap put her eye to the peeplens a dray is passing persons are near she looked back at reith hold your head down she said in a critical voice pull the hat lower walk quietly with your feet pointed straight she turned back to the peephole her hand went to the doorcatch she pressed and the door opened quick before we are seen blinking and furtive they entered a wide arched passage the pegmatite walls were studded with enormous tourmalines which excited to fluorescence by some means unknown glowed pink and blue zap set off along the passage reith followed at a discreet distance fifty yards ahead a low dray loaded with sacks rolled on heavy black wheels from somewhere behind them came the sound of hammers tapping at metal and a scraping noise the source of which reith never learned for ten minutes they plodded along the corridor on four occasions pnumekin passed shadowed faces averted thoughts exploring areas beyond reiths imagination the polished pegmatite altered abruptly to black hornblende polished back from veins of white quartz which seemed to grow like veins over the black matrix the endproduct of unknown centuries of toil far ahead the passage dwindled to a minute black halfoval which by insensible degrees grew larger beyond was black vacancy the aperture expanded and surrounded them they came out on a ledge overlooking a void as black and empty as space fifty yards to the right a barge moored against the dock seemed to float in midair reith perceived the black void to be the surface of a subterranean lake a half dozen pnumekin worked listlessly upon the dock loading the barge with bales zap sidled into a pocket of shadow reith joined her standing somewhat too close for her liking she moved a few fastidious inches away what now asked reith follow me aboard the barge say no word to anyone no one objects they wont put us off the girl gave him a blank look persons ride the barges this is how they see the far tunnels ah said reith wanderlust among the pnumekin they go to look at a tunnel the girl gave him another blank look reith asked have you ever traveled on a barge before no how do you know where this barge goes it goes north to the areas it can go nowhere else she peered through the gloom follow me and walk with decorum she set off along the dock eyes downcast moving as if in a reverie reith waited a moment then went after her she paused beside the barge looked vacantly across the black void then as if absentmindedly she stepped across to the barge she walked to the outboard side and merged with the shadow of the bales reith imitated her demeanor the pnumekin on the dock immersed in their private thoughts paid him no heed reith stepped aboard the barge and then could not control the acceleration of his pace as he slipped into the shade of the cargo zap tense as wire peered at the dockworkers gradually she relaxed they are disconsolate otherwise they would have noticed do the ghian always lurch and lope when they move about i wouldnt be surprised said reith but no harm done next time he stopped short at the far end of the dock stood a dark shape it stirred came slowly toward the barge and entered the zone of illumination pnume whispered reith zap stood soundless the creature padded forward oblivious to the dockworkers who never so much as glanced aside it stepped softly along the dock and halted near the barge it saw us whispered the girl reith stood heavyhearted bruises aching legs and arms nerveless and dull he could not survive another fight in a husky whisper he asked can you swim a horrified gasp and a glance across the black void no reith searched for a weapon a club a hook a rope he found nothing the pnume passed beyond the range of vision a moment later they felt the barge tremble under its weight take off your cloak said reith he slipped out of his own and wrapping up the portfolio shoved both into a crevice of the cargo zap stood motionless take off your cloak she began to whimper reith clapped his hand over her mouth quiet he pulled the neck laces and touching her fragile chin found it trembling he jerked off her cloak put it with his own she stood halfcrouching in a kneelength shift reith for all the urgency of the moment resisted an insane desire to laugh at the thin adolescent figure under the black hat listen he said hoarsely i can tell you only once i am going over the side you must follow immediately put your hands on my shoulders hold your head from the water above all do not splash or flounder you will be safe not waiting for her acknowledgment he lowered himself over the side of the barge the frigid water rose up his body like a ring of icy fire zap hesitated only for an instant then went over the side probably only because she feared the pnume more than the wet void she gasped when her legs hit the water quiet hissed reith her hands went to his shoulders she lowered herself into the water and in a panic threw her arms around his neck easy whispered reith keep your face down he drifted in under the gunwale and gripped a bracket unless someone or something peered over the side of the barge they were virtually invisible a halfminute passed reiths legs began to grow numb zap clung to his back chin at his ear he could hear her teeth chattering her thin body pressed against him trapping warm pockets of water which pulsed away when one or the other moved once as a boy reith had rescued a drowning cat like zap it had clung to him with desperate urgency arousing in reith a peculiarly intense pang of protectiveness the bodies both frightened and wet projected the same elemental craving for life silence darkness cold the two in the water listened along the deck of the barge came a quiet sound the click of horny toes it stopped cautiously started then stopped once more directly overhead looking up reith saw toes gripping the edge of the gunwale he took one of zap s hands guided it to the bracket then the other once free he turned to face outward from the barge unctuous ripples moved away from him lenses of quincecolored light formed and vanished the toes over reiths head clicked on the gunwale they shifted their position reith lips drawn away from his teeth in a ghastly grimace lunged up with his right arm he caught a thin hard ankle pulled the pnume croaked in dismal consternation it teetered forward and for a moment leaned at an incredible angle almost horizontal supported only by the grip of its toes then it fell into the water zap clutched at reith dont let it touch you it will pull you apart can it swim no she said through chattering teeth it is heavy it will sink reith said climb up on my back take hold of the gunwale pull yourself aboard the barge gingerly she swung behind him her feet pushed against his back she stood on his shoulder then clambered aboard the barge reith laboriously heaved himself up after her to lie on the deck totally spent presently he gained his feet to peer toward the dock the pnumekin worked as before reith moved back into the shadows zap had not moved the shift clung to her underdeveloped body she was not ungraceful reflected reith she noticed his attention and huddled back against the cargo take off your undergown and put on your cloak reith suggested youll be warmer she stared at him miserably reith pulled off his own sodden garments in horror almost as intense as she had shown toward the pnume she jerked herself around reith found the energy for a sour grin with her back turned she draped the cloak over her shoulders and by some means unknown divested herself of her undergarments the barge vibrated lurched reith looked past the cargo to see the dock receding it became an oasis of light in the heavy blackness far ahead showed a wan blue glimmer toward which the barge silently moved they were underway behind lay pagaz zone and the way to foreverness ahead was darkness and the northern areas chapter four the barge carried a crew of two who kept to the apron at the bow of the barge here was a small pantry a cookbench an island of dim yellow illumination there seemed to be at least two other passengers aboard perhaps as many as three or four who were even less obtrusive than the crew and manifested themselves only at the pantry and the cookbench the food seemed to be free to the use of all zap would not allow reith to go forward for food when the pantry and cookbench were not in use zap procured food for both cakes of pilgrimpod meal candied plumshaped objects which might have been fruit or possibly leechlike insects bars of meatpaste sweet and salty wafers of a delicate crisp white substance which zap considered a delicacy but which left an unpleasant aftertaste in reiths mouth time passed how long reith had no way of knowing the lake became a river which in turn became an underground canal fifty or sixty feet wide the barge moved without a sound propelled so reith guessed by electric fields cycling along the keel ahead gleamed a dim blue light serving as a fix for the barges steering sensor when one blue light passed overhead another always shone far ahead at long intervals the barge passed lonesome little piers and docks with passages leading away into unknown fastnesses reith ate and slept how many times he lost count his cosmos was the barge the dark the unseen water the presence of zap with nothing but time and boredom reith set himself to the task of exploring her personality zap on her part treated reith with suspicion as if begrudging even the intimacy of conversation a skittishness and prim reserve peculiar in a person who to the best of his knowledge had not even a distorted understanding of ordinary sexual processes primordial instinct at work reith surmised but how in good conscience could he turn her loose on the surface in such a condition of innocence on the other hand the prospect of explaining human biology to zap was not a comfortable one zap herself never seemed to become bored with the passage of time she slept or sat looking off into the darkness as if she watched passing vistas of great fascination vexed with her selfsufficiency reith would occasionally join her taking no notice of her slight shift of fastidious withdrawal conversation with zap was never exhilarating she had unalterable preconceptions regarding the surface she feared the sky the wind the space of the horizons the pale brown sunlight her anticipations were melancholy she foresaw death under the club of a yelling barbarian reith tried to modify her views but encountered distrust do you think that we are ignorant of the surface she asked in calm scorn the zuzhma kastchai know more than anyone they know everything knowledge is their existence they are the brainlife of tschai tschai is body and bones to the zuzhma kastchai and the pnumekin how do they fit into the picture the persons long ago the zuzhma kastchai gave refuge to certain men from the surface with some females and some motherwomen the persons proved their diligence by polishing stones and perfecting crystals the zuzhma kastchai provided peace and so it has been for all the ages and where did men come from originally do you know this zap was uninterested from the ghian where else do they teach you of the sun and the stars and the other worlds of space they teach what we most want to learn which is decorum and good conduct she heaved a small sigh that is all behind me and gone how the others would marvel at me now so far as reith could comprehend zap s principal emotion appeared to be for her own indecorous conduct the barge moved on blue glimmer appeared ahead waxed to become a glare and pass overhead with a new blue glimmer far in the distance reith became stale and restless darkness was almost complete relieved only by a vague glow from the bow apron forward the feminine voice of zap herself only a blur began to work upon his imagination certain of her mannerisms took on the semblance of erotic provocations only by conscious rational effort could he maintain his impersonality how he would ask himself could she provoke or tease when she was totally unaware of the malefemale relationship any urgings from her subconscious must seem a peculiar perversion the most exaggerated form of boisterous conduct he remembered the vitality of her body when she had clung to him in the water he thought of the look of her soaked body he began to wonder if his instincts might not be more accurate than his reason zap if she felt anything other than glumness and foreboding gave no evidence except a somewhat greater willingness to talk for hours she spoke in a low monotone of everything she knew she had lived a remarkably drab life thought reith without experience of gaiety excitement frivolity he wondered as to the content of her imaginings but of this she said nothing she recognized differences in the personalities of her fellows subtle variations of decorum and discretion which to her assumed the same significance as the more vehement personality traits of the surface she was aware of biological differences between male and female but apparently had never wondered as to their justification all very strange mused reith the shelters would seem to be an incubator for a whole congeries of neuroses reith dared venture no inquiries whenever the conversation skirted such matters she became instantly taciturn had the pnume bred sex drive out of the pnumekin did they administer depressants drugs hormones to eliminate a troublesome tendency to overreproduce reith asked a few cautious questions to which zap gave such irrelevant and unapposite replies that reith was sure she didnt know what he was talking about from time to time zap admitted certain persons found the shelters too staid they were sent up to the surface into the glare the blowing winds the empty nights with all the universe exposed and never allowed to return below i wonder that i am not more fearful she said is it possible that i have always had gzhindra tendencies i have heard that so much space creates a distraction i do not wish to be so affected were not on the surface yet said reith to which zap gave a faint shrug as if the matter were of no great importance regarding the reproductive mechanisms of the pnume she had no sure knowledge she was uncertain whether or not the pnume regarded the matter as secret though she suspected as much as to the relative number of pnume and pnumekin she was also uncertain there are probably more zuzhma kastchai but many are never seen they keep to the deep places where the precious things are kept what precious things again zap was vague the history of tschai goes back beyond thought just so far back go the records the zuzhma kastchai are meticulous they know everything that has ever happened they consider tschai to be a great conservatory where every item every tree every rock is a cherished curio now there are offworld folk on the ghian three different sorts who have come to leave their artifacts three the dirdir the chasch the wankh what of men men her voice took on a dubious tone i dont know perhaps men too are offworld if so four peoples sojourn in tschai but this has happened before many times have strange folk come down to old tschai the zuzhma kastchai neither welcome nor repel they observe they watch they expand their collections they fill the museums of foreverness they compile their archives reith began to see the pnume in a new light it seemed that they regarded the surface of tschai as a vast theater on which wonderful millenniumlong dramas were played out the old chaschblue chasch wars the dirdir invasion followed by the wankh counterinvasion the various campaigns battles routs and exterminations the building of cities the subsidence of ruins the coming and going of peoplesall of which explained the acquiescence of the pnume to the presence of alien races from the pnume point of view they embellished the history of tschai as for zap herself reith asked if she had the same regard for tschai the girl made one of her small apathetic gestures no it meant nothing she cared little one way or the other reith had a sudden insight into the processes of her psyche life for zap was a somewhat insipid experience to be tolerated fear was reserved for the unfamiliar joy was beyond conjecture he saw his own personality as it must appear to her abrupt brutal crafty harsh and unpredictable in whom the worst excesses of boisterous conduct must always be feared a sad creature thought reith inoffensive and colorless still remembering the feel of her clinging to his neck he wondered still waters ran deep in the dark with nothing to occupy his mind imaginings came to stimulate him and arouse his fervor whereupon zap somehow sensing his turmoil moved uneasily off into the shadows leaving reith sourly amused by the situation what could be going on in her mind reith invented a new game he tried to amuse her he invented grotesque incidents extravagant situations but zap was the fairytale princess who could not laugh her single pleasure insofar as reith could detect was the sweetsalt wafer which served as a relish to the otherwise bland food unfortunately the supply of these delicacies was quickly exhausted a day or two after they had boarded the barge zap was taken aback by the deficiency there is always diko in our dietalways someone has made a foolish mistake reith had never seen her quite so emphatic she became morose then listless and refused to eat anything whatever then she became nervous and irritable and reith wondered if perhaps the diko contained a habitforming drug to arouse so pronounced a craving for a period which might have been three or four days she spoke almost not at all and kept as far from reith as was practicable as if she held reith responsible for her deprivation which was actually the case reflected reith had he not blundered rudely into her cool gray existence she would be conducting her ordinary routine nibbling diko whenever she was of a mind her sulkiness waned she became almost talkative she seemed to want reassurance or attention orcould it be affection so it appeared to reith who found the situation as absurd as any he had known on and on through the dark moved the barge from blue light to blue light to blue light they passed along a chain of underground lakes through still caverns draped with stalactites then for a long period perhaps three daysalong a precisely straight bore with the blue lights spaced ten miles apart the bore gave into another set of caverns where they once again saw a few lonesome docks islands of dim yellow lights then once again the barge rode a straight canal the voyage was approaching its endthe feeling was in the air the crew moved with a somewhat less deliberate gait and the passengers on the starboard side went to stand on the forward apron zap returning from the pantry with food announced in a dolorous mutter we have almost come to bazhangahai and where is this at the far side of the area we have come a long way she added in a soft voice it has been a peaceful time reith thought that she spoke with regret is this place near the surface it is a trade center for goods from the stang islands and hedaijha reith was surprised we are far to the north yes but the zuzhma kastchai may be waiting for us reith looked anxiously ahead at the far blue guidelight why should they be i dont know perhaps they wont blue lights one after the other reith saw them pass with growing tension he became tired and slept when he awoke zap pointed ahead bazhangahai reith rose to his feet ahead the gloom had lightened the water showed a far luminous reflection with dramatic majesty the tunnel widened the barge moved forward ponderous as fate the cloaked shapes at the bow stood in silhouette against a great golden space reith felt a lifting of the spirit a mysterious exaltation the voyage which had started in cold and misery was at its end the sides of the tunnelfluted buttresses of raw rockbegan to be visible illuminated on one side in black shadow on the other the golden light was a blur beyond across calm water white crags rose to a great height zap came slowly forward to stare into the light with a rapt expression reith had almost forgotten what she looked like the thin face the pallor the fragile bones of jaw and forehead the straight nose and pale mouth were as he recalled additionally he saw an expression to which he could put no name sadness melancholy haunted foreboding she felt his gaze and looked at him reith wondered what she saw the passage opened and widened a lake lay ahead long and twisting the barge proceeded along vistas of uncanny beauty small islands broke the black surface great gnarled columns of white and gray rose to the vaulted ceiling far above half a mile ahead under a beetling overhang a dock became visible from an unseen opening a shaft of golden light slanted into the cavern reith could hardly speak for emotion sunlight he finally croaked the barge eased forward toward the dock reith searched the cavern walls trying to trace out a route to the gap zap said in a soft voice you will attract attention reith moved back against the bales and again studied the side of the cavern he pointed a trail leads up to the gap of course reith traced the trail along the wall it seemed to terminate at the dock now only a quarter of a mile distant reith noticed several shapes in black cloaks pnume or pnumekin he could not be sure they stood waiting in what he considered sinister attitudes he became highly uneasy going to the stern of the barge reith looked right and left he returned to zap in a minute or so well pass close to that island thats where we better leave the barge i dont care to land at that dock zap gave a fatalistic shrug they went to the stern of the barge the island a twisted knob of limestone came abeam reith said lower yourself into the water dont kick or flounder ill keep you afloat she gave him one unreadable sideglance and did as he bid holding the blue leather portfolio high in one hand he slid into the water beside her the barge moved away toward whoever or whatever waited on the dock put your hands on my shoulders said reith hold your face just above the water the ground rose under their feet they clambered up on the island the barge had almost reached the dock the black shapes came forward by their gait reith knew them for pnume from the island they waded to the shore keeping to areas of shadow where they were invisible to those on the dock or so reith hoped a hundred feet above ran the trail to the gap reith made a careful reconnaissance and they started to climb scrambling over detritus clinging to knobs of agate crawling over humps and buttresses a mournful hooting sound drifted across the water zap became rigid what does that mean reith asked in a hushed voice it must be a summons or a call like nothing i have heard in pagaz they continued up the slope sodden cloaks clinging to their bodies and at last heaved themselves up on the trail reith looked ahead and back no living creature could be seen the gap into the outer world was only fifty yards distant once again the hooting sounded conveying a mournful urgency panting stumbling they ran up the trail the gap opened before them they saw the goldengray sky of tschai where a tumbled group of black clouds floated he took a last look down the trail with the light of outdoors in his face with tears blurring his vision he could distinguish only shadows and dim rockshapes the underground was again a world remote and unknown he took zap s hand pulled her out into the open slowly she stepped forward and looked across the surface they stood halfway up the slope of a rocky hill overlooking a wide valley in the distance spread a calm gray surface the sea reith took a final look over his shoulder at the gap and started down the hill zap with a dubious glance toward the sun followed reith halted he removed the hated black hat and sailed it off over the rocks then he took zap s hat and did the same despite her startled protest chapter five for reith the walk down the wide valley in the browngold light of afternoon was euphoric he felt lightheaded his torpor had vanished he felt strong and agile and full of hope he even felt a new and tolerant affection for zap an odd wry creature he thought watching her surreptitiously and pale as a ghost she clearly felt uneasy in this sudden wilderness of space her gaze moved from the sky along the sweep of hills to either side out to the horizon of what reith had decided must be the first sea they reached the floor of the valley a sluggish stream wandered between banks of dark red reeds nearby grew pilgrim plant the pods of which formed the indispensable staple food of tschai zap looked at the graygreen pods skeptically failing to recognize the shriveled dry yellow tablets imported into the shelters she ate with fatalistic disinterest reith saw her looking back the way they had come somewhat wistfully he thought do you miss the shelters he asked zap considered her reply i am afraid we can be seen from all directions perhaps the zuzhma kastchai watch us from the gap they may send nighthounds after us reith looked up toward the gap a shadow almost invisible from where they sat he could detect no evidence of scrutiny they seemed alone in the open valley but he could not be sure eyes could be watching from the gap the black cloaks made them conspicuous he looked toward zap almost certainly she would refuse to remove the garment reith rose to his feet its growing late perhaps we can find a village along the shore two miles downstream the river spread wide to become a swamp along the opposite shore grew a dense forest of enormous dyans the trunks on the periphery slanting somewhat outward reith had seen such a forest before it was so he suspected a sacred grove of the khors a truculent folk living along the south shore of the first sea the presence of the sacred grove if such it was gave reith pause an encounter with the khors might immediately validate zap s fears regarding the ghaun and the unpleasant habits of those who lived there at the moment there were no khors in sight proceeding along the verge of the swamp they came out on a knoll overlooking a hundred yards of mud flat with the sluggish first sea beyond far to right and left were crumbling gray headlands almost lost in the afternoon murk somewhere to the southeast perhaps not too far must lie the carabas where men sought sequins and where the dirdir came to hunt reith looked up and down the coast trying to locate himself by sheer instinct zap stared glumly off to sea wondering what the future held a mile or so along the shore to the southeast reith noticed the crazy stilts of a pier extending across the mud flats out into the sea at the end half a dozen boats were moored a swelling of ground beyond the swamp concealed the village which must lie at the head of the pier the khors while not automatically hostile lived by a complicated etiquette transgressions of which were not tolerated a strangers ignorance received no sympathy the rules were explicit a visit with the khors thus became a chancy occasion i dont dare risk the khors said reith he turned to look back over the desolate hills sivishe is a long way south well have to make for cape braise if we get there we can take passage by ship down the west coast although at the moment i dont know what well use for money zap looked at him in slackmouthed surprise you want me to come with you so here was the explanation for her melancholy inspection of the landscape thought reith he asked did you have other plans she pursed her lips sullenly i thought that you would want to go your way alone and leave you by yourself you might not fare too well she looked at him with sardonic speculation wondering at the reason for his concern theres a good deal of boisterous conduct up here on the surface said reith i dont think youd like it oh well have to go warily these cloakswed better take them off zap looked at him aghast and go without clothing no just without the cloaks they attract attention and hostility we dont want to be taken for gzhindra but that is what i must be at sivishe you may decide otherwise if we arrive of course we dont help ourselves going as gzhindra he pulled off his cloak with her face angrily turned away she removed her cloak and stood in her gray undergown reith rolled the cloaks into a bundle it may be cold at night ill take them with us he picked up the blue portfolio which now represented excess baggage he wavered a moment and at last slid the portfolio between the inner and outer layers of his jacket they set off to the northwest along the shore behind them the khor grove became a dark blur the far headland grew bulky and dark carina moved down the sky and the sunlight took on a late afternoon richness to the north however a bank of purpleblack clouds threatened one of the sudden tschai thunderstorms the clouds moved inexorably south muffling halfconcealing spasms of electric light the sea below shone with the sallow luster of graphite ahead close underneath the headland appeared another grove of dyan trees a sacred grove reith searched the landscape but saw no khor town the grove loomed above them the exterior boles leaning outward the fronds hanging down in a great parasol the headland conceivably concealed a village but at the moment they were the only animate creatures under the halfblack halfgoldenbrown sky reith imparted none of his misgivings to zap who was sufficiently occupied with her own exposure to the sunlight had flushed her face in the rather flimsy and clinging gray undergown with the black hair beginning to curl down on her forehead and her ears she seemed a somewhat different person than the pallid wretch reith had met in the pagaz refectory was his imagination at fault or had her body become fuller and rounder she noticed his gaze and gave him a glare of shame and defiance why do you stare at me no particular reason except that you look rather different now than when i first saw you different and better i dont know what you mean she snapped youre talking foolishness i suppose so one of these daysnot just nowill explain how life is on the surface customs and habits are more complicatedmore intimate even more boisterousthan in the shelters hmmf sniffed zap why are you heading toward the forest isnt it another secret place i dont know reith pointed to the clouds see the black trails hanging below thats rain under the trees we might stay dry then night is coming soon and the nighthounds we have no weapons if we climb a tree well be safe zap made no further comment they approached the grove the dyans reared high overhead at the first lines of boles they stopped to listen but heard only a breath of wind from the oncoming storm step by step they entered the grove the sunlight shining past the clouds projected a hundred shafts and beams of dark golden light reith and zap walked in and out of shadow the nearest branches were a hundred feet above the trees could not be climbed the grove offered little more security from nighthounds than did the open downs zap stopped short and seemed to listen reith could hear nothing what do you hear nothing but she still listened and peered in all directions reith became highly uneasy wondering what zap sensed that he did not they proceeded wary as cats keeping to the shadows a clearing free of boles opened before them shrouded by a continuous roof of foliage they looked forth into a circular area containing four huts a low central platform the surrounding boles had been carved to the semblance of men and women a pair at each tree the men were represented with long nutcracker chins narrow foreheads bulging cheeks and eyes the females displayed long noses and lips parted in wide grins neither resembled the typical khor man or woman who as reith recollected almost exactly resembled one another in stature physiognomy and dress the poses conventionalized and rigid depicted the act of copulation reith looked askance at zap who seemed blankly puzzled reith decided that she interpreted the nottooexplicit attitudes as representations of sheer sportiveness or simple boisterous conduct the clouds submerged the sun gloom came to the glade drops of rain touched their faces reith scrutinized the huts they were built in the usual khor style of dull brown brick with conical black iron roofs there were four facing each other at quadrants around the clearing they appeared to be empty reith wondered what the huts contained wait here he whispered to zap and ran crouching to the nearest hut he listened no sound he tried the door which swung back easily the interior exhaled a heavy odor almost a stink of poorly cured leather resin musk on a rack hung several dozen masks of sculptured wood identical to the male faces of the carved trees two benches occupied the center of the room no weapons no garments no articles of value were to be seen reith returned to zap to find her inspecting the carved tree trunks eyebrows lifted in distaste a purple dazzle struck the sky followed immediately by a clap of thunder down came rain in a torrent reith led the girl at a run to the hut they entered and stood with rain drumming upon the iron roof the khors are an unpredictable people said reith but i cant imagine them visiting their grove on a night like this why would they come at any time demanded zap peevishly there is nothing here but those grotesque dancers do the khor look like that reith understood that she referred to the figures carved upon the tree trunks not at all he said they are a yellowskinned folk very neat and precise the men and women are exactly alike in appearance and disposition as well he tried to recall what anacho had told him a strange secret folk with secret ways different by day and by night or at least this is the report each individual owns two souls which come and go with dawn and sunset the body comprises two different persons later anacho had warned the khor are sensitive as spicesnakes do not speak to them pay them no heed except from necessity in which case you must use the fewest possible words they consider garrulity a crime against nature never acknowledge the presence of a woman do not look toward their children they will suspect you of laying a curse above all ignore the sacred grove their weapon is the iron dart which they throw with accuracy they are a dangerous people reith paraphrased the remarks to the best of his recollection zap went to sit on one of the benches lie down said reith try to sleep in the noise of the storm and this vile smell to all sides are all the houses of the ghaun so not all of them muttered reith he went to look out the door the alternation of lightning glare and dying twilight upon the treestatues presented the illusion of a frantic erotic jerking zap might soon begin to ask questions to which reith did not care to respond upon the roof came a sudden clatter of hail abruptly the storm passed over and nothing could be heard but wind sighing in the dyan trees reith returned into the room he spoke in a voice which rang false even to his own ears now you can rest at least the sound is gone she made a soft sound which reith could not interpret and went herself to stand in the doorway she looked back at reith someone is coming reith hurried to the doorway and looked forth across the clearing stood a figure in khor garments male or female reith could not determine it went into the hut directly opposite their own reith said to zap wed better leave while we have a chance she held him back no no theres another one the second khor entering the clearing looked up at the sky the first came from the hut with a flaring cresset on a pole and the second ran quickly to the hut in which reith and zap were concealed the first took no notice as the khor entered reith struck hard ignoring all precepts of gallantry in this case male and female were all the same the khor fell and lay limp reith jumped forward the khor was male reith stripped off his cape tied his hands and feet with sandal thongs and gagged him with the sleeve of his black coat with zap s help he dragged the man behind the rack of masks here reith made a quick search of the limp body finding a pair of iron darts a dagger and a soft leather pouch containing sequins which reith somewhat guiltily appropriated zap stood by the door gazing out in fascination the first to come had been a woman wearing a womanmask and a white frock she stood by the cresset which she had thrust into a socket near the central platform if she were perplexed by the disappearance of the man who had entered the hut she gave no sign reith looked forth now while theres only one woman no more come three persons slipped separately into the clearing going to the other three huts one in a womanmask and white gown emerged with another cresset which she placed in a socket and stood quietly like the first the other two now came forth wearing manmasks and white gowns like those of the women they went to the central platform and stood near the women who made no movement reith began to understand something of the purpose of the sacred grove zap stared forth in fascination reith became highly uneasy if events proceeded as he suspected she would be shocked and horrified three more persons appeared one came to the but where reith and zap waited reith tried to deal with him as he had the other but this time the blow was glancing and the man fell with a startled grunt reith was instantly upon him and shut off his breath until he fainted using sandal thongs and cape as before he tied and gagged the khor and again robbed the man of his pouch i regret becoming a thief said reith but my need is far greater than yours zap standing by the door gave a startled gasp reith went to look the womennow there were threehad disrobed to stand nude they began to sing a wordless chant sweet soft insistent the three in the manmasks began a slow gyration around the platform zap muttered under her breath what are they doing why do they reveal their bodies never have i seen such a thing it is only religion said reith nervously dont watch go lie down you must be very tired she gave him a lambent look of wonder and distrust you dont answer my question i am very embarrassed i have never seen a naked person are all the folk of the ghaun soso boisterous it is shocking and the singing most disturbing what are they planning to do reith tried to stand in front of her hadnt you better sleep the rites will only bore you they dont bore me i am astounded that people can be so bold and look the men reith took a deep breath and came to a desperate decision come back here he gave her a female mask put that on she jerked back aghast what for reith took a manmask and fitted it over his face were leaving but she turned a fascinated look toward the platform reith pulled her back around fitted one of the khor hats on her head arranged the other on his own theyll certainly see us said zap theyll chase us and kill us perhaps so said reith nevertheless wed better go he looked around the clearing you go first walk behind the hut ill come after you zap departed the hut the women at the platform chanted with the most compelling urgency the men stood nude reith joined zap behind the hut had they been noticed the chanting continued rising and falling walk out into the grove dont look back ridiculous muttered zap why shouldnt i look back she marched toward the forest with reith twenty feet behind her from the but came a wild scream of fury the chanting stopped short there was stunned silence run said reith through the sacred grove they fled throwing away the hats and masks from behind came calls of passionate fury but deterred perhaps by their nudity the khor offered no pursuit reith and zap came to the edge of the grove they paused to catch their breath halfway up the sky the blue moon shone through a few ragged clouds elsewhere the sky was clear zap looked up what are those little lights those are stars said reith far suns most control a family of planets from a world called earth men came your ancestors mine even the ancestors of the khor earth is the world of men how do you know all this demanded zap sometime ill tell you not tonight they set off across the downs walking through the starry night and something about the circumstances put reith in a strange frame of mind it was as if he were young and roaming a starlit meadow of earth with a slim girl with whom he had become infatuated so strong became the dream or the hallucination or whatever the nature of his mood that he groped out for zap s hand where she trudged beside him she turned him a wan uncomplaining glance but made no protest here was another incomprehensible aspect of the astounding ghaun so they went on for a period reith gradually recovered his senses he walked the surface of tschai his companion he left the thought incomplete for a variety of reasons as if she had sensed the alteration of his mood zap angrily snatched away her hand perhaps for a space of time she had been dreaming as well they marched on in silence at last with the blue moon hanging directly above they reached the sandstone promontory and found a protected niche at the base wrapping themselves in their cloaks they huddled upon a drift of sand reith could not sleep he lay looking up at the sky and listening to the sound of the girls breathing like himself she lay awake why had he felt so urgently compelled to flee the khor grove at the risk of pursuit and death to protect the girls innocence ridiculous he looked to find her face a pale blotch in the moonlight turned in his direction i cant sleep she said in a soft voice i am too tired the surface frightens me sometimes it frightens me said reith still would you rather be back in the shelters as always she made a tangential response i cant understand what i see i cant understand myself never have i heard such singing they sang songs which never change said reith songs perhaps from old earth they showed themselves without clothes is this how the surface people act not all of them said reith but why do they act that way sooner or later thought reith she must learn the processes of human biology not tonight not tonight nakedness doesnt mean much he mumbled everyone has a body much like everyone elses but why should they wish to show themselves in the shelters we remain covered and try to avoid boisterous conduct just what is this boisterous conduct vulgar intimacy people touch other people and play with them its all quite ridiculous reith chose his words with care this is probably normal human conductlike becoming hungry or something of the sort youve never been boisterous of course not youve never even thought about it one cant help thinking hasnt there ever been a young man with whom youve especially wanted to be friendly never zap was scandalized well youre on the surface and things may be different now youd better go to sleep tomorrow there may be a townful of khors chasing us reith finally slept he awoke once to find the blue moon gone the sky dark except for constellations from far across the downs came the sad hooting of a nighthound when he settled back into his cloak zap said in a drowsy whisper the sky frightens me reith moved close beside her involuntarily or so it seemed he reached out and stroked her head where the hair was now soft and thick she sighed and relaxed arousing in reith an embarrassed protectiveness the night passed a russet glow appeared in the east waxing to become a lilac and honeycolored dawn while zap sat huddled in her cloak reith investigated the pouches he had taken from the khors he was pleased to find sequins to the value of ninetyfive more than he had expected he discarded the darts needlesharp iron bolts eight inches long with a leather tail the dagger he tucked into his belt they set out up the slopes of the promontory and presently gained the ridge carina rising at their backs shone along the shore revealing another sweep of low beach and mud flats with far off another promontory like the one on which they stood the khor town occupied a hillside slope a mile to the left almost at their feet a pier zigzagged across the mud flats and out into the sea a precarious construction of poles rope and planks vibrating to the current which swirled around the base of the promontory half a dozen boats were moored to the spindly piles doubleended craft high at bow and stern like swaybacked dories fitted with masts reith looked toward the town a few plumes of smoke rose from the black iron roofs otherwise no activity was perceptible reith turned back to his inspection of the boats its easier to sail than to walk reith told zap and there seems to be a fair wind up the coast zap spoke in consternation out across so much emptiness the emptier the better said reith the sea gives me no worry its the folk who sail there the same is just as true of the land of course he set off down the slope zap scrambled after him they reached the end of the pier and started along the rickety walkway from somewhere nearby came a shriek of anger they saw a halfgrown boy racing toward the village reith broke into a run come along hurry we wont have much time zap came panting behind him the two reached the end of the pier we wont be able to escape theyll follow us in the boats no said reith i think not he looked from boat to boat and chose that which seemed the most staunch in front of the village excited black shapes had gathered a dozen started at a run for the pier followed by as many more jump down into the boat said reith hoist the sail it is too late cried zap we will never escape its not too late hoist the sail i dont know how pull the rope that goes up over the mast zap clambered down into the boat and tried to follow reiths instruction reith meanwhile ran along the pier cutting loose the other boats riding the current pushed by the offshore breeze they drifted away from the dock reith returned to where zap fumbled desperately with the halyard she strained with all her might and succeeded in fouling the long yard under the forestay reith took a last look toward the screaming villagers then jumped down into the boat and cast off no time to sort out halyards or clear the yard reith took up the sweeps fitted them between the thole pins and put way on the boat along the trembling pier surged the screaming khors halting they whirled their darts up and out flew a volley of iron to strike into the water an uncomfortable ten or twenty feet short of the boat with renewed energy reith worked the sweeps then went to hoist the sail the yard swung free creaked aloft the gray sail billowed the boat heeled and churned through the water the khors stood silent on the pier watching after their departing boats reith sailed directly out to sea zap sat huddled in the center of the boat finally she made a dispirited protest is it wise to go so far from the land very wise otherwise the khors might follow along the shore and kill us when we put into land i have never known such openness it is exposedfrightfully so on the other hand our condition is better than it was yesterday at this time are you hungry yes see whats in that caddy yonder we may be in luck zap climbed forward to the locker in the bow where among scraps of rope and gear spare sails a lantern she found a jug of water and a sack of dry pilgrimpod cakes with the shore at last a blur reith swung the boat into the northwest trimming the ungainly sail to the wind all day the fair wind blew reith held a course ten miles offshore well beyond the scope of khor vision headlands appeared in the murk of distance loomed off the beam slowly dwindled and disappeared as the afternoon waned the wind increased sending whitecaps chasing over the dark sea the rigging creaked the sails bulged the boat threw up a bowwave the wake gurgled and reith rejoiced at every mile so swiftly put astern carina sank behind the mainland hills the wind died and the boat lost way darkness came zap crouched fearfully on the center seat oppressed by the expanse of the sky reith lost patience with her fears he lowered the yard halfway down the mast lashed the rudder made himself as comfortable as possible and slept a cool early morning breeze awoke him stumbling about in the predawn gloom he managed to hoist the yard then went aft to the tiller where he steered halfdozing until the sun arose about noon a finger of land thrust forth into the sea reith landed the boat on a dismal gray beach and went out foraging he found a brackish stream a thicket of dark red dragon berries a supply of the ubiquitous pilgrimpod in the stream he noticed a number of crustaceanlike creatures but could not bring himself to catch them during the middle afternoon they once again put out to sea reith using the sweeps to pull the boat away from the beach they rounded the headland to find a changed landscape shoreward the gray beaches and mud flats had become a narrow fringe of shingle beyond were barren red cliffs and reith wary of the lee shore put well out to sea an hour before sunset a long low vessel appeared over the northeast horizon faring on a course parallel to their own with the sun low in the northwest reith hoped to evade the attention of those aboard the ship which held a sinister resemblance to the pirate galleys of the draschade hoping to draw away he altered course to the south the ship likewise altered course coincidentally or not reith could not be sure he swung the boat directly toward the shore now about ten miles distant the ship again seemed to alter course with a sinking heart reith saw that they must surely be overtaken zap watched with sagging shoulders reith wondered what he should do if the galley in fact overtook them she had no knowledge of what to expect now was hardly the time to explain to her reith decided that he would kill her in the event that capture became certain then he changed his mind they would plunge over the side of the boat and drown together equally impractical while there was life there was hope the sun settled upon the horizon the wind as on the previous evening lessened sunset brought a dead calm with the boats rolling helplessly on the waves reith shipped the sweeps as twilight settled over the ocean he pulled away from the becalmed pirate ship toward shore he rowed on through the night the pink moon rose and then the blue moon to project tremulous trails across the water ahead one of the trails ended at a mass of dead black the shore reith stopped his rowing far to the west he saw a flickering light to sea all was dark he threw out the anchor and lowered the sail the two made a meal on berries and pilgrimpod then lay down to sleep on the sails in the bottom of the boat with morning came a breeze from the east the boat lay at anchor a hundred yards offshore in water barely three feet deep the pirate galley if such it was could no longer be seen reith pulled up the anchor and hoisted the sail the boat moved jauntily off through the water made cautious by the events of the previous afternoon reith sailed only a quarter of a mile offshore until the wind died halfway through the afternoon in the north a bank of clouds gave portent of a storm taking up the sweeps reith worked the boat into a lagoon at the mouth of a sluggish river to the side of the lagoon floated a raft of dried reeds upon which two boys sat fishing after an initial stir they watched the approach of the boat in attitudes of indifference reith paused in his rowing to consider the situation the unconcern of the boys seemed unnatural on tschai unusual events almost always presaged danger reith cautiously rowed the boat to within conversational distance a hundred feet distant on the bank sat three men also fishing they seemed to be grays a people short and stocky with stronglyfeatured faces sparse brownish hair and grayish skin at least thought reith they were not khors and not automatically hostile reith let the boat drift forward he called out is there a town nearby one of the boys pointed across the reeds to a grove of purple ouinga trees yonder what town is it zsafathra is there an inn or a tavern where we can find accommodation speak to the men ashore reith urged the boat toward the bank one of the men called out in irritation easy with the tumult youll drive off every gobbulch in the lagoon sorry said reith can we find accommodation in your town the men regarded him with impersonal curiosity what do you here along this coast we are travelers from the south of kislovan now returning home you have traveled a remarkable distance in so small a craft remarked one of the men in a mildly skeptical voice one which strongly resembles the craft of the khors noted another for a fact reith agreed it does look like a khor boat but all this aside what of lodging anything is available to folk with sequins we can pay reasonable charges the oldest of the men on the bank rose to his feet if nothing else he stated we are reasonable people he signaled reith to approach as the boat nosed into the reeds he jumped aboard so then you claim to be khors quite the reverse we claim not to be khors what of the boat then reith made an ambiguous gesture it is not as good as some but better than others it has brought us this far a wintry grin crossed the mans face proceed through the channel yonder bear to the right for half an hour reith rowed this way and that through a maze of channels with the ouinga trees always behind islands of black reeds reich presently understood that the zsafathran either was having a joke or sought to confuse him he said i am tired you row the rest of the way no no declared the old man we are now there just left through yonder channel and toward the ouingas odd said reith we have gone back and forth past that channel a dozen times one channel looks much like another and here we are the boat floated into a placid pond surrounded by reedthatched cottages on stilts under the ouinga trees at the far end of the pond stood a larger more elaborate structure the poles were purple ouinga wood the thatch was woven in a complicated pattern of black brown and gray our community freehouse explained the zsafathran we are not so isolated as you might think thangs come by with their troupes and carts or bihasu peddlers or wandering dignitaries like yourselves all these we entertain at our freehouse thangs we must be close upon cape braise is three hundred miles close the thangs are as pervasive as sandflies they appear everywhere more often than not when they are not wanted not too far is the great thang town of urmank you and your woman both are of a race strange to me if the concept were not inherently ludicrousbut no to postulate nonsense is to lose my dignity i will hazard nothing we are from a remote place said reith you have never heard of it the old man made a sign of indifference whatever you like provided that you observe the ceremonies and pay your score two questions said reith what are the ceremonies and how much must we expect to pay as a daily charge the ceremonies are simple said the zsafathran an exchange of pleasantries so to speak the charges will be perhaps four or five sequins a day go ashore at the dock if you will then we must take your boat away to discourage speculation should a thang or a bihasu pass by reith decided to make no objection he worked the boat to the dock a construction of withe and reeds lashed to piles of ouingawood the zsafathran jumped from the boat and gallantly helped zap to the dock inspecting her closely as he did so reith jumped ashore with a mooring line which the zsafathran took and passed on to a lad with a set of muttered instructions he led reith and zap through the white pavilion and into the great freehouse so here you are take your ease the cubicle yonder is at your service food and wine will be served in due course we want to bathe said reith and we would appreciate a change of clothes if any such are available the bathhouse is yonder fresh garments after the zsafathran style can be furnished at a price and the price ordinary suits of gray furze for withecutting or tillage are ten sequins each since your present garments are little better than rags i recommend the expense underlinen is included in this price upon a surcharge of two sequins apiece underlinen is furnished and should you wish new sandals each must pay five sequins additionally very well said reith bring everything well go first class while the sequins last chapter six wearing the simple gray smock and trousers of the zsafathrans zap looked somewhat less peculiar and conspicuous her black hair had begun to curl exposure to wind and sun had darkened her skin only her perfectly regular features and her brooding absorption with secret ideas now set her apart reith doubted however if a stranger would notice in her conduct anything more unusual than shyness but cauch the old zsafathran noticed taking reith aside he muttered in a confidential voice your woman perhaps she is ill if you require herbs sweatbaths or homeopathy these are available at no great cost everything at zsafathra is a bargain said reith before we leave we might owe more sequins than we carry in this case what would be your attitude sorrowful resignation nothing more we know ourselves for a destinyblasted race doomed to a succession of disappointments but i trust this is not to be the case not unless we enjoy your hospitality longer than i presently plan no doubt you will carefully gauge your resources but again what of the womans condition he subjected zap to a critical scrutiny i have had some experience in these matters i deem her peaked and listless and somewhat morose beyond this i am puzzled she is an unfathomable person reith agreed the description if i may say so applies to you both said cauch he turned his owlish gaze upon reith well the womans morbidity is your affair of course a collation has been served on the pavilion which you are invited to join at a small charge presumably how can it be otherwise in this exacting world only the air we breathe is free are you the sort to go hungry because you begrudge the outlay of a few bice i think not come and cauch urging them out upon the pavilion seated them in withe chairs before a wicker table then went off to instruct the girls who served from the buffet cool tea spicecakes stalks of a crisp red watervegetable were set before them as a first course the food was palatable the chairs were comfortable after the vicissitudes of the previous weeks the situation seemed unreal and reith was unable to subdue a nervous mannerism of looking warily this way and that gradually he relaxed the pavilion seemed an idyll of peace gauzy fronds of the purple ouinga trailed low exhaling an aromatic scent carina sprinkled dancing spots of dark gold light across the water from somewhere beyond the freehouse came the music of watergongs zap gazed across the pond in a reverie nibbling at the food as if it lacked flavor becoming aware of reiths attention she straightened primly in the chair shall i serve more of this tea asked reith if you like reith poured from the bubbleglass jug you dont seem particularly hungry he observed i suppose not i wonder if they have any diko im sure that they have no diko said reith zap gave her fingers a petulant twitch reith asked do you like this place it is better than the vastness of the sea for a period reith sipped his tea in silence the table was cleared new dishes were set before them croquettes in sweet jelly toasted sticks of white pith nubbins of gray seaflesh as before zap showed no great appetite reith said politely youve seen something of the surface now is it different from your expectations zap reflected i never thought to see so many motherwomen she murmured as if talking to herself motherwomen do you mean women with children she flushed i mean the women with prominent breasts and hips there are so many some of them seem very young no more than girls its quite normal said reith as girls grow out of childhood they develop breasts and hips i am not a child zap declared in an unusually haughty voice and i her voice dwindled away reith poured another mug of tea and settled back into his chair its time he said that i explained certain matters to you i suppose i should have done so before all women are motherwomen zap stared at him incredulously this isnt the case at all yes it is said reith the pnume fed you drugs to keep you immature the diko or so i imagine you arent drugged now and youre becoming normalmore or less havent you noticed changes in yourself zap sank back in her chair dumbfounded by his knowledge of her embarrassing secret such things are not to be talked about so long as you know whats happening zap sat looking out over the water in a diffident voice she asked you have noticed changes in me well yes first of all you no longer look like the ghost of a sick boy zap whispered i dont want to be a fat animal wallowing in the dark must i be a mother all mothers are women reith explained but not all women are mothers not all mothers become fat animals strange strange why are some women mothers and not others is it evil destiny men are involved in the process said reith look yonder on the deck of that cottage two children a woman a man the woman is a mother she is young and looks healthy the man is the father without fathers there are no children before reith could proceed with his explanation old cauch returned to the table and seated himself all is satisfactory very much so said reith we will regret leaving your village cauch nodded complacently in a few poor ways we are a fortunate folk neither rigorous like the khors nor obsessively flexible like the thangs to the west what of yourselves i admit to curiosity regarding your provenance and your destination for i regard you as unusual folk reith ruminated a moment or two then said i dont mind satisfying your curiosity if you are willing to pay my not unreasonable fee in fact i can offer you various grades of enlightenment for a hundred sequins i guarantee amazement and awe cauch drew back hands raised in protest tell me nothing upon which you place a value but any oddments of small talk you can spare at no charge will find in me an attentive listener reith laughed triviality is a luxury i cant afford tomorrow we depart zsafathra our few sequins must take us to sivishein what fashion i dont know as to this i cant advise you said cauch not even for a fee my experience extends only so far as urmank here you must go carefully the thangs will take all your sequins without a qualm useless to feel anger or injury this is the thang temperament rather than work they prefer to connive zsafathrans are very much on their guard when they visit urmank as you will see should you choose to go in our company to the urmank bazaar hmm reith rubbed his chin what of our boat in this case cauch shrugged somewhat too casually or so it seemed to reith what is a boat a floating shell of wood we had planned to sell this valuable boat at urmank said reith still to save myself the effort of navigation i will let it go here for less than its full value with a quiet laugh cauch shook his head i have no need for so clumsy and awkward a craft the rigging is frayed the sails are by no means the best there is only a poor assortment of gear and rope in the forward caddy after an hour and a half of proposals and counterproposals reith disposed of the boat for fortytwo sequins together with all costs of accommodation at zsafathra and transportation to urmank on the morrow as they bargained they consumed quantities of the pepper tea a mild intoxicant reiths mood became loose and easy the present seemed none too bad the future it would be met on its own terms at the moment the failing afternoon light seeped through the enormous ouinga trees pervading the air with dusty violet and the pond mirrored the sky cauch went off about his affairs reith leaned back in his chair he considered zap who also had drunk a considerable quantity of the pepper tea some alteration of his mood caused him to see her not as a pnumekin and a freak but as a personable young woman sitting quietly in the dusk her attention was fixed on something across the pavilion what she saw astonished her and she turned to reith in wonder reith noticed how large and dark were her eyes she spoke in a shocked whisper did you see that what a young man and a young womanthey stood close and put their faces together really yes i cant believe it just what did they do welli cant quite describe it was it like this reith put his hands on her shoulders looked deep into the startled eyes no not quite they were closer like this reith put his arms around her he remembered the cold water of the pagaz lake the desperate animal vitality of her body as she had clung to him was it like this she pushed back at his shoulders yes let me go someone might think us boisterous did they do this reith kissed her she looked at him in astonishment and alarm and put her hand to her mouth no why did you do that did you mind well no i dont think so but please dont do it again it makes me feel very strangely that said reith is the effects of the diko wearing off he drew back and sat with his head spinning she looked at him uncertainly i cant understand why you did that reith took a deep breath its natural for men and women to be attracted to each other this is called the reproductive instinct and sometimes it results in children zap became alarmed will i now be a motherwoman no said reith wed have to become far friendlier youre sure reith thought that she leaned toward him im sure he kissed her again and this time after a first nervous motion she made no resistance then she gasped dont move they wont notice us if we sit like this theyll be ashamed to look reith froze his face close to hers who wont notice us he muttered looknow reith glanced over his shoulder across the pavilion stood two dark shapes wearing black cloaks and widebrimmed black hats gzhindra she whispered cauch came into the pavilion and went to talk with the gzhindra after a moment he led them out into the road dusk became night across the pavilion the serving girls hung up lamps with yellow and green shades and brought new trays and tureens to the buffet table reith and zap sat somberly back in the shadows cauch returning to the pavilion joined them tomorrow at dawn we will depart for urmank and no doubt arrive by noon you know the reputation of the thangs to some extent the reputation is deserved said cauch they cheat in preference to keeping faith their favorite money is stolen money so be on your guard reith asked casually who were the two men in black with whom you spoke half an hour ago cauch nodded as if he had been awaiting the question those were gzhindra or groundmen as we call them who sometimes act as agents for the pnume their business tonight was different they have taken a commission from the khors to locate a man and a woman who desecrated a sacred place and stole a boat near the town of fauzh the description by a peculiar coincidence matched your own though certain discrepancies enabled me to state with accuracy that no such persons had been seen at zsafathra still they may discuss the matter with people who do not know you as well as i to avoid any possible confusion of identities i suggest that you alter your appearance as dramatically as possible that is easier said than done said reith not altogether cauch put his fingers into his mouth producing a shrill whistle without surprise or haste one of the serving girls approached a pleasant creature broad in hips shoulders cheekbones and mouth with nondescript brown hair worn in a wildly coquettish array of ringlets well then you desire something bring a pair of turbans said cauch the orange and white with black bangles the girl procured the articles going to zap she wound the orange and white cloth around the black cap of hair tied it so that the tasseled ends hung behind the left ear then affixed black bangles to swing somewhat in front of the right ear reith marveled at the transformation zap now seemed daring and mischievous a gay young girl costumed as a pirate reith was next fitted with the turban zap seemed to find the transformation amusing she opened her mouth and laughed the first occasion reith had heard her do so cauch appraised them both a remarkable difference you have become a pair of hedaijhans tomorrow i will provide you with shawls your very mothers would not know you what do you charge for this service demanded reith a reasonable sum i hope a total of eight sequins to include the articles themselves fitting and training in the postures of the hedaijhans essentially you must walk with a swagger swinging your armsso cauch demonstrated a mincing lurching gait with your handsso now lady you first remember your knees must be bent swing swagger zap followed the instructions with great earnestness looking toward reith to see if he laughed the practice went on into the night while the pink moon sailed behind the ouinga trees and the blue moon rose in the east finally cauch pronounced himself satisfied you would deceive almost anyone so then to the couch tomorrow we journey to urmank the sleeping cubicle was dim cracks in the rattan wall admitting slits of green and yellow light from the pavilion lamps as many more from the pink and blue moons shining from different directions to make a multicolored mesh on the floor zap went to the wall and peered through the cracks out toward the avenue which ran under the ouingas she looked for several minutes reith came to join her what do you see nothing they would not let themselves be seen so easily she turned away and with an inscrutable glance toward reith went to sit on one of the wicker couches presently she said you are a very strange man reith had no reply to make there is so much you dont tell me sometimes i feel as if i know nothing whatever what do you want to know how people of the surface act how they feel why they do the things they do reith went to where she sat and stood looking down at her do you want to learn all these things tonight she sat looking down at her hands no im afraid not now reith reached out and touched her head he was suddenly wildly tempted to sit down beside her and tell her the tale of his remarkable past he wanted to feel her eyes on him to see her pale face attentive and marveling in fact thought reith he had begun to find this strange girl with her secret thoughts stimulating he turned away as he crossed to his own couch he felt her eyes on his back chapter seven the morning sunlight entered the cubicle strained by the withes of the wall going out upon the pavilion reith and zap found cauch making a breakfast of pilgrimpod cakes and a hot broth redolent of the shore he inspected reith and zap narrowly paying particular attention to the turbans and their gait not too bad but you tend to forget more swagger lady more shrug to your shoulders remember when you leave the pavilion you are hedaijhans in case suspicions have been aroused in case someone waits and watches after breakfast the three went out upon the avenue which led northward under the ouinga trees reith and zap as thoroughly hedaijhan as turban shawl and mincing gait could make them to a pair of carts drawn by a type of animal reith had not previously seen a grayskinned beast which pranced elegantly and precisely on eight long legs cauch climbed aboard the first cart reith and zap joined him the carts departed zsafathra the road led out upon a damp land of reeds waterplants isolated black stumps trailing limegreen tendrils cauch gave a great deal of his attention to the sky as did the zsafathrans in the cart behind reith finally asked what are you watching for occasionally said cauch we are molested by a tribe of predatory birds from the hills yonder in fact there you see one of their sentinels he pointed to a black speck flapping across the southern sky it appeared the size of a large buzzard cauch went on in a voice of resignation presently they will fly out to attack us you show no great alarm said reith we have learned how to deal with them cauch turned and gestured to the cart behind then accelerated the pace of his own cart to open up a gap of a hundred yards between the two out of the southern skies came a flock of fifty or sixty flapping birdcreatures as they drew near reith saw that each carried two chunks of stone half the size of his head he looked uneasily toward cauch what do they do with the rocks they drop them with remarkable accuracy assume that you stood in the road and that thirty creatures flew above you at their customary height of five hundred feet thirty stones would strike you and crush you to the ground evidently you have learned how to frighten them off no nothing of the sort you disturb their accuracy to the contrary we are essentially a passive people and we try to deal with our enemies so that they disconcert or defeat themselves have you wondered why the khors do not attack us the thought has occurred to me when the khors attackand they have not done so for six hundred yearswe evade them and by one means or another penetrate their sacred groves here we perform acts of defilement of the most simple natural and ordinary sort they no longer can use the grove for procreation and must either migrate or perish our weapons i agree are indelicate but typify our philosophy of warfare and these birds reith dubiously watched the approach of the flock surely the same weapons are ineffectual i would presume so cauch agreed though for a fact we have never tested them in this case we do nothing whatever the birds soared overhead cauch urged the draybeast into a sinuous lope one by one the birds dropped their stones which fell to strike the road behind the cart the birds you must understand can only compute the position of a stationary target in this case their accuracy is their undoing the stones were all dropped with croaks of frustration the birds flew back to the mountains they will more than likely return with another load of stones said cauch do you notice how this road is elevated some four feet above the surrounding marsh the toil has been accomplished by the birds over many centuries they are dangerous only if you stand to watch the carts moved through a forest of waxbrown trees seething with hordes of small white fuzzballs halfspider halfmonkey which bounded from branch to branch venting raucous little screams and hurling twigs at the travelers the road then led twenty miles across a plain littered with boulders of honeycolored tuff toward a pair of tall volcanic necks each growing into an ancient weathered castle in ages past the headquarters of hermetic cults but now according to cauch the abode of ghouls by day they are never seen but by night they come down to prowl the outskirts of urmank sometimes the thangs catch them in traps for use at the carnival the road passed between the peaks and urmank came into view a disorderly straggle of high narrow houses of black timber brown tile and stone a quay bordered the waterfront where half a dozen ships floated placidly at moorages behind the quay was the marketplace and bazaar to which a flutter of orange and green banners gave a festive air a long wall of crumbling brick bounded the bazaar a clutter of mud huts beyond seemed to indicate a caste of pariahs behold urmank said cauch the town of the thangs they are not fastidious as to who comes and who goes provided only that they take away fewer sequins than they brought in my case they will be disappointed said reith i hope to gain sequins by one means or another cauch gave him a marveling sideglance you intend to take sequins from the thangs if you control such a miraculous power please share it with me the thangs have cheated us so regularly that now they regard the process as their birthright oh i tell you in urmank you must be wary if you are cheated why do you deal with them it seems an absurdity cauch admitted after all we could bring a ship and sail it to hedaijha the green erges coadbut we are a wry people it amuses us to come to urmank where the thang provide entertainments look yonder see the area wrapped around with brown and orange canvas there is the site of the stilting beyond are the games of chance where the visitor invariably loses more than he gains urmank is a challenge to zsafathra always we hope to outwit the thangs our joint efforts may yield a profit said reith at least i can bring a fresh outlook to bear cauch gave an indifferent shrug zsafathrans have tried to outdo the thangs from beyond the brink of memory they deal with us by formula first we are enticed by the prospect of quick gain then after we have put down our sequins the prospects recede well first we will refresh ourselves the inn of the lucky mariner has proved satisfactory in the past as my associate you are safe from thuggery kidnap and slavetaking however you must guard your own money the thangs can be coerced only so far and no further the common room at the inn of the lucky mariner was furnished in a style reith had not seen previously on tschai angular chairs of wooden posts and poles lined the walls which were whitewashed brick in alcoves glass pots displayed the movement of iridescent seaworms the chief functionary wore a brown caftan buttoned down the front a black skullcap black slippers and black fingerguards his face was bland his manners suave he proffered for reiths inspection a pair of adjoining cubicles furnished with couch nightstand and lamp which with fresh body linen and foot ointment rented for the inclusive sum of three sequins reith thought the figure reasonable and said as much to cauch yes said cauch three sequins is no great amount but i recommend that you make no use of the foot ointment as a new amenity it arouses suspicion it may stain the woodwork whereupon you will be levied an extra charge or it may contain a pulsing vescient the balm for which sells at five sequins the dram cauch spoke in full earshot of the functionary who laughed quietly and without offense old zsafathran you are overskeptical for once recently we were required to accept a large stock of tonics and ointments in lieu of payment and we have merely put these substances at the disposal of our guests do you require a diuretic or a vermifuge we supply these at only a nominal charge at the moment nothing said cauch what of your hedaijhan friends everyone is the better for an occasional purge which we offer at ten bice no well then for your evening meal let me recommend the choicest offerings of land and sea a few steps to the right along the quay i have dined there on a previous occasion said cauch the substances set before me would have quelled the appetite of a highcastle ghoul we will buy bread and fruit in the market in that case be so good as to patronize the booth of my nephew opposite the depilatorium we will inspect his produce cauch led the way out upon the quay the lucky mariners comparatively scrupulous still as you see one must be alert on my last visit a troupe of musicians played in the common room i stopped for a moment to listen and on my reckoning discovered a charge of four sequins as far as the offer of purgative at little or no chargehere cauch coughedthis is all very well on a previous visit to urmank a similar offer was put to my grandfather who accepted and thereafter discovered a lock on the door to the convenience and consequent usage charge the medication in the long run cost him dearly it is wise in ones dealings with the thangs to examine every aspect of a situation the three strolled along the quay reith examining the ships with interest these were all fatbellied little cogs with high poops and foredecks propelled by sails when the wind was fair and an electric jetpump otherwise in front of each a board announced the name of the ship the port of destination and the date of sailing cauch touched reiths arm it might be imprudent to evince too great an interest in the ships why at urmank it is always the part of wisdom to dissemble reith looked back up the quay no one appears to be heeding us if they are they will take it for granted that i dissemble and actually plan a journey overland cauch sighed at urmank life has many surprises for the unwary reith halted by a board the ship nhiahar destination ching the murky isles the south schanizade coast kazain a moment reith climbed a gangplank and approached a thin and somber man in a leather apron where is the captain if you please i am he in connection with a voyage to kazain what fare would you demand for two persons for the class a cabin i require four sequins per person per diem which includes nutrition the passage to kazain is generally thirtytwo days hence the total fee for two persons is let us say two hundred and sixty sequins reith expressed surprise at the magnitude of the amount but the captain maintained an indifferent attitude reith returned to the dock i need something over two hundred and fifty sequins not an impossible sum said cauch a diligent laborer can earn four or even five sequins a day porters are always in demand along the docks what of the gambling booths the district is yonder beside the bazaar needless to say you are unlikely to overcome the thang gamesters on their own premises they walked into a plaza paved with squares of salmonpink stone a thousand years ago the tyrant przelius built a great rotunda here only a floor remains there foodstalls there garments and sandals there ointments and extracts as cauch spoke he pointed toward various quarters of the plaza where the booths offered a great variety of goods foodstuffs cloth leather an earthcolored melange of spices tinware and copper black iron slabs pads rods and bars glassware and lamps paper charms and fetishes beyond the floor of the rotunda and the more or less orderly array of booths were the entertainments orange tents with rugs in front where girls danced to noseflutes and snapblocks some wore garments of gauze others danced bare to the waist a few no more than a year or two from childhood wore only sandals zap watched these and their postures with amazement then with a shrug and a numb expression she turned away muffled chanting attracted reiths attention a canvas wall enclosed a small stadium from which now came a sudden chorus of hoots and groans the stilt contests cauch explained it appears that one of the champions has been downed and many wagers have gone by the boards as they passed the stadium reith caught a view of four men on tenfoot stilts stalking warily around each other one kicked forth with his stilt another struck a blow with a pillowheaded club a third caught unaware careened away preserving his balance by a miracle while the others hopped after him like grotesque carrionbirds the stiltfighters are mostly black mountain micacutters said cauch the outsider who wagers on the bouts might as well drop his money into a hole cauch gave his head a rueful jerk still we always hope my brothers namefather won fortytwo sequins at the eelrace some years ago i must admit that for two days previously he burnt incense and implored divine intervention lets watch an eelrace said reith if divine intervention earns a profit of fortytwo sequins our own intelligence should produce at least as much and hopefully more this way then past the brathouse reith was about to inquire what a brathouse might be when a grinning urchin ran dose and kicked reith on the shins then dodging back made an ugly face and ran into the brathouse reith looked after the child in wrathful puzzlement whats the reason for that come said cauch ill show you he led the way into the brathouse on a stage thirty feet distant stood the child who upon their entrance emitted a hideous taunting squeal behind the counter stood a suave middleaged thang with a silky brown mustache nasty tyke dont you think here give him a good pelting these mudballs come ten bice apiece the dungpackets are six to the sequin and these prickleburrs are five to the sequin yah yah yah screamed the urchin why worry he couldnt heave a rock this far go ahead sir give it to him suggested the operator which will it be the mudballs the dungpackets make a hideous reek the brat despises them and the thornballs hell rue the day he attacked you you get up there said reith let me throw at you prices double sir reith departed the brathouse with the taunts of both urchin and operator accompanying him to the reach of earshot wise restraint said cauch no sequins to be earned in such a place one cant live by bread alone but no matter show me the eel races only a few steps further they walked toward the sagging old wall which separated the bazaar from urmank old town at the very edge of the open area almost in the shadow of the wall they came to a ushaped counter surrounded by twoscore men and women many wearing outland garments a few feet beyond the open end of the u a wooden reservoir stood on a concrete platform the reservoir six feet in diameter and two feet high was equipped with a hinged cover and emptied into a covered flume which ran between the arms of the u to empty into a glass basin at the far bend the attention of the players was riveted upon the glass basin as reith watched a green eel darted forth from the chute and into the basin followed after a moment or two by eels of various other colors green wins again cried out the eelmaster in a voice of anguish lucky lucky green hands behind the screen please until i pay the winners i am sorely hit twenty sequins for this jadarak gentleman who risked a mere two sequins ten sequins for this greenhatted lady of the azote coast who chanced a sequin on the color of her hat what no more is this all i have not been struck so sorely as first i feared the operator cleared the boards of sequins laid down upon the other colors a new race will now occur arrange your bets sequins must be placed squarely upon the chosen color if you please to avoid misunderstanding i set no limit bet as high as you please up to a limit of a thousand sequins since my total wealth and reserve is only ten thousand five times already i have been bankrupted always i have climbed back from poverty to serve the gambling folk of urmank is this not true dedication as he spoke he gathered the eels into a basket and carried them to the upper end of the chute he hauled on a rope which passing over a frame lifted the lid of the reservoir reith edged close and peered down into the pool of water contained within the eelmaster made no objection look your fill my man the only mysteries here are the eels themselves if i could read their secrets i would be a rich man today within the reservoir reith saw a baffle which defined a spiral channel originating at a center well and twisting out to the chute with a gate to the center well which the eelmaster now snapped shut in the center well he placed the eels and closed down the lid you have witnessed he called out the eels move at random as free as though they traveled the depths of their native streams they whirl they race they seek a ray of light when i raise the gate all will dash forth which will win the race to the basin ah who knows the last winner was green will green win again place your bets all bets down aha a grandee here wagers generously upon gray and mauve ten sequins on each whats this a purple sequin upon purple behold all a noblewoman of the bashai backlands wagers a hundred value on purple will she win a thousand only the eels know i know too cauch muttered to reith she will not win purple eel will loiter along the way i predict a win for white or pale blue why do you say that no one has bet on pale blue only three sequins are down on white true but how do the eels know herein as the eelmaster avers lies the mystery reith asked zap can you understand how the operator controls the eels to his profit i dont understand anything well have to give this matter some thought said reith lets watch another race in the interests of research ill put a sequin down upon pale blue are all bets made called out the eelmaster please be meticulous sequins overlapping two colors are reckoned to fall on the losing color no more bets very well then please keep hands behind the screen no more bets please the race is about to begin stepping to the reservoir he pulled a lever which presumably lifted the gate in front of the spiral baffle the race is in progress eels vie for light they cavort and wheel in their joy down the chute they come which is to win the gamblers craned their necks to watch into the basin streaked the white eel ah groaned the operator how can i profit with such uncooperative eels twenty sequins to this already wealthy gray you are a mariner sir and ten to this noble young slavetaker from cape braise i pay i pay where is my profit he came past flipping reiths sequin into his tray so then everyone alert for the next race reith turned to cauch with a shake of his head perplexing perplexing indeed we had better go on they wandered the bazaar until carina went down the sky they watched a wheel of fortune they studied a game where the participants bought a bag of irregular colored tablets and sought to fit them together into a checkerboard a halfdozen other games more or less ordinary sunset arrived the three went to a small restaurant near the inn of the lucky mariner where they dined upon fish in red sauce pilgrimpod bread a salad of seagreens and a great black flask of wine in only one phase of existence said cauch can the thang be trusted their cuisine to which they are loyal the reason for this particularity escapes me it goes to demonstrate said reith that you cant judge a man by the table he sets cauch asked shrewdly how then can a man judge his fellows for example what is the basis of your calculation only one thing i know for certain said reith first thoughts are always wrong cauch sitting back inspected reith under quizzical eyebrows true quite possibly true for instance you probably are not the cool desperado you appear on first meeting i have been judged even more harshly said reith one of my friends declares that i seem like a man from another world odd that you should say that remarked cauch a strange rumor has recently reached zsafathra to the effect that all men originated on a far planet much as the redeemers of yao aver and not from a union of the sacred xyxyl bird and the seademon rhadamth furthermore it was told that certain folk from this far planet now wander old tschai performing the most remarkable deeds defying the dirdir defeating the chasch persuading the wankh a new feeling is abroad across tschai the sense that change is on its way what do you think of all this i suppose the rumor is not inherently absurd said reith zap said in a subdued voice a planet of men it would be more strange and wild than tschai that of course is problematical remarked cauch in a voice of didactic analysis and no doubt irrelevant to our present case the secrets of personality are mystifying for instance consider the three of us one honest zsafathran and two brooding vagabonds driven like leaves before the winds of fate what prompts such desperate journeys what is to be gained i myself in all my lifetime have not gone so far as cape braise yet i feel none the worse a trifle dull perhaps i look at you and ponder the girl is frightened the man is harsh goals beyond her understanding propel him he takes her where she fears to go still would she go back if she could cauch looked into zap s face she turned away reith managed a painful grin without money we wont go anywhere bah said cauch bluffly if money is all you lack i have the remedy once a week each ivensday combat trials are arranged in point of fact otwile the champion sits yonder he nodded toward a totally bald man almost seven feet tall massive in the shoulders and thighs narrow at the hips he sat alone sipping wine staring morosely out upon the quay otwile is a great fighter said cauch he once grappled a green chasch buck and held his own at least he escaped with his life what are the prizes reith inquired the man who remains five minutes within the circle wins a hundred sequins he is paid a further twenty sequins for each broken bone otwile sometimes provides a hundredworth within the minute and what if the challenger throws otwile away cauch pursed his lips no prize is posted the feat is considered impossible why do you ask do you plan to make the trial not i said reith i need three hundred sequins assume that i remained five minutes in the ring to gain a hundred sequins i would then need ten broken bones to earn a further two hundred cauch seemed disappointed you have an alternative scheme my mind reverts to the eelrace how can the operator control eleven eels from a distance of ten feet while they swim down a covered chute it seems extraordinary it does indeed declared cauch for years folk of zsafathra have put down their sequins on the presumption that such control is impossible might the eels alter color to suit the circumstances impractical unthinkable does the operator stimulate the eels telepathically i consider this unlikely i have no better theories said cauch reith reviewed the eelmasters procedure he raises the lid of the reservoir the interior is open and visible the water is no more than a foot deep the eels are placed into the center well and the lid is closed down this before betting is curtailed yet the eelmaster appears to control the motion of the eels cauch gave a sardonic chuckle do you still think you can profit from the eelraces i would like to examine the premises a second time reith rose to his feet now the races are over for the day still let us examine the ground it is only five minutes walk as you wish the area surrounding the eelrace layout was deserted and lit dimly by the glow of distant bazaar lamps after the animation of the daytime hours the table reservoir and chute seemed peculiarly silent reith indicated the wall which limited the compound what lies to the other side the old town and beyond the mausoleums where the thangs take their deadnot a place to visit by night reith examined the chute and reservoir the lid to which was locked down for the night he turned to cauch what time do the races begin at noon precisely tomorrow morning id like to look around some more indeed mused cauch he looked at reith sidewise you have a theory a suspicion if he looked around as zap grasped his arm she pointed over there across the compound walked two figures in black cloaks and wide black hats gzhindra said zap cauch said nervously let us return to the inn it is not wise to walk the dark places of urmank at the inn cauch retired to his chamber reith took zap to her cubicle she was reluctant to enter whats the matter asked reith i am afraid of what the gzhindra are following us thats not necessarily true those might have been any two gzhindra but perhaps they werent in any event they cant get at you in the room the girl was still dubious im right next door said reith if anyone bothers you scream what if someone kills you first i cant think that far ahead said reith if im dead in the morning dont pay the score she wanted further reassurance reith patted the soft black curls good night he closed the door and waited until the bolt shot home then he went into his own cubicle and despite cauchs reassurances made a careful examination of floor walls and ceiling at last feeling secure he turned the light down to a glimmer and lay himself upon the couch chapter eight the night passed without alarm or disturbance in the morning reith and zap breakfasted alone at the cafe on the quay the sky was cloudless the smoky sunlight left crisp black shadows behind the tall houses and glinted on the water of the harbor zap seemed less pessimistic than usual and watched the porters the hawkers the seamen and outlanders with interest what do you think of the ghian now asked reith zap at once became grave the folk act differently from what i expected they dont run back and forth they dont seem maddened by the sunglare of courseshe hesitatedone sees a great deal of boisterous conduct but no one seems to mind i marvel at the garments of the girls they are so bold as if they want to provoke attention and again no one objects quite the reverse said reith i could never act like that zap said primly that girl coming toward us see how she walks why does she act that way thats how shes put together also she wants men to notice her these are the instincts that the diko suppressed in you zap protested with unusual fervor i eat no diko now i feel no such instincts reith looked smiling off across the quay the girl to whom zap had drawn attention slowed her step hitched at the orange sash around her waist smiled at reith stared curiously at zap and sauntered on zap looked sidelong at reith she started to speak then held her tongue a moment later she blurted i dont understand anything of the ghian i dont understand you just now you smiled at that odious girl you never here she stopped short then continued in a low voice i suppose you blame instinct for your conduct reith became impatient the time has come he said to explain the facts of life instincts are part of our biological baggage and cannot be avoided men and women are different he went on to explain the processes of reproduction zap sat rigid looking across the water so said reith its not unnatural that people indulge in this kind of conduct zap said nothing her hands so reith noticed were clenched and her knuckles shone white she said in a low voice the khors in the sacred groveis that what they were doing so i suppose and you took me away so i wouldnt see well yes i thought you might be confused zap was silent a moment we might have been killed reith shrugged i suppose there was a chance and those girls dancing without clothesthey wanted to do that if someone gave them money and everyone on the surface feels this way most of them i should say do you certainly sometimes anyway not all the time then why she stuttered then why she could not finish reith reached out to pat her hand she snatched it away dont touch me sorry but dont be angry you brought me to this horrible place you deprived me of life you pretended to be kind but all the time youve been planningthat no no cried reith nothing of the sort youre quite wrong zap looked at him with eyebrows coolly raised you find me repulsive then reith threw his hands up in the air of course i dont find you repulsive in fact in fact what cauch arriving at the table provided for reith a welcome interruption you spent a comfortable night yes said reith zap rose to her feet and walked away cauch drew a long face how have i offended her shes angry with me said reith whyi dont know isnt this always the case but soon for reasons equally unknown she will again become benign meanwhile i am interested in hearing your ideas in regard to the eelraces reith looked dubiously after zap who had returned to the inn of the lucky mariner is it safe to leave her alone have no fear said cauch at the inn you and she are known to be under my sponsorship well then to the eelraces you understand that they are not yet in operation the races do not start till noon so much the better zap had never been so angry she halfwalked halfran to the inn through the dim common room to the cubicle where she had spent the night she entered furiously shot the bolt and went to sit on the couch for ten minutes she let her thoughts rage without control then she began to cry silently tears of frustration and disillusionment welling down her cheeks she thought of the shelters the quiet corridors with the blackrobed figures drifting past in the shelters no one would provoke her to anger or excitement or any of the other strange emotions which from time to time colored her brain they would give her diko once more she frowned trying to recall the flavor of the crisp little wafers on sudden impulse she rose to her feet examined herself in the mirror which hung on the side wall the previous evening she had looked at herself with no great interest the face which looked back seemed just a face eyes nose mouth chin now she studied herself earnestly she touched the black hair curling down her forehead combed it with her fingers studied the effect the face which looked back was that of a stranger she thought of the lithe girl who had regarded reith with such insolence she had worn a garment of blue cloth which clung to the figure different from the shapeless gray smock which zap now wore she pulled it off stood in her white undergown she turned studied herself from all angles a stranger now for certain what if reith could see her now what would he think the idea of reith made her furiously angry he considered her a child or something even more ignoble she had no word for the concept she felt herself with her hands and staring in the mirror marveled at the changes which had come over her her original scheme of returning to the shelters dwindled the zuzhma kastchai would give her to the darkness if by chance she were allowed to keep her life they would feed her diko again her lips twitched no more diko well then what of adam reith who considered her so repulsive thather mind refused to complete the train of thought what was to become of her she studied herself in the mirror and felt very sorry for the darkhaired girl with thin cheeks and sad eyes who looked back at her if she ran away from adam reith how could she survive she slipped into her gray smock but decided against tying the orange cloth around her head instead she tied it around her waist as a sash as she had noticed other girls of urmank doing she examined herself in the mirror again and rather liked the effect what would adam reith think she opened the door looked up and down the corridor and ventured forth the commonroom was empty but for a squat old woman who scrubbed the stone floor with a brush and looked up with a sneer zap hastened her pace and went out into the street here she hesitated she had never been alone before and the sensation was frightening if thrilling crossing to the quay she watched porters unloading a cog neither her vocabulary nor her stock of ideas contained the equivalent of quaint or picturesque nevertheless she was charmed by the bluffbrown craft moving gently to the heave of the water she drew a deep breath freak or not repulsive or not she had never felt so alive before the ghaun was a wild cruel placehere the zuzhma kastchai had not dissembledbut after living in the goldenbrown sunlight how could anyone choose to return to the shelters she walked along the quay to the cafe where somewhat diffidently she looked for reith what she would say to him she had not yet formulated perhaps she would sweep to her seat with only a haughty glance to let him know what she thought of his opinions reith was nowhere to be seen a sudden terrible fear came over her had he taken the opportunity to escape to be rid of her impulses urged upon her she wanted to cry out adam reith adam reith she could not believe that the reassuring form so taut and economical of motion was nowhere to be seen she turned to leave and stepped full into the advancing body of a tall massive man wearing pantaloons of dove brown leather a loose white shirt and a vest of maroon brocade a small brimless cap clung to the side of his bald head he gave a soft grunt as she walked into him and held her away with two hands on her shoulders where do you go in such haste nowhere stammered zap i was looking for someone you have found me which is not the worst of luck come along i have not yet had my morning wine then we will discuss our affairs zap stood paralyzed by indecision she tentatively tried to shrink away from the mans grasp which only tightened zap winced come said the man she stumbled with him to a nearby booth the man signaled a jug of white wine and a platter of fried fishcakes was set before them eat the man told her drink i stint no one either in bounty or hard knocks he poured her a liberal goblet of wine now before we proceed what are your fees certain of your number knowing me for otwile have attempted nothing less than larcenyto their dissatisfaction i may say so then your price price for what whispered zap otwiles blue eyes widened in surprise you are an odd one what is your race you are too pale for a thang too slender for a gray zap lowered her eyes she tasted the wine then searched desperately over her shoulder for reith ah but you are shy declared otwile and delicate of manner as well he began to eat zap tried to slip away sit snapped otwile she hastily returned to her seat drink she sipped at the wine which was stronger than any she had yet tasted that is better said otwile now we understand each other no said zap in her soft voice we dont i dont want to be here what do you want of me otwile again stared at her in disbelief you dont know of course not unlessyou dont mean that otwile grinned i mean precisely that and more buti dont know anything about such things i dont want to learn otwile put down his fishcakes he said incredulously a virgin wearing a sash is that how you represent yourself i dont know what such a thing is i must go to find adam reith you have found me which is somewhat better drink wine to relax yourself today is to be that particular day you will remember to the end of your time otwile poured full the goblets indeed i will join you to relax myself truth to tell i myself have become somewhat excited reith and cauch walked through the bazaar where the fish and produce vendors called attention to their merchandise by means of peculiar ululations are they singing asked reith no said cauch the cries were no more than devices to attract attention the thang have no great feeling for music the sellingscreams of the fishwives are inventive and emotional true listen and you will hear how they try to outdo each other reith conceded that certain of the advertisements were remarkably intricate in due course the social anthropologists will record and codify these calls but for the moment i am more interested in the eelraces to be sure said cauch though as you will notice they are not yet in operation they crossed the compound and stood appraising the vacant tables the reservoir and the chute looking across the wall reith noticed the fronds of a gnarled old psilla i want to look on the other side of the wall he said just so said cauch and i have the fullest sympathy with your curiosity but are we not at the moment directing our energies to the eelraces we are said reith i see a portal through the wall opposite that vendor of amulets do you care to accompany me certainly said cauch i am always alert to learn they walked along beside the old wall which in the remote past had been faced with brown and white tiles most of which had fallen away revealing patches of dark brown brick passing through the portal they entered urmank old town a district of huts built of broken tile brick fragments of stone and odd lengths of timber some were abandoned ruins others were in the process of construction a continuing cycle of decay and regeneration in which every shard every stick every fragment of stone had been used a hundred times over twice as many generations lowcaste thangs and a squat bigheaded variety of gray peered forth from the doorways as reith and cauch went past stench thickened the air beyond the huts lay an area of rubble puddles of slime a few clumps of angry red bristlebush reith located the psilla of which he had taken note it stood close beside the wall overhanging a shed built of welllaid bricks the door was solid timber bound with iron secured with a heavy iron lock the shed backed firmly up against the wall reith looked around the landscape which was vacant except for a group of naked children paddling in a rivulet of yellow slime he approached the shed the lock the hasp the hinges were sound and solid there was no window to the shed nor any opening other than the door reith backed away weve seen all we need to see indeed cauch dubiously inspected the shed the wall the psilla tree i see nothing significant are you still referring to the eelraces of course they went back through the dismal huddle of huts reith said very likely we could make all our arrangements alone still the help of two trustworthy men might prove convenient cauch eyed him with awe and incredulity you seriously hope to take money from the eelrace if the eelmaster pays all winning bets i do no fear of that said cauch he will pay assuming that there are winnings and on this supposition how do you propose to share half for me half for you and your two men cauch pursed his lips i perceive something of an inequity from a mutual project one man should not derive three times the share of the others i believe that he should said reith when otherwise the other three gain nothing whatever the point is welltaken cauch admitted the affair shall go as you recommend they returned to the cafe reith looked for zap who was nowhere to be seen i must find my companion he told cauch no doubt she waits at the inn cauch made an affable gesture reith went to the inn but found zap nowhere making inquiries of the clerk he learned that she had come and gone leaving no intimation as to her destination reith went to the doorway and looked up and down the quay to the right porters in faded red kirtles and leather shoulderpads unloaded a cog to the left was the bustle of the bazaar he never should have left her alone he told himself especially in her mood of the morning he had taken her stability for granted never troubling to divine the state of her mind reith cursed himself for callousness and egocentricity the girl had been undergoing the most intense and dramatic emotional strains all the fundamental processes of life at once reith strode back to the cafe cauch eyed him with calm benevolence you appear concerned the girl who accompanies mei cant find her pah said cauch they are all alike she has gone to the bazaar to buy a trinket no she has no money she is utterly inexperienced she would go nowhereexcept reith turned to look toward the hills the way which lay between the ghoulcastles would she seriously consider going down into the shelters a new idea came to turn his bones to ice the gzhindra reith summoned the thang servantboy i breakfasted this morning with a young woman do you recall her yes indeed she wore an orange turban like a hedaijhan at least on that occasion you saw her another time i did she sat yonder wearing the sash of solicitation and consorting with otwile the champion they drank wine for a period then went off she went of her own free will asked reith in wonder the servant gave a shrug of indifference covertly insolent she wore the sash she uttered no outcry she leaned on his arm perhaps to steady herself for i believe her to have been somewhat drunk where did they go again the shrug otwiles chambers are not too far distant perhaps this was their resort show me the way no no the servant shook his head i am at my duties also i would not care to vex otwile reith jumped at him the servant stumbled back in a panic quick hissed reith this way then but hurry i am not supposed to leave the cafe they ran through the dank back alleys of urmank in and out of the brown light of carina which occasionally slanted down past the crooked gables of the tall houses the servant halted pointed along a walkway leading into a garden of green and purple foliage at the back of the shrubbery are otwiles rooms he scuttled back the way he had come reith ran along the walkway through the garden at the back stood a cottage of carved timber and panels of translucent fiber as reith approached he heard a sudden wordless cry of outrage from within unclean then there was the sound of a blow and a whimper reiths knees shook he tottered forward thrust open the door on the floor crouched zap glassyeyed and nude above her stood otwile zap stared at reith he saw a red welt on her cheek otwile spoke in a voice of hushed outrage who are you to intrude in my house reith ignored him he picked up zap s undergown a torn tangle of cloth he turned to look at otwile cauch spoke from the doorway come adam reith fetch the girl do not trouble yourself reith paid no heed he moved slowly toward otwile who waited smiling coldly hands on hips reith approached to within three feet otwile six inches taller smiled down at him zap said in a husky croak it wasnt his fault i wore an orange sash i didnt know reith turned slowly away he found zap s gray gown pulled it over her slender body he saw what had outraged otwile he could hardly control a great cry to express sorrow and pity and terrible grim amusement he put his arm around zap and started to lead her from the room otwile was dissatisfied he had been awaiting a touch a motion even a word to serve as a trigger for his muscles was he to be denied even the gratification of beating the man who had invaded his chambers the bubble of his rage burst he bounced forward and swung his leg in a kick reith was pleased to find otwile active twisting he caught otwiles ankle pulled dragged the champion hopping out into the garden and sent him careening into a thicket of scarlet bamboo otwile sprang forth like a leopard he halted stood with arms out grimacing hideously clenching and unclenching his hands reith punched him in the face otwile seemed not to notice he reached for reith who backed away hacking at the heavy wrists otwile came forward crowding reith against the sidewall reith feinted punched with his left hand and rapped his knuckles into otwiles face otwile gave a small flatfooted jump forward and another then he gave a hideous rasping scream and swung his great arm in an openhanded slap reith ducked below hit otwile full in the belly and as otwile jerked up his knee seized the crooked leg heaved up and sent otwile down flat on his back with a thud like a falling tree for a moment otwile lay dazed then he slowly struggled to a sitting position with a single backward glance reith led zap from the garden cauch bowed politely toward otwile and followed reith took zap to the inn she sat on the couch in her cubicle clutching the gray gown about herself limp and miserable reith sat down beside her what happened tears dripped down her cheeks she held her hands to her face reith stroked her head presently she wiped her eyes i dont know what i did wrongunless it was the sash he made me drink wine until i became dizzy he took me through the streets i felt very strange i could hardly walk in the house i wouldnt take off my clothes and he became angry then he saw me and he became even angrier he said i was unclean i dont know what to do with myself im sick im dying reith said no youre not sick or dying your body has started to function normally theres nothing whatever wrong with you im not unclean of course not reith rose to his feet ill send in a maid to take care of you then just lie quietly and sleep until i returni hope with enough money to put us aboard a ship zap nodded listlessly reith departed the cubicle at the cafe reith found cauch and two young zsafathrans who had come to urmank aboard the second cart this is schazar this is widisch said cauch both are reckoned competent i have no doubt but that they will fulfill any reasonable requirements in that case said reith lets be off about our business we havent too much time to spare or so i should judge the four sauntered off down the quay reith explained his theories which now we must put to the test mind you i may be wrong in which case the project will fail no said cauch you have employed an extraordinary mental process to adduce what i now see to be limpid truth the process is called logic said reith it is not always dependable but we shall see they passed the eelrace table where a few folk had already settled at the benches ready for the days gambling reith hurried his steps under the portal through the dismal byways of urmank old town toward the shed under the psilla tree they halted fifty yards away and took cover in a ruined hut at the edge of the wastelands ten minutes passed reith began to fidget i cant believe that weve come too late the young man schazar pointed across the wastes to the far end of the wall two men the men strolled closer one affected the flowing white robes and square white hat of an erze island sage the eelmaster muttered cauch the other a young man wore a pink skullcap and a light pink cape the two walked casually and confidently along the trail and parted company near the shed the eelmaster continued toward the portal widisch said easier merely to waylay the old charlatan and divest him of his pouch the effect after all is the same unfortunately said cauch he carries no sequins on his person and makes the fact well known his funds are brought to the eelraces daily by four armed slaves under the supervision of his chief wife the young man in pink strolled to the shed he fitted a key in the lock turned it three times opened the ponderous door and entered the shed he turned with surprise to find that reith and schazar had also pushed into the shed beside him he attempted to bluster what is the meaning of this i will speak one time only said reith we want your unstinting cooperation otherwise we will hang you by the toes to yonder psilla is that clear i understand perfectly said the young man with a quaver describe the routine the young man hesitated reith nodded to schazar who brought forth a coil of hard cord the young man said quickly the routine is quite simple i undress and step into the tank he indicated a cylindrical pool four feet in diameter at the back of the shed a tube communicates with the reservoir the level in the tank and that in the reservoir are the same i swim through the tube to the reservoir and come up into a space in the peripheral frame as soon as the lid is lowered i open a partition i reach into the reservoir and move the specified eel to the edge of the chute and how is the color specified by the eelmasters fingertaps on the top of the lid reith turned to cauch schazar and i are now in control i suggest that you now take your places at the table he spoke to the young man in pink is there sufficient space for two under the reservoir yes said the young man grudgingly just barely but tell me if i cooperate with you how will i protect myself from the eelmaster be frank with him said reith state that you value your life more than his sequins he will say that as far as he is concerned affairs are reversed too bad said reith the hazard of your trade how soon should we be in position within a minute or so reith removed his outer garments if by some ineptness we are detected surely the consequences are as plain to you as to me the apprentice merely grunted he doffed his pink robe follow me he stepped into the tank the way is dark but straight reith joined him in the tank the young man drew a deep breath and submerged reith did the same at the bottom finding a horizontal tube about three feet in diameter he pulled himself through staying close behind the apprentice they surfaced in a space about four feet long a foot and a half high a foot wide light entered through artfully arranged crevices which also allowed a view over the gaming tables reith thus could see that both cauch and widisch had found places along the counter from near at hand came the eelmasters voice welcome all to another day of exciting races who will win who will lose no one knows it may be me it may be you but we all will enjoy the fun of the races for those who are new to our little game you will notice that the board before you is marked with eleven colors you may bet any amount on any of the colors if your color wins you are paid ten times the amount of your bet note these eels and their colors white gray tawny light blue brown dark red vermilion blue green violet black are there any questions yes called cauch is there any limit on the betting the case now being delivered contains ten thousand sequins this is my limit i pay no more please place your bets with a practiced eye the eelmaster appraised the table he lifted the lid set the eels into the center of the reservoir no more betting please on the lid sounded taptap taptap twotwo whispered the apprentice thats green he pushed aside a panel and reaching into the reservoir seized the green eel and set it into the mouth of the chute then he drew back and closed the panel green wins called the eelmaster so then i pay twenty sequins to this sturdy seafarer make your bets please tap taptaptap sounded on the lid vermilion whispered the apprentice he performed as before vermilion wins called the eelmaster reith kept his eye to the crack on each occasion cauch and widisch had risked a pair of sequins on the third betting round each placed thirty sequins on white bets are now made came the eelmasters voice the lid came down tap tap came the sounds brown whispered the apprentice white said reith the white eel wins the apprentice groaned in muted distress he put the white eel into the chute another contest between these baffling little creatures came the complacent voice of the eelmaster on this occasion the winning color isbrown brown white yes white it is ha in my old age i become colorblind tribulation for a poor old man a pair of handsome winners here three hundred sequins for you three hundred sequins for you take your winnings gentlemen what you are betting the entire sum both of you yes luck appears to be with us today both on dark red yes notice the flight of yonder bloodbirds this is a portent the eelmaster smiled off into the sky who can divine the ways of nature i pray that you are incorrect well then all bets are made then in with the eels down with the lid and let the most determined eel issue forth the winner his hand rested a moment on the lid his fingernail struck the surface a single time they twist they search the light beckons we should soon have a winner here comesis it blue he gave an involuntary groan dark red he peered into the faces of the zsafathrans your presages astonishingly were correct yes said cauch did i not tell you as much pay over our winnings slowly the eelmaster counted out three thousandworth of sequins to each astonishing he glanced thoughtfully toward the reservoir do you observe any further portents nothing significant but i will bet nonetheless a hundred sequins on black i bet the same declared widisch the eelmaster hesitated he rubbed his chin looked around the counter extraordinary he put the eels into the reservoir are all bets laid his hand rested on the lid as if by nervous mannerism he brought his fingernails down in two sharp raps very well i open the gate he pulled the lever and strode up to the end of the chute and here comeswhat color black excellent declared cauch we reap a return after years of squandering money upon perverse eels pay over our gains if you please certainly croaked the eelmaster but i can work no more i suffer from an aching of the joints the eelracing is at an end reith and the apprentice immediately returned to the shed the apprentice donned his pink cape and hat and took to his heels reith and schazar returned through the old town to the portal where they encountered the eelmaster who strode past in a great flapping of his white gown the normally benign face was mottled red he carried a stout stave which he swung in short ominous jerks cauch and widisch awaited them on the quay cauch handed reith a pleasantly plump pouch your share of the winnings four thousand sequins the day has been edifying we have done well said reith our association has been mutually helpful which is a rare thing for tschai for our part we return instantly to zsafathra said cauch what of you urgent business calls me onward like yourselves my companion and i depart as soon as possible in that case farewell the three zsafathrans went their way reith turned into the bazaar where he made a variety of purchases back at the hotel he went to zap s cubicle and rapped on the door his heart pounding with anticipation who is it came a soft voice it is i adam reith a moment the door opened zap stood facing him face flushed and drowsy she wore the gray smock which she had only just pulled over her head reith took his bundles to the couch thisand thisand thisand thisfor you for me what are they look and see with a diffident sideglance toward reith she opened the bundles then for a period stood looking down at the articles they contained reith asked uneasily do you like them she turned to him a hurt gaze is this how you want me to be like the others reith stood nonplussed it was not the reaction he had expected he said carefully we will be traveling it is best that we go as inconspicuously as possible remember the gzhindra we must dress like the folk we travel among i see which do you like best zap lifted the dark green gown laid it down took up the bloodorange smock and dull white pantaloons then the rather jaunty light brown suit with the black vest and short black cape i dont know whether i like any of them try one on now certainly zap held up first one of the garments then another she looked at reith he grinned very well ill go in his own cubicle he changed into the fresh garments he had bought for himself gray breeches a darkblue jacket the gray furze smock he decided to discard as he threw it aside he felt the outline of the portfolio which after a moments hesitation he transferred to the inner lining of his new jacket such a set of documents if for no other reason had value as a curio he went to the common room presently zap appeared she wore the dark green gown why do you stare at me she asked reith could not tell her the truth that he was recalling the first time he had seen her a neurasthenic waif shrouded in a black cloak pallid and bonethin she retained something of her dreaming wistful look but her pallor had become a smooth sunshadowed ivory her black hair curled in ringlets over her forehead and ears i was thinking said reith that the gown suits you very well she made a faint grimace a twitch of the lips approaching a smile they walked out upon the quay to the cog nhiahar they found the taciturn master in the saloon working over his accounts you desire passage to kazain there is only the grand cabin to be had at seven hundred sequins or i can give you two berths in the dormitory at two hundred chapter nine a dead calm held the second sea the nhiahar slid out of the inlet propelled by its field engine by degrees urmank faded into the murk of distance the nhiahar moved in silence except for the gurgle of water under the bow the only other passengers were a pair of waxenfaced old women swathed in gray gauze who appeared briefly on deck then crept to their dark little cabin reith was wellsatisfied with the grand cabin it ranged the entire width of the ship with three great windows overlooking the sea astern in alcoves to port and starboard were wellcushioned beds as soft as any reith had felt on tschai if a trifle musty in the center stood a massive table of carved black wood with a pair of equally massive chairs at either end zap made a sulky appraisal of the room today she wore the dull white trousers with the orange blouse she seemed keyed up and tense and moved with nervous abruptness in jerks and halts and fidgeting twitches of the fingers reith watched her covertly trying to calculate the exact nature of her mood she refused to look toward him or meet his gaze at last he asked do you like the ship she gave a sullen shrug i have never seen anything like it before she went to the door where she turned him a sour twitch of a smilea derisive grimaceand went out on deck reith looked up at the overhead shrugged and after a final glance around the room followed her she had climbed the companionway to the quarterdeck where she stood leaning on the taffrail looking back the way they had come reith seated himself on a bench nearby and pretended to bask in the wan brown sunlight while he puzzled over her behavior she was female and inherently irrationalbut her conduct seemed to exceed this elemental fact certain of her attitudes had been formed in the shelters but these seemed to be waning upon reaching the surface she had abandoned the old life and discarded its points of view as an insect molts a skin in the process reith ruminated she had discarded her old personality but had not yet discovered a new one the thought gave reith a qualm part of the girls charm or fascination or whatever it was lay in her innocence her transparency transparency reith made a skeptical sound not altogether he went to join her what are you pondering so deeply she gave him a cool sideglance i was thinking of myself and the wide ghaun i remember my time in the dark i know now that below the world i was not yet born all those years while i moved quietly below the folk of the surface lived in color and change and air so this is why youve been acting so strangely no she cried in sudden passion it is not the reason is you and your secrecy you tell me nothing i dont know where we are going or what you are going to do with me reith frowned down at the black boil of the wake im not sure of these things myself but you must know something yes when i get to sivishe i want to return to my home which is far and remote and what of me and what of zap wondered reith a question he had avoided asking himself im not sure youd want to come with me he replied somewhat lamely tears glinted in her eyes where else can i go should i become a drudge or a gzhindra or wear an orange sash at urmank or should i die she swung away and marched forward to the bow past a group of the spadefaced seamen who watched her from the side of their pale eyes reith returned to the bench the afternoon passed black clouds to the north generated a cool wind the sails were shaken out and the cog drove forward zap presently came aft with a strange expression on her face she gave reith a look of sad accusation and went down to the cabin reith followed and found her lying on one of the couches dont you feel well no come outside youll be worse in here she staggered out upon the deck keep your eyes on the horizon said reith when the ship moves keep your head level do that for a while and youll feel better zap stood by the rail the clouds loomed overhead and the wind died the nhiahar lay wallowing with slatting sails from the sky came a purple dazzle slanting and slashing at the seaonce twice three times all in the flicker of an eyeblink zap gave a small scream and jerked back in terror reith caught her and held her as the thunder rumbled down she moved uneasily reith kissed her forehead her face her mouth the sun settled into a tattered panoply of gold and black and brown with the dusk came rain reith and zap retreated to their cabin where the steward served supper mincemeat seafruit biscuits they ate looking out through the great windows at the sea and rain and lightning and afterwards with lightning sparking the dark they became lovers at midnight the clouds departed stars burnt down from the sky look up there said reith among the stars are other worlds of men one of them is called earth he paused zap lay listening but reith for some obscure reason could say no more and presently she fell asleep the nhiahar driven by fair winds plunged down the second sea crashing through great white billows of foam cape braise reared up ahead the ship put into the ancient stone city of stheine to take on water then fared forth into the schanizade twenty miles down the coast a tongue of land hooked out to the west along the foreshore a forest of dark blue trees shrouded a city of flat domes cambered cusps sweeping colonnades reith thought to recognize the architecture and put a question to the captain is that a chasch city it is songh most southerly of the blue chasch places i have taken cargoes into songh but it is risky business you must know the games of the chasch antics of a dying race i have seen ruins on the kotan steppes a hundred places where old chasch or blue chasch once lived and who goes there now only the phung the city receded into the distance and disappeared from view as the ship passed south beyond the peninsula not long after a cry from one of the crew brought everyone out on deck in the sky a pair of airships fought one was a gleaming contrivance of blue and white metal shaped to a set of splendid curves a balustrade contained the deck on which lay a dozen creatures in glistening casques the other craft was austere and bleak a vessel sinister ugly gray built with only its function in mind it was slightly smaller than the blue chasch ship and somewhat more agile in the dorsal bubble crouched the dirdir crew intent at the work of destroying the chasch ship the vessels circled and swung now high now low careening around each other like venomous insects from time to time as circumstances offered the ships exchanged volleys of sandblast fire without noticeable effect far up into the graybrown sky spun the sparkling shapes to spiral giddily down one after the other veering only yards above the oceans surface the whole company of the nhiahar came on deck to watch the battle even the two old women who had not previously shown themselves as they scanned the sky the hood fell back from the head of one of them to reveal a keen pale countenance zap standing beside reith uttered a soft gasp and quickly turned away her gaze the blue chasch ship slid suddenly down the bow guns struck under the counter of the dirdir ship knocking it up tumbling it over and down into the sea where it struck with a soundless splash the blue chasch vessel swung in a single grand circle then cruised back toward songh the old women had disappeared below zap spoke in a tremulous whisper did you notice yes i noticed they are gzhindra are you sure yes i am sure i suppose gzhindra make voyages like other folk said reith somewhat hollowly so far at least theyve done nothing to bother us but they are here aboard the ship they do nothing without purpose reith made another skeptical sound perhaps sobut what can we do about it we can kill them zap for all the strictures of her upbringing was still a creature of tschai thought reith he said well keep close watch on them now that we know who they are and they dont know that we know the advantage is ours it was zap s turn to make a skeptical sound reith nevertheless refused to waylay the old women in the dark and strangle them the voyage proceeded southwest toward the saschan islands days passed without event more noteworthy than the turn of the heavens each morning carina broke through the horizon into a dull bronze and old rose dawn by noon a high haze had formed to filter the sunlight and lay a sheen like antique silk on the water the afternoons were long sunsets were sad glories allegorical wars between dark heroes and the lords of light after nightfall the moons appeared sometimes pink az sometimes blue braz and sometimes the nhiahar rode under the stars for reith the days and nights would have been as pleasant as any he had known on tschai except for the worry which nagged him what was happening at sivishe would he find the spaceboat intact or destroyed what of crafty aila woudiver what of the dirdir in their horrid city across the water and what of the two old women who might be gzhindra they never appeared except in the deep of night to walk the foredeck one dark evening reith watched them the hair prickling at the nape of his neck either they were gzhindra or they were not but lacking information reith felt obliged to assume the worstand the implications were cause for the most dismal foreboding one pale umber morning the saschan islands loomed out of the sea three ancient volcanic necks surrounded by shelves of detritus where grew groves of psilla kianthus candlenut lethipod on each island a town climbed the central crag beehive huts stacked one on the other like the cells of a waspnest black openings stared out to sea wisps of smoke rose into the air the nhiahar entered the inner bay and swerving to avoid a ferry approached the south island on the dock waited bowlegged saschanese longshoremen in black breechclouts and black rolltoed ankleboots they took the hawsers the nhiahar was warped alongside as soon as the gangplank settled into place the longshoremen swarmed aboard hatches were opened bales of leather sacks of pilgrimpod meal crated tools were taken to the dock reith and zap went ashore the captain called dourly after them i make departure at noon exactly aboard or not the two walked along the esplanade the crag and its unnatural encrustation of huts rearing above them zap glanced over her shoulder they are following us the gzhindra yes reith grunted in disgust its definite then they have orders not to let us out of their sight and we are as good as dead zap spoke in a colorless voice at kazain they will report to the pnume and then nothing can help us well be taken down into the dark reith could think of nothing to say they came to a small harbor protected from the sea by a pair of jetties which narrowed to become a ferry slip reith and zap paused to watch the ferry arrive from the outer islands a wide scow with control cabins at either end carrying two hundred saschanese of all ages and qualities it nosed into the slip the passengers debarked as many more paid toll to a fat man sitting before a booth and surged aboard immediately the ferry departed reith watched it cross the water then led zap to a waiting area set with benches and tables beside the ferry slip reith ordered sweet wine and biscuits from a serving boy then went to confer with the fat farecollector zap looked nervously here and there in the shadow of a flight of steps she thought to glimpse two shapes robed in gray they wonder what were doing zap told herself reith returned the next ferry leaves in something over an houra few minutes before noon ive already paid our fares zap gave him a puzzled inspection but we must be aboard the nhiahar at noon true are the gzhindra nearby theyve just taken seats at the far table reith managed a grim chuckle were giving them something to think about what should they think about that we might take the ferry something of the sort but why should they think that it seems so strange not altogether there might be a ship at one of the other islands to take us somewhere beyond their knowledge is there such a ship none that i know of but if we take the ferry the gzhindra will follow and the nhiahar will leave without all of us i expect so the captain would have no qualms whatever the minutes passed zap began to fidget noon is very close she studied reith wondering what went on in his mind no other man of tschaiat least none she had yet seenresembled him he was of a different sort here comes the ferry said reith lets go down to the slip we want to be the first in line zap rose to her feet never would she understand reith she followed him down to the waiting sea others came to join them to push and squirm and mutter reith asked what of the gzhindra zap glanced over her shoulder theyre standing at the back of the crowd the ferry entered the slip the barriers opened and the passengers surged ashore reith spoke in zap s ear walk close by the collectors hut as we pass duck inside oh the gate opened reith and zap halfwalked halfran down the way at the collectors hut reith lowered his head and slipped within zap followed the embarking passengers pushing past handed their fares to the collector and marched down to the ferry near the end of the line came the gzhindra trying to peer through the surge ahead of them they moved with the crowd down the ramp aboard the ferry the barrier closed the ferry moved out reith and zap emerged from the hut its almost noon said reith time to return aboard the nhiahar chapter ten southeast toward kislovan gusty winds drove the nhiahar the sea was almost black the swells which rolled up and under the ship spilled rushes of white foam ahead one blustery morning zap joined reith where he stood at the bow for a moment they stood looking ahead across the heaving water to where carina dropped prisms and fractured shards of golden light zap asked what lies ahead reith shook his head i dont know i wish i did but you worry are you afraid im afraid of a man named aila woudiver i dont know whether hes alive or dead who is aila woudiver that you fear him so a man of sivishe a man to fear i think he must be dead i was kidnapped out of a dream in the dream i saw aila woudivers head split open so why do you worry sooner or later thought reith he must make all clear perhaps now was the time remember the night i told you of other worlds among the stars i remember one of these worlds is earth at sivishe i built a spaceship with aila woudivers help i want to go to earth zap stared ahead across the water why do you want to go to earth i was born there it is my home oh she spoke in a colorless voice after a reflective silence of fifteen seconds she turned him a sidelong glance reith said ruefully you wonder if i am insane ive wondered many times many many times though reith himself had put the suggestion he was nonetheless taken aback indeed she smiled her sad grimace of a smile consider what you have done in the shelters at the khor grove when you changed eels at urmank acts of desperation acts of a frantic earthman zap brooded across the windy ocean if you are an earthman what do you do here on tschai on the kotan steppes my spaceship was wrecked at sivishe ive built another hmmf is earth such a paradise the people of earth know nothing of tschai its important that they do know why a dozen reasons most important the dirdir raided earth once they might decide to return she gave him her swift sideglance you have friends on earth of course you lived there in a house in a manner of speaking with a woman and your children no woman no children ive been a spaceman all my life and when you returnwhat then im not thinking past sivishe right now you will take me with you reith put his arm around her yes i will take you with me she heaved a sigh of relief presently she pointed ahead beyond where the sun glintsan island the island a great crag of barren black basalt was the first of a myriad to scarify the surface of the sea the area was home to a host of seaforagers of a sort beyond reiths previous experience four oscillating wings supported a cluster of dangling pink tentacles and a central tube ending in a bulbous eye the creatures drifted high and low dipping suddenly to seize some small wriggling seathing a few drifted toward the nhiahar the crewmen lurched back in dread and took shelter in the forecastle the captain who had come up on the foredeck sneered in disgust they consider these the guts and eyes of drowned seamen we sail the channel of death these rocks are the channel teeth how do you navigate by night i dont know said the captain for i have never tried it is risky enough by day around each of those rocks lies a hundred hulks and heaped white bones do you notice far ahead the loom there is kislovan tomorrow will find us docked at kazain as evening approached long strands of clouds raced across the sky and the wind began to moan the captain took the nhiahar into the lee of one of the larger black rocks nosing close close close until the sprit almost scraped the wet black stone here the anchor was dropped and the nhiahar rode in relative safety as the wind became a screaming gale great swells drove through the black crags foam crashed high up and fell slowly back the sea boiled and surged the nhiahar wallowed jerking at the anchor line then floating suddenly loose and free with the coming of darkness the wind died for a long period the sea rose and fell in fretful recollection but dawn found the charnel teeth standing like archaic monuments on a sea of brown glass beyond lay the bulk of the continent proceeding through the charnel teeth under power the nhiahar at noon nosed into a long narrow bay and by late afternoon drew alongside the pier at kazain on the dock two dirdirmen paused to watch the nhiahar their caste was high perhaps immaculate they were young and vain they wore their false effulgences aslant and glittering reiths heart rose in his throat for fear that they had been sent to take him into custody for such a contingency he had no plans he sweated until the two sauntered off toward the dirdir settlement at the head of the bay there were no formalities at the dock reith and zap carried their belongings ashore and without interference made their way to the motorwagon depot an eightwheeled vehicle stood on the verge of departure across the neck of kislovan reith commissioned the most luxurious accommodation available a cubicle of two hammocks on the third tier with access to the rear deck an hour later the motorwagon trundled forth from kazain for a space the road climbed into the coastal uplands affording a view over the channel of death and the charnel teeth five miles north the road swung inland for the rest of the day the motorwagon lumbered beside beanvine fields forests of white ghostapple an occasional little village in the early evening the motorwagon halted at an isolated inn where the fortythree passengers took supper about half seemed to be grays the rest were people reith could not identify a pair might have been steppemen of kotan several conceivably were saschanese two yellowskinned women in gowns of black scales almost certainly were marshfolk from the north shore of the second sea the various groups took the least possible notice of each other eating and returning at once to board the powerwagon the indifference reith knew to be feigned each had gauged the exact quality of all the others with a precision beyond any reith could muster early in the morning the powerwagon once more set forth and met the dawn climbing over the edge of the central plateau carina rose to illuminate a vast savanna clumped with alumes gallowtrees bundlefungus patches of thorngrass so passed the day and four more a journey which reith hardly noticed for his mounting tension in the shelters on the great subterranean canal along the shores of the second sea at urmank even aboard the nhiahar he had been calm with the patience of despair the stakes were once again high he hoped he dreaded he strained for the powerwagon to go faster he shrank from the thought of what he might find in the warehouse on the sivishe salt flats zap reacting to reiths tension or perhaps beset with premonitions of her own retired into herself and took small interest in the passing landscape over the central plateau down through a badlands of eroded granite out upon a landscape farmed by clans of sullen grays went the powerwagon signs of the dirdir presence appeared a grey butte bristling with purple and scarlet towers overlooking a rift valley walled by sheer cliffs which served the dirdir as a hunting range on the sixth day a range of mountains rose ahead the back of the palisades overlooking hei and sivishe the journey was almost at an end all night the motorwagon lumbered along a dusty road by the light of the pink and blue moons the moons set the eastern sky took on the color of dried blood dawn came as a skyburst of dark scarlet orangebrown sepia ahead appeared the ajzan gulf and the clutter of sivishe two hours later the motorwagon lumbered into sivishe depot beside the bridge chapter eleven reith and zap crossed the bridge amid the usual crowd of grays trudging to and from their work in the hei factories sivishe was achingly familiar the background for so much passion and grief that reith found his heart pounding if by fantastic luck he returned to earth could he ever forget those events which had befallen him at sivishe come he muttered over here aboard the transit dray the dray creaked and groaned the dingy districts of sivishe fell behind they reached the southernmost stop where the wagon turned east toward the ajzan shore ahead lay the salt flats with a road winding out of aila woudivers construction depot all seemed as before mounds of gravel sand slag stacks of brick and rubble to the side stood woudivers eccentric little office beyond the warehouse there was no activity no moving figures no drays the great doors to the warehouse were closed the walls leaned more noticeably than ever reith accelerated his pace he strode down the road with zap walking then running then walking reith reached the yard he looked all around desolation not a sound not a step silence the warehouse seemed on the verge of collapse as if it had been damaged by an explosion reith went to the side entrance looked within the premises were vacant the spaceship was gone the roof had been torn away and hung in shreds the workshop and supply racks were a shambles reith turned away he stood looking over the salt flats what now he had no ideas his mind was empty he backed slowly away from the warehouse over the main entrance someone had scrawled onmale this was the name of the chiefemblem worn by traz when reith had first encountered him on the kotan steppes the word prodded at reiths numbed consciousness where were traz and anacho he went to the office and looked within here while he lay sleeping gas had stupefied him gzhindra had tucked him into a sack and carried him away someone else now lay on the couchan old man asleep reith knocked on the wall the old man awoke opening first one rheumy eye then the other pulling his gray cloak about his shoulders he heaved himself erect who is there he cried out reith discarded the caution he normally would have used where are the men who worked here the door slid ajar the old man came forth to look reith up and down some went here some went there one went yonder he jerked a crooked thumb toward the glass box who was that again the cautious scrutiny who would you be that doesnt know the news of sivishe im a traveler said reith trying to hold his voice calm whats happened here you look like a man named adam reith said the caretaker at least thats how the description went but adam reith could give me the name of a lokhar and the name of a thang that only he would know zarfo detwiler is a lokhar i once knew issam the thang the caretaker looked furtively around the landscape his gaze rested suspiciously on zap and who is this a friend she knows me for adam reith she can be trusted i have instructions to trust no one only adam reith i am adam reith tell me what you have to tell me come here i will ask a final question he drew reith aside and wheezed in his ear at coad adam reith met a yao nobleman his name was dordoho now what is your message i have no message reiths impatience almost burst through his restraint then why do you ask such questions because adam reith has a friend who wants to see him i am to take adam reith to his friend at my own discretion who is this friend the old man waved his finger tut i answer no questions i obey instructions no more and thus i earn my fee well then what are your instructions i am to conduct adam reith to a certain place then i am done very well lets go whenever you are ready now come then the old man started down the road with reith and zap following the old man halted not her just you she must come as well then we cannot go and i know nothing reith argued stormed and coaxed to no avail how far is this place he demanded at last not far a mile two miles not far we can be back shortly why cavil the woman will not run away if she does find another so was my style when i was a buck reith searched the landscape the road the scattering of huts at the edge of the salt flats the salt flats themselves no living creature could be seen a negative reassurance at best reith looked at zap she looked back with an uncertain smile a detached part of reiths brain noted that here for the first time zap had smileda tremulous uncomprehending smile but nonetheless a true smile reith said in a somber voice get in the cabin bolt the door dont open it for anyone ill be back as soon as i can zap went into the cabin the door closed the bolt shot home reith said to the old man hurry then take me to my friend this way the old man hobbled silently along the road and presently turned aside along a path which led across the salt flats toward the straggle of huts at the edge of sivishe reith began to feel nervous and insecure he called out where are we going the old man made a vague gesture ahead reith demanded who is the man we are to see a friend of adam reiths is it aila woudiver i am allowed to name no names i can tell you nothing hurry the old man hobbled on toward a hut somewhat apart from the others an ancient structure of moldering gray bricks the old man went up to the door pounded then stood back from within came a stir behind the single window was the flicker of movement the door opened ankhe at afram anacho looked forth reith exhaled a great gusty breath the old man shrilled is this the man anacho said yes this is adam reith give me my money then i am anxious to have done with this line of work anacho went within and returned with a pouch rattling with sequins here is your money in a month come back there will be another waiting for you if you have held your tongue meanwhile the old man took the pouch and departed reith asked where is traz where is the ship anacho shook his long pale head i dont know what this is what happened you were taken by the gzhindra aila woudiver was wounded but he did not die three days after the event the dirdirmen came for aila woudiver and dragged him off to the glass box he complained he implored he screamed but they took him away i heard later that he provided a spectacular hunt running in a frenzy like a bull marmont braying at the top of his lungs the dirdirmen saw the ship when they came to take aila woudiver we feared that they would return the ship was ready to fly so we decided to move the ship from sivishe i said that i would stay to wait for you in the middle of the night traz and the technicians took the ship up and flew it to a place that traz said you would know where reith demanded i dont know if i was taken i wanted no knowledge so that i could not be forced into betrayal traz wrote onmale on the shed he said that you would know where to come lets go back to the warehouse i left a friend there anacho asked do you know what he means by onmale i think so i cant be sure they returned along the trail reith asked is the skycar still available for our use i carry the calltoken i see no reason why there should be difficulty the situation isnt as bad as it might be then ive had an interesting set of experiences he told anacho something of his adventures i escaped the shelters but along the shore of the second sea gzhindra began to follow perhaps they were hired by the khors perhaps the pnume sent them after us we saw gzhindra in urmank probably these same gzhindra boarded the nhiahar they are still on the saschanese islands for all i know since then we apparently havent been followed and id like to leave sivishe before they pick us up again im ready to leave now said anacho at any instant we may lose our luck they turned down the road leading to woudivers old warehouse reith stopped short it was as he had feared in the deepest darkest layer of his subconscious the door to the office stood ajar reith broke into a run with anacho coming after zap was nowhere in the office nor in the ruined warehouse she was nowhere to be seen directly before the office the ground was damp the prints of narrow bare feet were plain gzhindra said anacho or pnumekin no one else reith gazed across the salt flats calm in the amber light of afternoon impossible to search impossible to run across salt marsh and flat looking and calling what could he do unthinkable to do nothing what of traz the spaceship the return to earth which now was feasible the idea sank from his mind like a waterlogged timber with only the umbral shape the afterimage remaining reith sat down upon an old crate anacho watched a moment his long white face drawn and melancholy like that of a sick clown finally in a somewhat hollow voice he said best that we be on our way reith rubbed his forehead i cant go just yet ive got to think what is there to think about if the gzhindra have taken her she is gone i realize that in such a case you can do nothing reith looked toward the palisades she will be taken back underground they will swing her out over a dark gulf and after a time drop her anacho hunched his shoulders in a shrug you cannot alter this regrettable fact so put it out of your mind traz awaits us with the spaceship but i can do something said reith i can go after her into the underground places insanity you will never return i returned before by a freak of fate reith rose to his feet anacho went on desperately you will never return what of traz he will wait for you forever i cant tell him you have sacrificed everything because i do not know where he is i dont intend to sacrifice everything said reith i intend to return indeed declared anacho with a sneer of vast scorn this time the pnume will make sure you will swing out over the gulf beside the girl no said reith they will not swing me they want me for foreverness anacho threw up his arms in bafflement i will never understand you the most obstinate of men go underground ignore your faithful friends do your worst when do you go below now tomorrow said reith tomorrow why delay why deprive the pnume of your society a single instant because this afternoon i have preparations to make come along lets go into town chapter twelve at dawn reith went to stand at the edge of the salt flats here months before he and his friends had detected aila woudivers signals to the gzhindra reith also held a mirror as carina lifted into the sky he swept the reflection back and forth across the salt flats an hour passed reith methodically flashed the mirror apparently to no avail then from nowhere or so it seemed came a pair of dark figures they stood half a mile away looking toward reith he flashed the mirror step by step they approached as if fascinated reith went to meet them gradually the three came together and at last stood fifty feet apart a minute passed the three appraised each other the faces of the gzhindra were shaded under lowcrowned black hats both were pale and somewhat vulpine with long thin noses and bright black eyes presently they came closer in a quiet voice one spoke you are adam reith i am adam reith why did you signal us yesterday you came to take my companion the gzhindra made no remark this is true is it not reith demanded it is true why did you do this we hold such a commission what did you do with her we delivered her to such a place as we were bid where is this place yonder you have a commission to take me yes very well said reith you go first i will follow the gzhindra consulted in whispers one said this is not feasible we do not care to walk with others coming at our backs for once you can tolerate the sensation said reith after all you will thereby be fulfilling your commission true if all goes well but what if you elect to burn us with a weapon i would have done so before said reith at the moment i only want to find my companion and bring her back to the surface the gzhindra surveyed him with impersonal curiosity why will you not walk first i dont know where to go we will direct you reith spoke so harshly that his voice cracked go first this is easier than carrying me in a sack the gzhindra whispered to each other moving the corners of their thin mouths without taking their eyes off reith then they turned and walked slowly off across the salt flats reith came after remaining about fifty feet to the rear they followed the faintest of trails which at times disappeared utterly a mile two miles they walked the warehouse and the office diminished to small rectangular marks sivishe was a blurred gray crumble at the northern horizon the gzhindra halted and turned to reith who thought to detect a fugitive flicker of glee come closer said one of the gzhindra you must stand here with us reith gingerly came forward he brought out the energy gun which he had only just purchased and displayed it this is precautionary i do not wish to be killed or drugged i want to go alive down into the shelters no fear there no fear there have no doubts on that score said the gzhindra speaking together put away your gun it is without significance reith held the gun in his hand as he approached the gzhindra closer closer they urged stand within the outline of the black soil reith stepped on the patch of soil designated which at once settled into the ground the gzhindra stood quietly so close now that reith could see the minute creases in the skin of their faces if they felt alarm for his weapon they showed none the camouflaged elevator descended fifteen feet the gzhindra stepped off into a concretewalled passage looking over their shoulders they beckoned hurry they set off at a swinging trot cloaks flapping from side to side reith came behind the passage slanted downward running was without sensible effort the passage became level then suddenly ended at a brink beyond stretched a waterway the gzhindra motioned reith down into a boat and themselves took seats the boat slid along the surface guided automatically along the center of the channel for half an hour they traveled reith looking dourly ahead the gzhindra sitting stiff and silent as carved black images the channel entered a larger waterway the boat drifted up to a dock reith stepped ashore the gzhindra came behind and reith ignored the neartransparent glee with as much dignity as he could muster they signaled him to wait presently from the shadows a pnumekin appeared the gzhindra muttered a few words into the air which the pnumekin seemed to ignore then they stepped back into their boat and slid away with pale backward glances reith stood alone on the dock with the pnumekin who now said come adam reith we have been awaiting you reith said the young woman who was brought down yesterday where is she come where the zuzhma kastchai wait for you a sensation like a draft of cold air prickled the skin of reiths back into his mind crept furtive little misgivings which he tried to put aside he had taken all precautions available to him their effectiveness was yet to be tested the pnumekin beckoned come reith followed resentful and shamed they went down a zigzag corridor walled with panes of polished black flint accompanied by reflections and moving shadows reith began to feel dazed the corridor widened into a hall of black mirrors reith now moved in a state of bewilderment he followed the pnumekin to a central column where they slid back a portal you must go onward alone to foreverness reith looked through the portal into a small cell lined with a substance like silver fleece what is this you must enter where is the young woman who was brought here yesterday enter through the portal reith spoke in anger and apprehension i want to talk to the pnume it is important that i do so step into the cell when the portal opens follow follow the trace to foreverness in a state of sick fury reith glared at the pnumekin the pale face looked back with fishlike detachment demands threats rose up in reiths throat only to dwindle and die delay any loss of time might result in terrible consequences the thought of which caused his stomach to jerk and quiver he stalked into the cell the portal closed down slid the cell dropping at a rapid but controlled rate a minute passed the cell halted a portal flew open reith stepped forth into black glossy darkness from his feet a trail of luminous yellow dots wound off into the gloom reith looked in all directions he listened nothing no sound no pressure of any living presence burdened with a sense of destiny he set off along the trace the line of luminous spots swung this way and that reith followed them with exactitude fearing what might lie to either side on one occasion he thought to hear a far hushed roar as of air rising from some great depth the dark lightened almost imperceptibly to a glow from some unseen source without warning he came to a brink he stood at the edge of a darkling landscape a place of objects faintly outlined in gold and silver luminosity at his feet a flight of stone steps led down reith descended step after step he reached the bottom and halted in an uncontrollable pang of terror in front of him stood a pnume reith pulled together the elements of his will he said in as firm a voice as he could muster i am adam reith i have come here for the young woman my companion whom you took away yesterday bring her here immediately from the shape came the husky pnume whisper you are adam reith yes where is the woman you came here from earth what of the woman tell me why did you come to old tschai a roar of desperation rose in reiths throat answer my question the dark shape slid quietly away reith stood a moment undecided whether to stand or follow the gold and silver luminosities seemed to become brighter or perhaps reith had begun to cast order upon the seemingly unrelated shapes he began to see outlines and tracts pagodalike frameworks a range of columns beyond appeared silhouettes with gold and silver fringes as yet unstructured by his mind the pnume stalked slowly away reiths frustration reached an intensity where he felt almost faint then he experienced a rage which sent him bounding after the pnume he seized the harsh shoulderelement and jerked to his utter astonishment the pnume dropped as if falling over backward the arms swinging down to serve as forelegs it stood ventral surface upmost head swiveling strangely down and over so that the pnume took on the aspect of a nighthound while reith gaped in awe and embarrassment the pnume flipped itself upright to regard reith with chilling disfavour reith found his voice i must talk to responsible folk among you and quickly what i have to say is urgentto you and to me this is foreverness came the husky voice such words have no meaning you will think differently when you hear me come to your place in foreverness you are awaited once more the creature set off tears brimmed in reiths eyes vast outrage rose up behind his teeth if anything had happened to zap they would pay how they would pay regardless of consequence for a space they walked and presently passed through a columned portal into a new underground realm a place which reith associated with some elegant memorial garden of old earth away and along the gold and silverfringed prospect stood brooding shapes reith had no opportunity for speculation certain shapes moved forward he saw them to be pnume and advanced to meet them there were at least twenty by their extreme diffidence and unobtrusiveness reith understood them to be of the highest status facing the twenty shadows in this shadowhaunted corner of foreverness he could not help but wonder as to the state of his mind was he wholly sane in such surroundings orderly mental processes were inapplicable by sheer brutal energy he must impose his personal willtoorder upon the devious environment of the pnume he looked around the shadowed group i am adam reith he said i am an earthman what do you want of me your presence in foreverness im here said reith but i intend to go i came of my own volition are you aware of this you would have come in any event wrong i would not have come you kidnapped my friend a young woman i came to fetch her away and take her back to the surface the pnume as if by signal all took a simultaneous slow step forward a sinister movement the stuff of nightmare how did you expect to effect so much this is foreverness reith thought for a moment you pnume have lived long on tschai long long we are the soul of tschai we are the world itself other races live on tschai they are people more powerful than yourselves they come and go colored shadows to entertain us we expel them as we choose you do not fear the dirdir they cannot reach us they know none of our precious secrets what if they did the dark shapes approached another slow pace reith called out in a harsh voice what if the dirdir know all your secrets all your tunnels and passages and popouts a grotesque situation which can never be real but it can be real i can make it real reith brought forth a folder bound in blue leather examine this the pnume gingerly accepted the portfolio it is the lost masterset wrong again said reith it is a copy the pnume set up a low whimpering sound and reith once again thought of the nighthounds he had often heard just such soft calls out on the kotan steppes the sad halfwhispered wails subsided the pnume stood in a rigid semicircle reith could feel their emotion it was almost palpable a crazy irresponsible ferocity he heretofore had associated only with the phung be calm said reith the danger is not imminent the charts are hostage to my safety you are secure unless i do not return to the surface in this case the charts will be given over to the blue chasch and the dirdir intolerable the charts must be secured there is no alternative that is what i hoped you would say reith looked around the halfcircle you agree to my conditions we have not heard them i want the woman whom you brought down yesterday if she is dead i plan to exact a terrible penalty from you you will long remember me you will long curse the name adam reith the pnume stood in silence where is she demanded reith in a rasping voice she is in foreverness to be crystallized is she alive or is she dead she is not yet dead where is she across the field of monuments awaiting preparation you say that she is not yet deadbut is she alive and well she lives then you are fortunate the pnume surveyed him with incomprehension and certain of the group gave nearhuman shrugs reith said bring her here or let us go to her whichever is faster come they set out across the field of monuments statues or simulacra representing folk of a hundred various races reith could not avoid pausing to stare in fascination who or what are all these creatures episodes in the life of tschai which is to say our own lives there the shivvan who came to tschai seven million years ago this is an early crystal one of the oldest the memento of a far time beyond the gjee who founded eight empires and were expunged by the fesa who in turn fled the light of the red star hsi yonder others who have dropped by along their way to oblivion along the avenues the group moved the monuments were black fringed with luminous gold and silver creatures quadruped triped biped with heads cerebral bags nervenets with eyes optical bands flexible sensors prisms here towered a massive bulk with a heavy cranium it brandished a sevenfoot sword the creature reith saw to be a green chasch bull nearby a blue chasch chastened a group of crouching old chasch while three chaschmen glowered from the side beyond were dirdir and dirdirmen attended by two men and two women of a race reith failed to recognize to the side a single wankh alone and austere surveyed a gang of toiling men beyond these groups except for a single empty pedestal the avenue led away down a black slope to a slow black river the surface marked by drifting silver swirls beside the river stood a cage of silver bars huddled in the cage was zap she watched the group approach with an impassive face she saw reith her face crumpled into opposed emotions grief and joy relief and dismay she had been stripped of her surface clothes she wore only a white shift reith took pains to control his voice still he spoke thickly what have you done to her she has been treated with liquid one it invigorates and tones and opens the passages for liquid two bring her forth zap emerged from the cage reith took her hand stroked her head you are safe were going back to the surface he stood for a few minutes quietly waiting while she wept in relief and nervous exhaustion on his shoulder the pnume came close one said the return of all charts is demanded reith managed a thick laugh not yet i have other demands to make of youbut elsewhere let us leave this place foreverness oppresses me in a hall of polished gray marble reith faced the pnume elders i am a man i am disturbed to see men of my own kind living the unnatural lives of pnumekin you must breed no more human children and the children now underground must be transferred to the surface and there maintained until they are able to fend for themselves but this means the end of the pnumekin so it does and why not your race is seven million years old or more only in the last twenty or thirty thousand years have you had pnumekin to serve you their loss will be no great hardship if we agreewhat of the charts i will destroy all but a very few copies none will be delivered to your enemies this is unsatisfactory we would then live in constant dread i cant worry as to this i must retain control over you to guarantee that my demands have been met in due course i may return all the charts to yousometime in the future the pnume muttered disconsolately together a few moments one said in a flat whisper your demands will be met in this case conduct us back to the sivishe salt flats at sunset the salt flats were quiet carina hung in a smoky haze behind the palisades glinting upon the dirdir towers reith and zap approached the old warehouse from the office came anachos spare form he stepped forward to meet them the skycar is here there is nothing to keep us lets hurry then i cant believe that were free the skycar lifted from behind the warehouse and swept north anacho asked where do we go to the kotan steppes south of where you and i first met all night they flew over the barren center of kislovan then over the first sea and the kotan marshlands at dawn they drifted over the edge of the steppes while reith studied the landscape below they crossed a forest reith pointed to a clearing there where i came down to tschai the emblem camp lay to the east there by that grove of featherbush there we buried onmale drop down there the skycar landed reith alighted and walked slowly toward the woods he saw the glint of metal traz came forth he stood quietly as reith approached i knew that you would come traz had changed he had become a man something more than a man on his shoulder he wore a medallion of metal stone and wood reith said you dug up the emblem yes it called to me wherever i walked upon the steppe i heard voices all the voices of all the omnale chieftains calling to be taken up from the dark i brought forth the emblem the voices are now silent and the ship it is ready four of the technicians are here one stayed at sivishe two lost heart and set off across the steppes for hedaijha the sooner we depart the better when were actually out in space ill believe that weve escaped we are ready anacho traz and zap entered the spaceship reith took a last look around the sky he bent touched the soil of tschai crumbled a handful of mold between his fingers then he too entered the unlovely hulk the port was closed and sealed the generators hummed the ship lifted toward the sky the face of tschai receded the planet exhibited rotundity became a graybrown ball and presently was gone
