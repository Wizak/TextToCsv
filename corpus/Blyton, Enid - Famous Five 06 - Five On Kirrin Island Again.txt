chapter one a letter for george anne was trying to do some of her prep in a corner of the commonroom when her cousin george came bursting in george was not a boy she was a girl called georgina but because she had always wanted to be a boy she insisted on being called george so george she was she wore her curly hair cut short and her bright blue eyes gleamed angrily now as she came towards anne anne ive just had a letter from home and what do you think father wants to go and live on my island to do some special work and he wants to build a sort of tower or something in the castle yard the other girls looked up in amusement and anne held out her hand for the letter that george was waving at her everyone knew about the little island off kirrin bay that belonged to george kirrin island was a tiny place with an old ruined castle in the middle of it the home of rabbits and gulls and jackdaws it had underground dungeons in which george and her cousins had had one or two amazing adventures it had once belonged to georges mother and she had given it to george and george was very fierce where her precious kirrin island was concerned it was hers nobody else must live there or even land there without her permission and now dear me here was her father proposing to go to her island and even build some sort of workshop there george was red with exasperation its just like grownups they go and give you things and then act as though the things were theirs all the time i dont want father living on my island and building nasty messy sheds and things there oh george you know your father is a very famous scientist who needs to work in peace said anne taking the letter surely you can lend him your island for a bit there are plenty of other places where he can work in peace said george oh dear i was so hoping we could go and stay there in the easter hols take our boat there and food and everything just like weve done before now we shant be able to if father really does go there anne read the letter it was from georges mother my darling george i think i must tell you at once that your lather pro poses to live on kirrin island for some little time in order to finish some very important experiments he is making he will have to have some kind of building erected there a sort of tower i believe apparently he needs a place where he can have absolute peace and isolation and also for some reason where there is water all round him the fact of being surrounded by water is necessary to his experiment now dear dont be upset about this i know that you consider kirrin island is your very own but you must allow your family to share it especially when it is for something as important as your fathers scientific work father thinks you will be very pleased indeed to lend him kirrin island but i know your funny feelings about it so i thought had better write and tell you before you arrive home and see him installed there complete with his tower the letter then went on about other things but anne did not bother to read these she looked at george oh george i dont see why you mind your father borrowing kirrin island for a bit i wouldnt mind my father borrowing an island from me if i was lucky enough to have one your father would talk to you about it first and ask your permission and see if you minded said george sulkily my father never does anything like that he just does exactly as he likes without asking anybody anything i really do think he might have written to me himself he just puts my back up youve got a back that is very easily put up george said anne laughing dont scowl at me like that im not borrowing your island without your gracious permission but george wouldnt smile back she took her letter and read it again gloomily to think that all my lovely holiday plans are spoilt she said you know how super kirrin island is at eastertime all primroses and gorse and baby rabbits and you and julian and dick were coming to stay and we havent stayed together since last summer when we went caravanning i know it is hard luck said anne it would have been wizard to go and stay on the island these holls but perhaps your father wouldnt mind if we did we neednt disturb him as if living on kirrin island with father there would be the same as living there all by ourselves said george scornfully you know it would be horrid well yes anne didnt think on the whole that kirrin island would be much fun with uncle quentin there georges father was such a hottempered impatient man and when he was in the middle of one of his experiments he was quite unbearable the least noise upset him oh dear how he will yell at the jackdaws to keep quiet and shout at the noisy gulls said anne beginning to giggle he wont find kirrin quite so peaceful as he imagines george gave a watery sort of smile she folded up the letter and turned away well i think its just the limit she said i wouldnt have felt so bad if only father had asked my permission hed never do that said anne it just wouldnt occur to him now george dont spend the rest of the day brooding over your wrongs for goodness sake go down to the kennels and fetch timmy hell soon cheer you up timothy was georges dog whom she loved with all her heart he was a big brown mongrel dog with a ridiculously long tail and a wide mouth that really seemed to smile all the four cousins loved him he was so friendly and loving so lively and amusing and he had shared so very many adventures with them all the five of them had had many happy times together george went to get timmy her school allowed the children to keep their own pets if it hadnt allowed this it is quite certain that george would not have gone to boardingschool she could not bear to be parted from timmy for even a day timmy began to bark excitedly as soon as she came near george lost her sulky look and smiled dear timmy dear trustable timmy he was better than any person he was always on her side always her friend whatever she did and to timmy there was no one in the world so wonderful as george they were soon going through the fields together and her father borrowing kirrin island timmy with every word she said he listened as if he george talked to timmy as she always did she told him understood everything and not even when a rabbit shot his path did he leave his mistresss side timmy knew when george was upset he gave her hand a few little licks every now and by the time that george was back at school again she felt much better she took timmy into school with smuggling him in at a side door dogs were not allowed in the school building but george like her father often did exactly as she liked she hurried timmy up to her dormitory he scuttled under her bed quickly and lay down his tail thumped the floor gently he knew what this meant george wanted the comfort of his nearness that night he would be able to jump on her bed when lights were out and snuggle into the crook of her knees his brown eyes gleamed with delight now lie quiet said george and went out of the room to join the other girls she found anne who was busy writing a letter to her brothers julian and dick at their boardingschool ive told them about kirrin island and your father wanting to borrow it she said would you like to come and stay with us george these holls instead of us coming to kirrin then you wont feel cross all the time because your father is on your island no thanks said george at once im going home i want to keep an eye on father i dont want him blowing up kirrin island with one of his experiments you know hes messing about with explosives now dont you ooooh atom bombs or things like that said anne i dont know said george anyway quite apart from keeping an eye on father and my island we ought to go and stay at kirrin to keep mother company shell be all alone if fathers on the island i suppose hell take food and everything there well theres one thing we shant have to creep about on tiptoe and whisper if your father isnt at kirrin cottage said anne we can be as noisy as we like do cheer up george but it took george quite a long time to get over the fit of gloom caused by her mothers letter even having timmy on her bed each night till he was discovered by an angry teacher did not quite make up for her disappointment the term ran swiftly on to its end april came in with sunshine and showers holidays came nearer and nearer anne thought joyfully of kirrin with its lovely sandy beach its blue sea its fishingboats and its lovely cliffside walks julian and dick thought longingly of them too this term both they and the girls broke up on the same day they could meet in london and travel down to kirrin together hurrah the day came at last trunks were piled in the hail cars arrived to fetch some of the children who lived fairly near the school coaches drew up to take the others down to the station there was a terrific noise of yelling and shouting everywhere the teachers could not make themselves heard in the din anyone would think that every single child had gone completely mad said one of them to another oh thank goodness theyre getting into the coaches george must you rush along the corridor at sixty miles an hour with timmy barking his head off all the time yes i must i must cried george anne where are you do come and get into the coach ive got timmy he knows its holidays now come on tim down to the station went the singing crowd of children they piled into the train bags i this seat whos taken my bag get out hetty you know you cant bring your dog in here with mine they fight hike anything hurrah the guards blowing his whistle were off the engine pulled slowly out of the station its long train of carriages behind it filled to bursting with girls off for their holidays through the quiet countryside it went through small towns and villages and at last ran through the smoky outskirts of london the boys train is due in two minutes before ours said anne leaning out of the window as the train drew slowly into the london station if it was punctual they might be on our platform to meet us oh look george look there they are george hung out of the window too hie julian she yelled here we are hie dick julian chapter two back at kirrin cottage julian dick anne george and timmy went straightaway to have buns and gingerbeer at the station tearoom it was good to be all together again timmy went nearly mad with joy at seeing the two boys he kept trying to get on to their knees look here timmy old thing i love you very much and im jolly glad to see you said dick but thats twice youve upset my gingerbeer all over me has he behaved himself this term george fairly well said george considering hasnt he anne i mean he only got the joint out of the larder once and he didnt do so much harm to that cushion he chewed and if people will leave their galoshes all over the place nobody can blame timmy for having a good old game with them and that was the end of the galoshes i suppose said julian with a grin on the whole timmy you have a rather poor report im afraid our uncle quentin will not award you the usual halfcrown we get for good reports at the mention of her father george scowled i see george has not lost her pretty scowl said dick in a teasing voice dear old george we shouldnt know her unless she put on that fearsome scowl half a dozen times a day oh shes better than she was said anne hurrying to georges defense at once george was not so touchy as she had once been when she was being teased all the same anne knew that there might be sparks flying over her father taking kirrin island these holidays and she didnt want george to fly into a temper too soon julian looked at his cousin i say old thing youre not going to take this business of kirrin island too much to heart are you he said youve just got to realize that your fathers a remarkably clever man one of the finest scientists weve got and i think that those kind of fellows ought to be allowed as much freedom as they like for their work i mean if uncle quentin wants to work on kirrin island for some peculiar reason of his own then you ought to be pleased to say go ahead father george looked a little mutinous after this rather long speech but she thought a great deal of julian and usually went by what he said he was older than any of them a tall goodlooking boy with determined eyes and a strong chin george scratched timmys head and spoke in a low voice all right i wont go up in smoke about it julian but im frightfully disappointed id planned to go to kirrin islandourselves these holls well were all disappointed said julian buck up with your bun old thing weve got to get across london and catch the train for kirrin we shall miss it if we dont look out soon they were in the train for kirrin julian was very good at getting porters and taxis anne gazed admiringly at her big brother as he found them all cornerseat a carriage julian did know how to tackle things do you think ive grown julian she asked him i hope id be as tall as george by the end of this term too well i should think you might be a quarter of an inch more than last term said julian you cant catch us up youll always be the smallest but i like you small look at timmy putting his head out of the window usual said dick timmy youll get a smokegrit in your eye then george will go quite mad with grief and think youre going blind woof said timmy and wagged his tail that was the nice part about timmy he always knew when he was being spoken to even if his name was not mentioned he answered at once aunt fanny was at the station to meet them in the trap the children flung themselves on her for they were very fond of her she was kind and gentle and did best to keep her clever impatient husband from find too much fault with the children uncle quentin asked julian politely when were setting off in the trap hes very well said his aunt and terribly excited really ive never known him to be so thrilled as he has been lately his work has been coming along very successfully i suppose you dont know what his latest experiment said dick oh no he never tells me a word said aunt fanny he never tells anyone except his colleagues of course i do know its important and i know of course that the last step the experiment has to be made in air with water all around dont ask me look theres kirrin island they had rounded a corner and had come in guarding the entrance of it was the curious little island topped by the old ruined castle the sun shone down on the blue sea and the island looked most enchanting george looked earnestly at it she was looking for the building whatever it was that her father said he needed for his work everyone looked at the island seeking the same thing they saw it easily enough rising from castle probably from the castle yard was a tall thin tower rather like a lighthouse at the top was a glassenclosed room which glittered in the sun oh mother i dont like it it spoils kirrin island said george in dismay darling it can come down when your father has finished his work said her mother its a very flimsy temporary thing it can easily be pulled down father promised me he would scrap it s soon as his work was done he says you can go across and see it if you like its really rather interesting ooooh id love to go and see it said anne at once it looks so queer is uncle quentin all alone on kirrin island aunt fanny yes i dont like him to be alone said her aunt for one thing i am sure he doesnt get his meals properly and for another im always afraid some harm mightcome to him when hes experimenting and if hes alone how would i know if anything happened to him well aunt fanny you could always arrange for him to signal to you each morning and night couldnt you said julian sensibly he could use that tower easily he could flash a signal to you in the morning using a mirror you know heliographing that he was all right and at night he could signal with a lamp easy yes i did suggest that sort of thing said his aunt i said id go over with you all tomorrow to see him and perhaps julian dear you could arrange something of the sort with your uncle he seems to listen to you now gracious do you mean to say father wants us to invade his secret lair and actually to see his strange tower asked george surprised well i dont think i want to go after all its my island and its horrid to see someone else taking possession of it oh george dont begin all that again said anne with a sigh you and your island cant you even lend it to your own father aunt fanny you should have seen george when your letter came she looked so fierce that i was quite scared everyone laughed except george and aunt fanny she looked distressed george was always so difficult she found fault with her father and got up against him time after time but dear me how very very like him she was with her scowls her sudden temper and her fierceness if only george was as sweettempered and as easy going as these three cousins of hers george looked at her mothers troubled face and felt ashamed of herself she put her hand on her knee its all right mother i wont make a fuss ill try and keep my feelings to myself really i will i know fathers work is important ill go with you to the island tomorrow julian gave george a gentle clap on the back good old george shes actually learned not only to give in but to give in gracefully george youre more like a boy than ever when you act like that george glowed she liked julian to say she was like a boy she didnt want to be petty and catty and bear malice as so many girls did but anne looked a little indignant it isnt only boys that can learn to give in decently and things like that she said heaps of girls do well i jolly well hope i do myself my goodness heres another firebrand said aunt fanny smiling stop arguing now all of you heres kirrin cottage doesnt it look sweet with all the primroses in the garden and the wallflowers coming out and daffodils peeping everywhere it certainly did the four children and timmy tore in the front gate delighted to be back they clattered into the house and to their great delight found joanna the old cook there she had come back to help for the holidays she beamed at the children and fondled timmy when he leapt round her barking well there now havent you all grown again how big you are master julian taller than i am i declare and little miss anne why shes getting quite big that pleased anne of course julian went back to the front door to help his aunt with the small bags in the trap the trunks were coming later julian and dick took everything upstairs anne joined them eager to see her old bedroom again oh how good it was to be in kirrin cottage once mote she looked out of her windows one looked on to the moor at the back the other looked sideways on to the sea lovely lovely she began to sing a little song as she undid her bag you know she said to dick when he brought georges bag in you know dick im really quite pleased that uncle quentin has gone to kirrin island even if it means we wont be able to go there much i feel much freer in the house when hes away hes a very clever man and he can be awfully nice but i always feel a bit afraid of him dick laughed im not afraid of him but hes a bit of a wet blanket in a house i must say when were here for the holidays funny to think of him on kirrin island all alone a voice came up the stairs come down to tea children because there are hot scones for you just out of the oven coming aunt fanny called dick hurry anne im awfully hungry julian did you hear aunt fanny calling george came up the stairs to fetch anne she was pleased to be home and as for timmy he was engaged in going round every single corner of the house sniffing vigorously he always does that said george as if he thought that there might be a chair or a table that didnt smell the same as it always did come on tim teatime mother as father isnt here can timmy sit beside me on the floor hes awfully wellbehaved now very well said her mother and tea began what a tea it looked as if it was a spread for a party of twenty good old joanna she must have baked all day well there wouldnt be much left when the five had finished chapter three off to kirrin island next day was fine and warm we can go across to the island this morning said aunt fanny well take our own food because im sure uncle quentin will have forgotten were coming has he a boat there asked george mother hasnt taken my boat has he no dear said her mother hes got another boat i was afraid he would never be able to get it in and out of all those dangerous rocks round the island but he got one of the fishermen to take him and had his own boat towed behind with all its stuff in who built the tower asked julian oh he made out the plans himself and some men were sent down from the ministry of research to put the tower up for him said aunt fanny it was all rather hushhush really the people here were most curious about it but they dont know any more than i do no local man helped in the building but one or two fishermen were hired to take the material to the island and to land the men and soon its all very mysterious said julian uncle quentin leadsrather an exciting life really doesnt he i wouldnt mind being a scientist myself i want to be something really worthwhile when i grow up im not just going into somebodys office im going to be on my own i think i shall be a doctor said dick off to get my boat said george rather bored with this talk she knew what she was going to do when she was grownup live on kirrin island with timmy aunt fanny had got ready plenty of food to take across to the island she was quite looking forward to the trip she had not seen her husband for some days and was anxious to know that he was all right they all went down to the beach julian carrying the bag of food george was already there with her boat james a fisherboy friend of georges was there too ready to push the boat out for them he grinned atthe children he knew them all the old days he had looked after timmy for george when her father had said the dog must be given away george had never forgotten jamess kindness to timmy and always went to see him every holidays going off to the island said james thats a queer sort of thing in the middle of it isnt it kind of lighthouse it looks take my hand miss and let me help you in anne took his hand and jumped into the boat george was already there with timmy soon they were all in julian and george took the oars james gave them a shove and off they went on the calm clear water anne could see every stone on the bottom julian and george rowed strongly they sent the boat along swiftly george began to sing a rowing song and they all took it up it was lovely to be on the sea in a boat again oh holidays go slowly dont rush away too fast george said her mother nervously as they in island you will be careful of these awful rocks wont you the waters so clear today that i can see them all and some of them are only just below the water oh mother you know ive rowed hundreds of times to kirrin island laughed george i simply couldnt go on a rock i know them all really i do i could almost row blindfold to the island now there was only one place to land on the island in safety this was a little cove a natural little harbour running up to a stretch of sand it was sheltered by high rocks all round george and julian worked their way to the east side of the island rounded a low wall of very sharp rocks and there lay the cove a smooth inlet of water running into the shore anne had been looking at the island as the others rowed there was the old ruined kirrin castle in the center just the same as ever its tumbledown towers were full of jackdaws as usual its old walls were gripped by ivy its a lovely place said anne with a sigh then she gazed at the curious tower that now rose from the centre of the castle yard it was not built of brick but of some smooth shiny material that was fitted together in sections evidently the tower had been made in that way so that it might be brought to the island easily and set up there quickly isnt it queer said dick look at that little glass room at the top like a lookout room i wonder what its for can anyone climb up inside the tower asked dick turning to aunt fanny oh yes there is a narrow spiral staircase inside said his aunt thats about all there is inside the tower itself its the little room at the top that is important it has got some extraordinary wiring there essential to your uncles experiments i dont think he does anything with the tower it just has to be there doing something on its own which has a certain effect on the experiments he is making anne couldnt follow this it sounded too complicated i should like to go up the tower she said well perhaps your uncle will let you said her aunt if hes in a good temper said george now george youre not to say things like that said her mother the boat ran into the little harbour and grounded softly there was another boat there already uncle quentins george leapt out with julian and they pulled it up a little further so that the others could get out without wetting their feet out they all got and timmy ran up the beach in delight now timmy said george warningly and timmy turned a despairing eye on his mistress surely she wasnt going to stop him looking to see if there were any rabbits only just looking what harm was there in that ah there was a rabbit and another and another they sat all about looking at the little company coming up from the shore they flicked their ears and twitched their noses keeping quite still oh theyre as tame as ever said anne in delight aunty fanny arent they lovely do look at the baby one over there hes washing his face they stopped to look at the rabbits they really were astonishingly tame but then very few people came to kirrin island and the rabbits multiplied in peace running about where they liked quite unafraid oh that one is began dick but then the picture was spoilt timmy quite unable to do nothing but look had suddenly lost his selfcontrol and was bounding on the surprised rabbits in a trice nothing could be seen but white bobtails flashing up and down as rabbit after rabbit rushed to its burrow timmy called george crossly and poor timmy put his tail down looking round at george miserably what he seemed to say not even a scamper after the rabbits what a hardhearted mistress wheres uncle quentin asked anne as they walked to the great broken archway that was the entrance to the old castle behind it werethe stone steps that led towards the centre they were broken and irregular now aunt fanny went across them carefully afraid of stumbling but the children who were wearing rubber shoes ran over them quickly they passed through a ruined doorway into what looked like a great yard once there had been a stonepaved floor but now most of it was covered by sand and by closegrowing weeds or grass the castle had had two towers one was almost a complete ruin the other was in better shape jackdaws circled round it and flew above the childrens heads crying chack chack chack i suppose your father lives in the little old room with the two slitlike windows said dick to george thats the only place in the castle that would give him any shelter everywhere else is in ruins except that one room do you remember we once spent a night there yes said george it was fun i suppose thats where father lives theres nowhere else unless hes down in the dungeons oh no one would live in the dungeons surely unless they simply had to said julian theyre so dark and cold where is your father george i cant see him anywhere mother where would father be asked george wheres his workshop in that old room there she pointed to the dark stonewalled stoneroofed room which was really all that was left of the part in which people had long ago lived it jutted out from what had once been the wall of the castle well really i dont exactly know said her mother i suppose he works over there hes always met me down at the cove and weve just sat on the sand and had a picnic and talked he didnt seem to want me to poke round much lets call him said dick so they shouted loudly uncle quentin uncle quentin where are you the jackdaws flew up in fright and a few gulls who had been sitting on part of the ruined wall joined in the noise crying eeoo eeoo eeoo over and over again every rabbit disappeared in a trice no uncle quentin appeared they shouted again uncle quentin where are you what a noise said aunt fanny covering her ears i should think that joanna must have heard that at home oh dear where is your uncle this is most annoying of him i told him id bring you across today oh well he must be somewhere about said julian cheerfully if mahomet wont come to the mountain then the mountain must go to mahomet i expect hes deep in some book or other well hunt for him well look in that little dark room said anne so they all went through the stone doorway and found themselves in a little dark room lit only by two slits of windows at one end was a space or recess where a fireplace had once been going back into the thick stone wall hes not here said julian in surprise and whats more theres nothing here at all no food no clothes no books no stores of any sort this is not his workroom nor even his store then he must be down in the dungeons said dick perhaps its necessary to his work to be underground and with water all round lets go and find the entrance we know where it is not far from the old well in the middle of the yard yes he must be down in the dungeons mustnt he aunt fanny said anne are you coming down oh no said her aunt i cant bear those dungeons ill sit out here in the sun in this sheltered corner and unpack the sandwiches its almost lunchtime oh good said everyone they went towards the dungeon entrance they expected to see the big flat stone that covered the entrance standing upright so that they might go down the steps underground but the stone was lying flat julian was just about to pull on the iron ring to lift it up when he noticed something peculiar look he said there are weeds growing round the edges of the stone nobody has lifted it for a long time uncle quentin isnt down in the dungeons then where is he said dick wherever can he be chapter four where is uncle quentin the four of them with timmy nosing round their legs stood staring down at the big stone that hid the entrance to the dungeons julian was perfectly right the stone could not have been lifted for months because weeds had grown closely round the edges sending their small roots into every crack no one is down there said julian we need not even bother to pull up the stone and go down to see if it had been lifted lately those weeds would have been torn up as it was raised and anyway we know that no one can get out of the dungeon once the entrance stone is closing it said dick its too heavy uncle quentin wouldnt be silly enough to shut himself in hed leave it open of course he would said anne well hes not there then he must be somewhere else but where said george this is only a small island and we know every corner of it oh would he be in that cave we hid in once the only cave on the island oh yes he might be said julian but i doubt it i cant see uncle quentin dropping down through the hole in the caves roof and thats the only way of getting into it unless youre going to clamber and slide about the rocks on the shore for ages i cant see him doing that either they made their way beyond the castle to the other side of the island here there was a cave they had once lived in it could be entered with difficulty on the seaward side as julian had said by clambering over slippery rocks or it could be entered by dropping down a rope through a hole in the roof to the floor some way below they found the hole half hidden in old heather julian felt about the rope was still there ill slide down and have a look he said he went down the rope it was knotted at intervals so that his feet found holdingplaces and he did not slide down too quickly and scorch his hands he was soon in the cave a dim light came in from the seaward side julian took a quick look round there was absolutely nothing there at all except for an old box that they must have left behind when they were last here themselves he climbed up the rope again his head appearing suddenly out of the hole dick gave him a helping hand well he said any sign of uncle quentin no said julian hes not there and hasnt been there either i should think its a mystery where is he and if hes really doing important work where is all his stuff i mean we know that plenty of stuff was brought here because aunt fanny told us so do you think hes in the tower said anne suddenly he might be in that glass room at the top well hed see us at once if he were said julian scornfully and hear our yells too still we might as well have a look so back to the castle they went and walked to the queer tower their aunt saw them and called to them your lunch is ready come and have it your uncle will turn up i expect but aunt fanny where is lie said anne with a puzzled face weve looked simply everywhere her aunt did not know the island as well as the children did she imagined that there were plenty of places to shelter in or to work in never mind she said looking quite undisturbed hell turn up later you come along and have your meal we think well go up the tower said julian just in case hes up there working the four children and timmy went to where the tower rose up from the castle yard they ran their hands over the smooth shining sections which were fitted together in curving rows whats this stuff its built of said dick some kind of new plastic material i should think said julian very light and strong and easily put together i should be afraid it would blow down in a gale said george yes so should i said dick look here is the door the door was small and rounded at the top a key was in the keyhole julian turned it and unlocked the door it opened outwards not inwards julian put his head inside and looked round there was not much room in the tower a spiral staircase made of the same shiny stuff as the tower itself wound up and up and up there was a space at one side of it into which projected curious hooklike objects made of what looked like steel wire ran from one to the other yes its lovely said anne but where is uncle quentin we still havent found him i suppose he is on the island well his boat was pulled up in the cove said george we saw it then he must be here somewheresaid dick but hes not in the castle hes not in the dungeons hes not in the cave and hes not up here its a firstclass mystery the missing uncle where is he said julian look theres poor aunt fanny still down there waiting with the lunch wed better go down shes signaling to us i should like to said anne its an awful squash in this tiny glass room i say did you feel the tower sway then when that gust of wind shook it im going down quickly before the whole thing blows over she began to go down the spiral stairs holding on to a little handrail that ran down beside them the stairs were so steep that she was afraid of falling she nearly did fall when timmy pushed his way past her and disappeared below her at a remarkably fast pace soon they were all down at the bottom julian locked the door again not much good locking a door if you leave the key in he said still id better they walked over to aunt fanny well i thought you were never coming she said did you see anything interesting up there only a lovely view said anne simply magnificent but we didnt find uncle quentin its very mysterious aunt fanny we really have looked everywhere on the island but hes just not here and yet his boat is in the cove said dick so he cant have gone yes it does sound queer said aunt fanny handing round the sandwiches but you dont know your uncle as well as i do he always turns up all right hes forgotten i was bringing you or he would be here as it is we may not see him if hes quite forgotten about your coming if he remembers hell suddenly turn up but where from asked dick munching a potted meat sandwich hes done a jolly good disappearing trick aunt fanny well youll see where he comes from ive no doubt when he arrives said aunt fanny another sandwich george no not you timmy youve had three already oh george do keep timmys head out of that plate hes hungry too mother said george well ive brought dogbiscuits for him said her mother oh mother as if timmy would eat dog biscuits when he can have sandwiches said george he only eats dog biscuits when theres absolutely nothing else and hes so ravenous he cant help eating them they sat in the warm april sunshine eating hungrily there was orangeade to drink cool and delicious timmy wandered over to a rockpool he knew where rainwater collected and could be heard lapping there hasnt he got a good memory said george proudly its ages since he was here and yet he remembered that pool at once when he felt thirsty its funny timmy hasnt found uncle quentin isnt it said dick suddenly i mean when we were hunting for him and got warm youd think timmy would bark or scrape about or something but he didnt i think its jolly funny that father cant be found anywhere said george i do really i cant think how you can take it so calmly mother well dear as i said before i know your father better than you do said her mother hell turn up in his own good time why i remember once when he was doing some sort of work in the stalactite caves at cheddar he disappeared in them for over a week but he wandered out all right when he had finished his experiments its very queer began anne and then stopped suddenly a curious noise came to their ears a rumbling grumbling angry noise like a giant hidden dog growling in fury then there was a hissing noise from the tower and all the wires that waved at the top were suddenly lit up as if by lightning there now i knew your father was somewhere about said georges mother i heard that noise when i was here before but i couldnt make out where it came from where did it come from said dick it sounded al most as if it was underneath us but it couldnt have been gracious this is most mysterious no more noises came they each helped themselves to buns with jam in the middle and then anne gave a squeal that made them all jump violently look theres uncle quentin standing over there near the tower hes watching the jackdaws wherever did he come from chapter five a mystery everyone stared at uncle quentin there he was intently watching the jackdaws his hands in his trousers pockets he hadnt seen the children or his wife timmy leapt to his feet and gamboled over to georges father he barked loudly uncle quentin jumped and turned round he saw timmy and then he saw all the others staring at him in real astonishment uncle quentin did not look particularly pleased to see anyone he walked slowly over to them a slight frown on his face this is a surprise he said i had no idea you were all coming today oh quentin said his wife reproachfully i wrote it down for you in your diary you know i did did you well i havent looked at my diary since so its no wonder i forgot said uncle quentin a little peevishly he kissed his wife george and anne and shook hands with the boys uncle quentin where did you come from asked dick who was eaten up with curiosity weve looked for you for ages oh i was in my workroom said uncle quentin vaguely well but wheres that demanded dick honestly uncle we cant imagine where you hide yourself we even went up the tower to see if you were in that funny glass room at the top what exploded his uncle in a sudden surprising fury you dared to go up there you might have been in great danger ive just finished an experiment and all those wires in there were connected with it yes we saw them acting a bit queerly said julian youve no business to come over here and interfere with my work said his uncle still looking furious how did you get into that tower i locked it yes it was locked all right said julian but you left the key in you see uncle so i thought it wouldnt matter if oh thats where the key is is it said his uncle i thought id lost it well dont you ever go into that tower again i tell you its dangerous uncle quentin you havent told us yet where your workroom is said dick who was quite determined to know we cant imagine where you suddenly came from i told them you would turn up quentin said his wife you look a bit thin dear have you been having regular meals you know i left you plenty of good soup to heat up did you said her husband well i dont know if ive had it or not i dont worry about meals when im working ill have some of those sandwiches now though if nobody else wants them he began to devour the sandwiches one after another as if he was ravenous aunt fanny watched him in distress oh quentin youre starving i shall come over here and stay and look after you her husband looked alarmed oh no nobody is to come here i cant have my work interfered with im working on an extremely important discovery is it a discovery that nobody else knows about asked anne her eyes wide with admiration how clever uncle quentin was well im not sure about that said uncle quentin taking two sandwiches at once thats partly why i came over here besides the fact that i wanted water round me and above me i have a feeling that somebody knows a bit more than i want them to know but theres one thing they cant come here unless theyre shown the way through all those rocks that lie round the island only a few of the fishermen know that and theyve been given orders not to bring anyone here at all i think youre the only other person that knows the way george uncle quentin please do tell us where your workroom is begged dick feeling that he could not wait a single moment more to solve the mystery dont keep bothering your uncle said his aunt annoyingly let him eat his lunch he cant have had anything forages yes but aunt fanny i began dick and was interrupted by his uncle you obey your aunt young man i dont want to be pestered by any of you what does it matter where i work oh it doesnt really matter a bit sir said dick hurriedly its only that im awfully curious to know you see we looked for you simply everywhere well youre not quite so clever as you thought you were then said uncle quentin and reached for a jammy bun george take this dog of yours away from me he keeps breathing down my neck hoping i shall give him a titbit i dont approve of titbits at mealtimes george pulled timmy away her mother watched her father gobbling up the rest of the food most of the sandwiches she had saved for teatime had gone already poor quentin how very hungry he must be quentin you dont think theres any danger for you here do you she said i mean you dont think anyone would try to come spying on you as they did once before no how could they said her husband no plane can land on this island no boat can get through the rocks unless the way through is known and the seas too rough round the rocks for any swimmer julian see if you can make him promise to signal to me night and morning said aunt fanny turning to her nephew i feel worried about him somehow julian tackled his uncle manfully uncle it wouldnt be too much of a bother to you to signal to aunt fanny twice a day would it if you dont quentin i shall come over every single day to see you said his wife and we might come too said anne mischievously her uncle looked most dismayed at the idea well i could signal in the morning and in the evening when i go up to the top of the tower he said i have to go up once every twelve hours to readjust the wires ill signal then half past ten in the morning and half past ten at night how will you signal asked julian will you flash with a mirror in the morning yes that would be quite a good idea said his uncle i could do that easily and ill use a lantern at night ill shine it out six times at half past ten then perhaps youll all know im all right and will leave me alone but dont look for the signal tonight ill start tomorrow morning oh quentin dear you do sound cross said his wile i dont like you being allalone here thats all you look thin and tired im sure youre not uncle quentin put on a scowl exactly like george sometimes put on he looked at his wristwatch well i must go he said time to get to work again ill see you to your boat were going to stay to tea here father said george no id rather you didnt said her father getting up come on ill take you to your boat but father i havent been on my island for ages said george indignantly i want to stay here a bit longer i dont see why i shouldnt well ive had enough interruption to my work said her father i want to get on we shant disturb you uncle quentin said dick who was still terribly curious to know where his uncle had his workroom why wouldnt he tell them was he just being annoying or didnt he want them to know uncle quentin led them all firmly towards the little cove it was plain that he meant them to go and to go quickly when shall we come over and see you again quentin asked his wife not till i say so said her husband it wont take me long now to finish what im on my word that dogs got a rabbit at last oh timmy yelled george in distress timmy dropped the rabbit he had actually managed to grab it scampered away unhurt timmy came to his mistress looking very sheepish youre a very bad dog just because i took my eye off you for half a second no its no good licking my hand like that im cross they all came to the boat ill push her off said julian get in all of you well goodbye uncle quentin i hope your work goes well everyone got into the boat timmy tried to put his head on georges knee but she pushed it away oh be kind to him and forgive him begged anne he looks as if hes going to cry are you ready cried julian got the oars george dick take the other pair he shoved the boat off and leapt in himself he cupped his hands round his mouth dont forget to signal sir well be watching out morning and evening and if you forget i shall come over the very next day called his wife the boat slid away down the little inlet of water and uncle quentin was lost to sight then round the low wall of rocks went the boat and was soon on the open sea ju watch and see if you can make out where uncle quentin is when were round these rocks said dick see what direction he goes in julian tried to see his uncle but the rocks just there hid the cove from sight and there was no sign of him at all why didnt he want us to stay because he didnt want us to know his hidingplace said dick and why doesnt he want us to know because its somewhere we dont know either but i thought we knew every single corner of my island said george i think its mean of father not to tell me if its somewhere i dont know i cant think where it can be timmy put his head on her knee again george was so absorbed in trying to think where her fathers hidingplace could be that she absentmindedly stroked timmys head he was almost beside himself with delight he licked her knees lovingly oh timmy i didnt mean to pet you for ages said george stop licking my knees you make them feel wet and horrid dick its very mysterious isnt it where can father be hiding i cant imagine said dick he looked back at the island a cloud of jackdaws rose up into the air calling loudly chack chack chack the boy watched them what had disturbed them was it uncle quentin perhaps his hidingplace was somewhere about that old tower then the one the jackdaws nested in on the other hand the jackdaws often rose into the air together for no reason at all those jackdaws are making a bit of fuss he said perhaps uncles hidingplace is not far from where they roost together by that tower cant be said julian we went all round there today well its a mystery said george gloomily and i think its horrible having a mystery about my very own island and to be forbidden to go to it and solve it its really too bad chapter six up on the cliff the next day was rainy the four children put on their macintoshes and souwesters and went out for a walk with timmy they never minded the weather in fact julian said that he really liked the feel of the wind and rain buffeting against his face we forgot that uncle quentin couldnt flash to us if the weather wasnt sunny said dick do you suppose hell find some way to signal instead no said george he just wont bother he thinks were awful fussers anyway im sure well have to watch at half past ten tonight to see if he signals i say shall i be able to stay up till then said anne pleased i shouldnt think so said dick i expect julian and i will stay up but you kids will have to buzz off to bed george gave him a punch dont call us kids im almost as tall as you are now its not much use waiting about till half past ten now to see if uncle signals to us in any way is it said anne lets go up on the cliff itll be lovely and blowy timmy will like that i love to see him racing along in the wind with his ears blown back straight woof said timmy he says he likes to see you with yours blown back too said julian gravely anne gave a squeal of laughter you really are an idiot ju come on lets take the cliffpath they went up the cliff at the top it was very windy indeed annes souwester was blown to the back of her head the rain stung their cheeks and made them gasp i should think we must be about the only people out this morning gasped george well youre wrong said julian there are two people coming towards us so there were they were a man and a boy both well wrapped up in macintoshes and souwesters like the children they too wore high rubber boots the children took a look at them as they passed the man was tall and well built with shaggy eyebrows and a determined mouth the boy was about sixteen also tall and well built he was not a badlooking boy but he had rather a sullen expression good morning said the man and nodded good morning chorused the children politely the man looked them over keenly and then he and the boy went on wonder who they are said george mother didnt say there were any new people here just walked over from the next village i expect said dick they went on for some way well walk to the coastguards cottage and then go back said julian hie tim dont go so near the cliff the coastguard lived in a little whitewashed cottage on the cliff facing the sea two other cottages stood beside it also whitewashed the children knew the coastguard well he was a redfaced barrelshaped man fond of joking he was nowhere to be seen when they came to his cottage then they heard his enormous voice singing a seashanty in the little shed behind they went to find him hallo coastguard said anne he looked up and grinned at the children he was busy making something halo to you he said so youre back again are you bad pennies the lot of you always turning up when youre not wanted what are you making asked anne a windmill for my young grandson said the coastguard showing it to anne he was very clever at making toys oh its lovely said anne taking it in her hands does the windmill part go round oh yes its super coastguard ive been making quite a bit of money out of my toys said the old fellow proudly ive got some new neighbours in the next cottage man and a boy and the mans been buying all the toys i make seems to have a lot of nephews and nieces he gives me good prices too oh would that be the man and the boy we met i wonder said dick both tall and well built and the man had shaggy eyebrows thats right said the coastguard trimming a bit of his windmill mr curton and his son they came here some weeks ago you ought to get to know the son master julian hes about your age i should think must be pretty lonely for him up here doesnt he go to any school asked julian no hes been ill so his father said got to have plenty of seaair and that sort of thing not a bad sort of boy comes and helps me with my toys sometimes and he likes to mess about with my telescope i do too said george i love looking through your telescope can i look through now id like to see if i can spot kirrin island well you wont see much this weather said the coast guard you wait a few minutes see that break in the clouds well itll clear in a few minutes and youll be able to see your island easily thats a funny thing your fathers built there miss part of his work i suppose yes said george oh timmy look what hes done coastguard hes upset that tin of paint bad boy timmy its not my tin said the coastguard its a tin belonging to that young fellow next door i told you he comes in to help me sometimes he brought in that tin to help paint a little dolls house i made for his father oh dear said george in dismay do you think hell be cross when he knows timmy spilt it shouldnt think so said the coastguard hes a queer boy though quiet and a bit sulky not a bad boy but doesnt seem very friendly like george tried to clear up the mess of paint timmy had some on his paws and made a little pattern of green pawmarks as he pattered about the shed ill tell the boy im sorry if i meet him on the way back she said timmy if you dare to go near any more tins of paint you shant sleep on my bed tonight the weathers a bit clearer now said dick can we have a squint through the telescope coastguard let me see my island first said george at once she tilted the telescope in the direction of kirrin island slit looked through it earnestly and a smile came over her face yes i can see it clearly theres the tower father has had built i can even see the glass room quite clearly and theres nobody in it no sign of father anywhere everyone had a turn at looking through the telescope it was fascinating to see the island appearing so close on a clear day it would be even easier to see all the details i can see a rabbit scampering said anne when her turn came dont you let that dog of yours squint through the telescope then said the coastguard at once hell try to get down it after that rabbit timmy cocked his ears up at the mention of the word rabbit he looked all round and sniffed no there was no rabbit then why did people mention them wed better go now said julian well be up here again sometime and well come and see what toys youve done thanks for letting us look through the telescope youre welcome said the old fellow youre not likely to wear it out through looking come along any time you want to use it they said goodbye and went off timmy capering round them couldnt we see kirrin island well said anne i wished i could see where your father was george wouldnt it be fun if we spotted him just coming out of his hidingplace the four children had discussed this problem a good deal since they had left the island it puzzled them very much indeed how did it happen that georges father knew a hidingplace that they didnt know why they had been over ever inch of the island it must be quite a big hidingplace too if he had got all his stuff for his experiments with him according to georges mother there had been quite a lot of this to say nothing of stores of food if father knew a place i didnt know and never told me about it i think hes jolly mean george said half a dozen times i do really its my island well hell probably tell you when hes finished the work hes on said julian then youll know we can all go and explore it then wherever it is after they left the coastguards cottage they turned their steps home they made their way along the cliff and then saw the boy they had met before he was standing on the path looking out to sea the man was not with him he turned as they came up arid gave them a pale kind of smile hallo been up to see the coastguard yes said julian nice old fellow isnt he i say said george im so sorry but my dog upset a tin of green paint and the coastguard said it was yours can i pay you for it please goodness no said the boy i dont mind there wasnt much of it left anyway thats a nice dog of yours yes he is said george warmly best dog in the world ive had him for years but hes still as young as ever do you like dogs oh yes said the boy but he made no move to pat timmy or fuss him as most people did and timmy did not run round the boy and sniff at him as he usually did when he met anyone new he just stood by george his tail neither up nor down thats an interesting little island said the boy pointing to kirrin i wish i could go there its my island said george proudly my very own really said the boy politely could you let me go over one day then well not just at present said george you see my fathers there working hes a scientist really said the boy again er has he got some new experiment on hand then yes said george ah and that queer tower is something to do with it i suppose said the boy looking interested for the first time when will his experiment be finished whats that to do with you said dick suddenly the others stared at him in surprise dick sounded rather rude and it was not like him oh nothing said the boy hastily i only thought that if his work will soon be finished perhaps your brother would take me over to his island george couldnt help feeling pleased this boy though she was a boy george was always gracious to people who made the mistake of thinking she was a boy of course ill take you she said it shouldnt be long before i do the experiment is nearly done chapter seven a little squabble a sound made them turn it was the boys father coming up he nodded to the children making friends he said amiably thats right my boys pretty lonely here i hope youll come up and see us some time finished your conversations sofl yes said the boy this boy here says that island is his and hes going to take me over it when his father has finished his work there and that wont be long and do you know the way through all those wicked rocks said the man i shouldnt care to try it i was talking to the fishermen the other day and not one of them appeared to know the way this was rather astonishing some of the fishermen did know it then the children remembered that the men had all been forbidden to take anyone to the island while uncle quentin was at work there it was clear that they had pretended not to know the way in loyalty to their orders did you want to go to the island then asked dick suddenly oh no but my boy here would love to go said the man i dont want to be seasick bobbing up and down in those waves near the island im a poor sailor i never go on the sea if i can help it well we must go said julian weve got to do some shopping for my aunt goodbye come and see us as soon as you can said the man ive a fine television set that martin here would like to show you any afternoon you like oh thanks said george she seldom saw television well come they parted and the four children and timmy went on down the cliffpath whatever made you sound so rude dick said george the way you said whats that to do with you sounded quite insulting well i just felt suspicious thats all said dick that boy seemed to be so jolly interested in the island and in your fathers work and when it would be finished why shouldnt he be demanded george everyone in the village is interested they all know about the tower and all the boy wanted to know was when he could go to my island thats why he asked when fathers work would be finished i liked him you only liked him because he was ass enough to think you were a boy said dick jolly girlishlooking boy you are thats all i can say george flared up at once dont be mean im not girlishlooking ive far more freckles than you have for one thing and better eyebrows and i can make my voice go deep youre just silly said dick in disgust as if freckles are boyish girls have them just as much as boys i dont believe that boy thought you were a boy at all he was just sucking up to you he must have heard how much you like playing at being what you arent george walked up to dick with such a furious look on her face that julian hastily put himself in between them now no brawls he said youre both too old to begin slapping each other like kids in the nursery let me tell you youre both behaving like babies not like boys or gins anne was looking on with scared eyes george didnt go off the deep end like this usually and it was funny of dick to have spoken so rudely to the boy on the cliff tirnmy gave a sudden little whine his tail was down and lie looked very miserable oh george timmy cant bear you to quarrel with dick said anne look at him hes just miserable he didnt like that boy a hit said dick that was another thing i thought was funny if timmy doesnt like a person i dont like him either timmy doesnt always rush round new people said george he didnt growl or snarl anyway all right all right julian im not going to start brawling but i do think dick is being silly making a mountain out of a molehill just because someone was interested in kirrin island and fathers work and just because timmy didnt caper all round him he was such a solemn sort of boy that im not surprised timmy wasnt all over him he probably knew the boy wouldnt like it timmys clever like that oh do stop said dick i give in gracefully i may be making a fuss probably am i couldnt help my feelings though anne gave a sigh of relief the squabble was over she hoped it wouldnt crop up again george had been very touchy since she had been home if only uncle quentin would hurry up and finish his work and they could all go to the island as much as they liked things would be all right id rather like to see that television set said george we might go up some afternoon right said julian but on the whole i think it would be best if we steered clear of any talk about your fathers work not that we know much still we do know that once before there were people after one of his theories the secrets of the scientists are very very important these days you know george scientists are vip whats vlp asked anne very important people baby said julian with a laugh what did you think it meant violet indigo purple i guess those are the colours uncle quentin would go if he knew anyone was trying to snoop into his secrets everyone laughed even george she looked affectionately at julian he was always so sensible and goodtempered she really would go by what he said the day passed swiftly the weather cleared and the sun came out strongly the air smelt of gorse and primroses and the salt of the sea lovely they went shopping for aunt fanny and stopped to talk with james the fisherboy your fathers got the island i see he said to george with a grin bad luck miss youll not be going overthere so often and nobody else will either so ive heard thats right said george nobody is allowed to go over there for some time did you help to take some of the stuff over james yes i know the way you see because ive been with you said james well miss how did you find your boat when you went across yesterday i got her all shipshape for you didnt i yes you did james said george warmly you made her look beautiful you must come across to the island with us next time we go thanks said james his ready grin showing all his white teethlike to leave timmy with me for a week or two see how he wants to stay george laughed she knew james was only joking he was very fond of timmy though and timmy adored james he was now pushing himself hard against the fisherboys knees and trying to put his nose into his brown hand timmy had never forgotten the time when james looked after him so well the evening came and the bay was softly blue little white horses flecked it here and there the four gazed across to kirrinisland it always looked so lovely at this time of the evening the glass top of the tower winked and blinked in the sun it looked almost as if someone was signaling but there was noone in the little glass room as the children watched they heard a faint rumbling sound and suddenly the top of the tower was ablaze with a curious glare look thats what happened yesterday said julian in excitement your fathers at work all right george i do wonder what hes doing then there came a throbbing sound almost like the noise of an aeroplane and once more the glass top of the tower shone and blazed as the wires became full of some curious power weird said dick a bit frightening too wheres your father at this very moment i wonder george how id like to know i bet hes forgotten all about meals again said george didnt he wolf our sandwiches he must have been starving i wish hed let mother go over there and look after him her mother came in at that moment did you hear the noise she said i suppose that was your father at work again oh dear i hope he doesnt blow himself up one of these days aunt fanny can i stay up till half past ten tonight asked anne hopefully to see uncle quentins signal you know good gracious no said her aunt no one needs to stay up i am quite capable of watching for it myself oh aunt fanny surely i and dick can stay up said julian after all were not in bed till ten at school yes but this is half past ten and you wouldnt even be in bed then said his aunt theres no reason why you shouldnt lie in bed and watch for it though if you want to providing you havent fallen asleep oh yes i can do that said julian my window looks across to kirrin island six flashes with a lantern i shall count them carefully so the four went to bed at the usual time anne was asleep long before half past ten and george was so drowsy that she could not make herself get up and go into the boys room but dick and julian were both wide awake they lay in their beds and looked out of the window there was no moon but the sky was clear and the stars shone down giving a faint light the sea looked very black there was no sign of kirrin island it was lost in the darkness of the night almost half past ten said julian looking at his watch which had luminous hands now then uncle quentin what about it almost as if his uncle was answering him a light shone out in the glass top of the tower it was a clear small light like the light of a lantern julian began to count one flash there was a pause two flashes another pause three four five six the flashes stopped julian snuggled down into bed well thats that uncle quentins all right i say its weird to think of him climbing that spiral stairway right to the top of the tower in the dark of night isnt it just to mess about with those wires mmmmm said dick sleepily i rather he did it than i you can be a scientist if you like ju but i dont want to climb towers in the dead of night on a lonely island id like timmy there at least someone knocked on their door and it opened julian sat up at once it was aunt fanny oh julian dear did you see the flashes i forgot to count them were there six oh yes aunt fanny id have rushed down to tell you if anything was wrong uncles all right dont you worry i wish id told him to do an extra flash to tell me if hes had some of that nice soup said his aunt well good night julian sleep well chapter eight down in the quarry the next day dawned bright and sunny the four tore down to breakfast full of high spirits can we bathe aunt fanny its really warm enough oh do say we can of course not whoever heard of bathing in april said aunt fanny why the sea is terribly cold do you want to be in bed for the rest of the holiday with a chill well lets go for a walk on the moors at the back of kirrin cottage said george timmy would love that wouldnt you tim woof said timmy thumping his tail hard on the ground take your lunch with you if you like said her mother ill pack some for you youll be glad to be rid of us for a little while i expect aunt fanny said dick with a grin i know what well do well go to the old quarry and look for prehistoric weapons weve got a jolly good museum at school and id like to take back some stone arrowheads or something like that they all liked hunting for things it would be fun to go to the old quarry and it would be lovely and warm in the hollow there i hope we shant find a poor dead sheep there as we once did said anne with a shudder poor thing it must have fallen down and baaed for help for ages of course we shant said julian we shall find stacks of primroses and violets though growing down the sides of the quarry they are always early there because its sheltered from every wind i should love to have bunches of primroses said his aunt nice big ones enough to put all over the house well while the boys are looking for arrowheads well look for primroses said anne pleased i like picking flowers and timmy of course will hunt for rabbits and will hope to bring home enough for you to decorate the larder from top to bottom said dick solemnly timmy looked thrilled and gave an excited little woof they waited for uncle quentins signal at half past ten it came six flashes of a mirror in the sun the flashes were quite blinding nice little bit of heliographing said dick good morning and goodbye uncle well watch for you tonight now everybody ready yes come on tim whos got the sandwiches i say isnt the sun hot off they all went they had on coats and their rubber boots but no hats and nobody thought of taking a macintosh it was going to be a really lovely day the quarry was not really very far only about a quarter of a mile the children went for a walk beforehand for timmys sake then they made for the quarry it was a queer place at some time or other it had been deeply quarried for stone and then left to itself now the sides were covered with small bushes and grass and plants of all kinds in the sandy places heather grew the sides were very steep and as few people came there there were no paths to follow it was like a huge rough bowl irregular in places and full of colour now where primroses opened their pale petals to the sky violets grew there by the thousand both white and purple cowslips were opening too the earliest anywhere oh its lovely said anne stopping at the top and looking down simply super i never in my life saw so many primroses nor such huge ones be careful how you go anne said julian these sides are very steep if you lose your footing youll roll right down to the bottom and find yourself with a broken arm or leg ill be careful said anne ill throw my basket down to the bottom so that i can have two hands to cling to bushes with if i want to i shall be able to fill that basket cramful of primroses and violets she flung the basket down and it bounced all the way to the bottom of the quarry the children climbed down to where they wanted to go the girls to a great patch of big primroses the boys to a place where they thought they might find stone weapons hallo said a voice suddenly from much lower down the four stopped in surprise and timmy growled why its you said george recognizing the boy they had met the day before yes i dont know if you know my name its martin curton said the boy julian told him their names too weve come to picnic here he said and to see if we can find stone weapons what have you come for oh to see if i can find stone weapons too said the have you found any asked george no not yet well you wont find any just there said dick not in heather you want to come over here where the ground is bare and gravelly dick was trying to be friendly to make up for the day before martin came over and began to scrape about with the boys they had trowels with them but he had only his hands isnt it hot down here called anne im going to take off my coat timmy had his head and shoulders down a rabbit hole he was scraping violently sending up heaps of soil behind him in a shower dont go near timmy unless you want to be buried in earth said dick hey timmy is a rabbit really worth all that hard work apparently it was for timmy panting loudly went on digging for all he was worth a stone flew high in the air and hit julian he rubbed his cheek then he looked at the stone that lay beside him he gave a shout look at this a jolly fine arrowhead thanks timmy old fellow very good of you to go digging for me what about a hammerhead next the others came to see the stone arrowhead anne thought she would never have known what it was but julian and dick exclaimed over it in admiration jolly good specimen said dick see how its been shaped george to think that this was used thousands of years ago to kill the enemies of a caveman martin did not say much he just looked at the arrowhead which certainly was a very fine unspoilt specimen and then turned away dick thought he was a queer fellow a bit dull and boring he wondered if they ought to ask him to their picnic he didnt want to in the least but george did are you having a picnic here too she asked martin shook his head no ive not brought any sandwiches well weve plenty stay and have some with us when we eat them said george generously thanks its very nice of you said the boy and will you come and see my television set this afternoon in return id like you to yes we will said george it would be something to do oh anne just look at those violets ive never seen such big white ones before wont mother be pleased the boys went deeper down scraping about with their trowels in any likely place they came to where a shelf of stone projected out a good way it would be a nice place to have their lunch the stone would be warm to sit on and was flat enough to take gingerbeer bottles and cups in safety at half past twelve they all had their lunch they were very hungry martin shared their sandwiches and became quite friendly over them best sandwiches ive ever tasted he said i do like those sardine ones does your mother make them for you i wish i had a mother mine died ages ago there was a sympathetic silence the four could not think of any worse thing to happen to a boy or girl they offered martin the nicest buns and the biggest piece of cake immediately i saw your father flashing his signals last night said martin munching a bun dick looked up at once how do you know he was signaling he asked who told you nobody said the boy i just saw the six flashes and i thought it must be georges father he looked surprised at dicks sharp tone julian gave dick a nudge to warn him not to go off the deep end again george scowled at dick i suppose you saw my father signaling this morning too she said to martin i bet scores of people saw the flashes he just heliographs with a mirror at half past ten to signal that hes all right and flashes a lantern at the same time at night now it was dicks turn to scowl at george why give away all this information it wasnt necessary dick felt sure she was doing it just to pay him out for his sharp question he tried to change the subject where do you go to school he asked i dont said the boy ive been ill well where did you go to school before you were ill asked dick i i had a tutor said martin i didnt go to school bad luck said julian he thought it must be terrible not to go to school and have all the fun the work and the games of schoollife he looked curiously at martin was he one of these rather stupid boys who did no good at school but had to have a tutor at home still he didnt look stupid he just looked rather sullen and dull timmy was sitting on the warm stone with the others he had his share of the sandwiches but had to be rationed as martin had to have some too he was funny with martin he took absolutely no notice of him at all martin might not have been there and martin took no notice of timmy he did not talk to him or pat him anne was sure he didnt really like dogs as he had said how could anyone be with timmy and not give him even one pat timmy did not even look at martin but sat with his back to him leaning against george it was really rather amusing if it wasnt so odd after all george was talking in a friendly way to martin they were all sharing their food with him and timmy behaved as if martin simply wasnt there at all anne was just about to remark on timmvs odd behaviour when he yawned shook himself and leapt down from the rock hes going rabbiting again said julian hey tim find me another arrowhead will you old fellow timmy wagged his tail he disappeared under the shelf of rock and there came the sound of digging a shower of stones and soil flew into the air the children lay back on the stone and felt sleepy they talked for some minutes and then anne felt her eyes closing she was awakened by georges voice wheres timmy timmy timmy come here where have you got to but no timmy came there was not even an answering bark oh blow said george now hes gone down some extradeep rabbit hole i suppose i must get him timmy wherever are you chapter nine george makes a discovery and loses her temper george slipped down from the rock she peered under it there was a large opening there scattered with stones that timmy had loosened in his digging surely you havent at last found a rabbit hole big enough to go down said george timmy where are you not a bark not a whine came from the hole george wriggled under the shelf of rock and peered down the burrow timmy had certainly made it very big george called up to julian julian throw me down your trowel will you the trowel landed by her foot george took it and began to make the hole bigger it might be big enough for timmy but it wasnt big enough for her she dug hard and soon got very hot she crawled out and looked over on to the rock to see if she could get one of the others to help her they were all asleep lazy things thought george quite forgetting that she too would have been dozing if she hadnt wondered where timmy had gone she slipped down under the rock again and began to dig hard with her trowel soon she had made the hole big enough to get through she was surprised to find quite a large passage once she had made the entrance big enough to take her she could crawl along on hands and knees i say i wonder if this is just some animals runway or leads somewhere thought george timmy where are you from somewhere deep in the quarry side there came a faint whine george felt thankful so timmy was there after all she crawled along and then quite suddenly the tunnel became high and wide and she realized that she must be in a passage it was perfectly dark so she could not see anything she could only feel then she heard the sound of pattering feet and timmy pressed affectionately against her legs whining oh timmy you gave me a bit of a fright said george where have you been is this a real passage or just a tunnel in the quarry made by the aid miners and now used by animals woof said timmy and pulled at georges shorts to make her go back to the daylight all right im coming said george dont imagine i want to wander alone in the dark i only came to look for you she made her way back to the shelf of rock by this time dick was awake and wondered where george had gone he waited a few minutes blinking up into the deep blue sky and then sat up george there was no answer so in his turn dick slipped down from the rock and looked around and to his very great astonishment he saw first timmy and then george on hands and knees appearing out of the hole under the rock he stared openmouthed and george began to giggle its all right ive only been rabbiting with timmy she stood beside him shaking and brushing soil from her jersey and shorts theres a passage behind the entrance to the hole under the rock she said at first its just a narrow tunnel like an animals hole then it gets wider and then it becomes a proper high wide passage i couldnt see if it went on of course because it was dark timmy was a long way in good gracious said dick it sounds exciting lets explore it shall we said george i expect julians got a torch no said dick we wont explore today the others were now awake and listening with interest is it a secret passage said anne thrilled oh do lets explore it no not today said dick again he looked t julian julian guessed that dick did not want martin to share this secret why should he he was not a real friend of theirs and they had only just got to know him he nodded back to dick no we wont explore today anyway it may be nothing just an old tunnel made by the quarrymen martin was listening with great interest he went and looked into the hole i wish we could explore he said maybe we could plan to meet again with torches and see if there really is a passage there julian looked at his watch nearly two oclock well martin if were going to see that half past two television programme of yours wed better be getting on carrying baskets of primroses and violets the girls began to climb up the steeep side of the quarry julian took annes basket from her afraid she might slip and fall soon they were all at the top the air felt quite cool there after the warmth of the quarry they made their way to the cliffpath and before long were passing the coastguards cottage he was out in his garden and he waved to them they went in the gateway of the nextdoor cottage martin pushed the door open his father was sitting at the window of the room inside reading he got up with a broad welcoming smile well well well this is nice come along in do yes the clog as well i dont mind dogs a bit i like them it seemed rather a crowd in the small room they all shook hands politely martin explained hurriedly that he had brought the children to see a television programme a good idea said mr curton still beaming anne stared at his great eyebrows they were very long and thick she wondered why he didnt have them trimmed but perhaps he liked them like that they made him look very fierce she thought the four looked round the little room there was a television set standing at the far end on a table there was also a magnificent wireless and something else that made the boys stare with interest hallo youve got a transmitting set as well as a receiving set said julian yes said mr curton its a hobby of mine i made that set well you must be brainy said dick whats a transmitting set asked anne i havent heard of one before oh it just means a set to send out messages by wireless like policecars have when they send back messages to their police stations said dick this is a very powerful one though martin was fiddling about with the television switches then the programme began it was great fun seeing the television programme when it was over mr curton asked them to stay to tea now dont say no he said ill ring up and ask your aunt if you like if youre afraid she might be worried well if youd do that sir said julian i think she would wonder where wed gone mr curton rang up aunt fanny yes it was quite all right for them to stay but they mustnt be too late back so they settled down to an unexpectedly good tea martin was not very talkative but mr curton made up for it he laughed and joked and was altogether very good company the talk came round to kirrin island mr curton said how beautiful it looked each evening george looked pleased yes she said i always think that i do wish father hadnt chosen this particular time to work on my island id planned to go and stay there i suppose you know every inch of it said mr curton oh yes said george we all do there are dungeons there you know real dungeons that go deep down where we once found gold ingots yes i remember reading about that said mr curton that must have been exciting fancy finding the dungeons too and theres an old well too you once got down isnt there yes said anne remembering and there is a cave where we once lived its got an entrance through the roof as well as from the sea and i suppose your father is conducting his marvellous experiments down in the dungeons said mrcurton well what a strange place to work in no we dont began george when she got a kick on the ankle from dick she screwed up her face in pain it had been a very sharp kick indeed what were you going to say said mr curton looking surprised er i was just going to say that er er we dont know which place father has chosen said george keeping her legs well out of the way of dicks feet timmy gave a sudden sharp whine george looked down at him in surprise he was looking up at dick with a very hurt expression whats the matter timmy said george anxiously hes finding the room too hot i think said dick better take him out george george feeling quite anxious took him out dick joined her she scowled at him what did you want to kick me for like that i shall have a frightful bruise you know jolly well why i did said dick giving away everything like that cant you see the chaps very interested in your father being on the island there may be nothing in it at all but you might at least keep your mouth shut just like a girl cant help blabbing i had to stop you somehow i dont mind telling you i trod jolly hard on poor old timmys tail too to make him yelp so that youd stop talking oh you beast said george indignantly how could you hurt timmy i didnt want to it was a shame said dick stopping to fondle timmys ears poor old tim i didnt want to hurt you old fellow im going home said george her face scarlet with anger i hate you for talking to me like that telling me i blab like a girl and stamping on poor timmys tail you can go back and say im taking timmy home right said dick and a jolly good thing too the less you talk to mr curton the better im going back to find out exactly what he is and what he does im getting jolly suspicious youd better go before you give anything else away almost choking with rage george went off with timmy dick went back to make her apologies julian and anne sure that something was up felt most uncomfortable they rose to go but to their surprise dick became very talkative and appeared to be suddenly very much interested in mr curton and what he did but at last they said goodbye and went come again do said mr curton beaming at the three of them and tell the other boy whats his name george that i hope his dog is quite all right again now such a nice well behaved dog well goodbye see you again soon i hope chapter ten a surprising signal whats up with george demanded julian as soon as they were safely out of earshot i know you kicked her at teatime for talking too much about the island that was idiotic of her but why has she gone home in a huff dick told them how he had trodden on poor timmys tail to make him whine so that george would turn her attention to him and stop talking julian laughed but anne was indignant that was horrid of you dick yes it was said dick but i couldnt think of any other way to head george off the island i really honestly thought she was giving away to that fellow all the things he badly wanted to know but now i think he wanted to know them for quite another reason what do you mean said julian puzzled well i thought at first he must be after uncle quentins secret whatever it is said dick and that was why he wanted to know all the ins and outs of everything but now that hes told me hes a journalist thats a man who writes for the newspapers anne i think after all he only wants the information so that he can use it for his paper and make a splash when uncle has finished his work yes i think that too said julian thoughtfully in fact im pretty sure of it well theres no harm in that but i dont see why we should sit there and be pumped all the time he could easily say look here id be obliged if youd spill the beans about kirrin island i want to use it in a newspaper story but he didnt say that no so i was suspicious said dick but i see now hed want all sorts of titbits about kirrin island to put in his newspaper whatever it is blow now i shall have to explain to george i was wrong and she really is in a temper lets take the road to kirrin village and go to get some bones for timmy at the butchers said julian a sort of apology to tim this seemed a good idea they bought two large meaty ones at the butchers and then went to kirrin cottage george was up in her bedroom with timmy the three went up to find her she was sitting on the floor with a book she looked p sulkily as they came in george sorry i was such a beast said dick i did it for a good cause if you only knew it but ive discovered at mr curton isnt a spy seeking out your fathers secret hes only a journalist smelling out a story for a paper look ive brought these for timmy i apologize to him too george was in a very bad temper but she tried to pond to dicks friendliness she gave him a small smile all right thanks for the bones dont talk to me right anybody i feel mad but ill get over it they left her sitting on the floor it was always best how queer said julian why twelve flashes hallo here we go again another six flashes came from the tower then no more at all julian wished he had a telescope then he could see right into the tower he sat and thought for a moment puzzled then he heard the others come pounding up the stairs they burst into the room julian father flashed eighteen times instead of six did you count them ju why did he do that is he in danger of some sort no if he was hed flash the sos signal said julian he doesnt know morse said george well i expect he just wants to let us know that he needs something said julian we must go over today and find out what it is more food perhaps so when aunt fanny came home they suggested they should all go over to the island aunt fanny was pleased oh yes that would be nice i expect your uncle wants a message sent off somewhere well go this morning george flew off to tell james she wanted her boat aunt fanny packed up plenty of food with joannas help then they set off to kirrin island in georges boat as they rounded the low wall of rocks and came into the little cove they saw uncle quentin waiting for them he waved his hand and helped to pull in the boat when it ran gently on to the sand we saw your treble signal said aunt fanny did you want something dear yes i did said uncle quentin whats in your basket fanny more of those delicious sandviches ill have some oh quentin havent you been having your meals properly again said aunt fanny what about that lovely soup what soup said uncle quentin looking surprised i wish id known about it i could have done with some last night but quentin i told you about it before said aunt fanny it will be bad by now you must pour it away now dont forget pour it away where is it perhaps i had better pour it away myself no ill do it said uncle quentin lets sit down and have our lunch it was much too early for lunch but aunt fanny at once sat down and began to unpack the food the children were always ready for a meal at any time so they didnt in the least mind lunch being so early well dear how is your work getting on asked aunt fanny watching her husband devour sandwich after sandwich she began to wonder if he had had anything at all to eat since she had left him two days ago oh very well indeed said her husband couldnt be better just got to a most tricky and interesting point ill have another sandwich please why did you signal eighteen times uncle quentin asked anne ah well its difficult to explain really said her uncle the fact is i cant help feeling theres somebody else on this island besides myself quentin what in the world do you mean cried aunt fanny in alarm she looked over her shoulder as if she half expected to see somebody there all the children stared in amazement at uncle quentin he took another sandwich yes i know it sounds mad nobody else could possibly have got here but i know there is someone oh dont uncle said anne with a shiver it sounds horrid and youre all alone at night too ah thats just it i wouldnt mind a bit if i was all alone at night said her uncle what worries me is that i dont think i shall be all alone uncle what makes you think theres somebody here asked julian well when i had finished the experiment i was doing last night about half past three in the early morning it would be but pitch dark of course said uncle quentin i came into the open for a breath of fresh air and i could swear i heard somebody cough yes cough twice good gracious said aunt fanny startled but quentin you might have been mistaken you do imagine things sometimes you know when youre tired yes i know said her husband but i couldnt imagine this could i he put his hand into his pocket and took something out he showed it to the others it was a cigarette end quite crisp and fresh now i dont smoke cigarettes nor do any of you well then who smoked that cigarette and how did he come here no one would bring him by boat and thats the only way here there was a silence anne felt scared george stared at her father puzzled who could be here and why and how had they got there well quentin what are you going to do said his wife what would be best ill be all right if george will give her consent to something said uncle quentin i want timmy here george will you leave him behind with me chapter eleven george makes a hard choice there was a horrified silence george stared at her father in complete dismay everyone waited to see what she would say but father timmy and i have never been separated once she said at last in a pleading voice i do see you want him to guard you and you can have him but ill have to stay here too oh no said her father at once you cant possibly stay george thats out of the question as for never being separated from timmy well surely you wouldnt mind that for once if it was to ensure my safety george swallowed hard this was the most difficult decision she had ever had to make in her life leave timmy behind on the island where there was some unknown hidden enemy likely to harm him if he possibly could and yet there was father too he might be in danger if there was no one to guard him i shall just have to stay here father she said i cant leave timmy behind unless i stay too its no good her father began to lose his temper he was like george he wanted his own way and if he didnt have it he was going to make a fuss if id asked julian or dick or anne this same thing and theyd had a dog they would all have said yes at once he raged but you george you must always make things difficult if you can you and that dog anyone would think he was worth a thousand pounds hes worth much more than that to me said george in a trembling voice timmy crept nearer to her and pushed his nose into her hand she held his collar as if she would not let him go for a moment yes that dogs worth more to you than your father or mother or anyone said her father in disgust no quentin i cant have you saying things like that said his wife firmly thats just silly a mother and father are quite different from a dog theyre loved in different ways but you are perfectly right of course timmy must stay behind with you and i shall certainly not allow george to stay with him im not going to have both of you exposed to danger its bad enough to worry about you as it is george looked at her mother in dismay mother do tell father i must stay here with timmy certainly not said her mother now george be unselfish if it were left to tim to decide you know perfectly well that he would stay here and stay without you he would say to himself im needed here my eyes are needed to spy out enemies my ears to hear a quiet footfall and maybe my teeth to protect my master i shall be parted from george for a few days but she like me is big enough to putup with that thats what timmy would say george if it were left to him everyone had been listening to this unexpected speech with great attention it was about the only one that could persuade george to give in willingly she looked at timmy he looked back at her wagging his tail then he did an extraordinary thing he got up walked over to georges father and lay down beside him looking at george as if to say there you are now you know what i think is right you see said her mother he agrees with me youve always said that timmy was a good dog and this proves it he knows what his duty is you ought to be proud of him i am said george in a choky voice she got up and walked off all right she said over her shoulder ill leave him on the island with father ill come back in a minute anne got up to go after poor george but julian pulled her down again leave her alone shell be all right good old timmy you know whats right and whats wrong dont you good dog splendid dog timmy wagged his tail he did not attempt to follow george no he meant to stay by her father now even though he would much rather be with his mistress he was sorry that george was unhappy but sometimes it was better to do a hard thing and be unhappy about it than try to be happy without doing it oh quentin dear i dont like this business of you being here and somebody else spying on you said his wife i really dont how long will you be before youve finished your work a few days more said her husband he looked at timmy admiringly that dog might almost have known what you were saying fanny just now it was remarkable the way he walked straight over to me hes a very clever dog said anne warmly arent you tim youll be quite safe with him uncle quentin hes terribly fierce when he wants to be yes i shouldnt care to have him leaping at my throat said her uncle hes so big and powerful are there any more pieces of cake quentin its really too bad of you to go without your meals said his wife its no good telling me you havent because you wouldnt be as ravenous as this if you had had your food regularly her husband took no notice of what she was saying he was looking up at his tower do you ever see those wires at the top blaze out he asked wonderful sight isnt it uncle youre not inventing a new atom bomb or anything are you asked anne her uncle looked at her scornfully i wouldnt waste my time inventing things that will be used to kill and maim people no im inventing something that will be of the greatest use to mankind you wait and see george came back father she said im leaving timmy behind for you but please will you do something for me what asked her father no silly conditions now i shall feed timmy regularly and look after him if thats what you want to ask me i may forget my own meals but you ought to know me well enough to know i shouldnt neglect any animal dependent on me yes i know father said george looking a bit doubtful all the same what i wanted to ask you was this when you go up in the tower to signal each morning will you please take timmy with you i shall be up at the coastguard cottage looking through his telescope at the glass room in the tower and i shall be able to see timmy then if i can catch just a glimpse of him each day and know hes all right i shant worry so much very well said her father but i dont suppose for a moment that timmy will be able to climb up the spiral stairway oh he can father hes been up it once already said george good heavens said her father has the dog been up there too all right george i promise ill take him up with me each morning that i signal and get him to wag his tail at you there will that satisfy you yes thank you said george and youll give him a few kind words and a pat occasionally father wont youand and put his bib on for him at mealtimes i suppose and clean his teeth for him at night said her father looking cross again i shall treat timmy like a proper grownup dog a friend of mine george and believe me thats the way he wants me to treat him isnt it timmy you like all those frills to be kept for your mistress dont you not for me woof said timmy and thumped his tail the children looked at him admiringly he really was a very sensible clever dog he seemed somehow much more grownup than george uncle if anything goes wrong or you want help or anything flash eighteen times again said julian you ought to be all right with timmy hes better than a dozen policemen but you never know right eighteen flashes if i want you over here for anything said his uncle ill remember now youd better all go its time i got on with my work youll pour that soup away wont you quentin said his wife anxiously you dont want to make yourself ill by eating bad soup it must he green by now it would be so like you to forget all about it while it was fresh and good and only remember it when it was bad what a thing to say said her husband getting up anyone would think i was five years old without a brain in my head the way you talk to me youve plenty of brains dear we all know that said his wife but you dont seem very old sometimes now look after yourself and keep timmy by you all the time father wont need to bother about that said george timmy will keep by him youre on guard timmy arent you and you know what that means woof said timmy solemnly he went with them all to the boat but he did not attempt to get in he stood by georges father and watched the boat bob away over the water goodbye timmy shouted george in a funny fierce voice look after yourself her father waved and timmy wagged his tail george took one of the pairs of oars from dick and began to row furiously her face red with the hard work julian looked at her in amusement it was hard work for him too to keep up with the furious rowing but he didnt say anything he knew all this fury in rowing was georges way of hiding her grief at parting with timmy funny old george she was always so intense about things furiously happy or furiously unhappy in the seventh heaven of delight or down in the very depths of despair or anger everyone talked hard so that george would think they were not noticing her feelings at parting with timmy the talk of course was mostly about the un known man on the island it seemed very mysterious indeed that he should suddenly have arrived how did he get there im sure not one of the fishermen would have taken him said dick he must have gone at night of course and i doubt if there is anyone but george who would know the way in the dark or even dare to try and find it these rocks are so close together and so near the surface one yard out of the right course and any boat would have a hole in the bottom no one could reach the island by swimming from the shore said anne its too far and the sea is too rough over these rocks i honestly do wonder if there is anyone on the island after all perhaps that cigarette end was an old one it didnt look it said julian well it just beats me how anyone got there he fell into thought puzzling out all the possible and impossible ways then he gave an exclamation the others looked at him ive just thought would it be possible for an aeroplane to parachute anyone down on the island i did hear a throbbing noise one night was it last night it must have been a planes engine of course could anyone be dropped on the island easily said dick i believe youve hit on the explanation ju good for you but i say whoever it is must be in deadly earnest to risk being dropped on a small island like that in the dark of night in deadly earnest that didnt sound at all nice a little shiver went down annes back i am glad timmys there she said and everyone felt the same yes even george chapter twelve the old map again it was only about half past one when they arrived back because they had had lunch so very early and had not stayed long on the island joanna was most surprised to see them well here you are again she said i hope you dont all want another lunch because theres nothing in the house till i go to the butchers oh no joanna weve had our picnic lunch said her mistress and it was a good thing we packed so much because the master ate quite half of the lunch he still hasnt had that nice soup we made for him now it will be bad of course oh the men theyre as bad as children said joanna well said george do you really think any of us would let your good soup go bad joanna you know jolly well wed probably eat it up before we ought to thats true i wouldnt accuse any of you four or timmy either of playing about with your food said joanna you make good work of it the lot of you but where is timmy i left him behind to look after father said george joanna stared at her in surprise she knew how passionately fond of timmy george was youre a very good girl sometimes she said see now if youre still hungry because your father has eaten most of your lunch you go and look in the biscuit tin i made you some of your favourite ginger biscuits this morning you go and find them that was always joannas way if she thought anyone was upset she offered them her best and freshest food george went off to find the biscuits youre a kind soul joanna said georges mother im so thankful we left timmy there i feel happier about the master now what shall we do this afternoon said dick when they had finished munching the delicious ginger biscuits i say arent these good you know i do think good cooks deserve some kind of decoration just as much as good soldiers or scientists or writers i should give joanna the obcbe whatevers that said julian order of the best cooks of the british empire said dick grinning what did you think it was oh be careful before eating you really are an absolute donkey said julian now what shall we do this afternoon go and explore the passage in the quarry said george julian cocked an eye at the window its about to pour with rain he said i dont think that clambering up and down the steep sides of that quarry in the wet would he very easy no well leave that till a fine day ill tell you what well do said anne suddenly do you remember that old map of kirrin castle we once found in a box it had plans of the castle in it a plan of the dungeons and of the ground floor and of the top part well lets have it out and study it now we know there is another hidingplace somewhere we might be able to trace it on that old map its sure to be on it somewhere but perhaps we didnt notice it before the others looked at her thrilled now that really is a brilliant idea of yours anne said julian and anne glowed with pleasure at his praise a very fine idea indeed just the thing for a wet afternoon wheres the map i suppose youve got it somewhere safe george oh yes said george its still in that old wooden box inside the tin lining ill get it she disappeared upstairs and came down again with the map it was made of thick parchment and was yellow with age she laid it out on the table the others bent over it eager to look at it once more do you remember how frightfully excited we were when we first found the box said dick yes and we couldnt open it so we threw it out of the top window down to the ground below hoping it would burst open said george and the crash woke up uncle quentin said anne with a giggle and he came out and got the box and wouldnt let us have it oh dear yes and poor julian had to wait till uncle quentin was asleep and creep in and get the box to see what was in it finished dick and we found this map and how we pored over it they all pored over it again it was in three parts as anne had said a plan of the dungeons a plan of the ground floor and a plan of the top part its no good bothering about the top part of the castle said dick its all fallen down and ruined theres practically none of it left except for that one tower i say said julian suddenly putting his finger on a certain spot in the map do you remember there were two entrances to the dungeons one that seemed to start somewhere about that little stone room and the other that started where we did at last find the entrance well we never found the other entrance did we no we didnt said george in excitement she pushed julians finger away from the map look there are steps shown here somewhere where that little room is so there must be an entrance there heres the other flight of steps the ones we did find near the well i remember that we hunted pretty hard for the entrance in the little room said dick we scraped away the weeds from every single stone and gave it up at last then we found the other entrance and forgot all about this one and i think father has found the entrance we didnt find said george triumphantly it leads underground obviously whether or not it joins up with the dungeons we know i cant make out from this map its a bit blurred here but its quite plain that there is an entrance here with stone steps leading underground somewhere see theres some sort of passage or tunnel marked leading from the steps goodness knows where it goes its so smeared it joins up with the dungeons i expect said julian we never explored the whole of them you know theyre so vast and weird if we explored the whole place we should probably come across the stone steps leading from somewhere near that little room still they may be ruined or fallen in now no they cant be said george im perfectly sure thats the entrance father has found and ill tell you something that seems to prove it too what said everyone well do you remember the other day when we first went to see father said george he didnt let us stay long and he came to see us off at the boat well we tried to see where he went but we couldnt but dick said he saw the jackdaws rising up in a flock as if they had been suddenly disturbed and he wondered if father had gone somewhere in that direction julian whistled yes the jackdaws build in the tower which is by the little room and anyone going into the room would disturb them i believe youre right george its been puzzling me awfully where uncle quentin could be doing his work said dick i simply could not solve the mystery but now i think we have i wonder how father found his hidingplace said george thoughtfully i still think it was mean of him not to tell me there must have been some reason said dick sensibly dont start brooding again im not said george im puzzled thats all i wish we could take the boat and go over to the island at once and explore yes i bet wed find the entrance all right now said dick your father is sure to have left some trace of where it is a stone a bit cleaner than the rest or weeds scraped off or something do you suppose the unknown enemy on the island knows uncle quentins hidingplace said anne suddenly oh i do hope he doesnt he could so easily shut him in if he did well he hasnt gone there to shut uncle up hes gone there to steal his secret or find it out said julian golly im thankful hes got timmy timmy could tackle a dozen enemies not if they had guns said george in a small voice there was a silence it was not a nice thought to think of timmy at the wrong end of a gun this had happened once or twice before in their adventures and they didnt want to think of it happening again well its no good thinking silly things like that said dick getting up weve had a jolly interesting halfhour i think weve solved that mystery but i suppose we shant know for certain till your fathers finished his experiment george and left the island then we can go over and have a good snoop round its still raining said anne looking out of the window but its a bit clearer it looks as if the sun will he out soon lets go for a walk i shall go up to the coastguards cottage said george at once i want to look through his telescope to see if i can just get a glimpse of timmy try the fieldglasses suggested julian go up to the top of the house with them yes i will said george thanks for the idea she fetched the fieldglasses where they hung in the hall and took them out of their leather case she ran upstairs with them but she soon came down again looking disappointed the house isnt high enough for me to see much of the island properly i can see the glass top of the tower easily of course but the telescope would show it much better its more powerful i think ill go up and have a squint you dont need to come if you dont want to she put the glasses back into their case oh well all come and have a squint for old timmydog said dick getting up and i dont mind telling you what well see what said george in surprise well see timmy having a perfectly wonderful time chasing every single rabbit on the island said dick with a grin my word you neednt worry about timmy not having his food regularly hell have rabbit for breakfast rabbit for dinner rabbit for tea and rainwater from his favourite pool not a bad life for old timmy you know perfectly well hell do nothing of the sort said george hell keep close to father and not think of rabbits once you dont know timmy if you think that said dick dodging out of georges way she was turning red with exasperation i bet thats why he wanted to stay just for the rabbits george threw a book at him it crashed to the floor anne giggled oh stop it you two well never get out come on ju we wont wait for the squabblers chapter thirteen afternoon with martin by the time they reached the coastguards cottage the sun was out it was a real april day with sudden showers and then the sun sweeping out smiling every thing glittered especially the sea it was wet underfoot but the children had on their rubber boots they looked for the coastguard as usual he was in his shed singing and hammering goodday to you he said beaming all over his red face i was wondering when youd come and see me again how do you like this railway station im making its better than any ive ever seen in the shops said anne in great admiration the coastguard certainly had made it well down to the smallest detail he nodded his head towards some small wooden figures of porters and guards and passengers those are waiting to be painted he said that boy martin said hed come in and do them for me very handy with his paints he is a proper artist but hes had an accident has he what happened said julian i dont quite know he was halfcarried home this morning by his father said the coastguard must have slipped and fallen somewhere i went out to ask but mr curton was in a hurry to get the boy on a couch why dont you go in and ask after him hes a queer sort of boy but hes not a bad boy yes we will go and ask said julian i say coastguard would you mind if we looked through your telescope again now you go and look at all you want to said the fellow i tell you you wont wear it out by looking i saw the signal from your fathers tower last night miss george just happened to be looking that way he went on flashing for a long time didnt he yes said george thank you ill go and have a look now she went to the telescope and trained it on her island but no matter where she looked she could not see timmy or her father they must be down in his workroom wherever it was she looked at the glass room in the top of the tower that was empty too of course she sighed it would have been nice to see timmy the others had a look through as well but nobody saw timmy it was plain that he was keeping close to his master a proper little guard well shall we go in and see whats happened to martin said julian when they had finished with the telescope its just about to pour with rain again another april shower we could wait nextdoor till its over right lets go said dick he looked at george dont be afraid i shall be rude george now that i know mr curton is a journalist shant bother about him all the same im not blabbing any more said george with a grin i see your point now even if it doesnt matter i still shant blab any more good for you said dick pleased spoken like a boy ass said george but she was pleased all the same they went through the front gateway of the next cottage as they filed in they heard an angry voice well you cant always wanting to mess about with a brush and paint i thought id knocked that idea out of your head you lie still and get that anklebetter spraining it just when i want your help anne stopped feeling frightened it was mr curtons voice they could hear through the open window he was giving martin a good talking to about something that was plain the others stopped too wondering whether to go in or not then they heard a bang and saw mr curton leaving the cottage from the back entrance he walked rapidly down the garden there and made for the path that led to the back of the cliff there was a road there that went to the village good hes gone and he didnt see us said dick who would have thought that such a genial smiling fellow could have such a rough brutal voice when he loses his temper come on lets pop in and see poor martin while theres a chance they knocked on the door its us called julian cheerfully can we come in oh yes shouted martin from indoors sounding pleased julian opened the door and they all went in i say we heard youd had an accident said julian whats up are you hurt much no its just that i twisted my ankle and it was sc painful to walk on that i had to he halfcarried up here said martin silly thing to do oh itll soon be right if its just a twist said dick ive often done that the thing is to walk on it as soon as you can where were you when you fell martin went suddenly red to everyones surprise well i was walking on the edge of the quarry with my father and i slipped and rolled a good way down he said there was a silence then george spoke i say she said i hope you didnt go and give away our little secret to your father i mean its not so much fun when grownups share a secret they want to go snooping about themselves and its much more fun to discover things by ourselves you didnt tell him about that hole under the shelf of rock did you martin hesitated im afraid i did he said at last i didnt think it would matter im sorry blow said dick that was our own little discovery we wanted to go and explore it this afternoon but we thought it would be so wet wed fall down the steep slope julian looked at martin sharply i suppose thats what happened to you he said you tried clambering down and slipped yes said martin im really sorry if you thought it was your secret i just mentioned it to my father out of interest you know something to say and he wanted to go down and see for himself i suppose journalists are always like that said dick wanting to be on the spot if theres anything to be ferreted out its their job all right martin forget it but do try and head your father off the quarry we would like to do a bit of exploring before he butts in though there may be nothing to be found at all there was a pause nobody knew quite what to say martin was rather difficult to talk to he didnt talk like an ordinary boy he never made a joke or said anything silly arent you bored lying here said anne feeling sorry for him yes awfully i wanted my father to go in and ask the coastguard to bring in some little figures i said id paint for him said martin but he wouldnt let me you know i simply love painting even doing a little thing like that painting clothes on toy porters and guards so long as i can have a brush in my hand and colours to choose from this was the longest speech martin had ever made to the four children his face lost its dull bored look as he spoke and became bright and cheerful oh you want to be an artist i suppose said anne i would like that too anne you cant even draw a cat that looks like one said dick scornfully and when you drew a cow i thought it was an elephant martin smiled at annes indignant face ill show you some of my pictures he said i have to keep them hidden away because my father cant bear me to want to be an artist dont get up if you dont want to said julian ill get them for you its all right if its good for me to try and walk i will said martin and got off the couch he put his right foot gingerly to the floor and then stood up not so bad after all he said he limped across the room to a bookcase he put his hand behind the second row of books and brought out a cardboard case big and flat he took it to the table he opened it and spread out some pictures gracious said anne theyre beautiful did you really do these they were queer pictures for a boy to draw for they were of flowers and trees birds and butterflies all drawn and coloured most perfectly every detail put in lovingly julian looked at them in surprise this boy was certainly gifted why these drawings were as good as any he had ever seen in exhibitions he picked a few up and took them to the window do you mean to say your father doesnt think these are good doesnt think its worth while to let you train as an artist he said in surprise he hates my pictures said martin bitterly i ran away from school and went to an artschool to train but he found me and forbade me to think of drawing any more he thinks its a weak feeble thing for a man to do so i only do it in secret now the children looked at martin with sympathy it seemed an awful thing to them that a boy who had no mother should have a father who hated the thing his son most loved no wonder he always looked dull and miserable and sullen its very bad luck said julian at last i wish we could do something to help well get me those figures and the paint tins from the coastguard said martin eagerly will you father wont be back till six ill have time to do them and do stay and have tea with me its so dull up here i hate it yes ill get the things for you said julian i cant for the life of me see why you shouldnt have something to amuse yourself with if you want to and well ring up my aunt and tell her were staying here to tea so long as we dont eat everything youve got oh thats all right said martin looking very cheerful indeed theres plenty of food in the house my father has an enormous appetite i say thanks most awfully julian rang up his aunt the girls and dick went to fetch the figures and the paint from the coastguard they brought them back and arranged them on a table beside martin his eyes brightened at once he seemed quite different this is grand he said now i can get on its a silly little job this but it will help the old man next door and im always happy when im messing about with a brush and paints martin was very very clever at painting the little figures he was quick and deft and anne sat watching him quite fascinated george went to hunt in the larder for the teathings there was certainly plenty of food she cut some bread and butter found some new honey brought out a huge chocolate cake and some ginger buns and put the kettle on to boil i say this is really grand said martin again i wish my father wasnt coming back till eight by the way wheres the dog i thought he always went everywhere with you wheres timmy chapter fourteen a shock for george dick looked at george he didnt think it would matter telling martin where timmy was so long as george didnt give the reason why he had been left on the island but george was going to hold her tongue now she looked at martin and spoke quite airily oh timmy we left him behind today hes all right gone out shopping with your mother i suppose hoping for a visit to the butchers said martin this was the first joke he had ever made to the children and though it was rather a feeble one they laughed heartily martin looked pleased he began to try and think of another little joke while his deft hands put reds and blues and greens on the little wooden figures they all had a huge tea then when the clock said a quarter to six the girls carried the painted figures carefully back to the coastguard who was delighted with them dick took back the little tins of paint and the brush stuck in a jar of turpentine well now hes clever that boy isnt he said the coastguard eyeing the figures in delight looks sort of miserable and sulky but hes not a bad sort of boy ill just have one more squint through your telescope said george before it gets too dark she tilted it towards her island but once more there was no sign of timmy or of her father either she looked for some time and then went to join the others she shook her head as they raised their eyebrows inquiringly the girls washed up the teathings and cleared away neatly nobody felt as if they wanted to wait and see mr curton they didnt feel as if they liked him very much now they knew how hard he was on martin thanks for a lovely afternoon said martin limping to the door with them i enjoyed my spot of painting to say nothing of your company you stick out for your painting said julian if its the thing youve got to do and you know it you must go all out for it see yes said martin and his face went sullen again but there are things that make it difficult things i cant very well tell you oh well never mind i dare say it will all come right one day and ill be a famous artist with pictures in the academy come on quickly said dick in a low voice to julian theres his father coming back they hurried off down the cliffpath seeing mr curton out of the corner of their eyes coming up the other path horrid man said anne forbidding martin to do what he really longs to do and he seemed so nice and jolly and alloverus didnt he very alloverus said dick smiling at annes new word but there are a lot of people like that one thing at home and quite another outside i hope mr curton hasnt been trying to explore that passage in the side of the quarry said george looking back and watching the man walk up to his back door it would be too bad if he butted in and spoilt our fun i mean there may be nothing to discover at all but it will be fun even finding there is nothing very involved said dick with a grin but i gather what you mean i say that was a good tea wasnt it yes said george looking all round her in an absentminded manner whats up said dick what are you looking like that for oh how silly of me i was just looking for timmy said george you know im so used to him always being at my heels or somewhere near that i just cant get used to him not being here yes i feel a bit like that too said julian as if there was something missing all the time good old tim we shall miss him awfully all of us but you most of all george yes especially on my bed at night said george i shant be able to go to sleep for ages and ages ill wrap a cushion up in a rug and plonk it down on your feet when youre in bed said dick then it will feel like timmy it wont dont be silly said george rather crossly and anyway it wouldnt smell like him hes got a lovely smell yes a timmysmell agreed anne i like it too the evening went very quickly playing the endless game of monopoly again julian lay in bed later watching for his uncles signal needless to say george was at the window too they waited for half past ten now said julian and just as he spoke there came the first flash from the lantern in the tower one counted george two three four five six she waited anxiously to see if there were any more but there werent now you can go to bed in peace said julian to george your father is all right and that means that timmy is all right too probably he has remembered to give timmy a good supper and has had some himself as well well timmy would soon remind him if he forgot to feed him thats one thing said george slipping out of the room good night dick good night ju see you in the morning and back she went to her own bed and snuggled down under the sheets it was queer not to have timmy on her feet she tossed about for a while missing him and then fell asleep quite suddenly she dreamed of her island she was there with timmy and they were discovering ingots of gold down in the dungeon what a lovely dream next morning dawned bright and sunny again the april sky was as blue as the forgetmenots coming out in the garden george gazed out of the diningroom window at breakfasttime wondering if timmy was runfling about her island dreaming about tim said julian with a laugh never mind youll soon see him george another hour or so and youll feast your eyes on him through the coastguards telescope do you really think youll be able to make out tim if hes in the tower with your father at half past ten asked her mother i shouldnt have thought you would be able to yes i shall mother said george its a very powerful telescope you know ill just go up and make my bed then ill go up the cliffpath anyone else coming i want anne to help me with some turning out said her mother im looking out some old clothes to give to the vicars wife for her jumble sale you dont mind helping me anne do you no id like to said anne at once what are the boys going to do i think i must do a bit of my holiday work this morning said julian with a sigh i dont want to but ive kept on putting it off youd better do some too dick you know what you are youll leave it all to the last day if youre not careful all right ill do some too said dick you wont mind scooting up to the coastguards cottage alone will you george not a bit said george ill come back just after half past ten as soon as ive spotted timmy and father she disappeared to make her bed julian and dick went to fetch some books anne went to make her bed too and then came down to help her aunt in a few minutes george yelled goodbye and rushed out of the house what a hurricane said her mother it seems as if george never walks if she can possibly run now anne put the clothes in three piles the very old the not so old and the quite nice just before half past ten julian went up to his window to watch for the signal from his uncle he waited patiently a few seconds after the hallhour the flashes came one two three four five six good now george would settle down for the day perhaps they could go to the quarry in the afternoon julian went back to his books and was soon buried in them with dick grunting by his side at about five minutes to eleven there was the sound of running feet and panting breath george appeared at the door of the sittingroom where the two boys were doing their work they looked up george was red in the face and her hair was windblown she fought to get her breath enough to speak julian dick somethings happened timmy wasnt there what do you mean said julian in surprise george slumped down on a chair still panting the boys could see that she was trembling too its serious julian i tell you timmy wasnt in the tower when the signals came well it only means that your absentminded father forgot to take him up with him said julian in his most sensible voice what did you see i had my eye glued to the telescope said george and suddenly i saw someone come into the little glass room at the top i looked for timmy of course at once but i tell you he wasnt there the six flashes came the man disappeared and that was all no timmy oh i do feel so dreadfully worried julian well dont be said julian soothingly honestly im sure thats what happened your father forgot about timmy anyway if you saw him obviously things are all right im not thinking about father cried george he must he all right if he flashed his signals im thinking about timmy why even if father forgot to take him hed go with him you know that your father might have shut the door at the bottom and prevented timmy from going up said dick he might said george frowning she hadnt thought of that oh dear now i shall worry all day long why didnt i stay with timmy what shall i do now wait till tomorrow morning said dick then probably youll see old tim all right tomorrow morning why thats ages away said poor george she put her head in her hands and groaned oh nobody understands how much i love timmy you would perhaps if you had a dog of your own julian its an awful feeling really oh timmy are you all right of course hes all right said julian impatiently do pull yourself together george i feel as if somethings wrong said george looking obstinate julian i think id better go across to the island no said julian at once dont be idiotic george nothing is wrong except that your fathers been forgetful hes sent his ok signal thats enough youre not to go and create a scene over there with him that would be disgraceful well ill try and be patient said george unexpectedly meek she got up looking worried julian spoke in a kinder voice cheer up old thing you do like to go off the deep end dont you chapter fifteen in the middle of the night george did not moan any more about her worries she went about with an anxious look in her blue eyes but she had the sense not to tell her mother how worried she was at not seeing timmy in the glass room when her father signalled she mentioned it of course but her mother took the same view as julian did there i knew hed forget to take timmy up hes so very forgetful when hes at work the children decided to go to the quarry that afternoon and explore the tunnel under the shelf of rock so they set off after their lunch but when they came to the quarry they did not dare to climb down the steep sides the heavy rain of the day before had made them far too dangerous look said julian pointing to where the bushes and smaller plants were ripped up and crushed i bet thats where old martin fell down yesterday he might have broken his neck yes i vote we dont attempt to go down till its as dry as it was the other day said dick it was disappointing they had brought torches and a rope and had looked forward to a little excitement well what shall we do asked julian im going back home said george unexpectedly im tired you others go for a walk anne looked at george she did seem rather pale ill come back with you george said anne slipping her hand through her cousins arm but george shook it off no thanks anne i want to be alone well well go over the cliff then said julian itll be nice and blowy up there see you later george they went off george turned and sped back to kirrin a cottage her mother was out joanna was upstairs in her bedroom george went to the larder and took several things from it she bundled them into a bag and then fled out of the house she found james the fisherboy james youre not to tell a soul im going over to kirrin island tonight because im worried about timmy we left him there have my boat ready at ten oclock james was always ready to do anything in the world for george he nodded and asked no questions at all right miss itll be ready anything you want put in it yes this bag said george now dont split on me james ill be back tomorrow if i find tims all right she fled back to the house she hoped joanna would not notice the things she had taken from the larder shelf i cant help it if what im doing is wrong she kept whispering to herself i know something isnt right with timmy and im not at all sure about father either he wouldnt have forgotten his solemn promise to me about taking timmy up with him ill have to go across to the island i cant help it if its wrong the others wondered what was up with george when they came back from their walk she was so fidgety and restless they had tea and then did some gardening for aunt fanny george did some too but her thoughts were far away and twice her mother had to stop her pulling up seedlings instead of weeds bedtime came the girls got into bed at about a quarter to ten anne was tired and fell asleep at once as soon as george heard her regular breathing she crept quietly out of bed and dressed again she pulled on her warmest jersey got her raincoat rubber boots and a thick rug and tiptoed downstairs out of the side door she went and into the night there was a bit of a moon in the sky so it was not as dark as usual george was glad she would be able to see her way through the rocks a little now though she was sure she could guide the boat even in the dark james was waiting for her her boat was ready everythings in said james ill push off now you be careful miss and if you do scrape a rock row like anything in case she fills and sinks ready off went george hearing the laplap of the water against the sides of the boat she heaved a sigh of relief and began to row strongly away from the shore she frowned as she rowed had she brought everything she might want two torches plenty of food a tinopener something to drink a rug to wrap herself in tonight back at kirrin cottage julian lay in bed watching for his uncles signal half past ten now for the signal ah here they were one two three four five six good six and no more he wondered why george hadnt come into his and dicks room to watch for them she had last night he got up padded to me door of georges room and put his head in george he said softly its ok your fathers signals have just come again there was no reply julian heard regular breathing and turned to go back to bed the girls must be asleep already well george couldnt really be worrying much about timmy now then julian got into his bed and soon fell asleep himself he had no idea that georges bed was empty no idea that even now george was battling with the waves that guarded kirrin island it was more difficult than she had expected for the moon did not really give very much light and had an annoying way of going behind a cloud just when she badly needed every scrap of light she could get but deftly and cleverly she managed to make her way through the passage between the hidden rocks thank goodness the tide was high so that most of them were well below the surface at last she swung her boat into the little cove here the water was perfectly calm panting a little george pulled her boat up as far as she could then she stood in the darkness and thought hard what was she going to do she did not know where her fathers hidingplace was but she felt certain the entrance to it must be somewhere in or near the little stone room should she make her way to that yes she would it would be the only place to shelter in for the night anyway she would put on her torch when she got there and hunt round for any likely entrance to the hidingplace if she found it she would go in and what a surprise she would give her father if old timmy was there he would go mad with delight she took the heavy bag draped the rug over her arm and set off she did not dare to put on her torch yet in case the unknown enemy was lurking near after all her father had heard him cough at night george was not frightened she did not even think about being frightened all her thoughts were set on finding timmy and making sure he was safe she came to the little stone room it was pitchdark in there of course not even the faint light of the moon pierced into its blackness george had to put on her torch she put down her bundle at the back of the wall near the old fireplace recess she draped the rug over it and sat down to have a rest switching off her torch after a while she got up cautiously and switched on her torch again she began to search for the hidingplace where could the entrance be she flashed her torch on to every flagstone in the floor of the room but not one looked as if it had been moved or lifted there was nothing to show where there might be an entrance underground she moved round the walls examining those too in the light of her torch no there was no sign that a hidden way lay behind any of those stones either it was most tantalizing if she only knew she went to wrap the rug round her and to sit and think it was cold now she was shivering as she sat there in the dark trying to puzzle out where the hidden entrance could be and then she heard a sound she jumped and then stiffened all over holding her breath painfully what was it there was a curious grating noise then a slight thud it came from the recess where people long ago had built their big log fires george sat perfectly still straining her eyes and ears she saw a beam of light in the fireplace recess then she heard a mans cough was it her father he had a cough at times she listened hard the beam of light grew brighter then she heard another noise it sounded as if someone had jumped down from somewhere and then a voice come on it was not her fathers voice george grew cold with fear then not her fathers voice then what had happened to him and to timmy someone else jumped down into the recess grumbling im not used to this crawling about that wasnt her fathers voice either so there were two unknown enemies not one and they knew her fathers secret workroom george felt almost faint with horror whatever had happened to him and timmy the men walked out of the little stone room without seeing george at all she guessed they were going to the tower how long would they be long enough for her to search for the place they had appeared from she strained her ears again she heard their footsteps going into the great yard she tiptoed to the doorway and looked out yes there was the light of their torch near the tower if they were going up there would be plenty of time to look round she went back into the little stone room her hands were trembling and she found it difficult to switch on her torch she went to the fireplace recess and flashed the light in it she gave a gasp halfway up the recess at the back was a black opening she flashed the light up there evidently there was a movable stone halfway up that swung back and revealed an entrance behind an entrance to what were there steps such as were shown in the old map feeling quite breathless george stood on tiptoe and flashed her light into the hole yes there were steps they went down into the wall at the back she remembered that the little stone room backed on to one of the immensely thick old walls still left she stood there uncertain what to do had she better go down and see if she could find timmy and her father but if she did she might be made a prisoner too on the other hand if she stayed outside and the men came back and shut up the entrance she might not be able to open it she would be worse off than ever ill go down she suddenly decided but id better take my bag and the rug in case the men come back and see them i dont want them to know im on the island if i can help it i could hide them somewhere down there i expect i wonder if this entrance leads to the dungeons she lifted up the rug and the bag and pushed them into the hole she heard the bag roll down the steps the tins inside making a muffled noise then she climbed up herself gracious what a long dark flight of steps wherever did they lead to chapter sixteen down to the caves george went cautiously down the stone steps they were steep and narrow i should think they run right down in the middle of the stone wall thought george goodness heres a narrow bit it was so narrow that she had to go sideways a fat man would never get through there she thought to herself hallo the steps have ended she had got her rug round her shoulders and had picked up her bag on the way down in her other hand she held her torch it was terribly dark and quiet down there george did not feel scared because she was hoping to see timmy at any moment no one could feel afraid with timmy just round the corner ready to welcome them she stood at the bottom of the steps her torch showing her a narrow tunnel it curved sharply to the left now will it join the dungeons from here she wondered trying to get her sense of direction to help her they cant be far off but theres no sign of them at the moment she went on down the narrow tunnel once the roof came down so low she almost had to crawl she flashed her torch on it she saw black rock there which had evidently been too hard to be removed by the tunnel builders long ago the tunnel went on and on and on george was puzzled surely by now she must have gone by all the dungeons why she must be heading towards the shore of the island how very queer didnt this tunnel join the dungeons then a little further and she would be under the bed of the sea itself the tunnel took a deep slope downwards more steps appeared cut roughly from rock george climbed down them cautiously where in the world was she going at the bottom of the steps the tunnel seemed to be cut out of solid rock or else it was a natural passage not made by man at all george didnt know her torch showed her black rocky walls and roof and her feet stumbled over an irregular rocky path how she longed for timmy beside her i must be very deep down she thought pausing to flash her torch round her once more very deep down and very far from the castle good gracious whatevers that awful noise she listened she heard a muffled booming and moaning was it her father doing one of his experiments the noise went on and on a deep neverending boom why i believe its the sea said george amazed she stood and listened again yes it is the sea over my head im under the rocky bed of kirrin bay and now poor george did feel a bit scared she thought of the great waves surging above her she thought of the restless moving water scouring the rocky bed over her head and felt frightened in case the sea should find a way to leak down into her narrow tunnel now dont be silly she told herself sternly this tunnel has been here under the seabed for hundreds of years why should it suddenly become unsafe just when you are in it george talking to herself like this to keep up her spirits she went on again it was very queer indeed to think she was walking under the sea so this was where her father was at work under the sea itself and then george suddenly remembered something he had said to them all the first time they had visited him on the island what was it now oh yes he said he had to have water above and around him said george now i see what he meant his workroom is somewhere down here so the seawater is above him and its all round the tower because its built on an island water above and water around so that was why her father had chosen kirrin island for his experiment how had he found the secret passage under the sea though why even i didnt know of that said george hallo what am i coming to she stopped the passage had suddenly widened out into an enormous dark cave whose roof was unexpectedly high lost in dark shadows george stared round she saw queer things there that she didnt understand at all wires glass boxes little machines that seemed to be at work without a sound whose centres were alive with queer gleaming shivering light sudden sparks shot up now and again and when that happened a funny smell crept round the cave how weird all this is thought george however can father understand all these machines and things i wonder where he is i do hope those men havent made him prisoner somewhere from this queer aladdins cave another tunnel led george switched on her torch again and went into it it was much like the other one but the roof was higher she came to another cave smaller this time and crammed with wires of all kinds there was a curious humming sound here like thousands of bees in a hive george halfexpected to see some flying round it must be these wires making the noise she said there was nobody in the cave at all but it led into another one and george hoped that soon she would find timmy and her father she went into the next cave which was perfectly empty and very cold she shivered then down another passage and into a small cave the first thing she saw beyond this tiny cave was a light a light then perhaps she was coming to the cave her father must be in she flashed her torch round the little cave she was now standing in and saw tins of food bottles of beer tins of sweets and a pile of clothes of some sort ah this was where her father kept his stores she went on to the next cave wondering why timmy had not heard her and come to greet her she looked cautiously into the cave where the light came from sitting at a table his head in his hands perfectly still was her father there was no sign of timmy father said george the man at the table jumped violently and turned round he stared at george as if he really could not believe his eyes then he turned back again and buried his face in his hands father said george again quite frightened because he did not say anything to her he looked round again and this time he got up he stared at george once more and then sat down heavily george ran to him whats the matter oh father whats the matter wheres timmy george is it really you george i thought i must be dreaming when i looked up and saw you said her father how did you get here good gracious its impossible that you should be here father are you all right whats happened and wheres timmy said george urgently she looked all round but could see no sign of him her heart went cold surely nothing awful had happened to timmy did you see two men asked her father where were they oh father we keep asking each other questions and not answering them said george tell me first where is timmy i dont know said her father did those two men go to the tower yes said george father whats happened well if theyve gone to the tower weve got about an hour in peace said her father now listen to me george very carefully this is terribly important im listening said george but do hurry up and tell me about timmy these two men were parachuted down on to the island to try and find out my secret said her father ill tell you what my experiments are for george they are to find a way of replacing all coal coke and oil an idea to give the world all the heat and power it wants and to do away with mines and miners good gracious said george it would be one of the most wonderful things the world has ever known yes said her father and i should give it to the whole world it shall not be in the power of any one country or collection of men it shall be a gift to the whole of mankind but george there are men who want my secret for themselves so that they may make colossal fortunes out of it how hateful cried george go on father how did they hear of it well i was at work on this idea with some of my colleagues my fellowworkers said her father and one of them betrayed us and went to some powerful business men to tell them of my idea so when i knew this i decided to come away in secret and finish my experiments by myself then nobody could betray me and you came here said george to my island yes because i needed water over me and water around me said her father quite by chance i looked at a copy of that old map and thought that if the passage shown there the one leading from the little stone room i mean if the passage there really did lead under the sea as it seemed to show that would be the ideal place to finish my experiments oh father and i made such a fuss said george ashamed to remember how cross she had been did you said her father as if he had forgotten all about that well i got all my stuff and came here and now these fellows have found me and got hold of me poor father cant i help said george i could go back and bring help over here couldnt i yes you could said her father but you mustnt let those men see you george ill do anything you want me to father anything said george but first do tell me whats happened to timmy well he kept by me all the time said her father really hes a wonderful dog george and then this morning just as i was coming out of the entrance in that little room to go up into the tower with timmy to signal the two men pounced on me and forced me back here but what happened to timmy asked george impatiently would her father never tell her what she wanted to know he flew at the men of course said her father but somehow or other one of them lassoed him with a noose of rope and caught him they pulled the rope so tight round his neck that he almost choked oh poor poor timmy said george and the tears ran down her cheek is he do you think hes all right father yes from what i heard the men saying afterwards i think theyve taken him to some cave and shut him in there said her father anyway i saw one of them getting some dogbiscuits out of a bag this evening so that looks as if hes alive and kicking and hungry george heaved a great sigh of relief so long as timmy was alive and all right she took a few steps towards what she thought must be another cave im going to find timmy father she said i must find him chapter seventeen timmy at last no george called her father sharply come back there is something very important i want to say come here george went over to him filled with impatience to get to timmy wherever he was she must find him now listen said her father i have a book in which i have made all my notes of this great experiment the men havent found it i want you to take it safely to the mainland george dont let it out of your sight if the men get hold of it they would have all the information they needed but dont they know everything just by looking at your wires and machines and things asked george they know a very great deal said her father and theyve found out a lot more since theyve been here but not quite enough i darent destroy my book of notes because if anything should happen to me my great idea would be completely lost so george i must entrust it to you and you must take it to an address i will give you and hand it to the person there its an awful responsibility said george a little scared of handling a book which meant so much not only to her father but possibly to the whole of the world but ill do my best father ill hide in one of the caves till the men come back and then ill slip back up the passage to the hidden entrance get out go to my boat and row back to the mainland then ill deliver your book of notes without fail and get help sent over here to you good girl said her father and gave her a hug honestly george you do behave as bravely as any boy im proud of you george thought that was the nicest thing her father had ever said to her she smiled at him well father ill go and see if i can find timmy now i simply must see that hes all right before i go to hide in one of the other caves very well said her father the man who took the biscuits went in that direction still further under the sea george oh by the way how is it youre here in the middle of the night it seemed to strike her father for the first time that george also might have a story to tell but george felt that she really couldnt waste any more time she must find timmy ill tell you later father she said oh wheres that book of notes her father rose and went to the back of the cave he took a box and stood on it he ran his hand along a dark ridge of rock and felt about until he had found what he wanted he brought down a slim book whose pages were of very thin paper he opened the book and george saw many beautifully drawn diagrams and pages of notes in her fathers small neat handwriting here you are said her father handing her the book do the best you can if anything happens to me this book will still enable my fellowworkers to give my idea to the world if i come through this all right i shall be glad to have the book because it will mean i shall not have to work out all my experiments again george took the precious book she stuffed it into her macintosh pocket which was a big one ill keep it safe father now i must go and find timmy or those two men will be back before i can hide in one of the other caves she left her fathers cave and went into the next one there was nothing there at all then on she went down a passage that twisted and turned in the rock and then she heard a sound she longed to hear a whine yes really a whine timmy shouted george eagerly oh timmy im coming timmys whine stopped suddenly then he barked joyously woof woof woof woof george almost fell as she tried to run down the narrow tunnel her torch showed her a big boulder that seemed to be blocking up a small cave in the side of the tunnel behind the boulder timmy barked and scraped frantically george tugged at the stone with all her strength timmy she panted timmy ill get you out im coming oh timmy the stone moved a little george tugged again it was almost too heavy for her to move at all but despair made her stronger than she had ever been in her life the stone quite suddenly swung to one side and george just got one of her feet out of its way in time or it would have been crushed timmy squeezed out of the space left he flung himself on george who fell on the ground with her arms tight round him he licked her face and whined and she buried her nose in his thick fur in joy timmy what have they done to you timmy i came as soon as i could timmy whined again and again in joy and tried to paw and lick george as if he couldnt have enough of her it would have been difficult to say which of the two was the happier at last george pushed timmy away firmly timmy weve got work to do weve got to escape from here and get across to the mainland and bring help woof said timmy george stood up and flashed her torch into the tiny cave where timmy had been she saw that there was a bowl of water there and some biscuits the men had not illtreated him then except to lasso him and halfchoke him when they caught him she felt round his neck tenderly but except for a swollen ridge there he seemed none the worse now hurry up well go back to fathers cave and then find another cave beyond his to hide in till the two men come back from the tower then well creep out into the little stone room and row back to the mainland said george ive got a very very important book here in my pocket timmy timmy growled suddenly and the hairs on the back of his neck rose up george stiffened and stood listening a stern voice came down the passage i dont know who you are or where youve come from but if you have dared to let that dog loose hell be shot and to show you that i mean what i say heres something to let you know ive a revolver then there came a deafening crash as the man pulled the trigger and a bullet hit the roof somewhere in the passage timmy and george almost jumped out of their skins timmy would have leapt up the passage at once but george had her hand on his collar she was very frightened and tried hard to think what was best to do the echoes of the shot went on and on it was horrid timmy stopped growling and george stayed absolutely still well said the voice did you hear what i said if that dog is loose hell be shot im not having my plans spoilt now and you whoever you are will please come up the tunnel and let me see you but i warn you if the dogs with you thats the end of him timmy timmy run away and hide somewhere whispered george suddenly and then she remembered something else that filled her with despair she had her fathers precious book of notes with her in her pocket suppose the man found it on her it would break her fathers heart to know that his wonderful secret had been stolen from him after all george hurriedly took the thin flat little book from her pocket she pushed it at timmy put it in your mouth take it with you tim and go and hide till its safe to come quick go timmy go ill be all right to her great relief timmy with the book in his mouth turned and disappeared down the tunnel that led further under the sea how she hoped he would find a safe hiding place the tunnel must end soon but maybe before it did timmy would settle down in some dark corner and wait for her to call him again will you come up the passage or not shouted the voice angrily youll be sorry if i have to come and fetch you because i shall shoot all the way along im coming called george in a small voice and she went up the passage she soon saw a beam of light and in a moment she was in the flash of a powerful torch there was a surprised exclamation good heavens a boy what are you doing here and where did you come from georges short curly hair made the man with the torch think she was a boy and george did not tell him he was wrong the man held a revolver but he let it drop as he saw george i only came to rescue my dog and to find my father said george in a meek voice well you cant move that heavy stone said the man a kid like you wouldnt have the strength and you cant rescue your father either weve got him prisoner as you no doubt saw yes said george delighted to think that the man was sure she had not been strong enough to move the big stone she wasnt going to say a word about timmy if the man thought he was still shut up in that tiny cave well and good then she heard her fathers voice anxiously calling from somewhere beyond the man george is that you are you all right yes father shouted back george hoping that he would not ask anything about timmy the man beckoned her to come to him then he pushed her in front of him and they walked to her fathers cave ive brought your boy back said the man silly little idiot thinking he could set that savage dog free weve got him penned up in a cave with a big boulder in front another man came in from the opposite end of the cave he was amazed to see george the other man explained when i got down here i heard a noise out beyond this cave the dog barking and someone talking to him and found this kid there trying to set the dog free id have shot the dog of course if he had been freed but how did this boy get here asked the other man still amazed maybe he can tell us that said the other and then for the first time georges father heard how george had got there and why she told them how she had watched for timmy in the glass room of the tower and hadnt seen him and that had worried her and made her suspicious so she had come across to the island in her boat at night and had seen where the men came from she had gone down the tunnel and kept on till she came to the cave where she had found her father the three men listened in silence well youre a tiresome nuisance one of the men said to george but my word youre a son to be proud of its not many boys would have been brave enough to run so much risk for anyone yes im really proud of you george said her father he looked at her anxiously she knew what he was thinking what about his precious book had she been sensible enough to hide it she id not dare to let him know anything while the men were there now this complicates matters said the other man looking at george if you dont go back home youll soon be missed and there will be all kinds of search parties going on and maybe someone will send over to the island here to tell your father you have disappeared we dont want anyone here at present not till we know what we want to know he turned to georges father if you will tell us what we want to know and give us all your notes we will set you free give you whatever sum of money you ask us for and disappear ourselves and if i still say i wont said georges father then i am afraid we shall blow up the whole of your machines and the tower and possibly you will never be found again because you will be buried down here said the man in a voice that was suddenly very hard there was a dead silence george looked at her father you couldnt do a thing like that he said at last you would gain nothing by it at all its all or nothing with us said the man all or nothing make up your mind well give you till half past ten tomorrow morning about seven hours then either you tell us everything or we blow the island skyhigh they went out of the cave and left george and her father together only seven hours and then perhaps the end of kirrin island chapter eighteen half past four in the morning as soon as the men were out of earshot georges father spoke in a low voice its no good ill have to let them have my book of notes i cant risk having you buried down here george i dont mind anything for myself workers of my sort have to be ready to take risks all their lives but its different now youre here father i havent got the book of notes whispered george thankfully i gave them to timmy i did manage to get that stone away from the entrance to his little prison though the men think i didnt i gave the book to timmy and told him to go and hide till i fetched him fine work george said her father well perhaps if you got timmy now and brought him here he could deal with these two men before they suspect he is free he is quite capable of getting them both down on the ground at once oh yes its our only chance said george ill go and get him now ill go a little way along the passage and whistle father why didnt you go and try and rescue timmy i didnt want to leave my book said her father i dared not take it with me in case the men came after me and found it theyve been looking in all the caves for it i couldnt bear to leave it here and go and look for the dog i was sure he was all right when i saw the men taking biscuits out of the bag now do go george and whistle to timmy the men may be back at any moment george took her torch and went into the passage that led to the little cave where timmy had been she whistled loudly and then waited but no timmy came she whistled again and then went further along the passage still no timmy she called him loudly timmy timmy come here but timmy did not come there was no sound of scampering feet no joyful bark oh bother thought george i hope he hasnt gone so far away that he cant hear me ill go a little further so she made her way along the tunnel past the cave where timmy had been and then on down the tunnel again still no timmy george rounded a corner and then saw that the tunnel split into three three different passages all dark silent and cold oh dear she didnt in the least know which to take she took the one on the left but that also split into three a little way on george stopped i shall get absolutely lost in this maze of passages under the sea if i go on she thought i simply darent its too frightening timmy timmy her voice went echoing along the passage and sounded very queer indeed she retraced her steps and went right back to her fathers cave feeling miserable father theres no sign of timmy at all he must have gone along one of the passages and got lost oh dear this is awful there are lots of tunnels beyond this cave it seems as if the whole rocky bed of the sea is mined with tunnels george sat down and looked very downhearted quite likely said her father well thats a perfectly good plan gone wrong we must try and think of another i do wonder what julian and the others will think when they wake up and find me gone said george suddenly they might even come and try to find me here that wouldnt be much good said her father then well simply come down here and wait and nobody will know where we are the others dont know of the entrance in the little stone room do they no said george if they came over here im sure theyd never find it weve looked before and that would mean theyd be blown up with the island father this is simply dreadful if only we knew where timmy was said her father or if we could get a message to julian to tell him not to come whats the time my word its half past three in the early morning i suppose julian and the others are still asleep julian was fast asleep so was anne dick was in a deep sleep as well so nobody guessed that georges bed was empty but about half past four anne awoke feeling very hot really must open the window she thought im boiling she got up and went to the window she opened it and stood looking out the stars were out and the bay one faintly george whispered anne are you awake she listened for a reply but none came then she listened more intently why she couldnt even hear georges breathing surely george was there she felt over georges bed it was flat and empty she switched on the light and looked at it georges pyjamas were still on the bed her clothes were gone george has gone to the island said anne in a fright in the dark by herself she went to the boys room she felt about julians bed for his shoulder and shook him hard he woke up with a jump what is it whats up julian george is gone her beds not been slept in whispered anne her whisper awoke dick and soon both boys were sitting up wide awake blow i might have guessed shed do a fool thing like that said julian in the middle of the night too and all those dangerous rocks to row round now what are we going to do about it i told her she wasnt to go to the island timmy would be quite all right i expect uncle quentin forgot to take him up to the tower with him yesterday thats all she might have waited till half past ten this morning then she would probably have seen him well we cant do anything now i suppose can we said anne anxiously not a thing said julian ive no doubt shes safely on kirrin island by now making a fuss of timmy and having a good old row with uncle quentin really george is the limit they talked for half an hour and then julian looked at his watch five oclock wed better try and get a bit more sleep aunt fanny will be worried in the morning when she hears of georges latest escapade anne went back to her room she got into bed and fell asleep julian could not sleep he kept thinking of george and wondering where exactly she was wouldnt he give her a talkingto when she came back he suddenly heard a peculiar noise downstairs whatever could it be it sounded like someone climbing in at a window was there one open yes the window of the little washplace might be open crash what in the world was that it couldnt be a burglar no burglar would be foolish enough to make such a noise there was a sound on the stairs and then the bedroom door was pushed open in alarm julian put out his hand to switch on the light but before he could do so something heavy jumped right on top of him he yelled and dick woke up with a jump he put on the light and then julian saw what was on his bed timmy timmy how did you get here wheres george timmy is it really you timmy echoed dick amazed has george brought him back then is she here too anne came in wakened by the noise why timmy oh julian is george back too then no apparently not said julian puzzled i say tim whats this youve got in your mouth drop it old chap drop it timmy dropped it julian picked it up from the bed its a book of notes all in uncles handwriting what does this mean how did timmy get hold of it and why did he bring it here its most extraordinary nobody could imagine why timmy had suddenly appeared with the book of notes and no george its very queer said julian theres something i dont understand here lets go and wake aunt fanny so they went and woke her up telling her all they knew she was very worried indeed to hear that george was gone she picked up the book of notes and knew at once that it was very important i must put this into the safe she said i know this is valuable how did timmy get hold of it timmy was acting queerly he kept pawing at julian and whining he had been very pleased to see everyone but he seemed to have something on his mind what is it old boy asked dick how did you get here you didnt swim because youre not wet if you came in a boat it must have been with george and yet youve left her behind i think somethings happened to george said anne suddenly i think timmy keeps pawing you to tell you to go with him and find her perhaps she brought him back in the boat and then was terribly tired and fell asleep on the beach or something we ought to go and see yes i think we ought said julian aunt fanny would you like to wake joanna and get something hot ready in case we find george is tired out and cold well go down to the beach and look it will soon be daylight now the eastern sky is just beginning to show its first light well go and dress then said aunt fanny still looking very worried indeed oh what a dreadful family ive got always in some scrape or other the three children began to dress timmy watched them waiting patiently till they were ready then they all went downstairs and out of doors julian turned towards the beach but timmy stood still he pawed at dick and then ran a few steps in the opposite direction why he doesnt want us to go to the beach he wants us to go another way cried julian in surprise all right timmy you lead the way and well follow chapter nineteen a meeting with martin timmy ran round the house and made for the moor behind it was most extraordinary wherever was he going this is awfully queer said julian im sure george cant be anywhere in this direction timmy went on swiftly occasionally turning his head to make sure everyone was following him he led the way to the quarry the quarry did george come here then said dick but why the dog disappeared down into the middle of the quarry slipping and sliding down the steep sides as he went the others followed as best they could luckily it was not as slippery as before and they reached the bottom without accident timmy went straight to the shelf of rock and disappeared underneath it they heard him give a short sharp bark as if to say come on this is the way hurry up hes gone into the tunnel under there said dick where we thought we might explore and didnt there must be a passage or something there then but is george there ill go first said julian and wriggled through the hole he was soon in the wider bit and then came out into the part where he could almost stand he walked a little way in the dark hearing timmy bark impatiently now and then but in a moment or two julian stopped its no good trying to follow you in the dark timmy he called well have to go back and get torches i cant see a foot in front of me dick was just struggling through the first part of the hole julian called to him to go back its too dark he said we must go and get torches if george for some reason is up this passage she must have had an accident and wed better get a rope and some brandy anne began to cry she didnt like the idea of george lying hurt in that dark passage julian put his arm round her as soon as he was in the open air again he helped her up the sides of the quarry followed by dick now dont worry well get her all right but it beats me why she went there and i still cant imagine how tim and she came from the island if they are here instead of on the beach look theres martin suddenly said dick in surprise so there was he was standing at the top of the quarry and seemed just as surprised to see them as they were to see him youre up early called dick and goodness me are you going gardening or something why the spades martin looked sheepish and didnt seem to know what to say julian suddenly walked up to him and caught hold of his shoulder look here martin theres some funny business going on here what are you going to do with those spades have you seen george do you know where she is or anything about her come on tell me martin shook his shoulder away from julians grip looking extremely surprised george no whats happened to him george isnt a him shes a her said anne still crying shes disappeared we thought shed gone to the island to find her dog and timmy suddenly appeared at kirrin cottage and brought us here so it looks as if george might be somewhere near here said julian and i want to know if youve seen her or know anything of her whereabouts no julian i swear i dont said martin well tell me what youre doing here so early in the morning with spades said julian roughly who are you waiting for your father yes said martin and what are you going to do asked dick going exploring up the hole there yes said martin again sullen and worried no harm in that is there its all very queer said julian eyeing him and speaking slowly and loudly but let me tell you this were going exploring not you if theres anything queer up that hole well find it we shall not allow you or your father to get through the hole so go and find him and tell him that martin didnt move he went very white and stared at julian miserably anne went up to him tears still on her face and put her hand on his arm martin what is it why do you look like that whats the mystery and then to the dismay and horror of everyone martin turned away with a noise that sounded very like a sob he stood with his back to them his shoulders shaking good gracious what is up said julian in exasperation pull yourself together martin tell us whats worrying you everything everything said martin in a muffled voice then he swung round to face them you dont know what it is to have no mother and no father nobody who cares about you and then but you have got a father said dick at once i havent hes not my father that man hes only my guardian but he makes me call him father whenever were on a job together a job what sort of job said julian oh any kind all beastly said martin snooping round and finding things out about people and then getting money from them if we promise to say nothing and receiving stolen goods and selling them and helping people like the men who are after your uncles secret oho said dick at once now were coming to it i thought you and mr curton were both suspiciously interested in kirrin island whats this present job then my guardian will halfkill me for telling all this said martin but you see theyre planning to blow up the island and its about the worst thing ive ever been mixed up in and i know your uncle is there and perhaps george too now you say i cant go on with it a few more tears ran down his cheeks it was awful to see a boy crying like that and the three felt sorry for martin now they were also full of horror when they heard him say that the island was to be blown up how do you know this asked julian well mr curtons got a wireless receiver and transmitter as you know explained martin and so have the fellows on the island the ones who are after your uncles secret so they can easily keep in touch with one another they mean to get the secret if they can if not they are going to blow the whole place skyhigh so that nobody can get the secret but they cant get away by boat because they dont know the way through those rocks well how will they get away then demanded julian we feel sure this hole that timmy found the other day leads down to the sea and under the seabed to kirrin island said martin yes i know it sounds too mad to be true but mr curtons got an old map which clearly shows there was once a passage under the seabed if there is well the fellows across on the island can escape down it after making all preparations for the island to be blown up see yes said julian taking a long breath i do see i see it all very clearly now see something else too timmy has found his way from the island using that same passage you have just told us about and thats why hes led us back here to take us to the island and rescue uncle quentin and george there was a deep silence martin stared at the ground dick and julian thought hard anne sobbed a little it all seemed quite unbelievable to her then julian put his hand on martins arm martin you did right to tell us we may be able to prevent something dreadful but you must help we may need those spades of yours and i expect youve got torches too we havent we dont want to waste time going back and getting them so will you come with us and help us will you lend us those spades and torches would you trust me said martin in a low voice yes i want to come and help you and if we get in now my guardian wont be able to follow because he wont have a torch we can get to the island and bring your unde and george safely back good for you said dick well come on then weve been talking far too long come on down again ju hand him a spade and torch martin anne youre not to come said julian to his little sister youre to go back and tell aunt fanny whats happened will you do that yes i dont want to come said anne ill go back з now do be careful julian she climbed down with the boys and then stood and watched till all three had disappeared into the hole timmy who had been waiting impatiently during the talking barking now and again was glad to find that at last they were going to make a move he ran ahead in the tunnel his eyes gleaming green every time he turned to see if they were following anne began to climb up the steep side of the quarry again then thinking she heard a cough she stopped and crouched under a bush she peered through the leaves and saw mr curton then she heard his voice martin where on earth are you so he had come to look for martin and go up the tunnel with him anne hardly dared to breathe mr curton called again and again then made an impatient noise and began to climb down the side of the quarry suddenly he slipped he clutched at a bush as he passed but it gave way he rolled quite near anne and caught sight of her he looked astonished but then his look became one of fear as he rolled more and more quickly to the bottom of the deep quarry anne heard him give a deep groan as at last he came to a stop anne peered down in fright mr curtin was sitting up holding one of his legs and groaning he looked up to see if he could spy anne anne he called ive broken my leg i think can you fetch help what are you doing here so early have you seen martin anne did not answer if he had broken his leg then he couldnt go after the others and anne could get away quickly she climbed carefully afraid of rolling down to the bottom and having to lie beside the horrid mr curton anne have you seen martin look for him and get help for me will you shouted mr curton and then groaned again anne climbed to the top of the quarry and looked down she cupped her hands round her mouth and shouted loudly youre a very wicked man i shant fetch help for you i simply cant bear you arid having got all that off her chest the little girl shot off at top speed over the moor i must tell aunt fanny shell know what to do oh i hope the others are safe what shall we do if the island blows up im glad glad glad i told mr curton be was very wicked man and on she ran panting aunt fanny would know what to do chapter twenty everything boils up meanwhile the three boys and timmy were having a strange journey underground timmy led the way without faltering stopping every now and again for the others to catch up with him the tunnel at first had a very low roof and the boys had to walk along in a stooping position which was very tiring indeed but after a bit the roof became higher and julian flashing his torch round saw that the walls and floor instead of being made of soil were now made of rock he tried to reckon out where they were weve come practically straight towards the cliff he said to dick thats allowing for a few turns and twists the tunnel has sloped down so steeply the last few hundred yards that i think we must be very far underground indeed it was not until the boys heard the curious booming noise that george had heard in the caves that they knew they must be under the rocky bed of the sea they were walking under the sea to kirrin island how strange how unbelievably astonishing its like a peculiarly vivid dream said julian im not sure i like it very much all right tim were coming hallo whats this they all stopped julian flashed his torch ahead and saw a pile of fallen rocks timmy had managed to squeeze himself through a hole in them and go through to the other side but the boys couldnt this is where the spades come in martin said dick cheerfully take a hand by dint of pushing and shovelling the boys at last managed to move the pile of fallen rocks enough to make a way past thank goodness for the spades said julian they went on and were soon very glad of the spades again to move another heap of rock timmy barked impatiently when they kept him waiting he was very anxious to get back to george soon they came to where the tunnel forked into two but timmy took the righthand passage without hesitation and when that one forked into three he again chose one without stopping to think for one moment marvellous isnt he said julian all done by smell hes been this way once so he knows it again we should be completely lost under here if we came by ourselves martin was not enjoying this adventure at all he said very little but labored on after the others dick guessed he was worrying about what was going to happen when the adventure was over poor martin all he wanted to do was to draw and instead of that he had been dragged into one horrible job after another and used as a catspaw by his evil guardian do you think were anywhere near the island said dick at last im getting tired of this yes we must be said julian in fact i think wed better be as quiet as we can in case we come suddenly on the enemy so without speaking again they went as quietly as they could and then suddenly they saw a faint light ahead of them julian put out his hand to stop the others they were nearing the cave where georges father had his books and papers where george had found him the night before timmy stood in front of them listening too he was not going to run headlong into danger they heard voices and listened intently to see whose they were georges and uncle quentins said julian at last and as if timmy had also satisfied himself that those were indeed the two voices the dog ran ahead and went into the lighted cave barking joyfully timmy came georges voice and they heard something overturn as she sprang up where have you been woof said timmy trying to explain woof and then julian and dick ran into the cave followed by martin uncle quentin and george stared in the very greatest amazement julian dick and martin how did you get here cried george whilst timmy jumped and capered round her ill explain said julian it was timmy that fetched us and he related the whole story of how timmy had come into kirrin cottage in the early morning and had jumped on his bed and all that had happened since and then in their turn uncle quentin and george told all that had happened to them where are the two men asked julian somewhere on the island said george i went scouting after them some time ago and followed them up to where they get out into the little stone room i think theyre there until half past ten when theyll go up and signal so that people will think everything is all right well what are our plans said julian will you come back down the passage under the sea with us or what shall we do better not do that said martin quickly my guardian may be coming and hes in touch with other men if he wonders where i am and thinks something is up he may call in two or three others and we might meet them making their way up the passage they did not know of course that mr curton was even then lying with a broken leg at the bottom of the quarry uncle quentin considered ive been given seven hours to say whether or not i will give the fellows my secret he said that time will be up just after half past ten then the men will come down again to see me i think between us we ought to be able to capture them especially as weve got timmy with us yes thats a good idea said julian we could hide somewhere till they come and then set timmy on them before they suspect anything almost before he had finished these words the light in the cave went out then a voice spoke out of the blackness keep still one movement and ill shoot george gasped what was happening had the men come back unexpectedly oh why hadnt timmy given them warning she had been fondling his ears so probably he had been unable to hear anything she held timmys collar afraid that he would fly at the man in the darkness and be shot the voice spoke again will you or will you not give us your secret not said uncle quentin in a low voice you will have this whole island and all your work blown up then and yourself too and the others yes you can do what you like suddenly yelled george youll be blown up yourself too youll never be able to get away in a boat youll go on the rocks the man in the darkness laughed we shall be safe he said now keep at the back of the cave i have you covered with my revolver they all crouched at the back timmy growled but george made him stop at once she did not know if the men knew he was free or not quiet footsteps passed across the cave in the darkness george listened straining her ears two pairs of foot steps both men were passing through the cave she knew where they were going they were going to escape by the undersea passage and leave the island to be blown up behind them as soon as the footsteps had died away george switched on her torch father those men are escaping now down the seatunnel we must escape too but not that way my boat is on the shore lets get there quickly and get away before theres any explosion yes come along said her father but if only i could get up into my tower i could stop any wicked plan of theirs they mean to use the power there i know but if i could get up to the glass room i could undo all their plans oh do be quick then father cried george getting in quite a panic now save my island if you can they all made their way through the cave up to the passage that led to the stone flight of steps from the little stone room and there they had a shock the stone could not be opened from the inside the men had altered the mechanism so that it could now only be opened from the outside in vain uncle quentin swung the lever to and fro nothing happened the stone would not move its only from outside it can be opened he said in despair were trapped they sat down on the stone steps in a row one above the other they were cold hungry and miserable what could they do now make their way back to the cave and then go on down the undersea tunnel i dont want to do that said uncle quentin im so afraid that if there is an explosion it may crack the rocky bed of the sea which is the roof of the tunnel and then water would pour in it wouldnt be pleasant if we happened to be thereat that moment oh no dont lets be trapped like that said george with a shudder i couldnt bear it perhaps i could get something to explode this stone away said her father after a while ive got plenty of stuff if only ive time to put it together listen said julian suddenly i can hear something outside this wall sh they all listened intently timmy whined and scratched at the stone that would not move its voices cried dick lots of them who can it be be quiet said julian fiercely we must find out i know i know said george suddenly its the fishermen who have come over in their boats thats why the men didnt wait till half past ten thats why theyve gone in such a hurry they saw the fisherboats coming then anne must have brought them cried dick she must have run home to aunt fanny told her everything and given the news to the fishermen and theyve come to rescue us anne anne were here timmy began to bark deafeningly the others encouraged him because they felt certain that timmys bark was louder than their shouts woof woof woof anne heard the barking and the shouting as soon as she ran into the little stone room where are you where are you she yelled here here move the stone yelled julian shouting so loudly that everyone near him jumped violently move aside miss i can see which stone it is said a mans deep voice it was one of the fishermen he felt round and about the stone in the recess sure it was the right one because it was cleaner than the others through being used as an entrance suddenly he touched the right place and found a tiny iron spike he pulled it down and the lever swung back behind it and pulled the stone aside everyone hurried out one on top of the other the six fishermen standing in the little room stared in astonishment aunt fanny was there too and anne aunt fanny ran to her husband as soon as he appeared but to her surprise he pushed her away quite roughly he ran out of the room and hurried to the tower was he in time to save the island and everyone on it oh hurry hurry chapter twentyone the end of the adventure wheres he gone said aunt fanny quite hurt nobody answered julian george and martin were watching the tower with anxious intensity if only uncle quentin would appear at the top ah there he was he had taken up with him a big stone as everyone watched he smashed the glass round the tower with the stone crash crash crash the wires that ran through the glass were broken and split as the glass crashed into pieces no power could race through them now uncle quentin leaned out of the broken glass room and shouted exultantly its all right i was in time ive destroyed the power that might have blown up the island youre safe george found that her knees were suddenly shaking she had to sit down on the floor timmy came and licked her face wonderingly then he too sat down whats he doing smashing the tower up asked a burly fisherman i dont understand all this uncle quentin came down the tower and rejoined them another ten minutes and i should have been too late he said thank goodness anne you all arrived when you did i ran all the way home told aunt fanny and we got the fishermen to come over as soon as they could get out their boats explained anne we couldnt think of any other way of rescuing you where are the wicked men trying to escape down the undersea tunnel said julian oh you dont know about that anne arid he told her while the fishermen listened openmouthed look here said uncle quentin when he had finished as the boats are here the men might as well take all my gear back with them ive finished my job here i shant want the island any more oh then we can have it said george delighted and theres plenty of the holidays left well help to bring up what you want father we ought to get back as quickly as we can so as to catch those fellows at the other end of the tunnel sir said one of the fishermen yes we ought said aunt fanny gracious theyll find mr curton there with a broken leg said anne suddenly remembering the others looked at her in surprise this was the first they had heard of mr curton being in the quarry anne explained and i told him he was a very wicked man she ended triumphantly quite right said uncle quentin with a laugh well perhaps wed better get my gear another time oh two of us can see to that for you now said the burly fisherman miss george here shes got her boat in the cove and youve got yours sir the others can go back with you if you like and tom and me well fix up your things and bring them across to the mainland later on save us coming over again sir right said uncle quentin pleased you do that then its down in the caves through that tunnel behind the stone they all went down to the cove it was a beautiful day and the sea was very calm except just round the island where the waters were always rough soon the boats were being sailed or rowed to the mainland the adventure is over said anne how queer i didnt think it was one while it was happening but now i see it was another to add to our long list of adventures said julian cheer up martin dont look so blue whatever happens well see you dont come out badly over this you helped us and you threw in your lot with us well see that you dont suffer wont we uncle quentin wed never have got through those falls of rock if we hadnt had martin and his spades well thanks said martin if you can get me away from my guardian and never let me see him again id be happy its quite likely that mr curton will be put somewhere safe where he wont be able to see his friends for quite a long time said uncle quentin dryly so i dont think you need worry as soon as the boats reached shore julian dick timmy and uncle quentin went off to the quarry to see if mr curton was still there and to wait for the other two men to come out of the tunnel mr curton was there all right still groaning and calling for help uncle quentin spoke to him sternly we know your part in this matter curton you will be dealt with by the police they will be along in a short while timmy sniffed round mr curton and then walked away nose in air as if to say what a nasty bit of work the others arranged themselves at the mouth of the hole and waited but nobody came an hour went by two hours still nobody im glad martin and anne didnt come said uncle quentin i do wish wed brought sandwiches at that moment the police arrived scrambling down the steep sides of the quarry the police doctor was with them and he saw to mr curtons leg then with the help of the others he got the man to the top with great difficulty julian go back and get sandwiches said uncle quentin at last it looks as if weve got a long wait julian went back and was soon down the quarry with neat packets of ham sandwiches and a thermos of hot coffee the two policemen who were still left offered to stay and watch if uncle quentin wanted to go home dear me no he said i want to see the faces of these two fellows when they come out its going to be one of the nicest moments of my life the island is not blown up my secret is safe my book is safe my work is finished and i just want to tell these things to my two dear friends you know father i believe theyve lost their way underground said george julian said there were many different passages timmy took the boys through the right ones of course but they would have been quite lost if they hadnt had him with them her fathers face fell at the thought of the men being lost underground he did so badly want to see their dismayed faces when they arrived in the quarry we could send timmy in said julian he would soon find them and bring them out wouldnt you tim woof said timmy agreeing oh yes thats a good idea said george they wont hurt him if they think he can show them the way out go on in timmy find them boy find them bring them here woof said timmy obligingly and disappeared under the shelf of rock everyone waited munching sandwiches and sipping coffee and then they heard timmys bark again from underground there was a panting noise then a scraping sound as somebody came wriggling out from under the rock he stood up and then he saw the silent group watching him he gasped good morning johnson said uncle quentin in an amiable voice how are you johnson went white he sat down on the nearby heather you win he said i do said uncle quentin in fact i win handsomely your little plan went wrong my secret is still safe and next year it will be given to the whole world there was another scraping sound and the second man arrived he stood up too and then he saw the quietly watching group good morning peters said uncle quentin so nice to see you again how did you like your underground walk we found it better to come by sea peters looked at johnson and he too sat down suddenly whats happened he said to johnson its all up said johnson then timmy appeared wagging his tail and went to george i bet they were glad when timmy came up to them said julian johnson looked at him yes we were lost in those hateful tunnels curton said hed come to meet us but he never came no hes probably in the prison hospital by now with a broken leg said uncle quentin well constable do your duty both men were at once arrested then the whole company made their way back over the moor the two men were put into a police car and driven off the rest of the company went into kirrin cottage to have a good meal im most terribly hungry said george joanna have you got anything nice for breakfast not much said joanna from the kitchen only bacon and eggs and mushrooms oooh said anne joanna you shall have the obcbe and what may that be cried joanna but anne couldnt remember its a decoration she cried well im not a christmas tree shouted back joanna you come and help with the breakfast it was a very jolly breakfast that the seven of them no eight for timmy must certainly be counted sat down to martin now that he was free of his guardian became quite a different boy the children made plans for him you can stay with the coastguard because he likes you he kept on and on saying you werent a bad boy and you can come and play with us and go to the island and uncle quentin will see if he can get you into an artschool he says you deserve a reward for helping to save his wonderful secret martin glowed with pleasure it seemed as if a load had fallen away from his shoulders ive never had a chance till now he said ill make good you see if i dont mother can we go and stay on kirrin island and watch the tower being taken down tomorrow begged george do say yes and can we stay there a whole week we can sleep in that little room as we did before well i suppose you can said her mother smiling at georges eager face id rather like to have your father to myself for a few days and feed him up a bit oh that reminds me fanny said her husband suddenly i tried some soup you left for me the night before last and my dear it was horrible quite bad oh quentin i told you to pour it away you know i did said his wife distressed it must have been completely bad you really are dreadful they all finished their breakfast at last and went out into the garden they looked across kirrin bay to kirrin island it looked lovely in the morning sun weve had a lot of adventures together said julian more than most children they have been exciting havent they yes they have but now we must say goodbye to the five and to kirrin island too goodbye julian dick george anne and timmy but only timmy hears our goodbye for he has such sharp ears
