 the twins make up their minds one sunny summer afternoon four girls sat on the grass by a tenthscourt drinking lemonade their rackets lay beside them and the six white balls were scattered over the court two of the girls were twins isabel and patricia osullivan were so alike that only a few people could tell which was pat and which was isabel both girls had dark brown wavy hair deep blue eyes and a merry smile and the irish lilt in their voices was very pleasant to hear the twins were staying for two weeks with friends of theirs mary and frances waters the four girls were talking and pat was frowning as she spoke she took up her racket and banged it hard on the grass its just too bad that mummy wont let us go to the same school as you now that we have all left redroofs school together weve been friends so long and now weve got to go to a different school and we shant see each other for ages its a pity that redroofs only takes girls up to fourteen said isabel we could have stayed on together and it would have been fun i loved being headgirl with pat the last year and it was fun being tenniscaptain and pat being hockeycaptain now weve got to go to another school that doesnt sound a bit nice and begin at the bottom well be the young ones of the school instead of headgirls i do wish you were coming to ringmere school with us said frances its such a nice exclusive school our mother says you know only girls of rich parents very wellbred go there and you make such nice friends we have a bedroom to ourselves and our own study and we have to wear evening dress at night and they say the food is wonderful and we are going to st clares where anybody can go and the dormitories take six or eight girls and arent nearly as nicely furnished as the maids bedrooms are at home said pat in a disgusted voice i cant imagine why mummy made up her mind to send us there instead of to ringmere said isabel i wonder if she has quite decided were going home tomorrow and well both do our very very best to make her say we can go to ringmere mary and frances well ring you up in the evening and tell you well jump for joy if you have good news said mary after all when youve been headgirls at a marvellous school like redroofs and had your own lovely bedroom and the best study with the best view and a hundred girls looking up to you its awful to have to start again in a school you dont want to go to a bit well do your best to make your parents change their minds said frances come on lets have another set before tea they all jumped up and tossed for partners isabel was a splendid player and had won the tennis championship at redroofs she was really rather proud of her game pat was nearly as good but much preferred hockey they dont play hockey at st clares they play lacrosse said pat dismally silly game lacrosse playing with nets on sticks and catching a ball all the time instead of hitting it thats another thing ill tell mummy that i dont want to play lacrosse after being hockeycaptain the twins thought hard of all the reasons they would put before their parents when they got home the next day they talked about it as they went home in the train ill say this and you say that said pat after all we ought to know the kind of school that would be best for us and st clares does sound too fierce for words so the next evening the girls began to air their thoughts about schools pat began and as was her way she attacked at once mummy and daddy she said isabel and i have been thinking a lot about what school were to go to next and please we dont want to go to st clares every one says its an awful school their mother laughed and their father put down his paper in surprise dont be silly pat said mrs osullivan its a splendid school have you quite decided about it asked isabel not absolutely said her mother but daddy and i both think it will be the best school for you now we do think that redroofs spoilt you a bit you know its a very expensive and luxurious school and nowadays we have to learn to live much more simply st clares is really a very sensible sort of school and i know the head and like her pat groaned a sensible school how i do bate sensible things theyre always horrid and ugly and stupid and uncomfortable oh mummy do let us go to ringmere school with mary and frances certainly not said mrs osullivan at once its a very snobbish school and fm not going to have you two girls coming home and turning up your noses at everything and everybody we wouldnt said isabel frowning at pat to make her stop arguing for a while pat lost her temper very easily and that didnt do when their father was there mummy dear be a pet just lets tryat ringmere for a term or two and then if you think were turning into snobs you can take us away but you might let us try they play hockey there and we do so like that wed hate to have to learn a new game just when weve got so good at hockey mr osullivan rapped with his pipe on the table my dear isabel it will be good for you to start at the beginning again and learn something new ive thought the last year that both you girls have become very conceited and thought far too much of yourselves if you have to learn new things and find youre not so wonderful as you thought you were it will be very good for you both the twins went red they were angry and hurt and almost ready to cry mrs osullivan felt sorry for them daddy doesnt mean to be unkind she said but he is quite right my dears youve had a wonderful time at redroofs bad things all your own way been headgirls and captains and really lived in luxury now you must show us what kind of stuff you are made of when you have to start as youngsters of fourteen and a half in a school where the top classes are eighteen years old pat looked sulky isabels chin shook as she answered we shant be happy and we shant try to be she said very well be unhappy said their father sternly if thats the sort of silly attitude youve learnt at redroofs im sorry we let you stay there so long i wanted to take you away two years ago but you begged so hard to stay that i didnt now say no more about it i shall write to st clares myself tonight and enter you for next term if you want to make me proud of you you will cheer up and make up your minds to be good and hardworking and happy at your next school their father lighted his pipe and began to read his paper again their mother took up her sewing there was no more to be said the twins left the room together and went into the garden they found their own secret place behind the thick old yewhedge and flung themselves down on the ground the evening sun threw its slanting golden rays around them and they blinked in its brightness tears shone in isabels eyes i never thought mummy and daddy would be so hard she said never after all we ought to have some say in the matter said pat furiously she took a stick and dug it hard into the ground i wish we could run away dont be silly said isabel you know we cant anyway its cowardly to run away well have to go to st clams but how i shall hate it well both bate it said pat and whats more im jolly well going to turn up my nose at everything there im not going to let them think were babies of fourteen just come from some silly prep school ill soon let them know that we were headgirls and tennis and hockeycaptains how horrid of daddy to say we are conceited were not a bit we cant help knowing that were good at nearly everything besides being pretty and quite amusing it does sound a bit conceited when you talk like that said isabel wed better not say too much when we get to st clares im going to say all i like and you must back me up said pat people are going to know who we are and what we can do all the mistresses are going to sit up and take notice of us too the osullivan twins are going to be somebodies and dont you forget it isabel isabel nodded her dark head with its black waves of hair i wont forget it she said ill back you up my word st clares will get a few surprises next term the twins arrive at st clares the time soon came when the twins had to leave for the winter term at st clares their mother had had a list of things they were to take with them and the twins examined it carefully its not nearly such a long list as we had for redroofs said pat and golly how few dresses we are allowed mary and frances said that they were allowed to take as many frocks as they liked to ringmere and they had both got long evening dresses like their mother wont they show off to us when they see us again and look lacrossesticks instead of hockeysticks said isabel in disgust they might at least play hockey as well as lacrosse i didnt even bother to look at the lacrosse sticks mummy bought for us did you and look we are even told what to bring in our tuck boxes we could take what we liked to redroofs just wait till we get to st clares well show that we can do as we like said pat what time is the train tomorrow ten oclock from paddington said isabel well we shall get our first glimpse of the st clare girls there i bet theyll be a queerlooking crowd mrs osullivan took the twins to london they taxied to paddington station and looked for the st clare train there it was drawn up at the platform labelled st clare on the platform were scores of girls talking excitedly to one another saying goodbye to their parents hailing mistresses and buying bars of chocolate from the teawagons a simplydressed mistress came up to the twins she knew that they were st clare girls because they had on the grey coats that were the uniform of the school she smiled at mrs osullivan and looked at the list in her band these are new girls she said and i am sure they must be patricia and isabel osullivan because they are so exactly alike im your formmistress miss roberts and im very pleased to see you this was a nice welcome and the twins liked the look of miss roberts she was young and goodlooking tall and smiling but she bad a firm mouth and both pat and isabel felt sure that she wouldnt stand much nonsense from her form your carriage is over here with the rest of your form said miss roberts say goodbye now and get in the train will be going in two minutes she went off to talk to some one else and the twins hugged their mother goodbye said mrs osullivan do your best this term and i do hope youll be happy at your new school write to me soon the twins got into a carriage where three or four other girls were already sitting and chattering they said nothing but looked with interest at the scores of girls passing by their compartment to their places farther up the at their last school the twins bad been the oldest and biggest there but now they were among the youngest at redroofs all the girls bad looked at pat and isabel with awe and admiration the two wonderful headgirls but now the twins were looking at others in the same way tall dignified girls from the top form walked by talking merryvoiced girls from other forms ran to get their places calling out to one another younger ones scrambled into the carriages as the guard went along to warn one that the train was about to go the journey was quite fun every one had packets of sandwiches to eat at halfpast twelve and the train steward brought bottles of gingerbeer and lemonade and cups of tea at halfpast two the train drew in at a little platform a big notice said alight here for st clares school there were big schoolcoaches waiting outside and the girls piled themselves in them chattering and laughing one of them turned to pat and isabel theres the school look up on that hill there the twins looked they saw a pleasant white building built of large white stones with two towers one at each end it looked down into the valley over big playingfields and gardens not nearly so nice as redroofs said pat to isabel do you remember how sweet our old school used to look in the evening sun its red roof was glowing and it looked warm and welcoming not cold and white like st clares for a few minutes both girls were homesick for their old school and their old friends they knew nobody at st clares at all they couldnt call out halo there to every one as they had done each term before they didnt like the look of any of the girls who seemed much more noisy and boisterous than the ones at redroofs it was all horrid anyway we are lucky to have got each other said isabel to pat i would have hated to come here all alone nobody seems to talk to us at all it was the twins own fault if they had but known it they both looked stuckup as one girl whispered to another nobody felt much inclined to talk to them or make friends them was the same rush of unpacking and settling in as there is at all boardingschools the big dormitories were full of girls putting away their things hanging up their dresses and putting photographs out on their little dressingtables there were a good many dormitories at st clares pat and isabel were in number where there were eight white beds all exactly alike each was in its own cubicle surrounded by curtains that could be drawn open or closed just as the girls pleased pats bed was next to isabels much to their joy when the girls had unpacked a tall girl came into the dormitory calling out any new girls here pat and isabel nodded their heads we are new said pat hallo twins said the tall girl smiling as she looked at the two sisters so exactly alike are you patricia and isabel osullivan matron wants to see you pat and isabel went with the girl to where the school matron sat in her comfortable room surrounded by cupboards chests and shelves she was a fat jollylooking person but her eyes were very sharp indeed you cant deceive matron over anything whispered their guide keep in her good books if you can matron checked over sheets towels and clothes with them you will be responsible for mending all your own belongings she said good gracious said pat there were sewing maids at our other school to do that shocking said matron briskly well there are no sewingmaids here so be careful of your things and remember that they cost your parents money our parents dont need to worry about torn clothes began pat why once at redroofs i got caught in some barbed wire and everything i had on was torn to bits they were so torn that the sewingmaid said she couldnt mend a thing and well i would have made you mend every hole every rent every tear said matron her eyes beginning to sparkle theres one thing i cant bear and thats carelessness and waste now mind youwhat is it millicent another girl had come into the room with a pile of towels and the twins were very glad that matrons attention was no longer given to them they slipped out of the room quietly i dont like matron said pat and ive a jolly good mind to tear something so badly that it cant be mended and that would give her something to think about lets go and see what the school is like said isabel slipping her arm into pats it seems much barer and colder somehow than dear old redroofs the twins began to explore the classrooms seemed much the same as any classrooms and the view from the windows was magnificent the twins peeped into the studies at their old school they had shared a fine study between them but here there were no studies except for the top form girls and the fifth form the younger girls shared a big common room where there was a wireless a gramophone and a big library of books shelves ran round the common room and each girl shared part of a shelf putting her belongings there and keeping them tidy there were small music rooms for practising a fine art room an enormous gym which was also used for assembly and concerts and a good laboratory the mistresses had two common rooms and their own bedrooms and the read lived in a small wing by herself having her own bedroom in one of the towers and a beautiful drawingroom below its not so bad said pat after they bad explored everywhere and the playingfields are fine there are many more tennis courts here than redroofs but of course its a much bigger school i dont like big schools said isabel i like smallerschools where you are somebody not just a little nobody tucked away among heaps of others they went into the common room the wireless was on and a danceband was playing cheerful music which was almost drowned by the chatter of the girls some of them looked up as pat and isabel came in hallo twins said a cheekylooking girl with curly golden hair which is which im patricia osullivan and my twin sister is isabel said pat well welcome to st clares said the girl im hilary wentworth and youre in the same dormitory as i am have you been to boardingschool before of course said pat we went to redroofs the school for snobs said a darkhaired girl looking up my cousin went there and didnt she fancy herself when she came home expected to be waited on hand and foot and couldnt even bear to sew a button on a shoe shut up said hilary seeing that pat went red you always talk too much janet well patricia and isabel this isnt the same kind of school as redroofs we work hard and play hard here and were jolly well taught to be independent and responsible we didnt want to come here said pat we wanted to go to ringmere school where our friends were going nobody thought much of st clares at redroofs dear dear dear is that so said janet raising her eyebrows till they were almost lost in the dark hair on her forehead well the point is my dear twins not what you think of st clares but what st dares thinks of you quite a different thing personally i think its a pity that you didnt go somewhere else ive a feeling you wont fit in here janet do be quiet said hilary its not fair to say things like that to new girls let them settle in comeon patricia come on isabel ill show you the way to the heads room youll have to go and say howdoyoudo to her before supper pat and isabel were almost boiling over with rage at what darkhaired janet had said hilary pushed the twins out of the room dont take too much notice of janet she said she always says exactly what she thinks which is very nice when she thinks complimentary things about people but not so good when she doesnt youll get used to her i hope we shant said pat stiffly i like good manners something that was taught at our school anyway even if its not known here oh dont be stuffy said hilary look thats the heads room knock on the door first and try some of your good manners on miss theobald the twins knocked on the door a pleasant rather deep voice called come in pat opened the door and the twins went in the head mistress was sitting at her desk writing she looked up and smiled at the girls i neednt ask who you are she said you are so alike that you must be the osullivan twins yes said the girls looking at their new head mistress she was greyhaired with a dignified serious face that broke into a lovely smile at times she shook hands with each twin i am very glad to welcome you to st dares she said i hope that one day we shall be proud of you do your best for us and st clares will be able to do its best for you well try said isabel and then was quite surprised at herself to find that she had said that she didnt mean to try at all she looked at pat pat said nothing but stared straight in front of her i know your mother quite well said miss theobald i was glad when she decided to send you here you must tell her that when you write to her and give her my kind regards yes miss theobald said pat the head mistress nodded at them with a smile and turned to her desk again what funny children she thought to herself anyone might think they hated to be here perhaps they are just shy or homesick but they were neither shy nor homesick they were just two obstinate girls determined to make the worst of things because they hadnt been sent to the school of their choice a bad beginning the twins soon found that st dares was quite different from their old school even the beds were not nearly so comfortable and instead of being allowed to have their own pretty bedspreads and eiderdowns to match every girl had to have the same i hate being the same as everyone else said pat goodness if only we were allowed to have what we liked wouldnt we make everyone stare what i hate most is being one of the young ones said isabel dismally i hate being spoken to as if i were about six when the top form or fifthform girls say anything to me its here youget out of my way hi you fetch me a book from the library its just too bad the standard of work was higher at st clares than at most schools and although the twins had good brains they found that they were rather behind their form in many ways and this too annoyed them very much they had so hoped that they would impress the others in so many ways and it seemed as if they were even less than nobodies they soon got to know the girls in their form hilary wentworth was one and the sharptongued janet robins then there was a quiet straighthaired girl called vera johns and a rather haughtylooking girl called sheila naylor whose manners were very arrogant thetwinsdidntlikeheratall i dont know what shes got to be so haughty about said pat to isabel its true shes got a lovely home because ive seen a photo of it on her dressingtable but my goodness she sometimes talks like our parlourmaid at home then she seems to remember she mustnt talk like that and goes all haughty and silly then there was kathleen gregory a frightened looking girl of fifteen who was the only one who really tried to make friends with the twins the first week most of the other girls left them alone except for being polite and telling them the ways of the school they all thought that pat and isabel werevery stuckup kathleen is funny said isabel she seems so eager to make friends with us and lend us books and shares her sweets shes been at st clares for a year and she doesnt seem to have any friends at all she keeps asking me to walk with her when we go out and i keep saying i cant because ive got you i feel rather sorry for her somehow said pat she reminds me of a lost dog trying to find a new master isabel laughed yes thats just it i think of all the girls that i like hilary the best in our form shes so natural and jolly a real sport the twins were very much in awe of the older girls who seemed very grownup to them the top form especially seemed almost as old and even more dignified than the mistresses the headgirl winifred james spoke a few words to the twins the first week she was a tall cleverlooking girl with pale blue eyes and pretty soft hair st clares was proud of her for she had passed many difficult exams with flying colours you are the new girls arent you she said settle in and do your best come to me if you are in any difficulty im the headgirl and i should like to help you if ever can oh thank you said the twins feeling quite overcome at being addressed by the headgirl winifred went off with her friends and the twins stared after her shes rather nice said isabel in fact i think most of the top form girls are nice though theyre awfully serious and proper they liked their formmistress miss roberts too though she would stand no nonsense at all sometimes pat would try to argue about something and say well thats what was taught at my old school then miss roberts would say really well do it that way if you like but you wont get very far up your form do remember that what suits one school wont work in another still if you like to be obstinate thats your own look out then pat would stick out her lower lip and isabel would go red and the rest of the form would smile to itself those stuckup girls were having to learn a lesson the artmistress miss walker was a merry soul young and jolly and very good at her work she was pleased to find that both twins could draw and paint well pat and isabel loved miss walkers classes they were very goasyouplease much more like their old school the girls were allowed to chatter and laugh as they worked and it was often a very noisy class indeed mamzelle was not so easygoing she was very strict elderly conscientious and fierce she wore pincenez glasses on her nose and these were always slipping off when she was cross which was fairly often she had enormous feet and a rather harsh voice that the twins hated at first but mamzelle bad also a great sense of fun and if anything tickled her she would go off into enormous roars of laughter that set the whole class laughing too pat and isabel came up against mamzelle very much at first for although they could speak and understand french quite well they had never bothered very much about french grammar and rules and mamzelle bothered a great deal about those you girls patricia and isabel she cried it is not enough to speak my language you write it abominably see this essay it is abominable abominable abominable was mamzelles favourite adjective she used it for everything the weather a broken pencil the girls and her own eyeglasses when they slipped off her big nose pat and isabel called her mamzelle abominable between themselves and were secretly more than a little afraid of the loudvoiced goodhearted big frenchwoman history was taken throughout the school by miss kennedy and her classes were a riot poor miss kennedy was a frump and could not manage any class of girls for more than five minutes she was nervous and serious always tremendously polite listened to every question that was put to her no matter how silly and explained every difficulty at great length she never seemed to see that half the time the girls were pulling her leg before miss kennedy came we had her friend miss lewis said hilary to the twins she was marvellous then she fell ill in the middle of last term and asked the head to have her friend miss kennedy until she was well enough to come back old kenny has got umpteen degrees and is supposed to be even cleverer than the head but my word shes a goose bit by bit the twins sorted out the various girls andmistresses grew to know the classes and the customs of the school and settled in but even when two weeks had gone by they had not got used to being nobodies instead of somebodies as pat complained one thing they found most annoying it was the custom at st clares for the younger girls to wait on the two top forms the fifth and sixthform girls shared studies two friends having a study between them they were allowed to furnish these studies themselves very simply and in cold weather to have their own fire there and to have tea by themselves instead of in the hall with the others one day a girl came into the common room where the twins were reading and called to janet hi janet kay longden wants you youre to light her fire and make some toast for her janet got up without a word and went out pat and isabel stared after her in surprise golly what cheek of kay longden to send a message to janet like that im jolly sure i wouldnt go and light anybodys fire said pat and neither would i said isabel let one of the maids light it or kay herself hilary wentworth looked up from her embroidery it will be your turn next she said look out next week for sudden messages twins if the fifth or sixth want anything doing they expect us to do it its the custom of the school and anyway it doesnt hurt us we can have our turn at sending messages and ordering the lower forms about when were topformers ourselves i never heard of such a thing cried pat furiously i jolly well wont go and do a thing for any one our parents didnt send us here to wait on lazy topformers let them light their own fires and make their own toast isabel and i wont do a thing and they cant make us either hoitytoity said hilary i never knew such a hot temper get further away from me pat youre scorching me pat slammed down her book and flounced out of the room isabel followed her all the other girls laughed idiots said hilary who do they think they are anyway why dont they get some sense they wouldnt be at all bad if only they would shake down i vote we knock some of their corners off else we shall hate them like anything ok said vera im willing i say what a shock for them when they find theyve got to wait on the topformers too i hope they get belinda towers i had to wait on her last term and my word didnt she make me skip around she got it into her head that i was lazy and im sure i lost a whole stone rushing round in circles after her one week the girls laughed sheila naylor spoke haughtily the worst of people who think they are somebodies is that so often they are just nobodies im sure i shouldnt even trouble to know patricia and isabel at home oh come off the high horse sheila said hilary the twins arent as bad as all that anyway there are a few shocks in store for them so there were and they came the very next week a little trouble for the twins one day about halfpast five when the twins were writing home one of the fourthformers popped her head in at the door hi there she said where are the osullivan twins belinda towers wants one of them pat and isabel looked up pat went red what doesshe want us for she asked how should i know said the messenger shes been out over the fields this afternoon so maybe she wants her boots cleaned anyway jump to it or youll get into a row the messenger disappeared the twins sat still hilary looked at them go on idiots she said one of you must go and find out what belinda wants dont keep her waiting for goodness sake shes got about as hot a temper as you have pat ill go said isabel and got up but pat pulled her down no dont she said fm not going to clean anybodys boots and youre not either look here pat dont be goofy said janet belinda may want to tell you something golly she might want to ask you if youll play in a match shes captain you know oh said pat well i shouldnt think its that because cause neither isabel nor i have ever played lacrosse before and we were pretty bad at it yesterday well do go said hilary youve got to go in the end so why not go now another girl popped her head in at the door i say belindas foaming at the mouth where are those osullivan twins theyll get it hot if one of them doesnt go along come on said pat to isabel well go and see what she wants but im not doing any bootcleaning or firelighting thats certain and neither are you the two got up and went out of the room everybody giggled wish i could go and see what happens said janet i love to see belinda in a rage belinda towers was in her study with pamela harrison the girl who shared it with her pat opened the door knock cant you cried belinda barging in like that and i should jolly well like to know why youve been all this time coming i sent for you ages ago pat was rather taken aback and isabel did not dare to say anything well havent you a tongue between you said belinda my goodness pam did you ever see such a pair of boobs well as youve both come you can both do a spot of work for me i want my boots cleaned and pams too and make up my fire for me and put the kettle on to boil youll find water just down the passage come on pam well go and collect our prep and by that time the kettle will be boiling and well make tea the two big girls walked to the door pat very red and angry stopped them i didnt come to st clares to wait on the older girls she said neither did my twin we shant clean your boots nor put on the kettle nor make up the fire belinda stopped as if she had been shot she stared at pat as if she was some particularly nasty insect then she turned to pam did you hear that she said talk about cheek all right my girl no walks down the town for you just remember that the twins stared at belinda in dismay the st care girls were allowed to go down to the town in twos to buy anything they needed or to look at the shops or even to go to the cinema if they had permission surely belinda hadnt the power to stop them doing that i dont think youve any right to say that said pat i shall go to winifred james and tell her what youve said and ask her about it well im blessed said belinda flaring up angrily her red hair seeming to flame too you do want taking down a peg dont you run off to winifred by all means tell your little tales and see what happens pat and isabel went out of the study isabel was very much upset and wanted to stay and do what belinda had ordered but pat was furious she took hold of her twins arm and marched her off to winifreds study the headgirl had her own study which she shared with no one pat dared not go in without knocking so she knocked quietly come in said winifreds voice the twins went in winifred was working at a table what is it she said im rather busy please winifred said pat belinda towers ordered us to clean her boots make up her fire and put her kettle on and when we said we wouldnt she said we werent to go down into the town so weve come to ask you about it i see said winifred well its the custom of this school to get the juniors to wait on the seniors within reason it doesnt hurt them when you go to rome you must do as rome does you know but we didnt want to come to st dares so we dont want to follow silly customs of that sort said pat do we isabel isabel shook her head she couldnt think how pat could dare to speak to winifred like that her knees were shaking as she stood she was never so brave as pat i think i should wait a little while before you call our customs silly said winifred now listen cant you clean boots dont you know how to make up a fire have you never put a kettle onto boil we never had to at redroofs said pat obstinately and we dont at home either i dont think id know how to clean muddy boots said isabel thinking that perhaps if she said that winifred would let them off good heavens said winifred in disgust to think youre nearly fifteen and you dont know how to clean boots how shocking all the more reason why you should learn at once go back to belindas study and try to do what she tells you i know shes hottempered and will tick you off properly but honestly i think you both deserve it do have a little common sense winifred turned back to her books the twins red in the face went out of the room and closed the door quietly they stood outside and looked at each other i shant clean her beastly boots even if i have to stay in the school grounds the whole of the term and not go down into the town once said pat angrily oh pat i do want to get a new set of hairgrips and some chocolate said isabel in dismay come on wed better do it the others will think were terribly silly if we kick up such a fuss they laugh at us enough already well you can do it if you like but im not going to said pat and she stalked off her nose in the air leaving isabel by herself isabel stood for a little while thinking supposing i go and do the jobs that belinda wants done she thought that means that i can go down into the town if want to and as pat is so exactly like me she can go down too if we each go at different times with somebody else no one will ever know that will trick belinda nicely isabel went to belindas study it was empty on the floor lay two pairs of very muddy boots the owners had evidently been across sonic very clayey fields isabel picked them up goodness however did anyone set about cleaning boots like that she heard some one passing and went to the door she saw kathleen gregory and called her kathleen look at these awful boots how do i clean them kathleen stopped at once looking delighted she was pleased that isabel should ask her help you want to scrape them first and get all the clay off she said come on ill help you soon the two girls were cleaning the muddy boots thoroughly they took quite a time kathleen talked hard all the time pouring out all kinds of information about how her mother spoilt her at home and what a lot of presents she was always getting from her parents and how much money they sent her for her birthday isabel listened politely grateful for kathleens help but thinking that she was rather silly after all every one got presents for their birthdays and every one had money on their birthdays when the boots were finished she put them neatly together on the shoeshelf and made up the fire kathleen showed her where to fill the kettle and set it on to boil just then belinda and pam came back oh so you decided to be sensible i see she said wheres your twin did she help you no said isabel well tell her from me that theres to be no going down to the town till she does her bit said belinda flinging herself down in a chair i wont have new girls behaving as if they owned the place is the kettle boiling yet my goodness the waters cold how long has this kettle been on ive only just this minute put it on belinda said isabel i suppose it didnt occur to you that it would be a good idea to make up the fire and put the kettle on first before you did the boots said belinda sarcastically i suppose you thought it would be a great pity if the kettle boiled whilst you were doing the boots i dont know what you kids are coming to nowadays when i was your age i had a lot more common sense clear out now and see that you come running next time i send a message isabel went out of the room just as she was closing the door belinda yelled to her again and mind you tell that obstinate twin of yours what i said if she disobeys ill report her to miss theobald isabel fled she felt upset and angry and very foolish why why why hadnt she put the kettle on first no wonder that belinda had thought her stupid isabel told pat what had happened and she says youre not to go down to the town until you do your bit she said but you can pat because no one will know if its you or me going i dont think anyone can tell the difference between us yet all right said pat ungraciously but i dont think much of you for giving in like that isabel fancy cleaning those dirty boots well i rather enjoyed it said isabel kathleen helped me first we oh shut up said pat rudely go and write an essay about how to clean boots and boil kettles if you want to but dont preach tome isabel was hurt but pat could not be angry with her twin for long before an hour had gone by she had slipped her arm through isabels sorry old thing she said i wasnt really angry with you i was furious with belinda and took it out on you never mind ill trick belinda all right and go down to the town whenever i like pretending that i am you pat was as good as her word she slipped down to the town with one or other of the girls pretending that she was isabel and nobody knew the difference how the twins giggled about their trick and then something happened pat had gone down to the town with kathleen after tea when a messenger came to the commonroom isabel was winding up the gramophone and she jumped when she heard pats name called patricia osullivan belinda wants you well i must pretend to be pat thought isabel but why does belinda want pat im the one that does her jobs just now she knows pat doesnt she soon knew what belinda wanted the sportscaptam was making out a list and she looked up as isabel came in pat osullivan you played well in the lacrosse practice yesterday she said i was watching youre a silly obstinate kid but im not counting that against you where lacrosse is concerned im putting you down for the match on saturday isabel stared in surprise how pleased pat would be isabel muttered a thank you and sped longing for pat to come back so that she might tell her the good news when pat heard she stood speechless in a match already she cried how decent of belinda if shed been spiteful shed have left me out for months then she became silent and went away by herself isabel knew quite well what she was thinking because she was worrying about the same thing herself soon pat came over and put her aim through isabels i feel a beast now said pat ive let you do all the jobs and ive gone down to the town all i wanted to just to spite belinda i thought we were being rather clever to play a trick like that but now i dont think so nor do i said isabel i just feel mean and dishonest it was decent of belinda to stick you in the match although she must have felt furious with you but we havent been decent and you know pat i dont really mind doing anything for the topformers they are awfully good sorts really after all why should anyone mind putting a kettle on to boil and making toast belinda talks to me quite a lot now and i like her though im a bit afraid of her hot temper pat rubbed her nose and frowned she always did that when she felt uncomfortable she suddenly got up and went to the door im going to tell belinda ive played her a trick she said im not playing in the match on saturday knowing ive been mean she ran out she went to belindas study and knocked on the door belinda yelled come in she looked surprised when she saw pat hallo isabel she said i didnt send for you im not isabel im pat said pat ive come about the match on saturday well theres nothing more to tell you than i told you just now said belinda thats just it you didnt tell me just now you told my twin isabel said pat i was down in the town i know you said i wasnt to go but im so like my twin that i knew nobody would ever know rather a mean trick pat said belinda in a scornful voice i know said pat in a troubled voice im sorry for that ive come to say thank you for putting me in the match but of course i dont expect to play now anyway i couldnt have you being decent to me if i was playing a trick just to pay you out and ill take my share of the jobs with isabel now i was silly before thats all belinda no not quite all said belinda in an unexpectedly gentle voice ive something to say too youve done something rather mean but youve been big enough to put it right well say no more about it but youll play in the match on saturday pat flew off to tell isabel her heart leaping for joy how decent belinda was how could she ever have thought her beastly and horrid ill boil her old kettle and clean her old boots and even scrub the floor now thought pat and my word ill shoot a dozen goals on saturday see if i dont she didnt but she shot one very difficult one and how pleased she was to hear both isabel and belinda shout well done pat oh good shot good shot a battle with mamzelle every week the twins form had marks for different subjects pat and isabel had been used to being top in most things at redroofs and it was with shame and dismay that they found they were nearer the bottom than the top at st clares hilary saw them looking unhappy about it and she spoke to them youve got to remember that you are the only new girls in your form she said the rest of us have been in the form at least two terms and we are used to st clare ways cheer up it was mamzelle abominable who really upset the twins she would not make allowances for them and when they sent in badly written french essays she was very angry she had the pile of french books on the desk before her all neatly marked with trиs bien or bien or excellent but when she took out pats book and isabels they were both marked the same abominable this will not do cried mamzelle banging her big hand down on the books cest abominable you will write the whole essay again today and you will bring it to me after supper we cant write it again today mamzelle said isabel politely weve got art this afternoon and after tea weve got permission to go to the cinema together we shant have time to rewrite it can we do it tomorrow oh que vous кtes insupportable raged mamzelle stamping her foot on the floor and making the books on her desk jump and slide how dare you talk to me like this you present me with a shocking yes a shocking essay and then you talk of going to the cinema you will not go you will stay behind and write the essay for me and if there is more than one mistake you will write it all over again that is certain but but weve got the tickets said isabel we had to book our seats we i do not care about seats i do not care about booklag shouted mamzelle now quite losing her temper all i care about is that you should learn good french which is what i am here for you will bring me the essays tonight isabel looked ready to cry pat looked mutinous and stuck out her lower lip every one else enjoyed the row and a few of the girls were secretly very pleased to see the twins taken down a peg nobody dared to be inattentive after that and the lesson went very smoothly though pat was sulky and joined in the lesson as little as she dared when the lesson was over the twins had a few words together im going to the cinema said pat oh no pat said isabel shocked we cant do that wed really get into a terrible row wed better stay behind and do the work again for goodness sake lets im going to the cinema said pat obstinately ill fit in the beastly essay somehow and you must too lets do it directly after dinner i dont care how badly i do it either but after dinner they had to go to a meeting of their form to plan nature rambles so there was no time then art took up the whole of the afternoon isabel began to be worried suppose pat insisted on going to the cinema even if they hadnt rewritten their essays she could not imagine what mamzelle would say lets miss our tea said isabel to pat as they ran down the stairs after the art lesson we could do our essays then miss my tea no thank you said pat im jolly hungry i dont know why art makes me hungry but it always does and i know janet has got a big pot of plum jam sent to her that shes opening this tea time im not going to miss my share isabel was hungry too and she weakly gave way she knew that if they were going to get into the cinema in time they wouldnt have a moment to spare for anything after tea let alone rewriting essays i really shant go to the cinema she thought i darent honestly i think mamzelle abominable would go up in smoke if she heard wed gone but after tea pat dragged isabel off to the dormitory to get her hat and coat were not really going pat surely cried isabel indeed we are said pat sticking out her lower lip come on but pat well really get into a simply enormous row said isabel it isnt worth it perhaps mamzelle will give us an hours extra work every day or something like that janet told me that once she had to stop in after tea for a whole week and write out french verbs for checking mamzelle just a little bit and she wouldnt count this a little thing dont be a coward isabel said pat rye got a plan mamzelle said we were to take our essays to her after supper didnt she but she didnt say what time after supper so when were in bed and think the others are asleep well slip down to the common room in our dressinggowns rewrite our essays then and give them to mamzelle when theyre finished pat id never dare to cried poor isabel think of going to find mamzelle at that time of night in our dressinggowns you must be mad well mamzelle has made me feel mad said obstinate pat anyway i dont care what happens you know we never wanted to come to st clares and if its going to treat us like this im jolly sure i wont stay ill get expelled pat youre not to say things like that said isabel think what mummy and daddy would say well its their fault for sending us here said pat who really was in a great rage yes but pat think how awful it would be if redroofs heard that wed been sent away from st clares said isabel in a low voice pats eyes filled with tears she didnt want to think of that come on the said gruffly im not going to change my mind now if youre coming with me come if not you can jolly well be a coward by yourself but isabel was not going to be left by herself she put on her hat and coat janet came into the room as the twins were going out halo ballot she said so you are going to the cinema after all whenever did you find time to rewrite your french we havent done it said pat janet gave a long whistle and stared at the twins in surprise i wouldnt like to be in your shoes tomorrow when you tell mamzelle that she said you really are a couple of idiots i cant think why you should go out of your way to make things difficult for yourselves the twins did not answer they ran downstairs and were soon in the town but neither of them really enjoyed the show although it was a fine naturefilm they had to leave a little before the end to get back to supper in time there was a debate afterwards that they had to go to and they both wished they could miss it but it was taken by winifred james the headgirl and neither of the twins dared to ask if they might miss it nine oclock was the bedtime for their form and the two forms above them chattering and laughing the girls went upstairs and undressed usually a mistress came to see that all the girls were in bed and switched off the lights but tonight hilary announced that she was to see to this miss roberts is with miss theobald she said so im on duty tonight hurry all of you because the light will go off in five minutes time and youll have to finish in the dark if youre not ready two girls joan and doris began to have a pillowfight when they heard that miss roberts was not coming bangthud went the two pillows and the girls shrieked with laughter but it wasnt quite so funny when one of the pillows split and feathers poured out into the air golly said joan look at my pillow hilary for goodness sake dont turn the lights off yet i must pick up some of these feathers sorry said hilary youll have to do it in the morning lights are going out now miss roberts will be along to see were all right in an hours time so lets hope she wont spot the feathers all over the place shell think the cats been chasing hens in our dormitory the lights snapped out all the girls were in bed except joan and dons who were still groping for feathers they bad to finish undressing and cleaning their teeth in the dark joan upset her toothmug and doris banged her ankle on her chestofdrawers and groaned deeply janet giggled and kathleen gregory went off into a spasm of laughter that gave her hiccups shut up kathleen ordered hilary youre hiccupping on purpose i know you im not said kathleen indignantly and gave such an enormous hiccup that her bed shook janet couldnt stop giggling every lime she tried to stop poor kathleen hiccupped again and janet went off into more gurgles even the twins anxious though they were to have every one going to sleep quickly could not help laughing hilary lost her temper and sat up in bed youre all meanies she cried if any one comes along and hears you making this row ill be blamed because im head of the dormitory shut up janet and kathleen for goodness sake get a drink of water how do you suppose were going to sleep with you hiccupping like that sorry hilary said kathleen with another hiccup ill get up and get some water get into bed joan and doris said hilary snuggling down again i dont care if youve cleaned your teeth and brushed your hair or not get into bed in five minutes time there was peace in the dormitory except for an occasional small and subdued hiccup from kathleen and a smothered giggle from janet the twins lay awake listening for the others to go to sleep they were worried because miss roberts was coming in about an hours time they could not wait a whole hour before going down to the common room for one thing mamzdlle would have gone to bed by the time they had finished their essays isabel whispered pat at last isabel i think theyre all asleep get up and put on your dressinggown but miss roberts hasnt been in yet whispered back isabel well put our bolsters down our beds so that theyll look like our bodies said pat come on they got up quietly and slipped on their dressinggowns they pushed their bolsters down their beds and hoped that miss roberts wouldnt notice anything different when she came then out of the door they went and down the dimlylit stairs to the common room which was just below their own dormitory pat shut the door and turned on the light the two girls sat down and took out their french books mamzelle had marked all the mistakes and carefully and laboriously the two girls wrote out the essays again well mine had fifteen mistakes before and i hope it hasnt got more than five now said isabel blow mamzelle abominable im so sleepy and oh pat dare we go and find mamzelle now do you think my knees are shaking at the very thought oh dont be stupid said pat what can she say to us anyway weve done the essays again and she said give them to her after supper and we are going to do that arent we the essays were finished now they had to find mamzelle where would she be in one of the mistresses common rooms or in her own bedroom or where well come on said pat at last we must go and find her cheer up isabel the twins slipped out of the common room and went to the first of the mistresses moms the light was out and the room was quite dark no one was there at all as they went on their way to the second common room they heard mamzelles voice in one of the classrooms what luck shes in the upper third classroom whispered pat i dont know whos there with her but it doesnt matter the art mistress i expect mamzelles awfully friendly with miss walker they knocked at the upper third door a surprised voice called come in whos there pat opened the door and the twins went in and oh my goodness who should be with mamzelle studying a big french chart but the head miss theobald herself the twins were so shocked that they stood and stared with wide eyes mamzelle cried tiens in a loud and amazed voice and miss theobald said nothing at all mamzelle recovered first what is wrong she cried are you ill mes petites no said pat in rather a trembling voice were not ill weve brought you our rewritten essays you said we were to bring them after supper so here they are but why bring them so late asked miss theobald in her deep serious voice you must have known that mamzelle meant you to bring them before you went to bed we hadnt time to rewrite the essays till just now answered pat suddenly feeling very foolish indeed we got out of bed and went down to the common room to do them ah the bad children they went to the cinema after all instead of doing my essays cried mamzelle guessing everything at once ah miss theobald these twins send my hair grey the work they do it is impossible that they have gone to a school before they came here their work is abominable we did go to a school and it was a jolly fine one cried pat indignantly much better than st clares there was a silence after this miss theobald looked thoughtful mamzelle was speechless i think we wont decide anything tonight or talk about this said miss theobald at last it is too late go to bed twins and come and see me at ten oclock to morrow morning ask miss roberts to excuse you for fifteen minutes then so back to bed with their french books went the twins subdued and dismayed what bad luck to have run into the head herself like that now what was going to happen to them they didnt like to think of ten oclock in the morning poor miss kennedy hilary was awake when they got back into bed and she sat up and demanded to know where they had been miss roberts came in and turned on the light and i woke up said hilary i spotted that youd put bolsters down your beds but miss roberts didnt whatever have you been doing pat told her hilary listened in amazement whatever will you two do next she said honestly i think youre mad nobody would ever think youd been headgirls in your old school you behave like a couple of babies the twins were annoyed with hilary particularly as they each had a kind of feeling that she was right they got into bed and lay thinking it was all very well to be defiant and daring but it wasnt so funny afterwards they asked miss roberts to excuse them at ten oclock miss roberts had evidently been told to expect this for she nodded her bead at once and did not ask any questions the twins went off together to miss theobalds room the head was making out timetables and she told them to sit down for a minute it was rather dreadful waiting for her to finish what she was doing both the twins felt much more nervous than they pretended pat began to wonder if the head would write home about them to their parents much as she had grumbled about going to st clares she didnt want the head to report her for misbehaviour at the school at last miss theobald was ready she swung her chair round and faced the twins she looked very serious but not angry i have been looking through the reports that your father sent me from your last school the head began they are very good and you seem to have been responsible and conscientious children there i cant imagine that you can have completely changed your characters in a few weeks so i am not going to treat you as naughty irresponsibe girls i know there must be a good reason behind all your queer behaviour last night really my dears you gave mamzelle and me quite a shock when you walked into the classroom in your blue dressinggowns the head smiled the twins felt most relieved and pat began to pour out what had happened in the french class the french isnt the same as at our old school it isnt much use our trying to do well because we always get everything wrong it isnt our fault and mamzelle was simply furious with us yesterday and miss theobald heard pat patiently to the end well your french difficulties can easily be put right said the head mistress i have spoken to mamzelle and she says that you speak well and understand well but that you have not been well grounded in the writing of french she has offered to give you half an hours extra french a day until you have caught up the others this is very kind of her because she is extremely busy all this bother has come from the fact that you were behind your class in one thing and if you are willing to help to put it right by working hard with mamzelle there is no need to say any more about your rather silly behaviour last night the twins stared at miss theobald with mixed feelings they were most relieved that nothing more was to be said but oh dear oh dear extra french each day how tiresome and yet how decent of mamzelle abominable to be willing to help them thank you miss theobald said pat at last well try once we catch up the others we shant feel so angry and ashamed when we are scolded in front of the class well you wont be scolded if mamzelle really feels you are trying said miss theobald now go to her and arrange what time will be best each day for the extra lesson and dont go marching through the corridors in your dressinggowns at halfpast ten anymore no miss theobald said the twins smiling at the head things seemed suddenly brighter what they had done didnt any longer seem a dreadful piece of misbehaviour likely to be punished in dire ways but just a silly bit of nonsense that they were both heartily ashamed of they went out of the room and skipped down the passage to the common room mamzelle was there correcting piles of french essays and muttering to herself as she ticked the pages trиs bien ma petite hilary ah this dreadful girl joan ah come in the twins went into the mistresses common room mamzelle beamed at them and patted them on the shoulder although she had an extremely quick and hot temper she was very good hearted and kind ah now we will see how clever you can be at catching up the others she said every day you will work with me and we shall be good friends nest ce pas thank you mamzelle said pat we were rather idiots yesterday we wont be again and thank you for saying youll help us each day said isabel so that was that and the classes with mamzelle went much more smoothly mamzelle was patient with the twins and they tried hard but nobody tried hard with poor miss kennedy janet was a born tease and legpuller and she gave the unfortunate historyteacher a terrible time janet had a wonderful collection of trickpencils all of which she tried on miss kennedy with enormous success one pencil had a point that was made of rubber so that it wobbled to one side when miss kennedy took it to write with another pencil had a point that slipped right inside the pencil as soon as any one wrote with it the girls all watched with intense eagerness as the unfortunate mistress unwarily used these pencils and gazed at them in surprise when they behaved so queerly then janet produced a pencil that wouldnt write at all although it appeared to have a most marvellous point to see poor miss kennedy pressing hard with the pencil trying her best to write very good with it sent the whole class into fits of giggles girls girls please make less noise miss kennedy said turn to page eightyseven of your history books today i want to tell you how the people lived in the seventeenth century the class at once began to turn over the pages of their history books in a most feverish manner making a noise like the whispering of trees in the wind they went on and on turning over the pages muttering eightyseven eightyseven to themselves all the time what number did you say miss kennedy asked kathleen innocently though she knew very well indeed i said page eightyseven said miss kennedy politely she was always polite never rude like mamzelle or sarcastic like miss roberts oh eightyseven said all the girls at once and immediately began to turn over their pages the other way very busy and very serious until janet let out a giggle and then the whole class roared miss kennedy rapped on the desk please please she said i do beg you to be quiet and let us get on with the lesson please miss kennedy did the people wear clothes in the seventeenth century or just skins asked janet in an innocent voice miss kennedy looked surprised surely you know that they wore clothes she said i have a picture here of the kind of clothes they wore you should know that they didnt wear skins then janet not even their own skins asked janet this wasnt really at all funny but the class was now in a state to giggle at anything and the twins and every one else joined in the laughter perhaps they had jumped out of their skins and thats why they didnt wear any said hilary more giggles followed this though half the class didnt even catch what hilary had said girls i cant have this i really cant said miss kennedy i shall have to report you oh please please please miss kennedy chanted the class in a chorus and one or two girls pretended to sob poor miss kennedy she had to deal with this sort of thing every time though the upper forms were better behaved the lower forms did not mean to be cruel or unkind but they loved a joke and did not stop to think about miss kennedy and what she must be feeling they just thought she was silly and asked for trouble one morning when the class was especially riotous janet caught every ones eye kathleen giggled for she knew what had been planned when janet gave the signal every girl was to drop her history text book flat on the floor janet nodded and each girl let go her book crash miss kennedy jumped in fright and the next minute the door opened and in came miss roberts she had been taking a class in the next room and when the crash of twenty history books had sounded like a gunshot she had decided it was time to investigate miss kennedy i dont know if there are any girls names you would like to report to me said miss roberts in a very cold voice but i shall be glad to have them after morning school i am sure you find it as difficult as l do to teach with all this noise going on miss roberts glared at the form and they sat silent half the girls going red miss kennedy went red too im so sorry for the noise miss roberts she said you see but miss roberts was gone shutting the door after her very firmly indeed kenny wont report any one whispered janet to isabel if she did shed have to report the whole class and she would be ashamed to do that miss kennedy reported no one but in the secrecy of her bedroom that night she worried and tossed all night long she had come to st clares because her friend miss lewis who thought so much of her was ill and now miss kennedy felt that she was letting her down because the girls were quite out of hand and she was sure that not one of them had learnt any history worth mentioning that term and miss roberts had come in like that and been so cold and horrid and had hardly spoken to her in the common room afterwards supposed pose she complained about her to miss theobald it was dreadful to feel herself a failure and poor miss kennedy did not see how she could possibly turn her failure into anything like success im afraid of the girls thats why she said to herself and do bate reporting them because if i do they will hate me and then my classes will be worse than ever and in the dormitory janet was planning other tricks to plat on poor unsuspecting miss kennedy janet had brothers monkeys all of them and they sent her all kinds of tricks which they themselves tried out in their own classes pat isabel are you asleep whispered janet i say my brothers are sending me some firecracks have you ever heard of them never said the twins whatever are they well you throw them on the fire and they crack and spit and hiss whispered janet in glee my seat is next to the fireso watch out for some fun next week i expect the parcel will come tomorrow the twins giggled whatever would kenny say when the fire began to spit and hiss and crack they hugged themselves and pictured miss kennedys alarmed expression janet whispered pat lets but hilary head of the dormitory put an end to the whispering shut up she said you know the rules dont you for goodness sake go to sleep janet is up to tricks the parcel of firecracks duly arrived for janet she giggled when she took it from the postrack and winked at the twins ill undo it m the dormitory after breakfast she id say youve forgotten something and get permission to go up before prayers janet and the twins scurried up stairs to the dory immediately after breakfast and for five minutes they gloated over the contents of the parcel there s a box inside and this contained about fifty squib crackers small and innocentlooking coloured red and yellow but will they really make much noise asked pat taking one up i shouldnt think theyd do much more than make a gentle pop dont worry ill throw about a dozen on at a time said janet therell be quite an explosion i promise you golly well have some sport with many giggles the girls hurried downstairs as the bell for prayers went they could hardly wait for the historylesson to come it came after the midmorning break janet told some of the other girls what she was to do and the whole form was in a great state of expectation even miss roberts felt there was something up though the class tried to work well at the end of the maths lesson just before break miss roberts spoke a few dry words to her form after break you will have your history lesson as usual i expect you to work as well for miss kennedy as you do for me if you dont i shall have something serious to say to you all there is to be no disturbance at all this morning do you hear me janet janet jumped she couldnt imagine why miss roberts had suddenly picked her out she did not know that she had been looking extremely guilty yes miss roberts said janet thinking that alas she would not be able to play her firecrack trick after all but the rest of the form crowded round her duringbreak and insisted that she carried out her promise they couldnt bear not to have the treat of seeing miss kennedy jump and stare with wide eyes at the fires extraordinary behaviour all right said janet at last but for goodness sake dont give me away to miss roberts thats all if she hears anything and do promise not to laugh too loudly honestly well get into an awful row if miss roberts hears us and shell be quite near you know no she wont said kathleen shes taking the sixth for something i heard her say so and theyre right at the other end of the school she wont hear a thing good said janet feeling more comfortable well watch out well hear some fine spitting and hissing i can tell you the whole form were in their places as quiet as mice when miss kennedy came in to give them their usual history lesson she was feeling even more nervous than usual for she had not forgotten how the form had behaved the last time she had taken them she was most relieved to see them sitting so quietly in their places good morning girls said miss kennedy sitting at her desk good morning miss kennedy chorused the form and the lesson opened miss kennedy had to turn to the blackboard to draw a history chart and immediately every girl turned her head towards janet the time had come janets seat was just by the fire the box of firecracks was in her desk cautiously she lifted the lid and took out about a dozen she threw them into the heart of the fire every one waited tensely for a moment nothing happened at all except that the fire flamed up a little then the excitement began crack spit hiss half the firecracks went off at once and sparks jumped up the chimney and leapt out of the fire on to the floor crack sssssssssss every one watched and listened their eyes on poor miss kennedy who looked as surprised and as startled as could be miss kennedy oh miss kennedy whats happening cried pat pretending to be frightened its all right pat its probably a very gassy piece of coal said miss kennedy its all over now but it really made me jump crack crack some more fireworks went off and a shower of sparks flew out of the fire janet jumped up took the blackboardcleaner and began to beat out the sparks with an enormous amount of quite unnecessary noise janet janet stop cried miss kennedy afraid that the next class would hear the noise by this time the class bad begun to giggle though they had tried hard to keep serious and to smother their laughter when the firecracks went off once more the class nearly went into hysterics which were not made any better by the sight of janet again pretending to beat out sparks on the floor by flapping about with the blackboardcleaner making an enormous dust miss kennedy went pale she guessed that some trick had been played though she couldnt imagine what she stood up locking unexpectedly dignified though bits of straight hair fell rather wildly from the two knots at the sides of her head girls she said there will be no history lesson this morning i refuse to teach an unruly class like this she went out of the room her face white and her eyes swimming with tears she would have to go to the head and give up her job she couldnt possibly take fees for teaching girls who simply played the whole of the time but it was no use going when she felt so upset she would wait until the end of the morning and go then she hurriedly scribbled a note to miss roberts and sent it to her by one of the school maids am afraid i feel unwell and have had to leave your form for a while said the note miss roberts was surprised to get the note she debated with herself whether to let the first form carry on by itself surely miss kennedy would have left them some work to do or should she leave the sixth form to get on by themselves and go back to the first she decided to give the sixth some questions to answer and leave them they would behave themselves of course but she wasnt so sure about her own form so she began to write out questions on the board wondering meanwhile what the first form was up to they had been rather taken aback when miss kennedy walked out some of the girls felt guilty and uncomfortable but when the fire began to hiss and spit again it all seemed terribly funny once more and doris joan kathleen and the rest began to giggle again did you see old kenny when the first crack went off cried joan i thought i should die trying not to laugh i had an awful stitch in my side i can tell you janet those firecracks are simply marvellous cried hilary put some more on kenny wont be back all i hope is that she doesnt go and tell miss theobald she didnt go towards the heads room said janet she went the other way all right ill slick some more on watch out everyone janet shook the box over the fire meaning to throw out about a dozen of the little squibs but the whole lot went in janet laughed golly theyve all gone in well have some fun doris was at the door of the classroom keeping guard in case a teacher came along suddenly she gave a cry look out miss roberts is coming get to your seats quick every one scurried to their seats at once they pulled open their history books and by the time that miss roberts came into the room the class looked fairly peaceful though it was rather surprising to see so many bent heads miss roberts became suspicious at once usually the girls all looked up when she came into the room you seem very busy she said drily did miss kennedy leave you history work to do nobody answered janet gave an anxious glance at the fire those firecracks how she wished she hadnt put so many on the fire began to flare up a little miss roberts spoke sharply cant somebody answer me did miss but she did not finish her question because about twenty firecracks went off at once with the most tremendous hissing spluttering and cracking sparks flew out and huge flames shot up the chimney good heavens said miss roberts what in the world is going on there again nobody said a word there was no giggling or laughing this time no smothered gurgles everyone looked scared crack sssssss crack some of the fireworks shot themselves up the chimney and exploded there bringing down showers of soot it was hot soot and flew out over the room janet and the girls nearest the fire began to cough and choke come away from the fire janet ordered miss roberts those sparks will set fire to your tunic the soot flew out again and black specks began to descend on to books papers desks and heads miss roberts mouth went very straight and thin she looked round the class some one has been putting fireworks into the fire she said the class will dismiss i am going to the common room across the passage i expect the girl who played this stupid and dangerous joke to come and own up at once she left the room every one stared in dismay it was all very well to play a joke on stupid old kenny but miss roberts was a different matter altogether miss roberts knew a great many most annoying punishments gosh im in for it now said janet gloomily id better go and get it over she went to the door the twins stared after her pat ran to the door too janet wait im coming too i was as much to blame as you because i egged you on id have put those firecracks on if you hadnt and ill come as well said isabel at once oh i say that is decent of you said janet slipping her arm through pats and holding out her other hand to isabel then hilary spoke up too well ill come along as well as a matter of fact were all to blame its true you got the squibs and put them on but we all shared the joke and its not fair that only you should be punished so it ended in the whole of the class going to the common room looking very downcast and ashamed miss roberts looked up surprised to see so many girls crowding into the room whats all this for she asked sternly miss roberts may i tell you said hilary im bead of the form i want the person who played the trick to own up said miss roberts who did it i did said poor janet going rather white her knees shook a little and she looked on the floor she could not bear to meet miss roberts sharp hazel eyes but we were all in it said hilary we wanted janet to do it and we shared in it and may i ask if you also treated miss kennedy to the same silly trick asked miss roberts in her most sarcastic voice yes said janet in a low voice so that explains it said miss roberts thinking of the note that miss kennedy had sent her well you will all share the expenses of the chimney being swept and you will all spend two hours each washing down the walls and scrubbing the floor and desks after the sweep has been that means that you will work in batches of five each giving up two hours of your free time to do it yes miss roberts said the class dolefully you will also apologize to miss kennedy of course went on miss roberts and i should like to say that i am ashamed of you for taking advantage of somebody not able to deal with you as i can the form trooped out miss roberts telephoned for the sweep and miss kennedy was surprised to find relays of girls waylaying her offering her humble apologies for their behaviour they did not tell her what had happened so miss kennedy had no idea that miss roberts had experienced the same startling explosions from the fire but had dealt with the whole matter with a firm hand she really thought that the girls were offering their apologies of their own accord and she felt almost happy i shant give in my resignation to miss theobald after all she thought anyway if i did i would have to say why and i shouldnt like to give the girls away after they had said they were sorry in such a nice way so the matter rested there for a while and batches of dismal girls washed and scrubbed that afternoon and evening instead of playing lacrosse and going to a concert one good thing came out of the row and that was that the twins form liked them a great deal better it was decent of pat and isabel to go after janet like that and say theyd share the blame said hilary good for them the great midnight feast miss roberts kept a very tight hand indeed on her form for the next week or two and they squirmed under her dry tongue pat and isabel hated being spoken to as if they were nobodies but they did not dare to grumble its simply awful being ticked off as if we were in the kindergarten when weve been used to bossing the whole school at redroofs said isabel i shall never get used to it i hate it too said pat but all the same i cant help liking miss roberts you know i do respect her awfully and you cant help liking people you respect well i wish shed start respecting us then said isabel gloomily then maybe shed like us and we wouldnt get such a hot time in class golly when i forgot to take my maths book to her this morning youd have thought she was going to phone up the police station and have me sent to prison pat laughed dont be an idiot she said by the way dont forget to give half a crown towards buying miss theobald something on her birthday ive given mine in oh my groaned isabel i hope ive got half a crown i had to give sixpence towards the sweep and i gave a shilling to the housemaid for cleaning my tunic for me in case matron ticked me off about it and we had to give sixpence to the babies convalescent home last week im just about broke she went to her part of the shelf in the common room and took down her purse it was empty golly said isabel in dismay im sure i had two shillings in my purse did you borrow it pat no said pat or id have told you it must be in your coatpocket silly but the two shillings were nowhere to be found isabel decided she must have lost them and she had to borrow some money from pat to give towards buying the head a present then janet had a birthday and every one went down to the town to buy a small present for her all but hilary who discovered to her dismay that the tenshilling note that her granny had sent her had disappeared out of her pocket oh my a whole ten shillings wailed hilary i was going to buy all sorts of things with it i really must get some new shoelaces and my lacrosse stick wants thendleg where in the world has it gone joan lent hilary a shilling to buy a present for janet and on her birthday janet was most delighted to find so many gifts she was very popular in spite of her bluntness the finest gift she had was from kathleen gregory who presented her with a gold barbrooch with her name inscribed at the back i say you shouldnt have done that said janet in amazement why it must have cost you a mint of money kathleen i really cant accept it its too generous a gift but you must accept it because its got your name inside said kathleen its no use to any one else every one admired the little gold brooch and read the name inscribed on the back kathleen glowed with pleasure at the attention that her gift produced and when janet thanked her again and slipped her arm through hers she was red with delight it was very generous of kathleen said janet to the twins as they went to the classroom but i cant understand why she went such a splash on me usually shes awfully mean with her gifts either gives nothing at all or something that costs half a farthing it isnt as if she likes me such a lot either ive gone for her heaps of times because shes such a goof janet had a marvellous tuck hamper sent to her for her birthday and she and hilary and the twins unpacked it with glee all the things i love said janet a big chocolate cake shortbread biscuits sardines in tomato sauce nestles milk and look at these peppermint creams theyll melt in our mouths lets have a midnight feast said pat suddenly we once had one at redroofs before we were head girls i dont know why food tastes so much nicer in the middle of the night than in the daytime but it does oh janet dont you think it would be fun it might be rather sport said janet but theres not enough food here for us all the rest of you will have to bring something as well each girl had better bring one thing a cake or gingerbeer or chocolate when shall we have the feast tomorrow night said isabel with a giggle miss roberts is going to a concert i heard her say so shes going to stay the night with a friend and get a train that brings her back in time for prayers oh good tomorrows the night then said janet lets tell every one so the whole form was told about the great feast and every one promised to bring something pat bought a jam sponge sandwich isabel who again had to borrow from pat bought a bar of chocolate joan brought candles because the girls were not allowed to put on the electric light once it was turned out except for urgent reasons such as illness the most lavish contribution was kathleens she brought a really marvellous cake with almond icing all over it and pink and yellow sugar roses on the top every one exclaimed over it golly kathleen have you come into a fortune or something cried janet that cake must have cost you all your pocketmoney for the rest of the term its marvellous the prettiest cake ive ever seen said hilary jolly decent of you kathleen kathleen was red with pleasure she beamed round at every one and enjoyed the smiles that she and her cake received i wish i could have got something better than my silly little bar of chocolate said isabel but i even had to borrow from pat to get that and i can only bring a few biscuits i had left from a tin that mother sent me a fortnight ago said hilary im quite broke since i lost my ten shilling note anyway weve got heaps of things said janet who was busy biding everything at the bottom of a cupboard just outside the dormitory golly i hope matron doesnt suddenly take it into her head to springclean this cupboard she would be surprised to see whats in it goodness who brought this porkpie how marvellous the whole form was in a state of excitement that day it was simply gorgeous to have a secret and not to let any of the other forms know hilary knew that the upper third had had a midnight feast already that term and it had been a great success she meant to make theirs even more of a success miss roberts couldnt think why the firstform girls were so restless as for mamzelle she sensed the underlying excitement at once and grew excited too ah now mes petites what is the matter with you today she cried when one girl after another made a mistake in the french translation what is in your thoughts you are planning something is it not so tell me what it is oh mamzelle whatever makes you think such a thing cried janet what should we be planning how should i know said mamzelle all i know is that you are not paying attention now one more mistake and i send you to bed an hour earlier than usual mamzelle did not mean this of course but it tickled the girls who were all longing for bedtime that night and would have been quite pleased to go early janet giggled and was nearly sent out of the room at last bedtime came and every one undressed whos going to get the stuff out of the cupboard said pat you and land hilary and isabel said janet and for goodness sake dont drop anything if you drop the porkpie on the linoleum there will be a mess every one laughed they snuggled down into bed they all wanted to keep awake but it was arranged that some of them should take it in turns to sit up and keep awake for half an hour waking the next girl when it was her turn then at midnight they should all be awakened and the feast would begin first janet sat up in bed for half an hour hugging her knees and thinking of all the things in the cupboard outside she was not a bit sleepy she switched on her torch to look at the time the halfhour was just up she leaned across to the next bed and awoke hilary at midnight every one was fast asleep except for the girl on watch who was pat as she heard the big clock striking from the west tower of the school pat crept out of bed she went from girl to girl whispering in her ear and shaking her hilary its time wake up isabel its midnight joan the feast is about to begin kathleen kathleen do wakeup its twelve oclock at last every girl was awake and with many smothered giggles they put on their dressinggowns and slippers the whole school was in darkness pat lighted two candles and placed them on a dressingtable in the middle of the dormitory she had sent isabel to waken the rest of the form in the next dormitory and with scuffles and giggles all the girls crept in they sat on the beds nearest to the candles and waited whilst pat and the others went to get the things out of the cupboard pat took her torch and shone it into the cupboard whilst the others took out the things a tin of sweetened milk dropped to the floor with a crash every one jumped and stood stockstill they listened but there was no sound to be heard no door opened no one switched on a light idiot whispered janet to isabel for goodness sake dont drop that chocolate cake where did that tin roll to oh here it is at last all the eatables were safely in the dormitory and the door was shut softly the girls looked at everything and felt terribly hungry golly porkpie and chocolate cake sardines and nestlйs milk chocolate and peppermint creams tinned pineapple and gingerbeer said janet talk about a feast i bet this beats the upper thirds feast hollow come onlets begin ill cut the cake soon every girl was munching hard and thinking that food had never tasted quite so nice before janet took an opener and opened a gingerbeer bottle the first one was quite all right and janet filled two toothglasses but the next gingerbeer bottle fizzed out tremendously and soaked the bed that janet was sitting on everyone giggled it went off with a real pop and sounded quite loud in the silence of the night dont worry no one will hear that said janet here pat open the sardines ive got some bread and butter somewhere and well make sandwiches the bread and butter was unwrapped from its paper janet had brought it up from the teatable every girl had taken a piece from the plate at teatime and hidden it to give to janet look take a bite of a sardine sandwich and then a bite of porkpie and then a spoonful of nestlйs milk said pat it tastes gorgeous the chocolate was saved till last by that time the girls were all unable to eat any more and could only suck the sweets and the chocolate they sat about and giggled at the silliest jokes of course the nicest thing of the whole feast was kathleens marvellous cake said hilary the almond icing was gorgeous yes and i had one of the sugar roses said joan lovely however much did you pay for that cake kath it was jolly decent of you oh thats nothing said kathleen fm most awfully glad you liked it she looked very happy there had not been quite enough cake to go round and kathleen hadnt even tasted the marvellous cake but she didnt mind at all she sat quite happily watching the others feast on it then the girls began to press doris to do her clowndance this was a dance she had learnt during the holidays at some special classes and it was very funny doris was full of humour and could make the others laugh very easily the clown dance was most ridiculous because doris had to keep falling over herself she accompanied this falling about with many groans and gurgles which always sent the audience into fits of laughter well dont laugh too loudly this time said doris getting up you made such a row last time i did it in the common room that belinda towers came in and ticked me off for playing the fool she began the dance with a solemn face she fell over the foot of the bed on purpose of course and rubbed herself with a groan the girls began to chuckle their hands over their mouths doris loved making people laugh she swayed about making comical faces then pretended to catch one leg in another and fell clutching at pat with a deep groan with a giggle pat fell too and knocked against the dressingtable the table shook violently and everything on it slid to the floor brushes combs photograph frames toothmugs a gingerbeer bottle goodness what a crash the girls stared in horror the noise sounded simply terrific quick clear everything up and get in to bed cried janet in a loud whisper golly well have half the mistresses here the girls belonging to the next dormitory fled out of the door at once the others cleared up quickly but very soon heard the sound of an electric light being switched on in the passage into bed hissed hilary and they all leapt under the sheets they pulled them up to their thins and lay listening hilary remembered that they had left two gingerbeer bottles out in the middle of the floor and they hadnt had time to clear up the remains of the porkpie either porkpies were so untidy and would scatter themselves in crumbs every time a bite was taken the door opened and some one was outlined against the light from the passage outside pat saw who it was old kenny what bad luck if she discovered anything she would be sure to report it after the bad behaviour of the form but perhaps she wouldnt switch on the dormitory light miss kennedy stood listening one of the girls gave a gentle snore making believe that she was fast asleep but that was too much for kathleen who was already very strung up she gave a smothered giggle and miss kennedy heard it she switched on the light the first thing die saw were the two gingerbeer bottles standing boldly in the middle of the floor then she saw the remains of the porkpie she saw the paper from the chocolate she guessed immediately what die girls had been up to a little smile came over her face what monkeys girls were she remembered the thrill of a midnight feast herself and how she and the others bad been caught and severely punished she spoke in a low voice to hilary the bead of the dormitory hilary are you awake hilary dared not pretend she answered in a sleepy voice hallo miss kennedy is anything wrong i thought i heard a noise from this dormitory said miss kennedy im in charge of it tonight as miss roberts isnt here but i may have been mistaken hilary sat up in bed and saw the gingerbeer bottles she glanced at miss kennedy and saw a twinkle in her eye perhaps you were mistaken miss kennedy she said perhaps perhaps it was mice or something perhaps it was said miss kennedy er well i dont see that theres anything to report to miss roberts but as youre bead of the dormitory hilary you might see that its tidy before matron goes her rounds tomorrow morning good night she switched off the light shut the door and went back to her room the girls all sat up in bed at once and began to whisper my goodness kennys a sport golly she saw those awful gingerbeer bottles all right and fancy agreeing that that terrific noise we made might have been mice and she as good as said we were to remove all traces of the feast and she promised not to report anything to miss roberts though old roberts is a sport too in her way said dons yes but were in her bad books at the moment dont forget and anything like this would just about finish things said isabel good old kenny a lacrosse match and a puzzle the only bad effects of the great midnight feast as it came to be called were that isabel doris and vera didnt feel at all well the next day miss roberts eyed them sharply what have you been eating she asked only what the others have answered doris quite truthfully well go to matron and shell dose you said miss roberts the three girls went off dolefully matron had some most disgusting medicine she dosed the girls generously and they groaned when she made them lick the spoon round then joan and kathleen felt ill and they were sent to matron tooi know these symptoms said matron you are suffering from midnight feast illness aha you neednt pretend to me if you will feast on porkpies and sardines chocolate and gingerbeer in the middle of the night you can expect a dose of medicine from me the next day the girls stared at her in horror how did she know who told you asked joan thinking that miss kennedy had told tales after all nobody said matron putting the cork back firmly into the enormous bottle but i havent been matron of a girls school for twentyfive years without knowing a few things i dosed your mother before you joan and your aunt too they couldnt stand midnight food any more than you can go along now dont stare at me like that i shant tell tales and i always say theres no need to punish girls for having a midnight feast because the feelings they get the next day are punishment enough the girls went away joan looked at kathleen you know i simply loved the porkpie and the sardines last night she said gloomily but the very thought of them makes me feel sick today i dont believe ill ever be able to look a sardine in the face again but every one soon forgot their aches and pains and the feast passed into a legend that was told throughout the school even belinda towers heard about it and chuckled when she was told how everything fell off the dressingtable at the last it was kathleen who told belinda it was rather strange how kathleen had altered during the last few weeks she was no longer nervous and apologetic to every one but took her place happily and laughed and joked like the rest she could even talk to tall belinda towers without stammering with nervousness she was waiting on belinda that week and rushed about quite happily making toast running errands and not even grumbling when belinda sent for her in the middle of a concert rehearsal kathleen was to play in an important lacrosse match that week and so was isabel they were the only firstform girls chosen all the others were second formers at first pat bad been by far the better of the two but isabel soon learnt the knack of catching and throwing the ball in the easiest way and had outstripped her twin the match was to be against the second form of a nearby day school and the girls were very keen about it kathleens goalkeeper said pat to isabel belinda told her today i say isnt kath different i quite like her now yes and shes so generous said isabel she bought some sweets yesterday and shared the whole lot round without having even one herself and she bought some chrysanthemums for vera they must have cost a lot vera was in the sickbay recovering from a bad cold she had been very surprised and touched when kathleen had taken her six beautiful yellow chrysanthemums it was so unlike kathleen who had always been rather mean before kathleen got isabel to practise throwing balls into the goal so that she might get even better at stopping them she was very quick then she and isabel practised catching and throwing the ball and running with it and dodging each other if only only l could shoot two or three goals on saturday isabel said a dozen times a day hilary laughed isabel asked her why im laughing at you said hilary who turned up her nose at lacrosse a few weeks ago you did who said there wasnt any game worth playing except hockey you did who vowed and declared she would never try to be any good at a silly game like lacrosse you did thats why fm laughing i have to sit and bear you raving about lacrosse now talking it all day long it sounds funny to me isabel laughed too but she went rather red i must have seemed rather an idiot she said you were a bit of a goof said janet joining in the stuckup twins thats what we used to call you oh said isabel ashamed she made up her mind to play so well on saturday that her whole form would be proud of her the stuckup twins what a dreadful name she and pat must really do something to make the form forget that saturday came a brilliantly fine winters day the first form were excited the girls from tire dayschool were coining to lunch and they bad to entertain them dinner was to be sausages and mashed potatoes with treacle pudding to follow a very favourite meal now look here isabel and kathleen just see you dont eat too much ordered hilary we want you to play your best youre the only ones from the first form who are playing all lire rest are secondformers well stuff the other school all right give them so much to eat that they wont be able to catch a ball oh i say cant i have two sausages said isabel in dismay and i always have two helpings of treacle pudding well you wont today said janet firmly but if you play well and we win the whole form will stand you creambuns at teatime see so isabel cheered up and went without a second help lag of treacle pudding quite amiably it was a pleasant lunch the guests were all jolly friendly girls and how they laughed when they were told the story of the great feast we cant have fun like that said one of the daygirls we always go home at night whats your lacrosse team like any good weve beaten you each time weve played you so far and i bet well beat them again cried the captain a tall girl with flaming red hair creambuns for you if you stop their goals kathleen cried janet and every one laughed all the first second and third forms turned out to watch the match the fourth form were playing a match of their own away from home and the sixth rarely bothered to watch the juniors some of the fifth turned up among them belinda towers who arranged all the matches and the players for she was sportcaptain and very keen that st clares should win as many matches possible the players took their places isabel was tremendously excited kathleen was quite cool and calm in goal the match began the day girls made a strong team and were splendid runners they got the ball at once and passed it from one to another whenever they were tackled but isabel jumped high into the air and caught the ball as it flew from one day girl to another then she was off like lire wind racing down the field a girl came out to tackle and tried to knock the ball off isabels net but isabel jerked it neatly over her head into the waiting net of another st clare girl and she was off down the field too isabel sped behind and caught the ball again neatly as the other girl threw it when tackled but a very fast girl was after isabel and took the ball from her back the other way raced the daygirl making for the goal she passed the ball to another girl who passed it to a third and the third one shot straight at the goal where kathleen stood on guard swift as lightning kathleen put her net down towards the ball caught it and threw it to isabel who was waiting not far off jolly well saved kathleen roared every one of the st clare girls and kathleen went red with excitement and delight so the match went on till halflime when lemon quarters were taken round on plates to all the hot and panting players how they loved sucking the cool sour lemon the score is threeone said the umpire three to the daygirls of st christophers and one to st clares play up st clares cried belinda play up now isabel score please the second half of the match began the players were not quite so fast now for they were tired but the excitement ran very high especially when st clares shot two goals in quick succession one of them thrown by isabel kathleen hopped about on one leg as tire play went on down the other end of the field she had saved seven goals already down the field raced the players the ball flying from one to another with grace and ease kathleen stood tensely knowing that a goal would be tried tire ball came down on her hard and swift she tried to save the goal but the ball shot into the corner of the net goal fourthree and only five minutes to go then st clares scored a most unexpected goal in the next two minutes and that made the score equal only one and a half minutes more panted isabel to a st clare girl as sire passed her the ball for goodness sake lets get another goal and win the bail came back to her a day girl thundered down on isabel a big burly girl isabel swung round and dodged the ball still in her net she passed it to another girl who neatly passed it back as soon as she was tackled and then isabel took a look at the goal which although a good way away was almost straight in front it was worth a shot she threw the bail hard and straight down the field the goalkeeper stood ready but somehow she missed the ball and it rolled into the net just before the whistle went for time how the st clare girls cheered pat leapt up and down like a mad thing belinda yelled till she was hoarse and hilary and janet thumped one another on the back though neither of them quite knew why good old isabel she saved the match just in time cried pat creambuns for her hot and tired and happy all the girls trooped off the field to wash and tidy themselves before tea janet ran to get her purse to rush off on her bicycle to buy the creambuns but her purse only had a few pence inside how strange janet knew quite well that it had had five shillings in it that very morning and she certainly hadnt spent any of it i say my moneys gone sire said in dismay i cant get the creambuns dash wheres it gone funny said isabel mine went a little while ago and so did hilarys now yours has gone well dont discuss it now said joan weve got to entertain the daygirls but its a pity about the creambuns ill buy them said kathleen ill give you the money janet oh no said janet we wanted to buy them for you and isabel because you did so well in the match we cant let you buy them for yourselves please do said kathleen and she took some money from her pocket here you are buy buns for every one well its jolly decent of you said janet taking the money thanks awfully she sped off on her bicycle whilst the other girls got ready for tea well played kids said belinda towers strolling up you stopped some pretty good goals kathleen and you just about saved the match isabel though all the rest did jolly well too every one glowed at the sportscaptains praise then they sat down to tea and soon the big piles of bread and butter and jam currant buns and chocolate cake disappeared like magic janet was back in a few minutes with a large number of deliciouslooking creambuns the girls greeted them with cheers thanks kathleen youre a brick kathleen everyone cried and kathleen beamed with delight well i did enjoy today said isabel to pat as they went off to the common room together after seeing the daygirls off simply marvellous every bit of it not quite every bit said pat rather gravely what about janets money somebody took that isabel and thats pretty beastly who in the world could it be i simply cant imagine said isabel neither could anyone else the girls talked about it together and wondered who had been near janets coat she had hung it on a peg in the sports pavilion and most of the first and second form had been in and out but surely surely no st clare girl could possibly do such a thing its stealing just plain stealing said hilary and its been going on for some time too because i know besides myself and janet and isabel have lost money belinda lost ten shillings too she made an awful row about it but she never found it could it be one of the maids said joan shouldnt think so said hilary theyve been here for years well we must all be careful of our money thats all and if we cant find the thief well make it difficult for her to be one a very muddled girl one afternoon rita george one of the big girls sent for kathleen to give her some instructions about a nature ramble she was getting up kathleen was head of the nature club in her form she asked pat to finish winding the wool that isabel was holding for her and ran off shant be long she said and disappeared pat wound the wool into balls and then threw them into kathleens workbasket sire looked at her watch i hope kath wont be long she said we are due for gym in five minutes id better go and remind her coming isabel the twins went out and made their way to ritas study meaning to see if kathleen was still there but when they arrived outside they stood still in dismay some one was sobbing and crying inside some one was saying oh please forgive me oh please dont tell anyone please please dont gracious thats not kathleen is it said pat horrified whats happened they did not dare to go in they waited hearing more sobs pitiful heartbroken sobs and they heard ritas rather deep voice sounding very stem they could not hear what she said then the door opened and kathleen came out her eyes red and her cheeks tearstained she sobbed under her breath and did not see the twins she hurried towards the stairs that led to her dormitory pat and isabel stared after her shes forgotten about gym said pat i dont like to go to her in case she hates any one seeing her cry oh lets go and comfort her said isabel well get into a row for being late for gym but its awful to see any one in trouble like that and not see if we can help so they ran up the stairs to the dormitory kathleen was lying on her bed her face buried in her pillow sobbing kathleen whatevers happened asked isabel putting her hand on kathleens shoulder kathleen shook it off go away she said go away dont come peeping and prying after me were not said pat gently whats the matter were your friends you know you wouldnt be if i told you what had happened sobbed kathleen oh do go away fm going to pack my things and leave st clares im going this very night kathleen do tell us whats happened cried isabel did rita tick you off for something dont worry about that its not the ticking off im worrying about its the thing i did to get the ticking off said kathleen she sat up her eyes swollen and red well ill tell you and you can go and spread it all round the school if you like and every one can laugh and jeer at me but ill not be here she began to cry again pat and isabel were very much upset isabel slipped her arm round the sobbing girl all right tell us she said we wont turn on you i promise yes you will yes you will what ive done is so dreadful sobbed kathleen you wont believe it i hardly believe it myself im imim a thief kathleen what do you mean asked pat shocked kathleen stared at her defiantly she wiped her eyes with a hand that shook i took all the money thats been missing she said every bit of it even your two shillings isabel i couldnt bear never having any money of my own and saying no when people wanted subscriptions and not giving any nice birthday presents to any one and being thought mean and selfish and ungenerous i did so want to be generous to everybody and to make friends i do so love giving things and making people happy the twins stared at kathleen in surprise and horror they could hardly believe what she said she went on pouring out her troubles between her sobs i havent a mother to send me money as you and the other girls have my father is away abroad and i only have a mean old aunt who gives me about a penny a week i hated to own up to such a miserable bit of money and then one day i found a shilling belonging to some one and i bought something for somebody with it and they were so terribly pleased and l was so happy i cant tell you how dreadful it is to want to be generous and not to be able to be poor kathleen said isabel and she patted her on the shoulder nobody would have minded at all if only you had told them you hadnt any money we could all have shared with you but i was too proud to let you do that said kathleen and yet i wasnt too proud to steal oh i cant think how i did it now i took janets money and hilarys and belindas it was all so easy and this afternoon l i i she began to cry so bitterly that the twins were quite frightened dont tell us if youd rather not said pat oh ill tell you everything now ive begun said poor kathleen its a relief to tell somebody well this afternoon when i went to ritas study she wasnt there but i saw her coat hanging up and her purse sticking out of it and l went to it and oh rita came in quietly and caught me and shes going to miss theobald about it and i shall be known all over the school as a thief and ill be expelled and she wept again and the twins looked at one another helplessly they remembered all kathleens sudden generosity her gifts the marvellous cake with sugar roses on it the fine chrysanthemums for vera and they remembered too kathleens flushed cheeks and shining eyes when she saw her friends enjoying the things she had bought for them kathleen go and wash your face and come down to gym said pat at last fm not going to said kathleen obstinately im going to stay here and pack i dont want to see anybody again you two have been decent to me but i know in your heart of hearts that you simply despise me we dont kath dear said isabel were terribly terribly sorry for you and we do understand why you did it you so badly wanted to be generous you did a wrong thing to make a right thing and thats never any good please go and leave me alone said kathleen please go the twins went out of the dormitory halfway to the gym isabel stopped and polled at pats arm pat lets go and find rita if we can lets say what we can for poor old kathleen all right said pat the two of them went to ritas study but it was empty blow said pat i wonder if shes gone to miss theobald already well come on lets see said isabel so to the heads room they went and coming out of the door looking very grim indeed was rita george what are you two kids doing here she said and went on her way without waiting for an answer pat looked at isabel shes told miss theobald she said well dare we go in and speak to the head about it i do really think kathleen isnt an ordinary kind of thiefand if she gets branded as one and sent away she may really become one and be spoilt for always come on lets go in they knocked and the head called them to come in she looked surprised to see them well twins she said what is the matter you look rather serious pat didnt quite know how to begin then the words came in a rush and the whole story came out about how kathleen had stolen all the money and why but oh miss theobald kathleen didnt spend a penny on herself said pat it was all for us others she certainly took our money but we got it back in gifts and things she isnt just an ordinary contemptible sort of thief shes terribly terribly upset oh could you possibly do anything about it not send her away not let the school know im quite sure kathleen would try to repay every penny and isabel and i would help her all we could never to do such a thing again you see it was all because kathleen got hardly any pocketmoney and she was too proud to say so and she hated to be thought mean and selfish because really shes terribly generous said isabel miss theobald smiled a very sweet smile at the earnest twins my dears she said you tell me such a different story from rita and im so very glad to hear it rita naturally sees poor kathleen as a plain thief you see her as she is a poor muddled child who wants to be generous and chooses an easy but a very wrong way i am sure i would not have got any explanation from kathleen and i might have written to her aunt to take her away and then i dread what might have happened to her poor sensitive child oh miss theobald do you mean that you will let kathleen stay cried pat of course said the head i must talk to her first and get her to tell me all this herself i shall know how to deal with her dont worry where is she in her dormitory packing said pat miss theobald stood up ill go to her she said now you go off to whatever lesson you are supposed to be at and tell your teacher please to excuse your being late but that you have been with me and i just want to say this i am proud of you both you are kind and understanding two things that matter a great deal blushing with surprise and pleasure the twins held open the door for miss theobald to go out they looked at each other in delight isnt she a sport said pat oh how glad i am we dared to come in and tell her i believe things will be all right for kath now they sped off to gym and were excused for being late they wondered and wondered how kathleen was getting on with miss theobald they knew after tea when kathleen her eyes still red but looking very much happier came up to them im not going said im going to stay here and show miss theobald fm as decent as anyone else shes going to write to my aunt and ask for a proper amount of pocket money to be paid to me and l shall give back all the money i took and start again and if i cant be as generous as id like for a little while ill wait patiently till i can yes and dont be afraid of owning up if you havent got money to spare said pat nobody minds that at all thats just silly pride to be afraid of saying when you cant afford something oh kath im so glad youre not going isabel and i had just got to like you very much youve been good friends to me said kathleen squeezing their arms as she walked between them if ever i can return your kindness i will you will trust me again wont you it would be so awful not to be trusted i couldnt bear that of course well trust you said pat if you go on like that ill get a hundred pounds out of the bank and ask you to keep it for me dont be such a sillybilly miss kennedy again the twins were really beginning to settle down well at st clares they were getting used to being in the lowest form instead of in the top one and they were no longer called the stuckup twins mamzelle had helped them a great deal with their french writing and they bad caught up with the rest of the form miss roberts found that they had good brains and occasionally threw them a word of praise which they treasured very much kathleen was their firm mend she really was a very generoushearted girl and although she now had no longer plenty of money to spend she gave generously in other ways mended pats stockings for her stuck together a favourite vase of mamzelles that got broken and spent what time she could with doris and hilary when they bad to go to the sickmom with flu she knew that she would never be dishonest again and she held her head high and tried to forget the silly things she had done which were now put right miss kennedy had a bit better time for since she had been so nice over their great feast the firstformers behaved better but the second form were not so good they had discovered that miss kennedy was terrified of cats and it was perfectly astonishing the number of cats that appeared at times in the secondform classroom the second form found every cat they could lay hands on and secreted them somewhere in the classroom before their history lesson they bad a big cupboard and this was a good place to hide a cat one morning miss roberts was not well she felt sure that she had flu coming and she retired to bed hoping to ward it off quickly so poor miss kennedy had to tackle both first and second forms together the firstformers went into the secondform classroom as it was much bigger than theirs they entered in an orderly line miss jenks the secondform mistress was there and she gave them their places now sit quietly till miss kennedy comes she said and went off to take needlework with another form as soon as she had gone a perfect babel of noise broke out and to the enormous astonishment of the firstformers a large black cat was produced from the passage where tessie a girl of the second form had hidden the cat in a cupboard the cat was most amiable it arched its back and purred sticking its tail up in the air the twins stared at it in surprise why the cat asked pat is it a member of your class by any chance ha ha funny joke i dont think said pain stroking the cat no pat its just going to give old kenny a fine surprise thats all didnt you know she was terrified of cats were going to shut old blackie up in our handwork cupboard over there and then at a good moment tessie who sits near is going to pull the door open and out will walk dear old blackie large as life and twice as natural and hell make straight for kenny you see if he doesnt the firstformers began to giggle this was marvellous even better than firecracks sh shes coming came a cry from the door where some one was keeping guard to your places put the cat into the cupboard quick tessie the cat went into the cupboard with a rush much to its amazement the door was shut on it kathleen who was passionately fond of animals began to object i say can the cat breathe properly in there ought we to shut up hissed tessie and at that moment in walked miss kennedy her pile of books under her arm she smiled at the girls and sat down she felt very nervous for she did not like handling two forms at once also she felt something was in the air and did not like the one or two chuckles that she heard from the back row her bock dropped to the floor and she bent to pick it up and her belt snapped undone and flew off this really wasnt very funny but it seemed most humorous to the girls in the front row and they bent over their books trying not to laugh miss kennedy knew that they were laughing and she determined to be firm for once any girl who disturbs the class by laughing or playing will stand the whole of the time she announced in as firm a voice as she could every one was astonished to hear the mild miss kennedy make such a statement and for a while the lesson went smoothly tessie was to let the cat out about halfway through the class but the cat thought otherwise it had lain down on the handwork and had got itself mixed up with the coloured raffia that was used by the girls for their basketmaking it tried to lick the raffia off its back legs but couldnt it stood up and shook itself it turned round and round but the more it turned the more entangled it got and at last it became frightened it jumped about on the shelf and some curious noises came from the cupboard at first miss kennedy could not imagine what the noise was the girls knew quite well that it was the cat and they bent their heads over their exercise books doing their best not to laugh the cat got excited it leapt into the air and knocked its head against the shelf above then it scrabbled about and bit savagely at the entangling raffia what is in that cupboard said miss kennedy at last the handwork miss kennedy answered tessie i know that answered miss kennedy impatiently but handwork doesnt make a noise what can be causing all that disturbance it must be mice it certainly wasnt mice it was just poor old blackie going completely mad he tore round and round the big shelf the raffia catching his legs all the time the whole class began to giggle helplessly this is too much said miss kennedy angrily she walked quickly to the handwork cupboard and flung open the door blackie was thrilled and leapt out with an enormous yowl miss kennedy gave a shriek when she saw the big black animal springing out and she rushed to the door blackie went with her thinking she was going to let him out he rubbed against her ankles and miss kennedy went white with fright for she really was quite terrified of cats blackie and miss kennedy went out of the door together parted and fled in opposite directions the girls put down their heads on their desks and almost sobbed with laughter tears trickled out of kathleens eyes and as for the twins they had to hold their sides for they each got dreadful stitches with laughing so much tessie staggered to the door and shut it in case any other mistress came by for at least five minutes the girls let themselves go and laughed till they cried as soon as they stopped some one started them off again oh i say did you see blackie when he shot out cried tessie and every one giggled again it must be mice said doris imitating miss kennedys voice shrieks of laughter again sh said tessie wiping her eyes some one will hear us i say i wonder whats become of old kenny she disappeared into the blue do you suppose shell comeback and finish the lesson but no miss kennedy came back she was sitting in one of the empty common rooms drinking a glass of water and looking very pale she was afraid of cats as some people are afraid of beetles or bats but that was not all that made her feel worried and ill it was the thought of the girls playing the trick on her knowing that she would so easily fall into the trap im absolutely no good at taking a class thought miss kennedy putting down her glass it was all very well when i coached one or two girls at a time but this job is too much for me and yet the money does come in so useful now mother is ill still its no use i must give it up she decided to go down to the town and meet a friend of hers at teatime she would talk over the matter with her then come back and give in her notice to miss theobald confessing that she could neither teach nor keep discipline so down to the town she went at four oclock after telephoning to her friend miss roper to meet her at the teashop and to the same shop went the twins and kathleen having tea there by themselves as a great treat the teashop was divided into little cosy partitions with red curtains and the three girls were already sitting eating buttered buns when miss kennedy and miss roper came in they chose the partition next to the three girls and sat down the girls could not see them but it was possible to hear the voices and they recognized miss kennedys at once listen theres old kenny i bet shes going to talk about the black cat chuckled kathleen the girls had no intention of eavesdropping but they could not help hearing what was said and as they thought kenny began to talk about the mornings happenings but she talked of something else too of her old mother ill and poor of the money that her teaching had so unexpectedly brought in of the bills she had to pay she spoke with sadness of her failure to hold the girls in class im a fraud she told her mend i take the schools money for teaching the girls and i dont teach them a thing because i cant manage them and they just rag me the whole time dont you think i should tell the head this clara its not honest of me to go on leaving my classes because they rag me miss lewis the schools history specialist cant possibly come back till the end of next term but i dont see how i can honestly take her place till then but you do so badly need the money to help your mother whilst shes ill said miss roper its bad luck my dear those girls must be wretches the three girls listened stricken dumb they were horrified what seemed just teasing and ragging to them meant losing a job to somebody else meant being a failure not being able to help a mother when she was ill lets go muttered pat in a low voice we oughtnt to overhear this they crept out unseen by miss kennedy paid their bill and went back to school they all felt unhappy they couldnt let miss kennedy give up her post she was a silly in many ways but she was kind and a real sport and they the girls were wretches oh dash i do feel mean said kathleen sitting down in their common room i just hate myself now i loved the joke this morning but a jokes not a joke when it means real unhappiness to somebody else we cant let kenny go to miss theobald said pat suddenly it would look awful look here weve got to do something for goodness sake think hard isabel looked up theres only one thing to do really she said we ought to get all our form to sign a letter and the second form too apologizing for the trick and swearing we wont rag kenny again and well have to stick to that thats not a bad idea at all said pat kath you go to the second form theyre having a meeting and tell them quite shortly whats happened ill write out the letterand each one of us can sign it kathleen sped off pat took a pen and some notepaper and she and isabel wrote out the letter this is what it said dear miss kennedy we are all ashamed of our behaviour this morning and we do ask you to accept our very humble apologies we didnt mean the cat to jump out at you please forgive us if you will we promise never to rag you again but to behave much better and work hard we thought you were a great sport not to split on us about you know what yours sincerely and then all the names of the girls were to follow written out by each girl the second form came in to sign their names whats you know what asked tessie curiously its our great midnight feast answered pat she knew we bad one and didnt tell now has every one signed you havent lorna put your name at the bottom all the girls felt rather ashamed when they heard kathleens tale of what they bad overheard you shouldnt really have listened said hilary reprovingly its mean to overhear things i know said pat but we really couldnt help it hilary and anyway im glad we did we can stop kenny giving up her job anyway it did prevent miss kennedy from going to miss theobald when she came in that evening she saw the letter on her desk and opened it when she read it the tears came into her eyes what a nice letter she thought the girls are not little wretches after all if only they keep their promise i should be happy teaching them then she thanked each form the next morning and assured them that she forgave them and for the first time that term her lessons went as smoothly as those of the other teachers for the girls bad no intention of breaking their word there would be giggles now and then sly flippings of paper darts but no organized ragging and no unkindness kenny was happy she taught well now that she bad no ragging to fight and the girls became interested and keen im glad we did the decent thing said pat one day after the history lesson i asked old kenny how her mother was today and she said shes much better and is coming out of the nursing home tomorrow wouldnt it have been awful if she had died because we made kenny her job so that her mother couldnt be nursed back to health awful agreed isabel and every one in the form thought the same a broken window one morning hilary came into the common room most excited i say did you know that the circus was coming to field just outside the town well it is i saw the notices up golly i hope were all allowed to go said pat who loved a circus its gallianos circus said hilary and she pulled a handbill out of her pocket look clowns acrobats dancing horses performing dogs everything if only miss theobald gives permission for the school to go miss theobald did she said that each evening two of forms might go with their teachers the first form e thrilled pat isabel kathleen and janet went down town to examine the big coloured posters pasted everywhere they did look exciting then the girls went to see the big tents set up in the field they leaned over the gate td watched the sleek satinskinned horses being galloped round and saw five clumsylooking bears ambling with their trainer they watched in wonder when a big chimpanzee dressed up in trousers and jersey came along hand in band with a small boy who bad a terrier at his heels gracious look at that big monkey cried isabel sammys not a monkey hes a chimpanzee said the boy smiling shake hands sammy the big chimpanzee solemnly held out his band to the girls isabel and kathleen were too afraid to take it but pat put out her hand at once sammy shook it up and down are you coming to see our show asked the boy rather said pat are you in the circus what do you do fm jimmy b own and l go into the ring with my famous dog lucky thats lucky just by your feet she knows how to spell and count oh no dogs cant do that said isabel jimmy laughed well mine can youll see when you come look see that girl over there riding the black horse thats lotta youll see her in the ring too she can ride the wildest horse in the world the girls stared at lotta she was galloping round the field on a beautiful black horse as she came near she suddenly stood up on the horses back and waved to the astonished girls isnt she awfully clever said pat how i wish i could ride like that doesnt she ever fall off of course not said jimmy well i must go come on sammy well look out for you four girls when you come to the show he went off with the chimpanzee and the little dog the girls made their way back to school they were longing for the night to come when they might go to the circus with the first and second forms there are two shows each night said pat one at to and the second at to i wish we were going to the later one it would be sport getting back at eleven oclock no such luck said isabel come on hurry we shall be late for tea but a dreadful blow befell the first form the next morning they came into their classroom chattering as usual and saw that one big pane of the middle window was completely broken miss roberts was at her desk locking stern gracious how did the window get broken cried janet in surprise that is exactly what i would like to know said miss roberts when i was in the common room heard a crash and came to see what caused it i heard the sound of running feet going round the corner of the corridor and when i came into the room i saw the broken window who did it said pat i dont know answered miss roberts but this is what broke the window she held up a hard rubber lacrosse ball i found it still rolling across the floor when i came in somebody must have been playing with it in the classroom and the window was smashed its against the rules to take lacrosse balls out of the locker in the gym unless you go to games as you know every one listened in silence they all felt a little guilty when miss roberts mentioned that it was against the rules to take lacrosse balls because it was a rule nobody bothered to keep any girl slipped to the locker to borrow a ball to play with at break now said miss roberts i want the girl who broke the window to own up now or to come to me at break and tell me then she should of course have stayed to own up as soon as the window was broken but it is quite natural in a moment of fright to run away nobody spoke all the girls sat perfectly still in their seats nobody looked at any one else miss roberts looked searchingly along the rows looking for a guilty face but as half the girls were blushing with sheer nervousness that was no help practically all the class looked guilty and ill at ease they always did when anything went wrong well said miss roberts at last it is quite evident that the culprit is not going to own up now she must come to me at break without fail all you girls have a sense of honour i know and not one of you is a coward so i am quite sure that the culprit will be brave enough to come to me i shall be in the common room alone still nobody said a word one or two looked round at each other and every one wondered who the sinner was pat and isabel smiled nervously at each other they had been together since breakfast so they knew that neither of them was the sinner the first lesson began it was maths miss roberts was not in a good temper and nobody dared to utter a word dark and fair heads were bent busily over books and when the formmistress rapped out an order it was obeyed at once every one knew how dangerous it would be to get into trouble when miss roberts was on the warpath after maths came french mamzelle came into the room and exclaimed at the broken window tiens the window is broken how did that happen we dont know mamzelle said hilary nobody has owned up yet that is abominable cried mamzelle looking round the class with her big dark eyes it is not brave the class said nothing they all felt uncomfortable for it was not nice to think that somebody in the class was a coward still maybe the culprit would own up at break whoever could it be pat and isabel thought hard it couldnt be janet or hilary for both girls were bravespirited and owned to a fault at once it couldnt be kathleen for she had been with them it might be vera or sheila or joan or doris no surely it couldnt be any of them they wouldnt be cowards at break the first form got together and discussed the matter it wasnt us said pat isabel and i were together all the time after breakfast till we went to the classroom and kathleen was with us too well it wasnt me said hilary i was doing a job for rita and it wasnt me said janet i was cleaning the birdtable and doris was helping one by one the girls of the first form all said what they bad been doing between breakfasttime and the first lesson apparently not one of them could have broken the window though one must be telling an untruth after break the girls took their places in their form room miss roberts came in her mouth in a thin line and her hazel eyes cold she looked round the class i am sorry to say that no one has owned up she said so i have had to report the matter to miss theobald she agrees with me that the window must be paid for by the whole class as the culprit hasnt owned up the window is made of vitaglass and will cost twenty shillings to mend miss theobald has decided instead of letting you go to the circus which would cost one shilling each she will use the money for the window there was a gasp of dismay from all the girls not go to the circus that was a terrible blow they looked round one another angry and upset why should the whole class suffer because one person had done a wrong thing it didnt seem fair i am sure that the one who broke the window will not want her whole class to be punished went on miss roberts so i hope she will still own up before the night comes when our form is due to go to the show that is on thursday and i trust that if any of you know who it is you will insist that she does her duty byher form but miss roberts suppose nobody owns up began hilary couldnt we all put a shilling of our own towards the window and still go to the circus no said miss roberts theres no argument hilary what i have said stands and will not be altered open your books at page eightytwo please what a babel there was after morning school was over in the quarter of an hour before dinner how angry and indignant the girls were its a shame cried janet i didnt do it nor did you pat and isabel and we jolly well know it so why should we be punished too well its the custom in schools to make a whole form suffer for one person in a case like this said hilary they do it at my brothers school too though it doesnt happen often i dont see the point of it myself but there you are if only i knew who it was wouldnt i take them by the scruff of the neck and give them a shaking look here what about one of us owning up to it so that the rest can go said kathleen suddenly i dont mind owning up and taking the blame then all you others can go dont be an idiot said pat slipping her arm through kathleens as if wed let you do a thing like that i suppose you didnt do it kath said sheila halflaughing of course she didnt cried isabel she was with pat and me all the time its jolly decent of her to offer to take the blame but i wouldnt dream of it if i heard shed owned up to save our skins id go straight to miss roberts myself and tell her that kathleen couldnt possibly have done it oh well said kathleen i shant say anything of course if you feel like that about it if only we knew which of us had done it the whole of tuesday slipped by and the whole of wednesday still nobody bad owned up when thursday came miss roberts informed the class that the second form were to go to the circus but not the first the class groaned and fidgeted im very sorry said miss roberts its most unfortunate i only hope that the culprit is feeling most unhappy and uncomfortable now no more groaning please lets get on with our geography the four truants that afternoon after tea four girls of the first form held a secret meeting in one of the little music moms they were the twins and kathleen and janet they were all furious because they were not allowed to go that night to the show in the town look here lets go said janet we can slip off at a quarter past eight on our bikes without any one noticing if we go down the path by the lacrosse field and we can get back in the dark all tight but the school doors are locked at ten said kath i know that idiot said janet but whats the matter with a ladder theres one alongside the gardeners shed we can easily get into our dormitory window with that yes but the ladder will be seen the next morning leading up to our window said isabel oh golly havent you any brains sighed janet one of us can go up the ladder and undo the side door to let the others in and we can all take the ladder back to the shed before we go in is that quite clear or shall l say it all over again every one laughed janet was funny when she was impatient i see said pat but gosh if we were caught i dont like to think what would happen to us well dont said janet because we shant be caught miss roberts never puts the light on at night when she comes to our dormitory now we shall be all right we must tell hilary though she wont come with us because shes headgirl and keeps all the rules but she wont stop us going hilary didnt stop them all right she said risk it if you want to i wont stop you but for goodness sake dont get caught the second form went off to the circus with miss jenks the first form stayed behind sulky and angry only the four who were going to slip off by themselves looked at all bright most of the first form knew what janet had planned but nobody else dared to risk it youll get expelled if youre caught i shouldnt wonder said doris we shant be expelled and we shant be caught said janet firmly when the time came the four girls put on their hats and coats and slipped down to the sidedoor it was dark outside but the night was dear coming home there would be a moon they went softly to the bicycle shed golly what a noise bikes make whispered janet as the four machines clanked and rattled now down the path by the field come on off they all rode their lamps shining in the darkness when they arrived at the circus field they saw the people streaming out of the gates they had been to the performance look out hide by the hedge till every ones gone said janet we dont want to run into miss jenks they hid until it was safe they pushed their bicycles behind the hedge and went to the gate where people were already going in under the flare of acetylene lamps the girls paid and went towards the big circus tent soon they had taken their seats well at the back in case any one saw them they took off their school hats the circus was marvellous they saw the girl lotta now dressed in a sparkling shining frock riding bareback around the ring standing on her horse kneeling jumping smiling all the time they saw jimmy and his dog lucky and could not imagine how he had been trained to be so clever they cheered the absurd clowns and the amazing acrobats they loved big mr galliano with his cracking whip and big moustaches it was a gorgeous show and the four girls enjoyed every minute wed better slip out a bit before the end whispered janet watching sammy the chimpanzee solemnly undress himself and put on a pair of pyjamas i say isnt he funny oh look hes getting into bed just before the show was finished the girls slipped out quietly everyone was intent on watching the five bears ho were now playing ringaringofroses with their trainer all fall down chanted the trainer and just as the four girls went out down fell the five bears in the ring for all the world as if they were children what a marvellous show said janet as they made their way to where they had left their bicycles wheres my bike oh here it is they mounted their bicycles and rode off the moon was up now and they could see clearly they were soon back at the school they put their bicycles into the shed as quietly as they could and then with beating hearts they tiptoed to the shed outside which the ladder was kept they all felt excited and nervous just suppose they were caught now it would be awful but nobody was about a dim light showed from a mistresss bedroom in the eastern wing of the school it was about eleven oclock and all the girls and some of the mistresses would be asleep they looked for the ladder there were two a small one and a much bigger one janet tugged at the smaller one i should think this one will just about reach she said so the four of them carried it to where their dormitory windows shone in the moonlight they kept in the dark shadows and were as quiet as they could be they set the ladder up gently against the wall but to their great dismay it didnt nearly reach to the windowsill dash said janet look at that its much too dangerous to try and climb to the sill from the top of the ladder its so far below the window well come on lets take it back and get the other ladder thats long enough to reach to the roof i should think they took the small ladder back and put it down gently but then they found they could not possibly carry the big ladder it was enormously heavy and needed two or three gardeners to handle it the four girls could hardly move it and certainly would not be able to set it up against the wall they stood in the moonlight and stared at one another in dismay now what are we going to do asked isabel her voice quivering we cant stay out here all night of course not silly said janet well try all the doors maybe well find one thats unlocked cheer up so they tiptoed round the school trying the doors but every one of them was safely locked and bolted the maids did their work well kathleen began to cry she did not want to be caught breaking the rules because she had tried very hard to be in miss theobalds good books since she had been forgiven for her fault it suddenly seemed a very dreadful thing to her to be out of doors when all the others were in bed and asleep we shall be discovered in the morning she whispered and we shall catch our deaths of cold staying out here shut up and dont be such a baby said janet fiercely i know what we can do well throw little pebbles up to our dormitory window said pat they will make a rattling noise and maybe one of the girls will wake then she can slip down and open a door for us good idea said janet pick up tiny pebbles everyone they scooped handfuls up from the gravel and threw them up but kathleen threw very badly and her pebbles rattled against the wrong window the one above the dormitory where mamzelle slept and mamzelle awoke quick back into the shadows whispered janet urgently idiot you hit mamzelles window the big dark head of mamzelle locked out and they heard her mutter to herself they squeezed together in a corner hardly daring to breathe terrified that mamzelle would see them but the shadows were black and she could see nothing puzzled and yawning deeply she went back to her bed the girls stayed where they were for a few minutes and then began to whisper this is awful really awful what are we going to do i do wish we hadnt slipped off to the circus im so cold my teeth are chattering then pat clutched hold of isabels arm and whispered loudly look look isnt that some one looking out of our dormitory window they all looked up and sure enough a girls head was peeping from the window pat slipped out of the shadows and stood in the moonlight hilarys voice came down to her in a whisper pat how late you are where are the others here whispered pat the ladders arent any good open the sidedoor here and let us in hilary quick were so cold hilary drew in her head and disappeared a minute later the four girls heard the key turning in the lock of the sidedoor and the bolts being slipped backand the door was open they crept in quietly and hilary locked and bolted the door once more they all slipped upstairs like mice and tiptoed in their stockinged feet to their dormitory once there they sank on to janets bed and began to giggle from sheer excitement and relief they told hilary all that had happened doris woke up and joined the little group the four truants began to feel much better now that they were safe and boasted of all they had done did you hear our pebbles rattling on the window asked janet of hilary why did you come to the window golly wasnt i glad to hear your voice your pebbles came rattling on to the floor said hilary with a laugh the window was open at the bottom i left it like that for you to climb in when i heard the sound of pebbles all over the lino i woke up at first i couldnt imagine what the noise was then i switched on my torch and saw the bits of gravel well have to sweep those up in the morning janet yawned tm so tired she said the circus was marvellous i wish you could have seen it hilary so do i said hilary buck up and get undressed now for goodness sake and dont make too much noise or youll wake mamzelle her rooms just above remember we know that all right said pat giggling as she remembered mamzelles dark bead sticking out of the window wheres my nightie oh blow wheres it gone you wont find it on my bed silly said isabel who was already undressed and in her nightgown youve got muddled thats your bed over there and theres your nightie on the pillow oh yes said pat yawning i wish i could go to sleep in my clothes soon all the dormitory was quiet once more and every girl was asleep the four truants slept peacefully but there was a shock in store for them in the morning a great disappointment the four truants were extremely sleepy the next day they could hardly wake up when the dressingbell went not one of them got out of bed hi janet kathleen arent you going to get a move on cried hilary youll be late and just look at those lazy twins they havent even opened their eyes another five minutes murmured pat sleepily but the five minutes stretched into ten and still the four girls hadnt moved hilary winked at doris and the two of them went swiftly to the four white beds and snipped off all the bedclothes throwing them on the floor oooooh shivered the girls for it was a very cold morning you mean things come on get up or youll get into a row said hilary and very slowly and sleepily the four dressed yawning all the time they cheered up a bit when the rest of the form clustered round them asking what happened the night before they really felt almost heroines as they related their exciting adventures i dont feel in the least like lessons this morning said janet oh my goodness miss roberts is taking us for algebra isnt she i always am stupid about that anyhow and i shant be able to understand a thing today i hope shes in a good temper the class went into their form room and took their places janet got out her algebra book and hurriedly glanced through the chapter she had been told to learn it seemed to her as if she had entirely forgotten every word but that was just because she had had such a short night here comes miss roberts hissed doris who was at the door the girls stood miss roberts came in and goodness whatever could have happened she looked very pleased and her eyes sparkled so that she looked really pretty sit girls she said and the girls sat down wondering why their mistress looked so pleased had they done some marvellous prep or something girls said miss roberts i feel very happy about something this morning i have found out that it was not any one in my form who broke the window the girls looked at her amazed miss roberts smiled round the class it was one of the second form she said apparently the ball bounced in here the girl rushed for it tried to catch it and it was knocked on to the window which broke but why didnt she own up cried hilary indignantly that was jolly mean of her we missed going the circus because of that wait said miss roberts the girl was queenie who as you know is now in the sickroom with bad attack of flu she was frightened when she broke the window but meant to own up at the end of the morning in the middle of the morning she was taken ill and was hurried off to the sickroom where she has been really ill for a few days today die is better and her formmistress miss jenks went to see her did she own up then asked janet miss jenks told her that the second form had gone the circus the night before but not the first form and queenie asked why said miss roberts when she card that you had all been punished for something that was her fault she was very upset and began to cry she told miss jenks of course and miss jenks came hurrying to tell me oh i am glad it wasnt anybody in our form said hilary i did hate to think that somebody was such a mean coward and i couldnt understand it either said miss roberts i think i know you all pretty well and although you are sometimes very stupid aggravating and in fact set of nuisances i really couldnt believe that any of you were cowards miss roberts smiled as she made these remarks and the class laughed they were all most relieved can we go to the circus after all then asked hilary theres still tonight or tomorrow of course said miss roberts you are to go to morrow miss theobald says and to make up for your disappointment which was quite undeserved i am to take you down into the town and give you a real good tea first what do you think of that the girls thought a lot of it they said oooh and ah and rubbed their hands together and looked as cheerful as possible tea first a really scrumptious tea and then the circus and it was sure to be good fun on the last night of all what luck that queenie had owned up in time but there were four girls who were feeling most uncomfortable about the whole thing and they were the twins and kathleen and janet they had played truant and seen the show they looked at one another and felt very guilty why hadnt they waited they went to hilary about it afterwards hilary we feel awfully mean now somehow do you think we ought to go tomorrow asked pat well if you dont what excuse will you make said hilary since you ask me i say you jolly well oughtnt to go youve had your pleasure by breaking the rules well every one breaks rules sometimes so im not blaming you for that the thing is its not fair that you should have a second treat i should feel like that myself just as you do but if you go and tell miss roberts why you certainly will get into a firstclass row could we say we dont feel well said isabel i really dont feel awfully well today i had so little sleep well say that tomorrow said hilary but i say its bad luck on you isnt it youve done yourself out of a gorgeous tea and every one knows that a saturday night is the best night to see a show i wish we hadnt been so impatient now sighed kathleen i would so love to go with you tomorrow the four were very sad they talked about it together lets go anyhow said janet then almost immediately she changed her mind no we cant id feel mean all the time and the other girls would think us mean too i only hope miss roberts doesnt send us to matron for some of her disgusting medicine when we tell her we dont feel well tomorrow said kathleen who was a perfect coward over taking medicine but when the next day came there was no question of telling a story about feeling unwell for all four girls had bad colds they had caught a chill standing about waiting to get into the school on thursday night and how they sneezed and coughed miss roberts noticed at once youd better spend a day in bed she said you may be in for flu go along to matron and ask her to take your temperatures four of you at once wherever could you all have caught such bad colds they didnt tell her they went to matron feeling very sad and sorry kathleen had a temperature and as matron was not at all sure that the whole lot were not going to have flu she did the sensible thing and popped them all into bed she gave them each a dose out of one of her enormous bottles tucked them up and left them in the sickroom together atishoo sneezed kathleen golly werent we idiots to rush off like that the other night i do hate having a beastly cold like this and missing that tea sighed pat hilary said miss roberts had rung up the teashop and made sure that they had those special chocolate cakes we like well its no use grumbling said isabel sensibly we brought this on ourselves now shut up you others i want to read the first form went off at five with miss roberts and had a gorgeous tea miss roberts bought four of the special chocolate cakes to take back to the girls in the sickroom i think they have been perfect bricks about all this she said to hilary not a grumble not one word of complaint hilary said nothing miss roberts would have been astonished if she bad known the real reason why the four truants were not at the circus but hilary was certainly not going to tell her the circus was at its best that night and afterwards the girls were allowed to go behind the ring and see the performers at close quarters sammy the chimpanzee was delighted to see them and kept taking off his cap to them most politely jumbo the enormous elephant blew down hilarys neck and lifted her curls as if they had been blown by the wind lotta let them all stroke her magnificent horse black beauty altogether it was a marvellous evening the girls went back tired but very happy and talkative miss roberts slipped into the sickroom to see if the four girls were awake matron was just tucking them up for the night theres nothing much wrong with them she told miss roberts kathleens temperature is down to normal theyve just got ordinary bad colds thats all as tomorrow is sunday ill keep them in bed one more day ive brought them some of the special chocolate cakes we always have at the teashop said miss roberts i suppose they mustnt have them now oh they can if they feel like it said matron smiling it wont hurt them all four girls felt like chocolate cakes immediately and sat up they thought it was jolly kind of miss roberts to think of them they munched their cakes and listened to their teachers recital of the evenings happenings didnt you think sammy the chimpanzee was funny when he undressed himself and got into bed asked kathleen eagerly quite forgetting that miss roberts had no idea she had seen the circus miss roberts stared in surprise kathleen saw the posters in the town said pat hurriedly glaring at the unfortunate kathleen with rage i think its time the girls settled down now miss roberts said matron coming in luckily for the four at that very moment miss roberts said good night at once and went they girls lay down whilst matron fussed round a bit then turned out the light and went idiot kathleen said janet you nearly gave us all away sorry said kathleen sleepily i quite forgot no more talking said matron putting her head round the door another word and ill come in and give you all a dose of my very nastiest medicine and after that there wasnt a word a terrible quarrel the weeks went quickly by halfterm came and went the twins mother came to see them at halfterm and took them out in the car for the day she was glad to see them looking so well and happy well how are you getting on she asked i hope youre not finding st clares quite as bad as you feared the twins blushed its not a bad school said pat its quite decent said isabel their mother smiled to herself she knew the twins so well and their few words meant that they liked st clares and were happy every week there were lacrosse matches sometimes they were played by the lower forms sometimes by the upper the twins became very keen indeed and used to watch all the upper form matches with great enjoyment they thought belinda towers was marvellous she was as swift as the wind and her catching was beautiful to watch do you remember how rude we were to her at the beginning of the term said pat golly i wonder how we dared now we were awful idiots said isabel honestly i wonder how everyone put up with us well theres one person i simply cant put up with said pat and thats sheila naylor what is the matter with her shes so awfully haughty and conceited always talking about her marvellous home and the number of servants they keep and her horse and their three motorcars always pushing herself forward and airing her opinions which arent worth twopence anyway everyone found sheila very trying indeed she was always doing her best to impress people and to make them think that she was wonderful actually she was a plain and ordinary girl with rather had manners who didnt speak very well all her clothes were good and she went to no end of trouble to buy the best of everything and yet she never brushed her hair really well and if she could forget to wash her neck she would the most impatient girl in the first form was janet she could not bear vanity or conceit and sheilas airs and graces irritated her beyond words she hadnt the patience to put up with sheila and usually sheila knew this and kept out of her way one afternoon just before tea the first form were enjoying themselves in their common room pat put on the gramophone and played the same record four times running janet looked up for goodness sake are you trying to learn that record by heart pat take it off and break it if i have to hear it again ill scream you didnt ought to talk like that began sheila in a mincing voice and janet flung down her book in a rage hark at sheila didnt ought to good heavens sheila where were you brought up havent you learnt by now that decent people dont say didnt ought to my goodness you talk about your servants and your rolls royce cars your horse and your lake and goodness knows what and then you talk like the daughter of the dustman sheila went very white pat hurriedly put on another record janet took up her book again still angry but rather ashamed if sheila had said nothing more the whole thing might have blown over but after a while sheila raised her voice and addressed janet im sure that if my people knew that i had to put up with girls like you janet they would never have sent me to st clares she began youve no manners at all you manners you talk about manners raged janet flinging down her book again good heavens what about your own manners i should like to know you can begin to talk about other peoples when you know how to wash your neck and brush your hair and how to eat decently and then you pretend you are too grand for us huh janet stamped out of the room sheila sat perfectly still very pale the twins glanced at her and pat put on yet another record setting it at loud what an awful quarrel after a while sheila went out of the room pat switched off the gramophone didnt she look awful she said to isabel i wish janet hadnt said all that its true its what weve all thought and perhaps said to one another in joke but its rather awful to blurt it all out like that well its partly sheilas own silly fault said hilary if she wouldnt swank as she does and try to make out shes someone marvellous we wouldnt notice so easily the stupid things she does and says i mean to say if people swank about five different bathrooms one pink one blue one green one yellow and one mauve and then dont trouble to wash their necks you do notice it rather yes shes funny about her bathrooms said isabel shes funny altogether shes the only girl in the form that i really and truly dont know at all i mean i dont know if shes generous or mean kind or unkind honest or dishonest truthful or untruthful jolly or serious because shes always pretending about herself putting on airs and graces swanking being somebody that she isnt she might be quite nice for all we know i shouldnt think so said hilary who was heartily tired of sheila and her nonsense honestly i think shes batty sheila didnt come in for tea but nobody missed her when she didnt attend evening preparation in the form room miss roberts sent pat to find her pat hunted all over the place and at last came across sheila sitting in a deserted and cold little music room all by herself sheila what in the world are you doing asked pat have you forgotten its prep tonight sheila sat still and said nothing pat looked at her closely she looked ill dont you feel well asked pat ill take you to matron if you like whats up sheila old girl nothing said sheila well what are you sitting here for all in the cold asked pat dont be an idiot if youre not ill come along to prep miss roberts is getting all hot and bothered about you im not coming said sheila i cant face you all again after what janet said well really fancy taking any notice of janet said pat feeling worried you know how she loses her temper with all of us and says things she doesnt mean shes forgotten all about it by now come along she didnt say things she didnt mean thats the whole point said sheila still in the same quiet rather queer voice she said things she did mean oh i hate her you cant hate old janet said pat shes dreadfully quicktempered and impatient but shes very kind too she wouldnt really hurt you sheila look here with me to matron perhaps youve got a temperature leave me alone said sheila obstinately so in despair pat left her feeling very worried what a pity janet had flared out like that and said those really dreadful things pat knew how she would feel if anyone sneered at her in that way in front of every one she wondered what to do what should she tell miss roberts on her way back to the form room she passed the headgirls study the door was a little open and pat could just see winifred james bent over a book she hesitated outside as a thought came into her head she couldnt tell miss roberts about the awful quarrel but could she tell winifred something had got to be done about sheila and she simply didnt know what she knocked at winifreds door come in said the headgirl and raised her serious face as pat came in hallo is there anything the matter asked winifred oughtnt you to be at prep yes i ought said pat but miss roberts sent me to find somebody and im rather worried about this girl winifred but i cant possibly tell miss roberts so can l tell you of course said winifred so long as it isnt just telling tales patricia of course its not winifred said pat i would never tell tales but i suddenly remembered that you and this girl come from the same town so i thought maybe you could help a bit this is very mysterious said winifred whats it all about then pat explained about the quarrel and told the headgirl all that had happened and sheila looks so funny and so ill she said im afraid its something worse than just a silly quarrel winifred listened in silence im glad you came to me she said it so happens im the only person that can help a little because i know sheilas history you are a sensible person pat so i shall tell you a little and perhaps between us we can help sheila i hope we can said pat i dont like her winifred in fact i hardly know her at all because shes always hidden behind conceit and swank if you know what i mean but shes awfully unhappy and i hate to see that sheilas parents were once very poor said winifred her mother was the daughter of our gardener her father kept a kind of village stores he made a great deal of money an enormous fortune in fact so they rose tremendously in the world now they have a wonderful house almost a mansion goodness knows how many servants and cars and they sent sheila to the best schools possible because they wanted their daughter to be a lady oh said pat suddenly understanding a lot of things so thats why poor sheila is always swanking and being haughty and arrogant and showing off because shes afraid well not want to be friends with her shes afraid we might sneer at her yes her stupid haughtiness is just a sort of smokescreen to hide the plain ordinary rather frightened person she is underneath said winifred and now you see what as happened janet has blown away the smokescreen and pointed out to every one just those things that sheila is always trying to hide the manners and speech she learnt when she was very small but how awfully silly of sheila to pretend like that said pat if shed told us honestly that her people had made a lot of money and how pleased she was to be able to conic to st clares and all that wed have understood and liked her for it but all that silly conceit and pretence honestly winifred it was awful when people feel that they are not so clever so good r so wellborn as others they often behave like that to hide their feelings of inferiority said winifred sounding rather learned to pat be sorry for them and help them well how can i help sheila asked pat i really dont see how i can ill go to her myself said winifred getting up all i want you to do and isabel too is to be extra nice to her for a week or two and not to laugh at her or point out anything that might hurt her now that janet has dragged away the wall sheila set up around herself and shown what a poor thing there is behind it she will want a little friendship and understanding if shes got any common sense shell drop her airs and graces after this and youll have a chance of finding out what the real sheila is like but do give her a chance wont you of course i will said pat thanks awfully winifred ill go back to prep now what winifred ad to sheila the twins never knew the head girl was wise beyond her years and handled the shocked and distressed girl with understanding and gentleness sheila appeared in the common room that night pale and nervous and would not meet any ones eyes but pat came to her rescue at once sheila youre just the person i wanted please tell me where ive gone wrong in this jumper im knitting youre so clever at following patterns and i get all muddied look did i go wrong there or was it here sheila gladly went to pats side and was soon showing her how to put the wrong stitch right when that was done isabel called to her hi sheila will you lend me your paints i cant imagine whats happened to mine yes of course said sheila and went to fetch her paints janet looked up as soon as she was out of the room why all this sudden friendship for our haughty sheila she asked to make up a bit for the beastly things you said to her said pat give her a chance janet youve bit her hard on her tenderest places and taken all the stuffing out of her good thing too said janet gruffly she needed it well shes bad it so now give her a chance said pat dont be small janet im not said janet im jolly sorry for what i said now though you may not think it all right ill do my best but im not going to say im sorry if i do itll get all hot and bothered again but i dont mind showing im sorry better still said isabel look out here she comes sheila came in with the paints thanks said isabel golly what a lovely box usually sheila would have said at once what the box had cost and would have boasted about it but she said thing janet glanced at her and saw that she was stillle janet was kindhearted and generous although her tongue could be sharp and bitter and her temper was a she got down a tin of toffees from her shelf and handed them round sheila expected to be missed out and looked away toffee for you sheila old girl said janet in her ear pleasant voice sheila looked at janet and hesitated she still felt sore and angry with her but janets brown eyes were kind and soft and sheila knew that she was trying to make peace she swallowed her feelings and put out her hand to take a toffee thanks janet she said in rather a shaky voice then all the girls plunged into a discussion of the play they were going to prepare for christmas and in the inrest of it all sheila forgot the quarrel sucked her toffee and grew happier she thought hard when she went to bed that night she shouldnt have boasted and bragged but she had only done it because she knew she wasnt as good as the others and she wanted to hide it and all the time the girls had seen her weak spots and must have laughed at her well if only they would be friendly towards her and not sneer at her she would try not to mind she as not a brave girl and not a very sensible one but at night she was brave enough and sensible enough see that money and servants and cars didnt matter at all it was the person underneath that mattered and now ill do what winifred said i must do show the girls the person i am underneath thought poor sheila turning over in bed i dont think im much of a person really but anyway ill be better than that awful conceited creature ive pretended to be for a year and that was the end of sheilas haughty and boastful manner the other girls followed the example of janet and the twins and were friendly to sheila and gave her a chance she took the chance and although as she had feared she wasnt much of a person at first nevertheless the rather mouselike gentle sheila was much nicer than the girl she had been before as time went on she would become somebody real and then as pat said she would be worth having for a friend i shall always give people a chance now pat said to isabel look at kathleen what a brick she is and sheilas so different already well said janet who overheard i should jolly well think you would give people a chance didnt we all give you two a chance my goodness you were pretty unbearable when you came i can tell you but youre not so bad now in fact youre quite passable pat and isabel picked up cushions and rushed at the quicktongued janet with squeals and shrieks she tried to get away but they pummelled her unmercifully we shant give you a chance you wretch giggled isabel you dont deserve one ow stop pinching you brute well get off my middle then panted janet wait till i get hold of a cushion but they didnt wait they tore off to gym with janet after them bumping into half a dozen girls on the way those firstform kids said tessie in disgust honestly they ought to be in a kindergarten they way they behave sheila does her bit only four weeks remained of the winter term the girls were busy with plays songs and sketches ready for the end of the term the first form were doing a historical play with miss kennedy and thoroughly enjoying themselves miss kennedy had written the play herself with the girls all helping where they could miss ross the sewing mistress was helping with the costumes it was great fun you know old kenny is a good sort said pat who was busily learning her part for the play its funny i hardly ever think of playing about in her lesson now i suppose its because were all so interested in the play well i wish i was as interested in our french play groaned doris whose french accent drove mamzelle to despair i simply can not roll my rs in my throat like the rest of you rrrrrrrr every one laughed at doriss funny efforts to say the letter r in the french way dons had no ear for either music or languages and was the despair of both the music mistress and mamzelle but she was a wonderful dancer and her sense of humour sent the class into fits of laughter half a dozen times a day it was fun preparing for the christmas concert all the different forms were doing something and there were squabbles over using the gym for rehearsals miss thomas the gym mistress complained that the gym was used for everything else but its proper purpose these days lessons went on as usual of course and miss roberts refused to allow the christmas preparations to make any difference at all to the work her form did for her she was very cross with pat when she found that was secretly learning her part in the play when she should have been learning a list of grammar rules she had copied out her words and had neatly fitted them into her grammar book she had a good part in the play and was very anxious to be wordperfect for the rehearsal that afternoon i think pat that you must have got the wrong page in your grammar book said miss roberts suddenly bring it to me pat went red she got up with her book she dropped it purposely on the floor so that it shut and then picked it up hoping that miss roberts would not notice the words of the play inside but miss roberts did of course her sharp eyes missed nothing i thought so she said dryly taking out the neatlycopied playwords when is the rehearsal this afternoon miss roberts said pat well you will learn your grammar rules instead of going to the rehearsal said miss roberts that seems quite fair to me and i hope it does to you if you learn your part in the play during grammar time then it seems just that you should learn your grammar rules in rehearsal time pat looked up in dismay oh miss roberts please dont make me miss rehearsal ive got an important part in the play you know yes and next year this form has important exams to take said miss roberts well ill give you one more chance pat no more of this please learn those rules now and say them to me at the end of the morning if they are correct ill let you off go back to your seat pat went to the rehearsal of course it was just no good at all trying to play any tricks in miss roberts class and she had had to learn her grammar in break in order to get it perfect for miss roberts by the end of the morning but every one liked the formmistress she was strict could be very severe and sarcastic but she was always perfectly just and never went back on what she said or promised mamzelle was not always just but she was so goodhearted that very few of the girls really disliked her what with working up for the end of term exams and the concert the girls had very little time to themselves but they enjoyed every minute doris was to dance a solo dance that she had created herself vera was to play the piano at which she was extremely good five of the girls were in the french play and most of them in the history play everybody was in something except one person sheila was in nothing this happened quite by accident at first mamzelle had said she was to be monsieur toctoc in the play so miss kennedy didnt put her in the history play and then mamzelle changed her mind and put joan into the french play instead so sheila was in neither and as she didnt play the piano or the violin could not recite at all and was no good at dancing she felt very leftout she said nothing at first nobody noticed that she wasnt going to be in anything because it had all happened accidentally then isabel noticed that sheila was looking mopey and asked her why whats up had bad news from home or something oh no said sheila nothings wrong isabel said no more but watched sheila for a few days she soon noticed that she was not in either of the plays and was not doing anything by herself either i say i believe youre miserable because youre not in the concert said isabel i thought you were going to be in the french play i was said sheila uncomfortably but then mamzelle chose some one else im not in anything and every one will notice it isabel i do so hate being left out well it wasnt done on purpose silly said isabel laughing i feel as if it was said sheila i know im not much good at anything but it doesnt make it any better when im not even given the chance to do anything oh dont be an idiot said isabel sheila looked obstinate like many weak people she could be really pigheaded well im fed up she said i shant go to the rehearsal or anything ill just go off by myself well anyway you might at least take an interest in what the form is doing even if youre not doing anything yourself cried isabel indignantly thats mean and stupid ill be mean and stupid then said sheila almost in tears and she went off by herself isabel told pat oh blow said pat just as we were getting sheila to be sensible too and giving her a chance dont lets bother about her if she wants to feel shes left out and slighted when she isnt let her janet came up and listened to the tale she had been very good to sheila the last week or two for she had really felt very guilty over her loss of temper she looked thoughtful now no dont lets undo the good work weve been trying to do she said lets think of something i know once i was left out of a match when i badly wanted to be in it and although im not such a silly as sheila still i did feel pretty awful i remember thinking that the whole school would be whispering about me wondering what i had done to be out of the match the twins laughed janet was so sensible and jolly that they couldnt imagine her worrying about a thing like that its all very well to laugh said janet you are twins and have always got each other to back up and laugh over things with but when youre a naturally lonely person like sheila its different little things get awfully big you are sticking up for sheila all of a sudden said pat in surprise no im not all i say is dont lets spoil what weve been trying to do said janet impatiently oh well you think of something then said isabel i cant the twins went off janet sat down and began to think she was impatient and impulsive but once she had set her hand to anything she wouldnt give up sheila wanted help again and janet was going to give it gosh ive got it said janet to herself well make her prompter of course we need some one at rehearsals with the book ready to prompt any of us who forgets and my goodness i forget my words all right ill go and ask sheila if shell be prompter at rehearsals and on the concert night too she went off to find sheila it was some time before she found her and then at last she ran her to earth in the art room tidying out the cupboards i say sheila will you do something for us cried janet will you be prompter for the play we get into an awful muddle trying to prompt each other and it would be an awful help to have some one with the book who will follow the words and help when we go wrong i wouldnt be any good at that said sheila rather sullenly oh yes you would idiot said janet it would be such a help sheila please do some of us are sure to be nervous on the concert night too and it would be nice to know you were at the side ready to prompt us with the words all right said sheila rather ungraciously she had felt that if she wasnt in the plays she jolly well wouldnt help at all but that was small and mean and sheila was doing her best not to be that so she became prompter and attended all the rehearsals with the book of words she soon began to enjoy it all and loved the play she did nothing but stand or sit with the book prompting those who forgot whilst the others had the fun of acting but she didnt grumble or complain and the twins secretly thought she was behaving rather well good for janet to have thought of that said pat yes she thought sheila was going to refuse said isabel im not at all sure i wouldnt have said no if it had been me i shouldnt have let you said pat two weeks before the end of the term an accident happened vera a very quiet girl in the first form fell during gym and broke her arm she broke it just by the wrist and had to be taken off to hospital to have it xrayed it was set in plaster and her parents decided that as it was so near the end of the term she might as well go home instead of staying the last two weeks its her right arm so she wont be able to write at all said her mother to miss theobald it would be just as well for her to be quiet at home so poor vera said goodbye and went promising to be back the next term with her arm mended again and then there was consternation in the class because vera had an important part in the play golly whats to be done said pat in dismay no one else can possibly learn all the words in time vera had such a big part every one stared round in despair those who were not in the play felt perfectly certain that they could not possibly learn the big part in so short a time and then janet spoke theres some one who does know all the words she cried sheila you do youve been prompting us at every rehearsal and you know every part youre the only one whos been following the words page by page in the book cant you take veras part sheila went bright red all the girls looked at her expectantly go on say you will said pat you can do it just as well as vera i should love to said sheila im sure i could do it i know every word well i know every word of every part now of course but id just love to do veras part i like it best of all good cried pat thats settled then well get some one else to be prompter and you must be in the play so at the next rehearsal sheila was not prompter but took one of the most important parts she was quite wordperfect and because she had so often watched vera doing the part she was able to act it very well every one was pleased they had all known that sheila was hurt because she had been left out of everything by accident and had admired her for taking on the rather dull job of prompter and now that she had had such an unexpected reward the whole form was delighted but nobody was more delighted than sheila herself she was really thrilled with her good luck she went about with a smiling face and was so unexpectedly fly that the class could hardly believe it was sheila but sheila did not forget to write and tell vera how sorry she was to hear about her accident she remembered some one elses disappointment in the middle of her own pleasure yes sheila was well on the way to becoming somebody now kathleen has a secret one afternoon when pat isabel and kathleen were coming back from the town across the fields they heard a whining noise from the hedge thats a dog said kathleen at once and she ran to see the others followed and there in the ditch they saw a halfgrown roughhaired terrier its chest and face bleeding its been shot cried kathleen indignantly look at all the pellets in its poor legs oh its that hateful fanner who lives over the hill he always swears hell shoot any dog that goes wandering in his fields but why asked pat in surprise dogs go all over the fields yes but sheep are in these fields and soon the lambs will be born said kathleen dogs chase sheep you know and frighten them well this poor animal has been shot said pat what are we going to do with it im going to take it back to school with me and look after it said kathleen she was quite crazy over animals the twins looked at her in astonishment you wont be able to keep him said pat and anyway you ought to ring up the police and report him suppose his owner is looking for him well ill ring up and see if any one has been asking for him said kathleen but if you think fm going to leave a dog bleeding all by itself out in the fields youre jolly well mistaken all right all right said isabel but how are you going to take him home hell cover you with blood as if i care about that said kathleen picking the dog up very gently he whined again but snuggled down into the girls aims knowing quite well that they were kind and friendly they walked back to school with the dog they debated where to put him no girl was allowed to keep a dog and if he were discovered he would certainly be sent off and kathleen was quite determined that she was going to nurse him till he was better could we keep him in the bicycle shed asked pat oh no he would be much too cold said kathleen standing behind the bushes with the dog in her arms pondering how to get him into school without being seen wait a minute lets think they all thought then pat gave an exclamation i know i what about that little boxroom near the hot tank upstairs in the attics hed be warm there and right away from every one nobody ever goes there and were not supposed to either said isabel dash we always seem to be doing things we oughtnt to do well this is for the dogs sake said kathleen im willing to do anything poor darling dont whine like that i promise ill make you better soon janet came round the corner and saw the three of them standing by the bushes hallo she said whats up what have you got there a dog goodness gracious whats wrong with him hes been shot said kathleen were going to keep him in the boxroom upstairs in the attics till hes better are you going down to the town janet well be a sport and ask at the police station if anyone has reported a lost dog if they have ask for their name and address and ill tell them ive got him safely all right said janet but lookout that he doesnt make a noise or youll get into trouble youre quite batty over animals kathleen goodbye janet rushed off to get her bicycle kathleen turned to the twins you go and see that the coast is clear she said and lets think what to have for a bed for him theres an old wooden box in the gardeners shed said isabel eagerly that would do nicely ill get it she ran to get it pat went indoors to see if it was safe for kathleen to take the dog in she whistled a little tune and kathleen ran in with the dog the two of them scurried up the stairs without meeting any one but round the corner of the corridor they could hear footsteps coming and the loud voice of mamzelle talking to miss jenks oh crumbs groaned kathleen and she turned to go down the stairs again but some one was now coming up pat opened the door of a big broom cupboard and pushed kathleen and the dog into it she shut the door and then dropped on one knee pretending to do up her shoe just as mamzelle and miss jenks passed her the dog in the cupboard gave a whine mamzelle looked round m surprise tiens why do you whine like a dog she asked pat and passed on thinking that girls were indeed funny creatures pat giggled and opened the door when the two mistresses had gone by did you hear what mamzelle said she asked come on its all right now we can get up the attic stairs in a trice they went up to the top of the school the attics were just under the roof and the boxrooms were a peculiar shape being small with slanting roofs and almost im possible to stand up in here were kept the trunks and cases belonging to the girls the boxrooms were only visited twice a term once when the trunks were put there and once when they were brought down to be packed after a moment isabel came up with the box and an old rug she had found in the locker downstairs in the gym the girls chose the little boxroom next to the hot tanks it was warm and cosy they set the wooden box down in a corner and tucked the old rug into it it made a very cosy bed then kathleen set to work to bathe the dogs wounds it took a long time and the dog lay patiently till it was finished licking kathleens careful hands as she bathed him youre awfully good with animals said pat watching her and doesnt he love you im going to be a vet when im grownup said kathleen there you are my beauty youre all right now dont lick off that ointment more than you can help lie quietly here now and youll soon be all right again ill bring you some water and some food the bell went for prep and the three girls hurried downstairs carefully closing the boxroom door behind them they met janet as they went into the classroom i asked at the police station whispered janet but they said nobody had reported a dog i had to tell them what he was like and they wanted your name and address gracious what an idiot you are whispered back kathleen as she took her seat whatever will miss theobald say if the police ring up the school and ask for me really janet well i had to give it whispered janet you cant say no to the police can you anyway i dont expect the dog will be reported so dont worry but kathleen did worry when she heard the telephone bell ringing that evening she was quite sure that it was the police ringing up the head mistress but it wasnt the girls breathed with relief when they heard that it was a message for miss roberts the dog was given water and food he lay quite quietly in his basket and was as good as gold he ought to have a run before we go to bed said kathleen anxiously how are we to manage it lets bundle him up in a heap of the clothes we are using for the play said pat if anyone meets us they will think we are just taking a pile of clothes for rehearsal ill get some so five minutes before bedtime the girls crept up the attic stairs with a heap of clothes the surprised dog was carefully tucked up in them with just his nose showing so that he could breathe then kathleen carried him downstairs whispering to him so that he would lie quiet he did not want to be quiet at all and struggled violently but luckily the girls met nobody except matron she was in a hurry and hardly glanced at them you wont be in time for bed if you arent quick she called the girls giggled and went out into the garden by a littleused door they set the dog free in a tiny yard where the gardeners chopped firewood and logs and he limped about joyfully then they packed him up in the pile of clothes again and scurried indoors this time they were not so lucky they met belinda towers she stopped and glared at them dont you know that your bedtime bell has gone what are you doing wandering about here and what on earth is that in those clothes the dog struggled to get out and its head came out with a jerk oh weve been trying so hard not to let any one see him said kathleen almost in tears belinda hes been shot hes dont tell me anything about him and i shant now said belinda who was very fond of animals too go on take that pile of clothes away and go to your dormitory quickly good old belinda said pat as the three of them went up the stairs to the boxroom isnt she a sport talk about nelson turning the blind eye she turned a blind eye on our dog all right do hurry kath we really shall get into a row if were much longer they tucked the dog up again in his basket he licked their bands and wuffed a very small bark isnt he clever cried kathleen in delight he even knows he that he must whisper a bark well it was a pretty loud whisper said pat come on lets go down and hope that hilary wont say a word its about the first time weve been late anyway i hope the dog doesnt bark the place down in the night of course he wont said kathleen shutting the boxroom door carefully hell sleep all night and in he morning very early ill take him for a run again they tore down to their dormitory to find hilary getting most exasperated with them where have you been she demanded you know its my job to see youre here on time at nine oclock its too bad of you weve been putting a dog to bed whispered kathleen hilary stared in surprise what did you say she asked putting what to bed shall i tell every one said kathleen to the twins they nodded it was lovely to have a secret but it was great fun to surprise every one and tell it so kathleen explained about the hurt dog and every one listened in amazement fancy taking a dog to the boxroom cried doris well id never dare to do that suppose matron went up there shed soon find him well we shall only keep him for a day or two till hes quite better said kathleen then well have found out where he belongs to and can take him back but it wasnt quite as easy as all that the secret is out the dog made no noise at all in the night kathleen managed to wake very early and creep up to the boxroom to take him for a run in the little woodyard he completely refused to be taken down all wrapped up again so kathleen had to put a bit of string round his neck and lead him down the stairs he made rather a noise flopping down but nobody came to see what was the matter it was marvellous the way his legs and chest and face bad healed during the night kathleen was very pleased the dog fawned round her legs in the yard and tried to jump up to lick her hand the girl thought he was a marvellous dog and hoped against hope that no one would claim him if only l could keep him until the end of term and then take him home she thought wouldnt it be lovely she took him back to the boxroom again this time he didnt want her to leave him and after she had shut the door and gone back to the dormitory she felt sure she could hear him whining and scraping against the door the firstforms classroom was just underneath the boxrooms the room where the dog was not exactly overhead but more to the right kathleen listened anxiously to see if he was making any noise during school time her sharp ears heard the patter of feet and small whines but miss roberts apparently heard when mamzelle came to take a french lesson however she heard the dog quite plainly her ears were exceedingly keen the first time that the dog whined she looked up in surprise what can that noise be she said what noise mamzelle asked isabel with an innocent face the noise of a dog said mamzelle impatiently the whine the bark is it possible that you have not heard it isabel all the class pretended to listen hard then the girls shook their heads you must be mistaken mamzelle said doris gravely there surely isnt a dog in the school said joan only the kitchen cats mamzelle was really most astonished to think that she was the only one who heard the strange noises ah it must be something wrong with my ears then she said and she shook her big head vigorously i will get the doctor to syringe them for me i cannot have dogs barking and whining in my head the class already in a state of giggle was glad to burst into laughter at this mamzelle rapped on the desk enough i made no joke take down dictйe please the class went on with its work the dog in the boxroom explored the place thoroughly and judging by the noise tried a good deal of scratching at the door and the walls mamzelle looked extremely puzzled once or twice and glanced at the girls to see if they too had noticed the noises but one and all went serenely on with their work and appeared to hear nothing so mamzelle pressed her ears thoughtfully and made up her mind to see the doctor that very same day the twins and kathleen spent most of their free time in the boxroom with the dog it was always so pleased to see them and they all grew very fond of it indeed the only exasperating thing was that when they left it it would bark and whine after them and try to scratch the door open they were always afraid that somebody would hear it then but two days went by safely and it was not discovered the girls fed it gave it water and took it down secretly for runs in the woodyard kathleen really adored the little creature and indeed it was a very intelligent and affectionate animal as nobody has claimed to be its owner i really think i might keep it for myself dont you asked kathleen anxiously as she and the twins stroked the dog up in the boxroom one free halfhour i do love him so he really is a darling i couldnt bear to take him to the policestation now and leave him there you know if nobody claimed him at all the police would have him put to sleep well you keep him then said pat there isnt much longer till the end of the term but youll have to move him out of here when the maids come up to get down our boxes for us thats very soon i dont see what youre going to do really i dont however the twins and kathleen did not need to bother about what was going to happen because the dog soon decided things for himself one morning about four days after he had been found he lay down in a bit of wintry sunshine that came slanting through the attic window it made him feel restless and he jumped up and prowled round he came to the door and stood sniffing at it then he began to jump at the handle after a while he managed quite by chance to jerk the catch back and the door opened the dog was delighted he pushed it wide open with his nose and trotted down the attic stairs now all might still have been well if one of the school cats bad not been lying fast asleep on a mat underneath one of the corridor radiators the dog sniffed the catsmell and trotted up in delight what a cat and what was more a cat asleep with a loud wuff the dog leapt on the cat in play it was only a puppy and would not really have hurt it but the cat was in a most terrible fright it leapt up gave an anguished yowl and fled down the corridor its tail straight up in the air the dog gave chase at once prancing along on all four puppylegs and that was how miss theobald met the dog she was going along to one of the classrooms when first the cat and then the dog shot round her legs she turned in amazement cats there were in the school because of mice but where in the world did a dog suddenly appear from the cat leapt out of a window the dog paused surprised that the cat had disappeared so suddenly then he decided to go and find kathleen he thought he had smelt her somewhere along the passage so off be trotted again and soon came to the firstform classroom he stood up on his hind legs and whined and scratched mamzelle was once again giving a french lesson and the whole class was busy correcting its french prep and writing cut various mistakes when the dog jumped up at the door and whined mamzelle leapt to her feet tiens this time it is not my ears it is in truth a dog she marched to the door and opened it in ran the dog his tail wagging nineteen to the dozen and went straight to kathleen how all the class stared and after him came miss theobald determined to unravel the mystery of the dog she looked into the classroom and saw mamzelle stamping up and down and kathleen doing her best to quiet the excited dog what is all this disturbance asked miss theobald in her quiet serious voice mamzelle turned to her at once her hands wagging above her shoulders as she poured out how she had heard a dog some days ago and how he had come to the door and scratched i think perhaps kathleen knows more about him than any one said miss theobald noticing how the animal fawned on the girl and how she stroked and patted him kathleen come with me and perhaps you can give mean explanation kathleen rather pale stood up she followed the head to her room the dog trotting amiably at her heels miss theobald made her sit down i didnt mean to do any wrong said kathleen beginning her tale but he was so hurt miss theobald and i do so much love dogs and ive never had any pet of my own and begin at the beginning said the head so kathleen told the whole story and miss theobald listened at the end she reached for the telephone and took off the receiver she asked for the police station kathleens heart stood still whatever was the head going to say miss theobald enquired if any dog had been reported missing apparently none had then she asked what would happen if a dog was kept that had been found hurt it had no collar when it was found she explained after a while she put down the receiver and turned to kathleen who now had the dog on her knee i cant imagine how you have kept the dog hidden all this time she said and i am not going to enquire i know you are fond of animals well apparently there is no reason why you should not keep the dog for yourself if no one claims it within a certain time so i propose to let you keep it until you return home for the holidays and if your aunt will let you have it you can take it back but it must be kept in the stables kathleen for once in a way i will relax the rule that says no pet must be kept and let you have the dog until the holidays if kathleen had not been in such awe of the head she would certainly have flung her arms round her neck as it was she could hardly swallow a lump that suddenly appeared in her throat which made it very difficult for her to say anything but she managed to stammer out her thanks the dog was not in awe of miss theobald however and he went to her and licked her hands solemnly for all the world as if he knew what had been said take him to the stables now and get one of the men to find a good place for him said miss theobald and next time you want to do anything peculiar kathleen come and ask either me or miss roberts first it really would save quite a lot of trouble kathleen hurried off her eyes shining the dog trotted after her before she went to the stables the girl ran back to her classroom and burst in her cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkling i say she cried im to keep the dog im to take him home if my aunt kathleen i will not have my class interrupted in this scandalous way cried mamzelle rising in wrath from her desk kathleen took one look at her and disappeared she went to the stables and found one of the gardeners he soon gave the dog a place and kathleen left him happy in the thought that now she could come and take him for a walk whenever she wanted to on her way back to her form she met belinda towers off for a practice in the lacrosse field belinda she cried the dog escaped and came to me in the classroom and he chased a cat and miss theobald saw him and came after him and shes letting me keep him good for you said belinda now buzz off back to your form you firstform kids always seem to be doing something extraordinary kathleen buzzed off she went very very quietly back to the french lesson and sat down mamzelle still had a lot to say but the words rolled off kathleens head like water off a ducks back she sat and dreamed of the dog who was really to be her very own and if you do not pay more attention to me i will give you a threepage essay to write about dogs in french she suddenly heard mamzelle say and pulled herself together the whole class was grinning at her mamzelle was glaring halfangry halfamused for the girl had really not heard a word until then kathleen didnt at all want to write a threepage essay in french good gracious she wouldnt be able to take the dog for a walk so for the next twenty minutes she worked harder than any one in the class and mamzelle said no more and during the halfhour between morning school and dinner four girls crowded round an excited dog and quarrelled as to what name he should be given im his owner and im going to choose said kathleen firmly his name is binks i dont know why but he looks like a binks to me so binks he was and binks he remained till the last day of term came and he went home with kathleen what a time he bad till then with dozens of girls clamouring to take him for walks and bringing him so many things to eat that he grew as fat as a barrel even the mistresses loved him and gave him a pat when they met him out with kathleen all but mamzelle who thought that school was no place for dogs he is abominable she said whenever she saw him that dog how he disturbed my class but there was a twinkle in her eye so nobody took her seriously a shock for isabel exams began the twins were very anxious to do well in them for they badly wanted to be top in something they had caught up well with the rest of their form but as most of the other girls had been there a good deal longer than they had miss roberts told them that they could not expect to come out top that term the maths exam came first it was quite a stiff one for miss roberts had taught her form a good deal that term and expected them to make a good showing pat and isabel groaned over it but did their best i know i got questions and quite wrong said isabel when they compared their papers afterwards i think i got the problems right though but they took me so long to puzzle out that i didnt do them all i bet ill be bottom said pat dismally she still at times resented being a nobody as she put it though she was rapidly forgetting all the highandmighty ideas she had held at first french wasnt so bad thanks to mamzelle abominables coaching the twins were now well up to the average of their class in writing it was poor doris who fell down in french she stammered and stuttered in the oral exam and drove mamzelle nearly frantic have i taught you three terms already and still you speak french like a fouryearold in the kindergarten she stormed now repeat tome again one of the french verses you learnt this term the crosser mamzelle got the worse poor doris became she gazed hopelessly round the class and winked at the twins ah you wink you will soon wink the other side of your face cried mamzelle getting all mixed up you will have nought for your oral french as doris had expected to be bottom anyhow this did not disturb her a great deal she sat down thankfully joan was next and as she was good at french mamzelle calmed down a little the exams went on until only the geography one was left the twins examined the lists each morning and were sad to see that they were not top in anything at all they were not even second in anything pat managed to get third in nature and isabel fifth in history but that was the highest they reached golly our exam marks wont look too good on our reports sighed pat we were always top in most things at redroofs long before we were head of the school mother and daddy wont like us not being top in a single thing here why theyll think we did what we said and didnt try at all said isabel oh blow and we have been trying what a pity we said all we did before we came i dont see how daddy can help feeling weve slacked all this term hes so used to getting reports that show us top in nearly everything well theres only the geography exam left said pat we might be top in that but i doubt it i dont feel i know an awful lot about africa though weve been studying the wretched place all term which part of it do the zulus live i never can remember i wish we could just be top in it said isabel getting out her geography textbook and turning over the pages pat lets cram hard all tonight and really see if we cant do well come on so the two of them bent their heads over their textbooks and solemnly began to read through the whole of the lessons they bad had that term on africa they looked at the maps they had drawn and drew them roughly again two or three times they made lists of towns and ports and said them to one another they pored over the rivers and learnt those too and read up about the peoples of africa the animals and the products well i really feel i know something now said isabel with a sigh i especially know all the products of africa and the rivers and i especially know all about the climate said pat but i bet we shant get asked questions about those things exam questions always seem to deal with the things you missed because you were ill or forgot to look up or for some reason simply cant remember at all well i cant do any more work tonight said isabel i want to finish the sleeve of the jumper fm knitting ive only got a few more rows to do where did i put the pattern book cant imagine said pat youre always losing it i think you took it into the formroom with you this afternoon blow said isabel so i did she got up and went out of the common room she quite forgot that she and the others had been told not to go to the first form room that evening because the exam papers were to be set out there she sauntered along to the room opened the door and went in she walked over to her desk and opened it yes there was the patternbook good isabel took it and then picked up a pencil that belonged to miss roberts she went to the teachers big desk and put it in the groove that held pencils and pens and there staring up at her from the desk were the exam papers for tomorrow a list of geography questions was written out very neatly on a sheet of paper isabel stared at them with a beating heart if only she knew what the questions were she could cram them up and answer them so perfectly that she would be top without thinking she hurriedly read down the questions state what you know about the climate of south africa what do you know about the race called pygmies what do you isabel read the questions from top to bottom and then went out of the room her face was flushed and her heart was beating all those questions are what weve both been looking up this evening she said to herself it doesnt matter me seeing the paper at all ive already crammed up the answers pat looked up as isabel came back into the common room got the pattern book she asked isabel looked down at her empty hands no she had left the pattern book behind after all didnt you find it said pat surprised yes i did said isabel but ive gone and left it behind after all well arent you going to go and get it asked pat still more surprised isabel hesitated she could not bear to go back into the form room again what is the matter isabel asked pat impatiently have you gone dumb whats up pat the geography paper questions were on miss roberts desk said isabel i read them isabel thats cheating said pat i didnt think about whether it was cheating or not said isabel in a troubled voice but its all right pat the questions were all about what weve been looking up this evening so it wont matter pat stared at isabel isabel would not look at her isabel i dont see how in the world youre going to sit for the geography exam tomorrow when you know youve already seen the questions she said at last i dare say you could answer them all quite perfectly without any further looking up at all but if anyone knew about this theyd think you were a cheat and youre not youve always been straight and honourable i just dont understand you i did it all in a hurry said poor isabel well youd better tell miss roberts said pat oh i cant said isabel in horror you know how strict she is i cant well you must answer all the questions so badly that miss roberts will be angry with you and then you can tell her why youve done it said pat if she knows you havent taken advantage of seeing the questions she cant think youre a cheat youll have to own up before or after go on now isabel you know you must well ill own up afterwards said isabel ill sit for the exam and do the answers so badly that ill be bottom then when miss roberts rows me ill tell her why oh blow why was l so silly i did it all in a hurry i might even have been top you know because all the questions were ones i could answer quite well dont tell me what they were said pat i dont want to know else ill feel awkward about answering them cheer up isabel i know you well enough to know you didnt mean to cheat anybody can be silly isabel was not very happy that night she tossed and turned wishing to goodness she hadnt seen the geography questions she could so easily have answered them correctly and got high marks what an idiot she had been the geography exam was to be held first thing after prayers next day at nine oclock all the first form filed into their room and took their places isabel saw that the exam questions were still on the desk pat saw them there too though of course it was impossible for any one to read them miss roberts came in good morning girls she said good morning miss roberts chorused the class and sat down geography exam this morning said miss roberts briskly do well please joan come and give out the questions isabel watched joan go up for the slips of paper she felt miserable it was not nice to have to do badly on purpose but there was nothing else to do just as joan was taking up the papers miss roberts gave an exclamation and stopped her wait i dont believe these are the right papers no theyre not how stupid they are the exam questions for the second form who have been doing africa too go to miss jenks with these and ask her to give you the papers i left on her desk tell her ive left the first forms exam questions there and that these are for her form joan took the papers and disappeared out of the room isabel looked at pat pat was smiling in delight when miss roberts turned to write something on the board pat leaned across and whispered to isabel what luck now you can do your best instead of your worst old girl you saw the wrong questions hurrah isabel nodded she was really delighted too it seemed too good to be true miss roberts turned round no talking if i catch any girls whispering during exams i shall deduct ten marks from their papers do you hear me pat yes miss roberts said pat meekly joan came back with the right papers and distributed them round the class isabel read hers quickly yes they were quite quite different from the questions she had read last night how marvellous now she could set to work and really do her best to be top she would never be such an idiot again she hadnt meant to be a cheat but it was horrible to feel like one but poor isabel was rather nervous now after her experiences and did not do nearly such a good paper as pat her hand shook as she drew the maps required and she made some silly mistakes so when the papers were gathered up and corrected isabel was nowhere near the top she was sixth but pat was top isabel was as pleased to see pats name heading the list as she would have been to see her own she squeezed her twins arm hard good for you pat she said tm jolly glad one of us is top in something anyhow pat glowed with pleasure it was marvellous to see her name heading the list miss roberts came up and patted her on the back you did an excellent paper patricia she said eightythree per cent is very good but i was surprised that isabel didnt do better why was that isabel but isabel did not tell her and miss roberts laughed and went on her way surprising things happened in exams probably next term those osullivan twins would be top in nearly everything the concert and now the end of the term was indeed drawing near miss theobald and the other mistresses were busy making out reports putting up lists helping the girls with the great concert and going through exam papers the girls themselves were restless looking forward to the holidays getting readyfor the concert wondering what their reports would be like and nearly driving mamzelle mad with their inattention miss roberts was more lenient but even she grew impatient when isabel told her that there were fourteen ounces in a pound i know you all go slightly mad at the end of term she said but there really is a limit to my patience isabel if there was a lower form than this id send you to it for the rest of the morning the last two weeks were really great fun for one thing all the cupboards had to be turned out washed dried and tidied the twins had never done this at redroofs school and at first were inclined to turn up their noses at such work but when they saw the others tying handkerchiefs round their hair and putting on overalls they couldnt help thinking it would be rather fun even though the cleaning had to be done in their free lime come on pat come on isabel dont stand looking stuckup like you used to cried janet who sensed at once the twins hadnt done work like this before youll get dirty but you can always bath and wash your hair come on highandmighties this was not a name that the twins liked at all so they climbed down at once they found big hankies and tied up their hair they put on overalls and went to join the others hilary was in charge of the firstform cleaning it really was fun everything had to be taken out of the cupboards and there were squeals and shrieks of delight when things longlost came to light again oh i thought id never see that penknife again squealed doris pouncing on a small pearlhandled knife in delight wherever has it been all this time golly heres miss roberts fountainpen cried hilary a little later look tangled up in this bundle of raffia oooh i know how it got there do you remember janet when you dumped a whole lot of it on to miss roberts desk in handwork one day and she objected and you carted it all off to the cupboard again well i bet you took the pen with you my word what a hunt we had for it well for pitys sake dont remind her that it might have been me said janet shes always going off the deep end about something now look take her the pen isabel and say we found it in the handwork cupboard youve been in her bad books today so maybe youll get an unexpected smile isabel did miss roberts was delighted to see her pen and beamed at isabel with pleasure isabel wondered if miss roberts was in a good enough temper to be asked something she tried miss roberts im so sorry i made a mess of my maths this morning if i promise to do better tomorrow need i do those sums all over again ive such a lot to do today but miss roberts was not to be caught like that my dear isabel she said i am delighted that you have been able to give me back my pen but i think youll agree with me that that isnt any real reason why i should forgive you for shockingly bad work and even if you find me my best hat which unaccountably flew from my head last sunday and completely disappeared over the fields i should still say you must do your sums again the class chuckled miss roberts could be very dry when she liked isabel laughed too and went back to the cleaning and tidying i wish i could find her hat for her she said shes jolly strict but shes an awful sport there was great excitement when the night of the concert came for the last few days before the concert the girls had been in a state of great excitement getting their lines perfect and rehearsing everything each form was to do something and the concert was to last three hours with a break in between for refreshments mamzelle had taught french plays and songs to each form and pestered the girls continually to make sure that they were word perfect the sixth form were doing a short greek play the fifth were doing an absurd sketch that they had written themselves called mrs jenkins pays a call and borrowed all kinds of queer hats and clothes from the mistresses and even from the school cook the fourth form had got up a jazz band which sounded simply marvellous though mamzelle said that she could easily do without the sidedrum which could be heard ratatattatting from a music room at all kinds of odd hours the third form were doing part of a shakespeare play and the second and first were doing plays and odd things such as doriss solo dance and tessies recitations sheila was tremendously excited she knew that if she had been given a part in the history play at the beginning she would never have had the chance of such a big part now because of veras accident she had a fine part she practised it continually thinking about it putting in actions that vera had never thought of and astonishing every one by her acting shes going to be jolly good whispered janet to pat im quite getting to like old sheila now who would have thought there was a hardworking interesting little person like that underneath all those old posings and boastings of hers pat and isabel worked their hardest for the concert too all the mistresses and the staff were coming and the whole school would be watching nobody must forget their words or do anything silly each form had its own honour to uphold the great night came there were gigglings and whisperings all day long lessons slacked off that day except mamzelles french classes mamzelle would surely not allow even an earthquake to spoil her lessons no wonder that the girls were such excellent french scholars by the time that they reached the top form the sewing mistress worked at top speed to alter dresses at the last moment matron proved unexpectedly good at providing a real meal in one of the plays instead of the pretendone that hilary had arranged for golly isnt that decent of her said hilary looking at the jug of lemonade and the currant buns that matron had presented her with i shall enjoy my part in the play now well dont stuff your mouth so full that you cant speak grinned janet i say what about asking mamzelle to let us have a meal of some sort in the french play too but nobody dared to mention such a thing to mamzelle at six oclock the concert began everyone had filed into the gym where benches and chairs had been set ready the stage had its curtains and footlights and looked fine there were pots of plants borrowed from miss theobalds hothouse at the sides the mistresses sat in the three front rows leaving their forms to look after themselves for once the kitchen staff sat behind the mistresses the girls were on benches at the back completely filling the gym everyone had a programme designed and coloured by the girls themselves pat was terribly proud to see that miss theobald had the one that she herself had done she saw the head looking carefully at the design of the cover and she wondered if miss theobald would see her name in the corner pat osullivan every form knew when its turn was coming and knew when it must rise quietly and go to the back of the stage to dress and await its turn the fifth form were acting their play first and as soon as the curtains swung aside and showed the girls dressed up most ridiculously in odd hats and coats and shawls the audience went off into fits of laughter the school cook squealed out oh theres my old hat i never thought id see it on a stage the sketch was really funny and the audience loved it then came the greek play by the sixth which was really a serious and difficult thing to understand the firstformers listened politely and clapped bard at the end but they secretly thought that the fifth form were very much better the fourth form came on with their jazz band and this was an instant success the drummer was simply marvellous and mamzelle quite forgave the constant irritation that the practising of the drum had given her swinging dance tunes were played and the audience roared the choruses they kept clapping for encores but as it was now halftime the jazz band had to stop at last how the girls enjoyed the trifles and jellies creambuns sandwiches and lemonade when they went into the diningroom to have their meal they gasped at the sight of so much food golly well never never eat all that cried pat patricia osullivan you dont know what youre talking about said janet lifting up a plate of asparagus sandwiches speak for yourself have one or two whilst theyre here and sure enough pat didnt know what she was talking about for in twenty minutes not a thing was left on the dishes the girls made a clean sweep of everything and hidden under the long cloth of the table sat some one as hungry as the girls binks the puppydog kathleen had let him out secretly and bad tied him to a leg of the big table she gave him bits of sausage roll which he ate eagerly he was sensible enough not to poke his nose out in case he was discovered and nobody guessed he was there except isabel who had been filled with astonishment at the amount of sausage rolls that kathleen was apparently able to eat then she suddenly realized what was happening oh you monkey kath youve got binks there sh said kathleen dont say a word i didnt see why he should miss the fun isnt he good binks had a marvellous time after that for there were two people feeding him instead of one the concert began again in half an hour the first form gave their two short plays and sheila acted so magnificently that the audience actually roared her name and made her come and give a special bow the girl was happier than ever she had been in her life and looked quite pretty as she stood on the stage flushed and excited winifred the headgirl smiled across at pat to let her know how pleased she was for she guessed that pat and the others had been giving sheila the chance she had begged for her the french play was a success too and mamzelle beamed round with pleasure when she heard it clapped so heartily those firstform kids arent half bad isabel heard belinda towers say and she stored it up in her mind to tell the others later on doris did her dance which was really excellent she too was encored and came on again in a clowns dress she proceeded to do the clown dance which bad ended so disastrously on the night of the great feast and this time it ended in plenty of cheers and clapping just as she was finishing a disturbance arrived in the shape of binks he had bitten through his lead and had come to join his mistress kathleen was in the wings at the side of the stage watching doris dancing binks leapt up on to the stage joyfully to join kathleen and tripped doris up very neatly for all the world as if he were joining in the dance doris promptly fell over just as the music ended how the audience laughed and cheered binks turned round as he heard them his pink tongue hanging out and his tail wagging joyfully then he went to kathleen who fearful of being scolded rushed off at once to put him back into the stables but nobody scolded her not even mamzelle who bad never ceased to say that she thought it was abominable and insupportable to allow that dog in the school the concert ended with the whole school singing the school song a very swinging heartening tune that the twins heard for the first lime they were the only ones who did not know it well sing it next time whispered pat to isabel oh isabel what a lovely evening it beats redroofs hollow dont you think then yawning hugely for it was an hour past their usual bedtime the firstformers went up to bed they chattered and laughed as they undressed and were just as long as they liked for this was the last evening of term and tomorrow they were breaking up and going home the last day next day the trunks were dragged down from the loft each had its owners name on in white paint and soon they were being packed matron bustled to and fro giving out clothes and seeing that the girls packed at least moderately well she made doris take out every single thing and begin again but matron ill never have time said doris laughing at matrons annoyed face if you stay here till next week you will pack properly said matron grimly doris edward your mother and your two aunts came here years ago and they never learnt to pack but you are going to it is not sensible to put breakable things at the bottom of your trunk and shoes and boots on the top of your best things begin again kath whats your home address yelled pat you said youd give it tome and you havent i want to write to you for christmas kathleen went red with pleasure no one had even bothered to ask for her address before she wrote it down for pat then there was a general exchange of addresses and promises to telephone and invitations for parties after christmas if soandso could only manage to come the school didnt seem like school any more everywhere there was babbling and chattering and giggling and even when mistresses came into the classrooms and dormitories nobody thought of being quiet the mistresses were excited too and talked laughingly among themselves im pleased with my lot this term said miss roberts watching sheila throw something across to pat two or three of them have altered so much for the better that i hardly know them what about those osullivan twins asked miss jenks i thought they were going to be a handful when they came they were called the stuckup twins you know and at first i couldnt bear the look of their discontented faces oh theyre all right said miss roberts at once theyve settled down well theyve got good stuff in them one of these days st clares will be proud of them mark my words theyre monkeys though look out when you get them in your form some time next year oh theyll be all right after a term or two in your tender care laughed miss jenks i never have any trouble with girls that come up into my form from yours its only the new girls that come straight into my form that i have bother with mamzelle sailed by beaming she always entered every girls address in a little black holiday notebook and most conscientiously wrote to every one of them in the holidays good old mamzelle abominable whispered pat as she went by mamzelles sharp ears heard what she said what is that you call me she demanded towering over pat as she knelt packing her trunk oh nothing mamzelle said pat horrorstruck to think that mamzelle might have overheard the other girls looked round grinning they all knew the twins name for mamzelle you will tell me please i demand it insisted mamzelle her eyes beginning to flash well said pat reluctantly i only call you mamzelle abominable because at first you called me and isabel and our work abominable so often please dont be cross but mamzelle was not cross for some reason the name tickled her sense of humour and she threw back her head and roared ha mamzelle abominable that is a fine name to call your french mistress and next term your work will be so fine that i shall say you are magnifique and you will then call me mamzelle magnifique nest cepas at last all the packing was done each girl went to say a polite goodbye to miss theobald when the twins went in together she looked at them seriously and then smiled an unusually sweet smile at them i dont think you wanted to come to st clares did you she said and now somehow i think youve changed your minds yes we have changed our minds said pat honestly she never minded owning up when she altered her ideas we hated coming here we were going to be really awful and we did try to be but well st clares is fine and we shall simply love coming back again next term said isabel eagerly its hard work here and things arent a bit the same as at our old school and its odd being one of the young ones after being top of the school but weve got used to it now one day maybe youll be one of the top ones at st clares said miss theobald but the thought of being as grand and great as winifred james was too much for the twins oh no said pat we could never never be that but miss theobald smiled a secret smile she knew far more about the girls than they knew about themselves and she felt sure that she was right these troublesome twins had the makings of fine girls and she and st clares would see to it that they fulfilled the promise they showed here are your reports she said and gave one to each girl give my love to your mother and tell her that i havent had to expel you yet i hope our reports are good said pat we told daddy we werent going to try a bit and if theyre bad hell think we were jolly mean well youll see when you get home said miss theobald smiling but i wouldnt worry very much if l were you goodbye the twins said goodbye to every one and received fat kisses on each cheek from mamzelle who seemed unaccountably fond of every girl that day miss roberts shook hands and warned them not to eat too much plum pudding miss kennedy looked rather sad she said goodbye for her friend miss lewis was now quite well and was coming back to take up her old post the next term i shant see you again said kenny as she said goodbye to the twins im going to miss you all very much goodbye kenny said pat we were pigs to you at first but you do forgive us for being piggy dont you and i do promise to write i wont forget neither will i said isabel and then janet and hilary and the rest came crowding up and miss kennedy grew quite tearful as the girls poured goodbyes and good wishes on her what a good thing it was that she hadnt been a failure after all the most uproarious person that day was binks he was set free and spent his time taking chocolate from his friends and going round licking peoples hands and faces as they knelt to pack no mistress had the heart to complain about him and he had a marvellous time he will hate leaving me when l come back to school again said kathleen as she patted his wiry head but never mind we shall have a whole month together miss theobald wrote to my aunt and aunt is going to see if he behaves of course hell behave said janet but i expect hell take after you kathleen sometimes hell behave well and sometimes he wont kathleen laughed and gave janet an affectionate punch she didnt live a great way from the twins and they had already made plans to cycle over and see one another she was very happy the bell rang to say that the first coach was ready to take the girls to the station that was for the first form shouting goodbyes to their teachers the girls ran helterskelter down the stairs and piled into the big motorcoach what fun to be breaking up what fun to be going home to christmas jollities parties and theatres there were christmas presents to buy christmas cards to send all kinds of things to look forward to pat and isabel got into the train together and sat down with the others to wait for the rest of the school to come down in the coaches before very long the engine gave a violent whistle and the carriages jerked they were off the twins craned their heads out of the window to see the last of the big white building they had grown to love goodbye said pat under her breath we hated you when we first saw you st clares but now we love you and well be glad to see you again whispered isabel oh pat its marvellous that well be going back in four weeks time isnt it good old st clares and then the school disappeared from sight and the train rattled on its noisy way singing a song that seemed to say over and over again were pleased were coming back againto st clares were pleased were coming back again tostclares a funny song but quite a true one thought the twins
