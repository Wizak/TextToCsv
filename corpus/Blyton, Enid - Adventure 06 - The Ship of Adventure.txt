 enid blyton the ship of adventure chapter a grand holiday plan mothers got something up her sleeve said philip mannering i know she has shes gone all mysterious yes said his sister dinah and whenever i ask what were going to do this summer holidays she just says wait and see as if we were about ten years old wheres jack said philip well see if he knows whats up with mother hes gone out with lucyann said dinah ah i can hear old kiki screeching theyre coming jack and lucyann trent came in together looking very much alike with their red hair green eyes and dozens of freckles jack grinned hallo you ought to have been with us just now a dog barked at kiki and she sat on a fence and mewed like a cat at him you never saw such a surprised dog in your life he put his tail down and ran for his life said lucyann scratching kiki on the head the parrot began to mew again knowing that the children were talking about her then she hissed and spat like an angry cat the children laughed if youd done that to the dog hed have died of astonishment said jack good old kiki nobody can be dull when youre about kiki began to sway herself from side to side and made a crooning noise then she went off into one of her tremendous cackles now youre showing off said philip dont lets take any notice of her shell get noisy and mother will come rushing in that reminds me whats mother gone all mysterious about said dinah lucyann havent you noticed it well aunt alison does act rather as if shes got something up her sleeve said lucyann considering the matter rather like she does before somebodys birthday i think shes got a plan for the summer holidays jack groaned blow ive got a perfectly good plan too simply wizard id better get mine in before aunt allie gets her whats yours asked dinah with interest jack always had wonderful plans though not many of them came to anything well i thought we could all go off together on our bikes taking a tent with us and camp out in a different place each night said jack it would be super the others looked at him scornfully you suggested that last hols and the hols before said dinah mother said no then and shes not likely to say yes now it is a good plan going off absolutely on our own like that but ever since weve had so many adventures mother simply wont hear of it couldnt your mother come with us suggested lucyann hopefully now youre being silly said dinah mothers a dear but grownups are so frightfully particular about things wed have to put our macks on at the first spot of rain and coats if the sun went in and i wouldnt be surprised if we didnt each have to have an umbrella strapped to our bikehandles the others laughed i suppose it wouldnt do to ask aunt allie too then said lucyann what a pity what a pity what a pity agreed kiki at once wipe your feet and shut the door wheres your hanky naughty boy kikis got the idea all right said philip thats the kind of thing that even the nicest grownups say isnt it kiki old bird bill isnt like that said lucyann at once bills fine everyone agreed at once bill cunningham or bill smugs as he had first called himself to them was their very firm friend and had shared all their adventures with them sometimes they had dragged him into them and sometimes it was the other way round he had got into one and they had followed it really did seem sometimes as mrs mannering said that adventures cropped up wherever bill and the children were i had an idea for these hols too said philip i thought it would be pretty good fun to camp down by the river and look for otters ive never had an otter for a pet lovely things they are i thought you would think of a thing like that said dinah half crossly just because youre mad on all kinds of creatures from fleas to to elephants said jack obligingly from fleas to elephants you think everyone else is said dinah what a frightful holiday looking for wet slimy otters and having them in the tent at night i suppose and all kinds of other horrible things too shut up dinah said philip otters arent horrible theyre lovely you should just see them swimming under the water and by the way im not mad on fleas or mosquitoes or horseflies i think theyre interesting but you cant say ive ever had things like that for pets what about those earwigs you had once that escaped out of the silly cage you made for them ugh and that stagbeetle that did tricks and that oh gosh now were off said jack seeing one of the familiar quarrels breaking out between philip and hotheaded dinah i suppose were going to listen to a long list of philips pets now anyway here comes aunt allie we can ask her what she thinks of our holiday ideas get yours in first philip mrs mannering came in with a booklet in her hand she smiled round at the four children and kiki put up her crest in delighted welcome wipe your feet and shut the door she said in a friendly tone one two three go she made a noise like a pistol shot after the word go and mrs mannering jumped in fright its all right mother she keeps doing that ever since she came to our school sports and heard the starter yelling to us and letting off his pistol grinned philip once she made that pistolshot noise just when we were all in a line ready to start and off we went long before time you should have heard her cackle bad bird naughty polly poor polly what a pity what a pity said kiki jack tapped her on the beak be quiet parrots should be seen and not heard aunt allie weve just been talking about holiday plans i thought it would be a super idea if youd let us all go off on our bikes ride where we liked and camp out each night i know youve said we couldnt when i asked you before but i say no again said mrs mannering very firmly well mother could we go off to the river and camp there because i want to find out more about the otters said philip not taking any notice of dinahs scowl you see no philip said his mother just as firmly as before and you know why i wont let you go on expeditions like that i should have thought you would have given up asking me by now but why wont you let us go wailed lucyann we shall be quite safe now lucyann you know perfectly well that as soon as i let you four out of my sight when holidays come you immediately yes immediately fall into the most frightful adventures imaginable mrs mannering sounded quite fierce and i am quite determined that these holidays you are not going off anywhere on your own so its just no good your asking me but mother thats just silly said philip in dismay you speak as if we go out looking for adventures we dont and i ask you what possible adventure could we fall into if we just went down to the river to camp why you could come and see us for yourself every evening if you wanted to yes and the very first evening i came i should find you all spirited away somewhere and mixed up with robbers or spies or rogues of some kind said his mother think of some of your holidays first you got lost down an old copper mine on a deserted island then another time you got shut up in the dungeons of an old castle mixed up with spies oooh yes and another time we got into the wrong aeroplane and were whisked off to the valley of adventure said lucyann remembering that was when we found all those queer stolen statues hidden in caves how their eyes gleamed when we saw them i thought they were alive but they werent and the next time we went off with bill to the bird islands said jack that was grand we had two tame puffins do you remember philip huffin and puffin put in kiki at once quite right old bird said philip huffin and puffin they were i loved them you may have gone to look for birds but you found a whole nest of rogues said his mother gunrunners terribly dangerous well mother what about last summer hols said dinah you nearly got caught up in that adventure horrible said mrs mannering with a shiver that awful mountain with its queer secrets and the mad king of the mountain you nearly didnt escape from there no i tell you quite definitely that you can never again go off anywhere by yourselves im always coming with you there was a silence at this all four children were very fond of mrs mannering but they did like being on their own for some part of each holiday well aunt allie suppose bill came with us wouldnt that be all right asked lucyann i do always feel safe with bill bill cant be trusted to keep out of adventures either said mrs mannering hes grand i know and id trust him more than anyone else in the world but when you and he get together theres just no knowing what will happen so these holidays ive made a very safe plan and dear old bill isnt in it so perhaps we shall keep away from danger and extraordinary happenings whats your plan mother said dinah nervously dont say were going to a seaside hotel or anything like that theyd never take kiki im taking you all for a cruise on a big ship said mrs mannering and she smiled i know youll like that its tremendous fun we shall call at all sorts of places and see all kinds of strange and exciting things and i shall have you under my eye in one place all the time the ship will be our home for some time and if we get off at various ports we shall all go in a party together there wont be a chance of any strange adventure the four children looked at one another kiki watched them philip spoke first it does sound rather exciting mother yes it really does weve never been on a really big ship before of course i shall miss having any animals oh philip surely you can go without your everlasting menagerie of creatures cried dinah i must say itll be a great relief to me to know you havent got mice somewhere about you or lizards or slowworms mother it sounds super i think thanks awfully for thinking up something so exciting yes it sounds smashing said jack well see no end of birds ive never seen before jacks happy so long as hes somewhere that will provide him with birds said lucyann with a laugh what with philip with his craze for all kinds of creatures and jack with his passion for birds its a good thing we two girls havent got crazes for anything as well aunt allie its a wizard plan of yours when do we go next week said mrs mannering that will give us plenty of time to get our things ready and packed it will be very warm on the cruise so we must get plenty of thin clothes to wear whites the best thing it doesnt hold the heat so much and you must all have sunhats the whole time so dont begin to moan about wearing hats isnt bill coming asked philip no said his mother firmly i feel rather mean about it because hes just finished the job hes on and he wants a holiday but this time hes not coming with us i want a nice peaceful holiday with no adventure at all poor bill said lucyann still i daresay hell be glad to have a holiday without us for a change i say its going to be fun isnt it fun said kiki joining in and let off a screech of excitement fun fun fun chapter on the viking star it certainly was fun getting everything ready buying flimsy clothes and enormous hats masses of films for the cameras guidebooks and maps it was to be quite a long cruise and the ship was to go to portugal madeira french morocco spain italy and the aegean islands what a wonderful trip at last everything was ready the trunks were packed and strapped the tickets had arrived passports were ready and everyone had screamed in dismay to see how hideous they looked in their passport photographs kiki screamed too just for company she loved screeching and screaming but she wasnt encouraged in this so it was a fine chance to scream when everyone was doing the same shut up kiki said jack pushing her off his shoulder fancy screaming right in my ear like that its enough to make me stone deaf aunt allie will kiki want a passport of course not said mrs mannering im not even sure she will be allowed to go with us jack stared at her in the greatest dismay but i cant go if kiki doesnt i couldnt leave her behind shed be miserable well ill write and ask if you can take her said mrs mannering but if the answer is no you are not to make a fuss jack ive gone to a lot of trouble to arrange this trip and i cant have you upsetting it just because of kiki i cant imagine that she will be allowed to go im sure passengers would object to a noisy bird like that she can be awfully quiet if she wants to said poor jack kiki chose that moment to have a fit of hiccups she hiccupped very well and it always annoyed mrs mannering stop that kiki she ordered kiki stopped and looked reproachfully at mrs mannering she began to cough a small but hollow cough copied from the gardener mrs mannering tried not to laugh the bird is so idiotic she said quite crazy now where did i put that list of things that ive got to do before we go one two three go shouted kiki and jack just stopped her making a noise like a pistol shot mrs mannering went out of the room and jack spoke solemnly to kiki kiki i may have to go without you old bird i cant upset all the arrangements at the last minute because of you but ill do what i can so cheer up god save the king said kiki feeling that it must be a solemn moment by the look on jacks face poor polly naughty polly the last few days went by slowly lucyann complained about it why is it that time always goes so slowly when youre wanting something to happen quickly its sickening thursday will never come jack was not so excited as the others because a letter had come saying that parrots could not be taken on board all four children were very sorry about it and jack looked really worried but he did not grumble about it or worry mrs mannering she was sorry for him and offered to arrange with a woman in the village to look after kiki for him she used to have a parrot of her own she said i expect shed enjoy having kiki no thanks aunt allie ill arrange something said jack dont lets talk about it so mrs mannering said no more and even when kiki sat on the teatable and picked all the currants out of the cake before anyone noticed she didnt say a word on wednesday all five went off in mrs mannerings car to southampton followed by another with the baggage they were in a great state of excitement everyone was in charge of something to carry and lucyann kept looking at her package anxiously to make sure she still had it they were to stay at a hotel for the night and embark on the ship at halfpast eight in the morning to catch the tide they would be away at eleven oclock steaming steadily towards france what excitement they all had a very good dinner at the hotel and then mrs mannering suggested going to the cinema she felt sure that not one of the children would go to sleep if she sent them to bed at the usual time do you mind if i go and hunt up a school friend of mine aunt allie said jack he lives in southampton and id like to spring a surprise on him and go and call all right said mrs mannering but youre not to be late back do you want to go and see him too philip whos this chappy jack asked philip but jack was halfway out of the room a mumble came through the door whats he say said philip sounded like porky to me said dinah porky who does he mean i wonder said philip somebody mad on birds i expect ill come to the cinema id like to see the picture its got wild animals in it they went off to the cinema without seeing jack again he was home when they came back reading one of the guidebooks mrs mannering had bought hallo see porky said philip he got a frown from jack and was puzzled what was jack up to he changed the subject quickly and began to talk about the picture they had seen now to bed said mrs mannering stop talking philip off you all go and remember up at seven oclock sharp in the morning everyone was awake long before seven the girls talked together and philip and jack chattered away too philip asked jack about the night before why did you shut me up when i asked you if youd seen porky he said and anyway who is porky hes that fellow called hogsney said jack we called him porky he left ages ago he was always wanting to borrow kiki dont you remember oh yes porky of course said philip id almost forgotten him jack whats up you look sort of secretive dont ask me any questions because i dont want to answer them said jack youre being jolly mysterious said philip i believe its something to do with kiki you kept putting us all off when we asked you what youd done with her we thought you were feeling upset about it so we didnt press you well dont press me now said jack i dont want to say anything at the moment all right said philip giving it up i know youre up to something though come on lets get up its not seven yet but we cant lie in bed on a morning as fine as this they were all on the boat at just after halfpast eight mrs mannering found their cabins there were three in a row a single one for her and two double ones for the others lucyann was delighted with them why they are just like proper little rooms she said jack is your cabin like ours look weve even got hot and cold water taps weve got an electric fan going in our cabin said philip appearing at the door its wizard lovely and cool youve got one too the water is only just below our porthole said dinah looking out if the sea got at all rough it would slop into the hole it would be well and truly screwed up before that happened said philip im glad were at the waterline it will be cooler in this warm weather i say isnt this super im longing to sail off they all went to see mrs mannerings cabin which was the same as theirs but smaller then they went to explore the ship she was quite big but not tremendous and was white from top to bottom white funnels white rails white sides her name was on each of the white lifeboats swung at the sides of the deck viking star lucyann read it a dozen times over we shall have lifeboat drill tomorrow i expect said mrs mannering joining them on their exploration there are big sort of lifebelt jackets in our cabin cupboards said lucyann i suppose you tie them round you you slip them over your head so that half the jacket is at your front and half behind and then you tie it firmly round you with the ropes on it said mrs mannering youll have to put it on tomorrow for lifeboat drill it all sounded very exciting they went round the ship thrilled with everything there was the sports deck where someone was already playing quoits with thick rings of rope and two others were playing decktennis fancy being able to play games like this on board ship said dinah theres a cinema down below said mrs mannering and a writingroom and library and lounge and an enormous diningroom and gosh look heres a swimmingpool on the ship itself cried jack in amazement as they came to a beautiful pool at one end of the ship shimmering blue with water the ships siren suddenly hooted twice very loudly lucyann almost fell into the swimmingpool with fright mrs mannering laughed oh lucyann did it make you jump it made me jump too what a terrific noise said lucyann my goodness its a good thing kiki isnt here if she began to hoot like that siren shed be impossible shut up idiot said dinah in a low voice dont remind jack were going off without her lucyann glanced round for jack but he wasnt there wheres he gone she asked dinah but nobody had seen him go hes somewhere about said philip i say we must be sailing soon look theyre taking up the gangways well soon be off lets stand at this side and wave to all the people said lucyann she leaned over the rail and watched the people crowded together on the dockside below they were shouting and waving suddenly lucyann gave a squeal look look theres somebody with a parrot just like kiki honestly it is wheres jack i must tell him blow hes nowhere to be seen the engines of the ship had now started up and the children felt a vibration under their feet lucyann strained her eyes to look at the parrot that was so very like kiki it is kiki she cried kiki kiki goodbye im sure its you the parrot was chained to a young mans wrist whether it was making a noise or not the children couldnt tell because of the hullaballoo going on it certainly was remarkably like kiki were off weve moved away from the quay cried philip hurrah were off he waved madly to every one lucyann waved too and watched the parrot it was getting smaller as the ship moved away towards the open water its owner seemed to be having trouble with it i was flapping its wings and pecking at him then it suddenly rose into the air the chain parted and the parrot sailed right over the stretch of water be tween quay and ship screeching madly it is kiki it is it is yelled lucyann jack where are you jack chapter everyone settles in dinah lucyann and philip rushed to find jack the parrot had reached the ship and they had lost sight of it they were all certain it was kiki and philip had a shrewd idea that jack wouldnt be quite so surprised about it as they themselves were jack was nowhere to be found it was most exasperating they hunted for him everywhere and at last lucyann thought of his cabin he might be there she said though why he wants to go and shut himself up there just at the exciting moment when the ship is leaving southampton i really cant imagine and wheres the parrot she seems to have disappeared too they went down the stairs to the cabins and found their way to the passage where theirs were they flung open jacks door and crowded in jack are you here what do you think weve just seen they stopped in surprise at what they saw jack was sitting on his bed in the cabin and kiki was on his shoulder making a curious crooning noise into his ear pulling at it gently gosh said philip so she found you i suppose it is kiki of course idiot said jack what a bit of luck wasnt it old porky brought her down to the quay to see me off chained to his wrist and she broke the chain and flew over to me came into my porthole too brainy old bird porky the boy you used to know at school did you give kiki to him to mind for you said lucyann amazed but how did she get down here i brought her in the car yesterday said jack putting one hand over his ear so that kiki couldnt nibble it she was in the picnicbasket i was carrying as quiet as a mouse i was terrified one of you would ask me to open the basket and get you out something to eat but i say wont porky be upset to have her escape like that said dinah and how did she know you were here if you were down in your cabin wondered lucyann perhaps she heard me call her that must have been it she heard me yelling kiki kiki broke her chain in her excitement and flew over and by a lucky chance she chose your very porthole youd better tell aunt allie all that said jack with a grin it makes a very fine story better than mine the three stared at him in silence youre a determined old fraud jack said philip at last you arranged it all i bet you did yes even arranged for the chain to snap and for kiki to see or hear you at your porthole jack grinned again well i think lucyanns idea is very good shouting to kiki like that and making her so excited that she flew across to the ship anyway shes here and here she stays id better keep her down in the cabin i think they all made a fuss of old kiki who enjoyed it very much indeed she couldnt understand the noise the vibration of the engines made and kept cocking her head on one side to listen she tried an imitation but not a very good one now dont you do any funny noises jack warned her you dont want to be hauled up before the captain do you pop goes the weasel said kiki and pecked his ear then she suddenly gave a most realistic sneeze dont said jack use your handkerchief gosh kiki i couldnt have gone without you everyone was pleased to know that kiki was safely with them they broke the news as gently as possible to mrs mannering she listened in annoyance but it didnt seem to occur to her for one moment that kikis arrival was anything but an unfortunate accident she sighed all right if shes here shes here but for goodness sake jack keep her locked up in the cabin you really will get into trouble if the passengers complain about her and she may be sent to the mens deck and put in a cage if you dont keep a firm hand on her so kiki was locked into the cabin and passed the first day wondering whether she was giddy or whether there was a slight earthquake going on all the time she had no idea she was in a big ship and couldnt understand its movements though she had many a time been in small boats the first day seemed lovely and long the viking star slid easily through the calm blue water her engines purring sweetly leaving behind her a creamy wake that seemed to have no end but to stretch right back to the horizon itself england was soon left behind the first stop was to be lisbon in portugal it was fun to go down to meals in the big diningroom and choose what they liked from the long menu it was fun to go up on the sports deck and play decktennis and try to keep their balance as they ran for the rubber ring it was even fun to go to bed because it meant snuggling down into a narrow bunklike bed turning out the light feeling the breeze from the electric fan cooling their hot bodies and hearing the plishplishplash of the water just below their portholes lovely said lucyann before she fell asleep i hope this trip doesnt turn into an adventure i like it as it is its quite exciting enough without having an adventure it wasnt quite so nice in the bay of biscay the sea was rough and choppy there and the boat pitched and tossed and rolled mrs mannering didnt like it at all she stayed in her cabin but the four children were as right as rain they turned up to every meal in the diningroom and ate steadily right down the menu they would even have gone up to try and play decktennis on the sports deck if one of the stewards hadnt firmly forbidden them to and then quite suddenly as it seemed everything changed the sea grew blue and calm the sun shone out very hotly indeed the sky was brilliant and every officer and man appeared in spotless white mrs mannering felt all right again and kiki grew very impatient at being kept in the cabin she was already great friends with the steward and stewardess who looked after the cabins they had soon got over their astonishment at finding her in jacks cabin they hadnt seen her at first she was sitting behind the little curtain that hung at the side of the porthole which jack had to keep shut in case kiki flew out it was the stewardess who heard her first she had come in to make the beds kiki watched her slyly from behind the curtain then she spoke in a firm and decided voice put the kettle on the stewardess was startled she looked round at the door thinking that someone must be there speaking to her but nobody was kiki gave a loud hiccup pardon she said the stewardess felt alarmed she looked all round she opened the cupboard door what a pity what a pity said kiki in such a mournful voice that the stewardess could bear it no longer and flew to find the steward he was a dour and determined scot with very little patience he came into the cabin and looked round whats to do wumman he said to the stewardess whats scairt ye theres naught here kiki gave a long cough and then sneezed violently pardon she said wheres your hanky now it was the stewards turn to look amazed he stared all round the cabin kiki gave a loud and realistic yawn she had a wonderful collection of noises she couldnt resist looking round the curtain to see how her performance was going the steward saw her and strode over to the porthole now look ye here its a parrot he said did ever ye hear the like a fine clever bird it must be to do all that well polly youre a clever wee bird thats what you are kiki flew to the top of the cupboard and looked at the steward and stewardess first out of one eye and then out of the other then she made a noise like the dinnergong being beaten for the ships meals at the end she went off into one of her cackles of laughter it fair beats ye doesnt it said the scots steward amazed a rare bonny bird it is the laddie that owns it should think shame on himself to keep it shut up here it scared me right enough said the stewardess i wonder if it would like a grape my greataunts parrot loved grapes ill go and get some pretty soon kiki was enjoying some black grapes and when jack came along to see her he found the cabin floor scattered with grapepips and two admiring people gaping at kiki in delight dirty bird said jack sternly looking down at the pips you come down off that cupboard and pick up these pips pips said kiki pops pip goes the weasel i hope she hasnt been annoying you said jack to the stewardess oh shes wonderful said the woman i never saw such a clever bird you ought to take her up and show her off it wasnt very long before jack did take her up to the deck above on his shoulder much to the surprise and amusement of all the passengers kiki had a wonderful time showing off the only thing she couldnt bear was the hoot of the ships siren which always startled her so much that she fell off jacks shoulder in fright every time she heard it she didnt know what it was or where it came from and usually flew off to hide herself somewhere whenever she heard it she came to the lifeboat drill and lucyann was certain she was upset because she hadnt a small life jacket to wear they all put theirs on went to the right lifeboat and listened to a short talk from one of the officers about what they were to do if danger arose lucyann hoped fervently that it wouldnt were going to land in lisbon tomorrow said mrs mannering but none of you is to wander off alone im not going to have any adventure starting up youll all keep close to me please understand that chapter philip collects a pet soon the days began to slip by quickly after lisbon lucyann and dinah lost count of them they didnt even know if the day was monday tuesday or any other they knew sunday because everyone went into the big lounge then and listened to the captain conducting a short church service for days they saw no land philip grew very excited when a shoal of flyingfish flew out of the sea and kept up in the air for some time they were lovely little things what makes them do that wondered lucyann just being chased by some hungry big fish said philip wouldnt you leap out of the water and try and fly through the air if an enormous fish was after you lucyann gosh i wish one of the fish would fly on deck id just love to see it close to well you couldnt possibly make it a pet thank goodness because it would die in your pocket said dinah it seems queer for you to be without any pets at all philip very nice but she spoke too soon because philip collected a pet two days later they had called at madeira left that island and gone on to french morocco it was there that philip collected his queer little pet the children liked french morocco they especially liked the native bazaars although the smell was so terrible that mrs mannering said she could only bear it if she walked along with smellingsalts pressed to her nose the children soon got used to the smell though kiki didnt judging by the number of poohs she said pooh gah pooh dinah tried out her french on the blackeyed natives and was pleased when they understood she bought a tiny brooch and lucyann bought a blue vase dont you see anything you like she asked philip he shook his head i dont want things like that now if i could see something really exciting say an old dagger or i tell you what something ive always wanted and never had whats that asked lucyann determined to buy it for him if only she could see it youll laugh but ive always wanted a ship in a bottle said philip ive never even seen one said lucyann astonished a ship inside a bottle do you mean what a peculiar thing how is it put there i dont know said philip its daft of me to want it really its just one of those ideas you get you know ill be sure to look out for one for you wherever we go promised lucyann oh do look at kiki shes taking sweets from those little brown children shell make herself sick again mrs mannering insisted that they should all stay close to her and keep with the ships party the four children wished they could explore by themselves for they liked the natives and their strange dark narrow little shops certainly not said mrs mannering why didnt you hear what happened to the man at the next table to ours on the ship he and his wife went off by themselves in a taxi to visit some place or other and the driver took them to a deserted hill and wouldnt take them back to the ship till they had given him all the money they had gracious said lucyann alarmed he brought them back just as the gangway was being drawn up went on mrs mannering so they had no time to make any complaint now you know why i want you to keep with the ships party no more adventures for you if i can help it it would be just like you all to disappear somewhere get into awful danger and put a few more grey hairs into my head you havent really got very many said lucyann just about one for each of our adventures thats all i will keep near to you aunt allie i dont want an adventure either the next day there was to be a trip by motorcoach to a famous place inland an old town on the edge of the desert the motorcoaches will be here on the quay at halfpast ten mrs mannering told the four be sure to wear your sunhats it will be terribly hot it was on that trip that philip collected his new pet the motorcoaches duly arrived and everyone crowded into them looking extremely hot off they went at top speed down a sandy road that for a time seemed to run through what looked like a bare desert queer cactusplants grew by the roadside lucyann thought they looked ugly and spiteful with their numerous prickles and fat bulging bodies in two hours time they came to the old town its queer arches and towers seemed to spring up suddenly out of the sand little darkbrown children with hardly anything on ran to meet them their hands held out pennee pennee they said and kiki echoed them at once pennee pennee they all went into the narrow street of the old town the guide took them to an ancient building and began to drone its history then one by one the party climbed steep winding steps up an enormous tower halfway up philip looked out of a great stone window it had no glass of course the wall was so thick that he could sit on the windowsill with his legs stretched right out he hung on to the side of the window and slid forward to look down far below he could see a little crowd of halfnaked children they were pointing upwards and chattering some of them were throwing stones now what are those little beggars throwing stones at thought philip if its something alive ill knock their heads together he slid down from the enormous windowsill and ran down the great winding stairs a stone flew through a windowopening not far from the bottom and he stopped he heard a little whimpering noise and hidden in a corner of the windowopening he saw a little heap of brown fur he went over to it what could it be click a stone flew near him blow those kids he stepped to the window and looked down sternly you stop that he shouted do you hear me stop it the small children looked in consternation at this sudden apparition they disappeared in a hurry philip reached over to the brown bundle a small wizened face peeped out at him with mournful brown eyes then it was covered by tiny hands why its a monkey a tiny monkey thought philip he knew how scared the little creatures were and he was afraid of frightening this poor little stoned animal he had seen plenty of monkeys in that part of the country already but not near they always kept well out of the way philip spoke to the little creature in what lucyann called his special animalvoice it uncovered its queer little face again and then with one bound was cuddling into the boys shoulder nestling against his neck trembling he put up a cautious hand and rubbed its soft fur no animal had ever been able to resist philips magic horses dogs cats snakes insects birds they came to him at once trustfully and confidingly not one could resist him it was a gift that everyone marvelled at and envied him for philip sat down on the broad windowsill and talked to the scared and miserable little monkey it chattered back in a queer high little voice it looked at him shyly out of childlike brown eyes its tiny brown fingers wound themselves round one of his it was philips devoted slave from that moment when the others came pattering down the stairs in front of the rest of the party they were astonished to see the little monkey cuddled up to philip there i knew hed get hold of something sooner or later said dinah ugh a nasty dirty smelly little monkey full of fleas too i expect well it is dirty and smelly and im sure its got fleas said philip but it isnt nasty its been stoned by those wretched little children down below both its back legs are hurt poor little thing said lucyann almost in tears jack stroked the tiny things head but that only made it shrink closer to philip youre not to take it back to the ship with you began dinah i shall tell mother if you do i wont have a monkey in our party hes coming with me said philip sternly dinah began to lose her temper then i shall tell mother i wont have it i shall dinah its so small and its hurt said lucyann in a shaky voice dont talk like that its so unkind dinah flushed and turned away she was cross and horrified at the thought of having a monkey tagging along with them as she put it but she didnt want to go against all three of the others she said no more though she sulked for the rest of the day how philip hid the monkey till he got back to the ship only he knew the fact is that noone even noticed it philip and lucyann helped him valiantly by standing in front of him whenever they thought anyone might see the monkey dinah would not help but on the other hand she did nothing to give the secret away back in the cabin the three children pored over the tiny creature its not even a grown monkey said philip how those children could stone a little thing like this beats me but i suppose in every country there are cruel and unkind people after all weve seen boys in our country throwing stones at a cat look its legs are bruised and cut but theyre not broken i can soon get those right i wonder if it would let me wash it its so dirty the little thing would let philip do anything in the world he wanted to the children spent two hours washing and drying it gently jack brought a little shoebrush to brush its fluffy fur it let philip put iodine on its cuts with only a tiny whimper there said the boy you look fine whats your name the monkey chattered something and the children listened it sounds as if hes saying mickymickymick said lucyann right if he thinks his name is micky micky it is said philip i wonder what kiki will think of him she wont like him much said jack shell be jealous good thing we left her in the girls cabin shed screech the place down if she saw us washing and brushing micky kiki certainly was most amazed to see micky on philips shoulder that night she stared and then just as jack had said she screeched one of her very best expresstrain screeches mrs mannering put her head in at the cabin door to protest she suddenly caught sight of the monkey and stepped forward in surprise wondering if she had seen aright oh philip you oughtnt to have brought it back to the ship what a tiny thing mother some children were stoning it i had to bring it away said philip his mother looked at him it was just exactly the kind of thing philips father had done when he was alive how could she scold him for something that was in his very blood well i dont know if a fuss will be made if you keep him on the ship she said stroking the monkeys head what does dinah say about it she was cross at first but she didnt say much said lucyann shes still in our cabin i think shell get over micky shell have to mickykikimickykikimickykiki said kiki triumphantly as if she had suddenly discovered something very clever she loved words that sounded the same mickykiki mickykiki shut up kiki said philip i say what a pity hes called micky well never stop kiki saying those two words now but he is micky we cant alter his name now so micky he was and in a day or two he was everyones friend yes even dinahs he had such a queer comical face that it was impossible not to like him when he looked at you out of mournful brown eyes hes such a baby and yet hes got such a wise wizened little face said lucyann and i do like his tiny black fingers just like ours dont you dinah well hes not as awful as i thought he was at first admitted dinah i cant say i want him sitting on my shoulder all day long like philip and im sure hes still got fleas but hes really not bad he hasnt got fleas said philip annoyed dont keep saying that micky soon recovered his spirits and from being a gentle confiding little thing he became a mischievous chattering little madcap he leapt about the cabin as lightly as a squirrel and dinah was always scared he would take a flying jump on to her shoulder but he didnt he was wise enough not to do that kiki was alarmed to see these acrobatics and when the two were together in the same cabin she always turned to face micky so that she could jab him with her beak if he leapt at her but he left her alone and took very little notice she didnt like that at all she took to calling his name in philips voice which she could imitate perfectly micky micky the monkey would look round at once but would see no philip micky kiki would say again and the monkey would begin to leap all over the place trying to find philip then kiki would cackle with laughter and micky would go off in disgust and sit on the portholesill with his back to kiki looking through the thick glass out to sea kiki certainly had the best of it because she soon found that she could make noises that terrified micky if she barked like a dog the little creature went nearly frantic with fright he was puzzled too he watched kiki closely and soon realized that no dog barked unless kiki was in the cabin then was kiki some kind of birddog the next time she barked she followed it by a fierce growl this was too much for micky he picked up a tablet of soap from the basin and flung it at the surprised kiki it hit her full on the beak and she gave a squawk of alarm and nearly fell off her perch micky sent a toothbrush after the soap and then the toothmug he was a very fine shot and soon kiki was flying round the cabin trying to find a place to hide from the volley of articles that micky was sending after her hairbrushes combs a roll of films anything he could get hold of philip stopped the battle when he came in micky pick them all up he said sternly what did kiki do to you to make you lose your temper like that bad micky naughty micky bad boy said kiki at once and went off into one of her cackles of laughter micky picked everything up humbly then he went to sit on philips shoulder as usual kiki was jealous she flew to his other shoulder the monkey chattered at her kiki chattered back in exactly the same monkeyvoice as micky used he stared in amazement and chattered back excitedly philip listened amused well i dont really know if you understand one another or not he said but its just as well you should i dont want to find my cabin strewn with all my belongings each time i come into it so just be friends do you hear kiki and micky pooh said kiki in a friendly voice and nibbled at him pooh to you said philip and kindly stop nibbling my ear chapter lucian arrives the children soon felt that the viking star was their home a floating home containing everything they wanted except the open countryside they got to know every nook and cranny on the ship they explored the engineroom under the eye of mac the chief engineer and they were even allowed up on the bridge by the first officer a very great honour mrs mannering made friends on the ship with two or three people she liked there were only a few children on board besides jack and the others and they were much younger and so spoilt that nobody wanted to have much to do with them id rather wish there were more children of your own age mrs mannering said to her four it might be more fun for you well we dont want anyone else thanks said philip were all right on our own its bad enough having those other spoilt kids around always wanting to mess about with micky and trying to get kiki to talk to them shes too sensible said jack kiki just looks at them and says shut up whenever she sees them how rude of her said mrs mannering i do hope you stop her when she talks like that to the other children well actually i dont said jack she only says what i jolly well would like to say myself spoilt little brats im going to push that nasty little yellowhaired girl into the swimmingpool one of these days coming whining round me asking me if she can hold kiki hold kiki what does she think kiki is one of her frightful dolls you mustnt push the child into the pool said mrs mannering horrified i do agree she wants slapping but shes only a little girl jack shes a human mosquito said jack i just wish i had a flyswatter when she comes near well all the kids are getting off at the next stop said philip fondling micky who as usual was on his shoulder the boys looked a curious pair one with a parrot on his shoulder the other with a monkey the passengers smiled whenever they saw them im glad to hear those tiresome children will soon be gone said dinah who was not very fond of youngsters but i expect some equally obnoxious ones will embark in their place she was wrong as it happened only one boy embarked no girls at all all the spoilt youngsters left stumbling down the gangway at naples screaming and complaining to the last certainly a most unpleasant collection of small children jack and the others watched them go with pleasure and kiki screeched after them goodbye good riddance goodbye good riddance jack shes never said that before said mrs mannering reproachfully you must just have taught her kiki only reads my thoughts aunt allie laughed jack i say look here here comes rabbitmouth the children giggled as they watched a tall gangling boy come up the gangway his mouth certainly was exactly like a rabbits the front teeth stuck out and his chin sloped backwards he was about as old as jack and philip he wore large round glasses that magnified his eyes and made them look rather staring he had a very amiable grin on his face as he came up the gangway he seemed very excited and was talking in a mixture of english and some foreign language to a rather languidlooking lady behind him and a short burly man who wore dark sunglasses that completely hid his eyes uncle aunt were off at last oh i say what a magnificent ship im sure i shant be seasick in her then he went off into what sounded like a string of gibberish but was really a foreign language kiki cocked her head when she hard this string of what sounded to her like complete nonsense as the boy passed she spoke to him in a conversational tone pouring out the same kind of gibberish that she had heard the boy looked at her in amazement oh i say a talking parrot oh i say oh i say repeated kiki immediately oh i say oh i say shut up kiki dont be rude said jack micky leaned forward on philips shoulder and sent out a stream of excited chattering to kiki the rabbitmouthed boy stared in delight oh i say a talking monkey too whats he saying he says he thinks hes seen you somewhere before but he cant remember where and he wants to know if kiki the parrot remembers said philip solemnly lucyann gave a delighted giggle the boy stared openmouthed then he laughed showing all his rabbitteeth oh youre pulling my leg arent you but i say what fun a parrot that talks and a tame monkey arent you lucky get on lucian get on said the burly man behind him and gave the boy a push lucian went forward at a run turning round to give the four children an apologetic grin for leaving them so abruptly the man said something in an annoyed voice to the woman with him but as he said it in a foreign language the children didnt understand a word they guessed at once however that lucian was not very popular with his uncle well if rabbitmouth is the only boy to come on board here i suppose hell pin himself on to us all day long said philip what a weed oh i say said kiki jack groaned now we shall have kiki saying that day and night its a good thing micky cant talk properly wed never get a word in edgeways the ship sailed off again into waters bluer than ever it was pleasant to go to the bow of the ship and feel the breeze both kiki and micky liked this too just as jack and philip had feared the rabbitmouthed boy tagged himself on to them whenever he could the children always knew when he was coming because kiki invariably gave them warning oh i say she would squawk and the four would sigh lucian again he would come up grinning amiably and settle himself beside them he told them all about himself immediately he had no father or mother his father had been english but his mother was greek so he had plenty of greek relations he went to school in england but spent most of his holidays with his relations he was fourteen nearly fifteen he didnt like games he loved history and he wished his name wasnt lucian why asked dinah well because the boys at my school change it to lucyann explained lucian i mean fancy having a name thats as girlish as that its my name said lucyann i like it well its very nice for you said lucian but awful for me especially when they shorten it and call me lucy juicy lucy said kiki at once in delight juicy lucy oh i say everybody roared even lucian kiki cackled too juicy lucy gooseylucy oh i say caroled kiki oh i say really that bird of yours is a regular comic isnt she said lucian in admiration gosh i wish i could borrow her to take back to school i say do you take her to school with you i used to said jack regretfully but she kept telling our formmaster to wipe his feet and shut the door and when she yelled out dont sniff use your hanky to the head well that was about the end do you remember how you put her in a cupboard once to hide her in class and she went off like fireworks fizzling and popping and exploding said philip with a grin it was just after guy fawkes day she remembered the noises lucian listened in the greatest admiration his rabbitmouth open as if he listened with that as well as with his ears oh i say what happened well we exploded too said philip and after that the master did in a different way of course we had to put kiki out to live with someone in the village we go to see her every day of course and have her on halfholidays and weekends and she always goes to every school match and cheers like anything doesnt she jack said lucyann shes a wonder said lucian let me have her for a minute look out she wont go to strangers warned jack but lucian was already trying to get hold of the wonderful parrot he soon let her go she gave him a vicious nip with her curved beak and he yelled to lucyanns amazement she saw tears in his eyes he turned and went off without a word sucking his bleeding thumb the others looked at one another he was crying said lucyann in sheer amazement that a boy of fourteen should do such a thing hes a nitwit said jack trying to calm down kiki who had put up her crest tremendously and was dancing angrily from one foot to another nitwit said kiki pouncing on the word at once nitwit witnit titbit bitnit oh i say youre a bad bird nipping people like that scolded jack that was a nasty nip nipwit announced kiki yes thats about what you are a nipwit said jack with a chuckle now dont you start micky weve had enough rudery from kiki micky had started off on one of his long strings of excited gibberish it was comical to see how seriously and solemnly kiki listened to this with her head on one side she answered the little monkey solemnly when he had finished his excited announcement whatever it was rikkylikkyacky icky poppoppop she said the children roared she thinks shes talking his language good old kiki you cant get the better of her said philip im glad shes more friendly with micky now hes such a dear hes getting awfully mischievous though said dinah who now thought of the monkey much more kindly he went into a dozen cabins yesterday and collected all the soaps out of the basins and put them in one of the armchairs in the lounge gracious said jack hell be getting into trouble soon you mean we shall said philip i wish we could teach kiki to keep an eye on micky for us but she encourages him im sure it was kiki who told the monkey to climb up the pole to the man in the crowsnest there and give him an awful fright mickys a dear said lucyann and she tickled him under his furry chin he looked at her with wise sad eyes lucyann knew he was very happy now but she was always worried because he looked at her sorrowfully she only half believed philip when he told her that all monkeys looked sad theres the gong for lunch said lucyann thankfully i feel as if its about an hour late today im so hungry come on everybody chapter the tale of andras treasure the viking star was now going off to cruise among the islands of the aegean sea the water was a beautiful dark blue and the children thought it was the nicest part of the trip seeing the islands loom up out of the purpleblue sea lucian proved himself quite useful here because he knew that part of the sea very well he was able to tell them about the different islands and he was full of exciting stories of old pirates and robberies at sea and the taking of treasure see that island were coming to he said thats oupos its only small but its got an old castle on it with one of the biggest dungeons in the world the old sailors used to take prisoners at sea and sail to oupos and dump their prisoners in the dungeons sometimes they left them there for years till they were old men how horrible said lucyann have you been on oupos yes once said lucian i saw the holes for the dungeons too nearly fell down one myself what do you mean holes for the dungeons asked philip well the yard of the old castle was pitted with holes deep very deep holes explained lucian and when a prisoner was landed on the island he was dragged to the great yard and popped down the nearest hole he fell down down into the dungeons below and joined the other prisoners there how awful couldnt he get out again asked jack in horror no the only way out was up the steep deep holes said lucian no one could climb up those but how were the prisoners fed asked philip easy said lucian the guards just went to the holes each day and tipped food down i dont know whether to believe that or not said jack i tell you ive been on the island and seen the holes insisted lucian of course the dungeons arent used now the yard is all overgrown and you can hardly see the dungeon holes thats how i nearly fell down one would you have been there till you were old asked lucyann of course not my uncle would have got a rope and hauled me up said lucian i should probably have broken my leg though tell us some more tales about these old islands said jack i wouldnt mind visiting one or two well i daresay we could if i asked my uncle said lucian surprisingly what do you mean whats your uncle got to do with it demanded philip you talk as if he owned the islands he does own quite a few said lucian didnt i tell you its a craze of his i think he buys this one and that one explores it thoroughly and then maybe he gets tired of it and sells it again the four children looked at lucian to see if he was telling the truth it seemed extraordinary to them that anyone should buy and sell islands as if they were cakes or something but what does he do it for asked jack i mean is he interested in old things is he looking for antiques or something hes very interested in history said lucian yes and in old things generally you should see his house in athens hes got the most marvellous collection of things from these old islands hes crazy about them the children thought about lucians uncle they couldnt tell if he was crazy or not he seemed an ordinary rather cross grownup to them hard to size up because he always wore dark glasses and they couldnt see his eyes you dont know what people are thinking if you cant see their eyes lucyann said and it was true i expect i get my liking for history from my uncle said lucian im always top in that bottom in everything else of course and i loathe games yes youve told us that before said jack but only about fifteen times put in dinah oh i say said lucian sorry its just that i do detest them so much sixteen times said lucyann gooseylucy remarked kiki very aptly the children thought they grinned at one another lucian was a goose a silly credulous aggravating tiresome goose a nitwit and a rabbit but he was quite harmless and caused them a lot of amusement to come back to your uncle said jack do you honestly mean he owns some of these exciting islands oh yes he doesnt own oupos now but he owns the one well soon be passing thatll be helios hes about finished with it now though he sent his men there to dig and explore but they didnt find much what did they find asked lucyann with interest let me see they found three magnificent vases but that was about all said lucian they were cracked of course they nearly always are it seems to me he found a pair of daggers too frightfully old i think those were and he got a lot of rubbish too you know bits of broken crockery pieces of jewellery not worth anything oh yes and he got a little carving of a goose he gave it to me gooseylucy put in kiki again she appeared to be listening hard to all this rigmarole of lucians shut up kiki dont interrupt said jack go on lucy i mean lucian oh i say dont you start calling me that jack said lucian looking hurt dont be an ass get on with your story said jack he had no patience with lucian when he began getting hurt which happened quite a lot do you know any more stories about the islands asked lucyann seeing that lucian still looked upset well theres the story of the andra treasureships said lucian thats supposed to be absolutely true ive heard my uncle tell it many a time go on tell us said philip scratching mickys back for him as he lay cuddled in the boys arms fast asleep well it happened hundreds of years ago began lucian i cant remember the exact date there was a king called panlostes who had a kingdom on one of these islands a large one i expect you know that most of them had rulers of their own well panlostes had a son what was he called asked lucyann i dont know said lucian anyway this son had an accident when he was small and he lost one eye and hurt his foot so that he limped he wanted to marry the daughter of a king on the mainland of greece a girl called andra but she wouldnt have him because he was oneeyed and limped i suppose said jack and there was someone else she liked and wanted to marry well if you know the story began lucian half annoyed i dont but i know lots like it said jack go on andras father said the girl should marry the oneeyed prince if king panlostes would send him gold and arms and treasure worth half his kingdom went on lucian warming up again so the king got ready a fleet of ships and stuffed them with riches of all kinds and one morning they set sail from the island to go to the mainland lucyann gazed out over the darkblue sea imagining the fleet of small ships their sails filled with the wind their holds packed with rich treasure she heard the sharp commands the creaking of the old wooden ships the billowing flapping noise of the sails lucian took another breath and continued well the girl andra sent word to the man she really wanted to marry to tell him about the ships and he got ready some ships himself and set out to intercept the treasurefleet did he find them asked lucyann yes he did but when he attacked them and finally defeated the fleet he found no treasure gracious where had it gone asked dinah had they dumped it into the sea or something no the captain of the fleet had never meant to deliver the treasure safely he had made up his mind to take it to an island he knew of land it there hide it safely and come back for it when he could he meant to tell both the kings that he had been attacked and robbed on the way to the mainland and he was attacked but he had hidden the treasure said jack what happened next the captain was killed and so were half the men the rest of them made off in their ships and scattered far and wide search was made for the hidden treasure but it couldnt be found golly was nothing more ever heard of it said philip oh yes some of the men thought they remembered where the island was where they had landed the treasure one night they made up an expedition secretly and went to look for it they quarreled and fought and in the end only two or three men were left one of them had made a rough map a map of the island was it ever found asked dinah in excitement yes years later a greek merchantman got hold of it somehow and pored over the old map till he had made some sense out of it he made up his mind that it could refer to only five out of all the islands in the aegean sea and there are heaps and heaps you know so he began to explore them one by one did he find the right one asked lucyann her eyes shining this is a lovely story i think yes the old story says he did find the island and found out where the treasure was too but before he could do anything about it he died there was a disappointed silence but who got the treasure then asked jack nobody said lucian the old merchantman never told a soul but its said theres a copy of the map and plan he made somewhere goodness knows where he hid it before he died or so people say he lived about a hundred years ago what a thrilling story said dinah i wish we could find the map where did the old man live surely the map would be hidden in the house he had i should think its been searched from top to bottom said lucian i know the island he lived on we shall come to it in a days time its called amulis oh are we going to land on it cried lucyann id like to yes we usually do call there said lucian its quite a big island with towns and villages and some good shops that sell antiques and things visitors often go in parties from the ships and buy things well go together said dinah i want to buy some things i havent nearly enough come with us lucian youll really be a very great help chapter lucian is very helpful mrs mannering was pleased to hear that the ship was to call at the romantic island of amulis she like the children had been fascinated by all the mistypurple islands that kept looming up in the darkblue sea she had been dipping into greek history and somehow it seemed as if the aegean sea belonged to the past not to the present the children borrowed her books and read them too how old these islands were and what stories they held lucyann was fascinated by them she stood at the deckrail and watched all day long why are there so many she said what do you call a collection of so many islands its a long name i know archipelago said mrs mannering you know lucyann its said that once all these islands were joined together making a great mainland then something happened and the sea rushed into what is now the mediterranean basin filled it up and drowned a lot of this mainland only the highest parts the hills and mountains were left and they show above the water as islands the aegean islands we are cruising among my goodness said lucyann her quick imagination showing her a great sweep of water rushing relentlessly over a land where towns and villages stood swallowing them up one by one drowning them and at last leaving only the highest parts showing above the surface of the waters oh aunt allie do you mean that far below us on the ocean bed are the ruined remains of cities and villages did it happen long ago thousands and thousands of years ago said mrs mannering there wouldnt be a trace of them left now but it explains the myriads of little islands in this sea im glad we are to visit one of the them youre not afraid of us falling into some exciting adventure now are you said lucyann slyly you think it will be safe to visit this romantic little island quite safe said mrs mannering laughing for one thing i shall be with you weve asked lucian to come too said dinah i know hes a nitwit but he really does know about these islands mother hes told us all sorts of stories about them his uncle owns some of them yes i heard that he did said mrs mannering ive talked to his wife quite a nice woman i cant say id like a husband who did nothing but buy up islands and dig frantically for months then sell them and start somewhere else hes got a bee in his bonnet i think still he certainly seems to have made some interesting finds finds that have made him a wealthy man the viking star sailed into a small port the next day the children were hanging over the deckrail and were surprised when their ship came to a stop and anchored where she was without steaming to the jetty we cant get any closer in the jetty isnt suitable for us were too big explained one of the officers to the children youll go ashore in a motorlaunch sure enough a launch came out to the ship and a score or so of passengers climbed down the ladder to the deck of the launch the four children went of course and lucian also mrs mannering and some of the other interested passengers lucians people didnt go they knew so much about the island that they had no desire to visit amulis but to the children it was all very thrilling indeed the motorlaunch sped off to the jetty where they all landed lucian was quite at home on the island which he had visited before with his uncle you keep with me i can show you all the interesting things he said and i can talk to the people too and bargain for you if you want to buy anything lucian was certainly very very useful he pushed off the dirty little children who came crowding round begging for money and sent out such a fierce stream of queersounding words that even kiki was most impressed he knew his way about and was quite good at explaining things heres the market the people from the hills up there bring their goods down here look at all the stalls then they spend the money they get at the shops in the town or they go to the cinema the natives were a picturesque lot but rather dirty they wore big hats because of the sun and a collection of nondescript white garments that might have been anything but which suited them quite well the children were beautiful lucyann thought with their dark eyes beautifully shaped faces and thick curling hair lucian took them to an old ruined castle but the boys were disappointed because there were no dungeons to be seen the girls were amazed to see people apparently living in parts of the castle together with their goats and hens theyre only poor peasants explained lucian theyve got nowhere else to live further inland if id time to take you youd see people living in caves in the mountainsides they used to do that thousands of years ago too its queer to think those caves have sheltered people century after century do those cavepeople go to the cinema in the town asked dinah oh yes they love it though they cant read anything on the screen of course none of them can read or write said lucian they live in two worlds really the world of long ago when people used caves as shelter and scraped along with their goats and hens and geese and in the world of today where there are motorcars and cinemas and so on a queer mixture said jack i shouldnt know where i was oh they know all right said lucian and he paused to shout angrily at a small child who was trying slyly to pull at a ribbon lucyann was wearing in her dress kiki also began to scream excitedly and micky jumped up and down on philips shoulder chattering the child flew away in terror lucyann felt quite sorry for it lucian took them to the shops some of them were small native shops dark and full of strange goods one shop which was full of antiques to attract visitors was quite big you can go in here if you want to look around and buy something said lucian oh i say wheres micky gone just to have a little exercise on the canopy over the shop said philip micky was amusing the way he often leapt off philips shoulder and hung on to all kinds of things near by scampering here and there flinging himself through the air to some fresh place never once falling or missing his hold he was now galloping over the suncanopy running from side to side occasionally stopping to fling himself up to a windowledge overhead and then drop back but when he saw that philip was going into the shop below he threw himself down from the canopy and with a flying leap was back on the boys shoulder cant get rid of you can i said philip youre a bad penny always turning up and you do make my neck so hot the shop was fascinating to the four children they had no idea which things were genuinely old and which were not lucian with the knowledge he had picked up from his uncle pointed out a few really old things but they were far too expensive to buy lucyann looked at her money and asked lucian if there was anything at all she could afford to buy he counted it up it was greek money and lucyann had no idea of its value yes you might buy one or two things he said theres this blue carved stone for instance no i dont want that said lucyann i really want to buy something for philip its his birthday soon is there anything he would like dont let him see it its to keep for his birthday well what about this tiny carved ship said lucian holding out a miniature ship exactly like some of the ships in the harbour it isnt old of course seeing the ship reminded lucyann of something oh i know what id like to buy for him lucian ive just thought something he badly wants whats that said lucian he wants a ship in a bottle said lucyann i know it sounds a queer thing to ask for but philip says he always has wanted a ship in a bottle well i dont think ive ever seen one here said lucian its not the kind of thing they sell wait a minute ill ask the johnny whos at the back of the shop hell know he made his way through the masses of curious goods and disappeared behind a screen where he could be heard talking to someone he appeared again a minute later no they dont sell things like that here he said but he says he knows where there is one though its rather a dirty old thing and he thinks its cracked where is it asked lucyann i could clean it up if it isnt too badly cracked he says he saw it on a shelf in a house belonging to an old fisherman not far from here said lucian ill like you if you like would mrs mannering mind mrs mannering was with the ships party but she was keeping an eye on lucian and his little company lucyann thought she had better go and ask permission she went out of the shop and found mrs mannering with the rest of the party having a cool native drink in a curious little courtyard overshadowed by an enormous tree aunt allie i want to give philip a ship in a bottle for his birthday and ive heard of one lucian says hell take me to get it may i go asked the little girl yes but dont be long lucian said mrs mannering its not far is it oh no just behind the market thats all said lucian and set off with lucyann they crossed the noisy market falling over stray hens and getting in the way of a herd of goats they came to a tall blank wall and went around it on the other side was a sloping courtyard and round it were set several quaint little cottages made of stone lucian went to one of them and shouted in at the open door a croaking voice answered him want to come in he asked lucyann it will be a bit smelly i expect lucyann didnt really want to go in but she thought it would be rude to refuse so she stepped over a hen that was squatting on the step and went into a small dark room that certainly did smell rather strongly of dirty clothes smoke and cooking theres the ship in a bottle look said lucian and he pointed to a stone shelf at the end of the room there was a broken pot on it an old bone and the bottle lucyann peered at the bottle to see if there was a ship inside it was so sooty and dirty that she couldnt see through the glass lucian said something to the old woman sitting on a stool picked up the bottle and carried it to the door he wiped it with his handkerchief and held up the bottle for lucyann to see there you are you can just see the ship now wed have to wash the bottle in soapy water before we got the dirt off its quite a good ship nicely carved and i should think philip would like it if he really wants one though i cant imagine why anyone should long for a ship in a bottle oh i can said lucyann peering at the ship ive often longed for things like this you know quite useless but nice and queer i had a friend once who had a glass ball and inside was a little snowman and when you shook the ball a whole lot of snow rose up inside the ball and showered itself down over the snowman i loved that so i know why philip wants this well shall i ask the old dame if shell sell it asked lucian the bottle is dirty and cracked so its not worth much yes ask her you know how much money ive got i can spend all that said lucyann lucian went back into the cottage with the bottle nearly falling over two ducking hens on the way a loud argument could be heard from inside lucyann stayed out in the open air listening but not understanding a word she felt she couldnt bear to smell the smell inside the cottage again lucian came out triumphant he carried the bottle well there you are ive spent half your money the old dame wanted the money badly but she said she didnt know what her old grandad would think if he knew shed sold a ship that had been in that bottle and in that family for years and years however as her grandad must have died long ago i dont expect hell mind here you are oh thank you lucian said lucyann gratefully ill get a bit of paper and wrap it up i do do hope philip will like it its an exciting present isnt it but it was going to be much much more exciting than lucyann imagined chapter the ship in the bottle lucyann managed to get some paper and wrap up the bottle and ship before philip saw it the others were curious to know what she had got but she wouldnt tell them its something breakable because youre carrying it so carefully said jack when they got back to the ship she unwrapped the bottle when she and dinah got into their cabin and showed it to her what a dirty old thing said dinah what is it you havent spent your money on that surely half of it said lucyann its for philips birthday he said he wanted one its a ship in a bottle is it really gosh so it is said dinah interested lets clean it up and see it properly isnt it a big one they rubbed soap on a flannel and proceeded to clean up the bottle once the glass was clean the ship inside could be plainly seen it was a beauty quite big intricately carved with carefullymade sails in contrast to the bottle it was clean and free from dust the colours it had been painted with were still bright look at that said lucyann in delight it must be a model of one of the old greek ships how did it get into the bottle dinah look the neck of the bottle is small and narrow nobody could possibly push that lovely little ship through the neck it would be quite impossible i cant imagine how it got into the bottle said dinah puzzled too but its certainly inside wont philip be pleased i rather like it myself oh so do i its wizard said lucyann she stood it on a shelf the bottle had a flat side and stood on this the lovely little ship sailing along as it seemed in the middle of the bottle all its sails set whats the ship called said dinah peering at it i cant tell can you the letters on it arent like ours they must be greek the ship in the bottle was duly given to philip two days later on his birthday he was thrilled lucyann glowed with delight when she saw how pleased he was but where did you get it why its the nicest one ive ever seen he said quite the nicest really beautifully made i wonder how old it is im glad its such a nice big one too most of the ships in bottles ive seen are much smaller than this micky and kiki came to look at the ship in the bottle micky saw the ship through the glass and tried to get hold of it he couldnt of course because of the glass and it puzzled him happy christmas said kiki to philip every now and again she had been taught to say happy returns but she kept mixing it up with happy christmas which she said every few minutes thanks old thing philip said happy new year to you oh dont muddle her any more said dinah lets go and show mother the ship in the bottle they went up on deck and found mrs mannering her deckchair was next to lucians aunts chair which she found rather trying sometimes as she didnt very much like the uncle look mother see what lucyanns given me for my birthday something ive always wanted said philip it was admired and then passed on to lucians aunt and uncle to see mr eppy looked at it carefully he seemed puzzled the ship is very old really old he said but the bottle is modern the idea of a ship in a bottle is a comparatively recent one of course but the ship inside is far older almost an antique very interesting its got a name carved on it very small said lucyann i cant read it can you mr eppy he peered at it and spelt it out yes andra queer name for a ship never heard of one called that in greek ive heard the name before said lucyann and she tried to remember oh yes wasnt it the name of the girl in that lovely treasure story of lucians the girl who didnt want to marry a oneeyed man well we often call our ships by the names of girls or women look at our big liners queen mary and queen elizabeth i dont see why a greek ship shouldnt be called after a princess too mr eppy wasnt listening he wasnt at all interested in any of the children not even in lucian his own nephew he yawned and settled himself to sleep mrs mannering nodded to the children to go micky and kiki were rather tiresome when anyone wanted to sleep kikis squawks and mickys chatter and tricks didnt appeal to the grownups as much as they did to the children they took the ship and bottle back to the cabin this time to the boys cabin philip decided to put it on the shelf opposite his bed where he could see it he was very pleased with it indeed it was quaint and queer and beautiful and he had always wanted it now he had it be careful that monkey of yours doesnt tamper with it jack warned him hes very curious about the ship inside keeps trying to touch it through the glass and he gets quite annoyed when he cant the viking star cruised from island to island time didnt seem to exist and not one of the children had any idea of the days it was all like a pleasant dream where fortunately the food tasted very real and very nice in fact as jack said if the food hadnt tasted jolly real he might honestly have thought that he was dreaming and then a squabble blew up between micky and kiki that broke up the dream in a strange way and made things very real and earnest indeed from that time onwards it happened one evening the boys had gone up to play decktennis with the girls and for once had left micky and kiki down below in their cabin micky was such a nuisance when they played decktennis because he would fling himself after the rubber ring and if he got it tear up to the top of the nearest pole and sit there chattering in glee so he had been relegated to the cabin that sunny evening with kiki as company kiki was cross she didnt like being left behind she sat on the portholesill and sulked making a horrible moaning noise that distressed micky very much the monkey went to sit beside her looking at her enquiringly and putting out a sympathetic paw to stroke kikis feathers kiki growled like a dog and micky retreated to the shelf where he sat looking puzzled and sad he tried once more to comfort kiki by taking jacks toothbrush over to her and trying to brush her feathers with it chuckling with delight kiki turned her back on him and finally put her head under her wing which always puzzled and frightened micky he didnt like her to have no head he began to look for it cautiously parting the parrots feathers carefully and gently where had the head gone kiki spoke from the depth of her feathers nitwit nitwit nitwit oh i say grrrrrrr wipe the door and shut your feet god save the king micky left her in despair he would wait till she grew her head again and became the jolly parrot he knew he put the toothbrush back into its mug and considered the sponge near by he picked it up and sucked some moisture out of it he sponged his little face with it as he had seen philip do then he got tired of that and darted back to the shelf again what could he do he looked down at the shelf on it was the ship in the bottle micky cautiously put his hand down to the bottle why couldnt he get that little thing inside why couldnt he get it and play with it he put his head on one side and considered the ship inside he picked up the bottle and nursed it like a doll crooning in his monkey language kiki took her head out of her wing and looked round at him when she saw him nursing the bottle she was jealous and cross shut the door shut the door naughty boy she scolded wheres your hanky pop goes the weasel micky didnt understand a word and it wouldnt have made any difference if he had he shook the bottle hard kiki raised her crest and scolded again naughty naughty bad boy poppoppop micky chattered at her and wouldnt put the bottle down kiki flew across to the shelf and gave the surprised monkey a hard peck he gave an anguished howl and flung the bottle away from him nursing his bleeding arm the bottle fell to the floor with a crash and broke in half the little ship inside was shaken loose from its base and fell over on its side micky saw it and leapt down to it here was that thing inside the bottle at last he picked it up and retired under the bed in silence kiki was shocked by the noise of the bottle falling and breaking she knew it was a bad thing to happen she made a noise like a motormower and then relapsed into silence what would philip say five minutes later the two boys came clattering into the cabin to wash and put on clean things for dinner the first thing they saw was the broken bottle on the floor philip looked at it in horror look its smashed either kiki or micky must have done it wheres the ship said jack looking all round it was nowhere to be seen it wasnt till they hauled micky out from underneath the bed that they got the ship he hadnt harmed it at all he got three hard smacks and kiki got three hard taps on her beak my beautiful present groaned philip looking at the little carved ship look isnt it a beauty jack you can see it better out of the bottle jack looked at it and pulled at a tiny knob in one side whats this he said to his great surprise the knob came out and he could look inside the ship its hollow inside he said and theres something there philip looks like paper or parchment i say what can it be philip suddenly felt excited parchment then it must be an old document and why should it be hidden inside the ship only because it contains a secret i say this is super goodness knows what the document is lets probe it out and see said jack look this little section of the ship can be moved now weve taken that knob out and well just about have room to get out the parchment be careful it may fall to pieces if its very old philip warned him jack removed the loose section of the ship and put it beside the knob then very carefully he began to try and probe out the parchment but he was excited and his hands trembled too much then the gong went to say that dinner was ready we cant go we cant go groaned jack we must find out what this is look out youre tearing it said philip lets wait till after dinner jack we wont have time now and i think the girls ought to be here to see all this yes youre right well wait till after dinner said jack with a sigh lock the whole thing up philip we cant risk anything happening to the ship and its secret so they locked the little ship up in a cupboard and then hot with excitement went up to have their dinner what a thrill they could hardly wait to tell the girls the two girls couldnt imagine what was the matter with the boys that dinnertime jack kept grinning quite idiotically at them and philip did his best to do a little whispering to give the news mrs mannering frowned at him in surprise philip you forget yourself say what you have to say out loud please that was just what philip couldnt do of course er who won at decktennis he said feebly well really i cant imagine why you had to say that in a whisper said mrs mannering dont be silly philip sorry mother said philip not looking in the least sorry but extraordinarily pleased he simply couldnt help it he kept thinking of the ship and its secret parchment it was something really exciting he was sure of it as soon as dinner was over the four children slipped away when they got to a safe corner jack clutched at the girls lucyann dinah what is it said dinah you both acted like lunatics at dinner whats up with you sh listen you know that ship in a bottle began jack but philip interrupted him no let me tell well micky and kiki broke the bottle between them the wretches and when we got down into the cabin there it was smashed on the floor and the ship was gone where said lucyann upset micky had it under the bed we got it and looked at it and will you believe it there was a knob that came out and then we could remove another section of the ship and inside theres a parchment document of some sort no cried the girls both together thrilled to hear the news its true you come down and see dont tell anyone though especially lucian its our own secret they all tore down to the boys cabin and nearly knocked over the steward who had been turning down the beds sorry said jack have you finished steward yes ive finished but whats all your hurry said the astonished steward he got no answer the door closed in his face and he heard the latch being put across to lock it now what were those lambs of children up to inside the cabin the light was switched on and the cupboard unlocked philip took out the little carved ship the others crowded round to look at it see you take out this knob and that loosens this section of the side and it comes right out said philip and now look can you see the document neatly crammed inside im sure its parchment the girls took a deep breath gosh its a thrill said dinah get it out quick well have to be careful not to tear it said jack stand back a bit you girls you keep jogging my arm how the boys managed to wheedle the closelyfolded paper out of the inside of the wooden ship was a miracle little by little they edged it out until at last it was completely out and the inside of the ship was empty there we are said jack triumphantly as he laid the yellow parchment carefully on the dressingtable now to see what it is with gentle careful fingers philip unfolded the parchment it spread out into quite a big sheet the children pored over it thrilled its a map a plan of some kind i cant read the words blow they must be in greek or something what is it it looks like some island or something look at these marks they must be the bearings of the compass look would that be north south east west its two maps thats what it is look this bit must show an island i think surely thats meant to be sea round it and that bit is a plan a plan of some building i should think with passages and things the excited talk went on and on each of the four children trying to press closer still to the map philip remembered that he had a magnifyingglass and went to get it then they could all see even better and could make out a few strange words and marks too faded to see before see this queer word here at the lefthand side right at the top said lucyann suddenly well it looks exactly like the name on the ship doesnt it lets compare them and see they looked at both the words first on the ship and then on the map they certainly were the same well mr eppy said the ships name was andra and if the name on the map is the same it must have something to do with an island or a person called andra said dinah there was a silence everyone was digesting this and wondering if they dared to say what they thought it meant no it wasnt possible it simply wasnt possible lucyann voiced their feelings first she spoke in rather a breathless voice andra the name of the girl who wouldnt marry the oneeyed prince do you suppose that one of the ships of treasure sent out and lost was called andra in her honour and do you suppose andra was the name given to the search for the treasure and thats why this ship and this map are marked andra it cant be said jack under his breath it isnt possible that we have hit on the old plan that was lost the copy of the older plan made hundreds of years ago it just isnt possible its probably a hoax said philip feeling perfectly certain that it wasnt no it cant be said dinah mr eppy who knows about old things told us this ship was old didnt he he was puzzled about it because he said the ship was far older than the bottle well ill tell you what i think said jack slowly i think this may be the plan and i think probably that old greek merchantman who copied the original one and died hid it in this ship which he may have carved himself yes and after he died his family may have kept it as a curio not knowing what was inside it and later on somebody else got the ship and thought it would be a very suitable one for putting inside a bottle finished philip but how did it get inside wondered lucyann thats a real puzzle to me oh dont be silly everyone knows how a ship gets into a bottle said jack impatiently all they do is to blow a glass bottle round the ship idiot you know how bottles are made dont you blown like bubbles of glass well thats how ships get inside bottles the glass is just blown round them gosh how clever said lucyann she looked at the ship again and at the map lying beside it old and yellowed to think we are looking at a plan that was first drawn ages ago by a greek captain in charge of a fleet of treasureships and on this very map is shown where that treasure is still hidden and were the only people in the world that know the secret it certainly was rather a tremendous thought silence fell on the four children they looked at one another lucyann spoke again timidly jack philip this wont be another adventure will it nobody answered her they were all thinking about the strange map jack voiced their thoughts the thing is as lucyann says we may be the only ones in the world that know this secret but its all greek to us we cant read a word on the map we dont even know what the name of the island is that is marked here its maddening we shall have to find out said dinah oh yes run around to various greek people mr eppy for instance and say please will you decipher this strange document for us thats not a very bright idea dinah anyone who knows anything would see there was something worth while in this map and it would disappear like a shot oh dear would it said lucyann do lets be careful of it then i know what we could do to make sure nobody could possibly steal it and use it said jack we could cut it carefully into four pieces and each one of us could have a bit then if anyone tried to grab our bit he wouldnt be any better off hed only have a quarter of the plan which wouldnt help him much yes thats a good idea said philip though why we are imagining thieves and robbers like this i dont know only because weve had a bit of experience in our other adventures said dinah were getting to know how to handle them now and you know said jack still thinking of his plan if we cut the map into four pieces we could quite well go to four different people to ask them to decipher each quarter without their seeing the other bits at all so they wouldnt be any wiser but we could fit their explanations together and get a complete picture of what the map means thats really a very clever idea jack said philip considering it all the same i vote we dont go to mr eppy about one of the bits i dont see why not said jack he wont be able to tell anything from one bit and we certainly shant say weve got the rest in fact it wouldnt be a bad idea to go to him first hed be able to tell all right if it was a genuine document if it isnt we shant need to waste our time trailing round to find three other people to decipher the other bits do you think he might guess what we guess that this map is a plan of the andra treasure hidingplace asked philip still doubtful of the wisdom of asking mr eppy about the map we wont give him the bit with the name andra on said jack and we wont say a word about the other bits or even where we found them well just say we came across his bit in our explorations but we dont know where lucyann doesnt need to say a word shes the only one who knows where the ship was bought we dont so we can truthfully look him in the eye and say no sir we havent any idea where this bit of paper originally came from it just er kind of appeared i hope he believes you said dinah he never seems to believe a word that lucian says oh well that nitwit said jack lucians really nicer than you think said lucyann it was all because of him dont forget that i got this ship id never have found the ship in the bottle if it hadnt been for him well he shall have a small share in the treasure if we find it said jack generously oh are we going to look for it then said lucyann what about aunt allie what will she say and will the viking star mind us going to hunt for a treasure island dont be a baby lucyann said jack how can we possibly settle anything in the way of future plans till we know what the map says i imagine aunt allie will be as thrilled as we are when she hears about this well i dont said lucyann i think shell hate it shell take us all straight back home she wont have us rushing about looking for islands and treasure i know shes had enough of that kind of thing with us we shant tell her then till everything is settled and when it is well send for old bill declared jack lucyann cheered up immediately as long as bill cunningham was there nothing would matter the four sat down on the two beds quite tired out with their exciting talk they wished the electric fan would go twice as fast because they felt so hot it whirred away turning this way and that a real blessing in the warm cabin a terrible noise far louder than the electric fan made came to their ears they jumped thats kiki making her expressengine screech said jack come on wed better get her or we shall have the captain himself down to see whats up my gracious there she goes again weve left her too long in the girls cabin little wretch the children hurried to the cabin next door anxious to stop kiki before other passengers complained kiki was standing on the dressingtable in front of the mirror screeching at herself although she knew mirrors very well indeed there were still times when she flew into a rage at seeing another parrot there one that she couldnt peck stop it kiki bad bird cried jack ill tie your beak up i will bad bird naughty polly happy returns said kiki speaking to philip and ignoring jack she made a sound like a cork being popped out of a bottle and then another noise like the gurgling of a liquid being poured out she wants a drink said jack sorry old thing i forgot youd be hot in here he filled a toothglass with water and kiki sipped it thirstily micky came out for a drink too we are awful said philip we forgot all about these two in our excitement theres always water for them in our cabin but there isnt any in the girls poor kiki poor micky nitwit said kiki politely she gave a realistic hiccup pardon micky kiki micky kiki micky ki thats enough said jack we dont think thats funny come along for a walk on deck well all get some fresh air and then sleep on our plans they went up on deck with the parrot and the monkey the other passengers smiled to see them they liked the four children and their amusing pets kiki gave a hiccup every time she passed anyone and immediately said oh i say pardon she knew that made people laugh and she loved showing off it was cool on deck in the evening air the children said very little because they were thinking such a lot the bottle the ship the old map quartering it deciphering it hunting hunting hunting for andras treasure down in their cabins that night they all found it very difficult to go to sleep they tossed and turned wishing they could get cool micky and kiki were on the portholesill for coolness the boys had it open always now because neither of the pets showed any sign of wanting to go out of the big round opening lucyann lay thinking in her bed she had the old familiar feeling of queer excitement and anticipation mixed with a little dread she knew that feeling it was the one she got when an adventure was beginning she called softly to dinah dinah are you asleep listen do you think were beginning one of our adventures again do do say were not well if we are whose fault will it be came back dinahs voice very wide awake who bought that ship i did said lucyann yes if we plunge headlong into an adventure this time itll be all because i bought the little ship the ship of adventure chapter the secret of the ship of adventure when the morning came the boys began to realise the difficulties in front of them concerning the strange document they had got hold of the matter didnt seem half so easy to tackle or a quarter so straightforward as they had imagined the night before things the boys had poohpoohed such as mrs mannering objections suddenly seemed very awkward indeed in fact the whole idea lost its rosy glow and seemed to recede into the realm of the impossible it was very disappointing but when they got out the map again which philip had carefully put into an envelope and placed under his pillow all night long the excitement of the night before swept over them again somehow they must get the map deciphered they must find out for certain if it was genuine and then who knows what might happen they made their plans the map must be carefully cut into quarters each quarter must be placed in a small envelope which in turn should be put into one a little larger each child must secrete his bit of the map either about his or her person or in the cabin that was the first thing to do then one of them must take his quarter to mr eppy and see what he said not the bit with the name of the island on of course but one of the other pieces and lucyann mustnt come with us when we ask him said philip because if he asks us straight out where we originally got the paper we can all say truthfully we dont know but lucyann cant say that and shed blush or something and give the game away i should not said lucyann who didnt want to miss any of the excitement you would youre such a truthful person said philip dont look like that lucyann its a very nice thing to be and we wouldnt have you any different its only that this is important and it just might spoil things if you show theres something up all right said lucyann with a sigh perhaps youre right i do wish mr eppy would take off his sunglasses sometimes i just dont know what hes really like if i cant see his eyes i should think hes all right except that hes a bit shorttempered said jack hes nice to his wife and hes always very polite to aunt allie of course hes pretty awful to lucian but then if we had poor old rabbitmouth for a nephew wed be pretty awful to him too we are now sometimes said lucyann like when we go on and on and on at him to have a swim in the ships pool when we know hes scared stiff of the water its only to see what excuse hell think up each time said jack hes a marvel at excuses well what about this map when shall we take it to mr eppy asked philip and if he says its genuine what do we do next is there anyone else on the ship we can ask about the next bit of the map yes theres the deck steward said dinah hes greek he could decipher it all right i should think and theres that little greek woman who keeps the shop on the promenade deck shed be able to do a bit too i expect yes were getting on said philip pleased well what about doing a bit of snipping ive got some very sharp scissors said lucyann theyre in my cabin ill go and get them and ill see what micky and kiki are doing there at the same time up to some mischief i expect well we couldnt have them here whilst we get out the map said jack micky might quite well make a grab at it and throw it out of the porthole like he did yesterday with the postcard id just written what a horrible thought said dinah she visualised their precious map sailing away out of the porthole and she got up to shut it just in case she said and the boys laughed lucyann went to get her scissors she was a long time coming back and the others got impatient what is she doing shes been ages when lucyann came back she had kiki with her i had to bring her she said she had got micky into a corner and she was dancing in front of him from one leg to another you know how she does when shes cross and she was growling terrifically just like a dog poor micky was scared stiff i just had to stay and comfort him a bit what you mean is you stayed and had a good game with them both grumbled jack keeping us waiting all this time where are the scissors blow i left them behind after all said lucyann and departed again in a hurry looking rather red she came back immediately with the scissors in her hand kiki was now contentedly perched on her beloved jacks shoulder singing something that sounded like humpydumpy three blind mice over and over again in a very quiet little voice she knew she had been naughty jack took the scissors and very carefully and solemnly cut the precious document in half the parchment crackled as he cut it the others held their breath and watched then jack cut the halves into half again and there on the boys dressingtable lay the four pieces four exciting parts of a rare and unique document if it was what the children imagined it to be now for small envelopes and then a bit larger ones said dinah she rummaged in the boys writingcases and produced four fairly strong little envelopes each bit of the map was carefully slipped into one then four bigger envelopes were found and the small envelopes were slipped into those good the first step was taken we can easily paste the four bits together once we have got all the pieces deciphered said philip now whats the best time to interview mr eppy and exactly how shall we set about it it would be quite a good time now said jack hes usually up in his deckchair and hell probably be awake because its not long after breakfast i say are we to tell lucian anything about this said lucyann dont be silly of course not said jack i wouldnt trust old rabbitmouth with anything his uncle has only got to bark a few words at him and hed tell him everything he knew and a lot more that he didnt besides it was decided that jacks bit should be the one presented to mr eppy it hadnt the name andra on it neither had it the name of the island so far as they could tell it had one part of the island with a few queer hieroglyphics what are hierosomethingorother asked lucyann when jack used the word it sounds like a medicine or something hieroglyphics well these squiggly marks that we dont understand said jack marks that stand for words secret symbols perhaps secret symbols it sounds thrilling said lucyann now where shall i hide my bit not in your writingcase or anywhere obvious like that lucyann said philip i know where im going to hide mine where asked the others and watched as philip rose and went to his dressingtable it was fixed to the wall of course every bit of furniture in the cabins was fixed either to the wall or to the floor so that it would not move if the ship rolled between the wall and the dressingtable was a thin space no more than a crack philip bent down and slid his envelope into this crack there he said noone will dust there its absolutely hidden between the bottom of the dressingtable and the wall where will you put yours jack on my person said jack my shorts have got a thin lining ill get lucyann to take out a few stitches so that i can slip my bit in ill pin it up afterwards but i shant hide mine yet because ive got to show it to mr eppy dinah had thought of a really excellent place she took the others to her cabin behind the electric fan was a panel of wood to which it was fixed she slid her envelope neatly into the crack between the panel and the wall of the cabin it hid it completely she had had to turn off the fan to use the hidingplace of course now she turned it on again and the others voted her hidingplace as firstclass noone would ever think there was anything hidden behind an electric fan that whirred round and round all day and night good for you said jack now what about lucyann think of somewhere that micky cant get at warned philip hes watching you he cant get dinahs piece because hes afraid of the fan hed never dare to explore behind it could i slip it under the carpet said lucyann no said jack the stewardess might feel it there when she was doing the carpet and get it out well i know what about at the back of a drawerspace said lucyann she pulled out one of the drawers in her dressingtable and set it on the floor she got a drawingpin from her pencilbox and pinned the precious envelope to the very back of the drawerspace there she said no one can possibly see its there unless they pull the drawer right out and why should they do that yes thats fine said jack and the others approved too mickys not strong enough to pull the drawer out even if he wants to now what about going and tackling mr eppy right lucyann you go up to the decktennis place with lucian whilst we talk to his uncle said philip then youll both be out of the way lucyann went off to find lucian he was mooning about by himself wondering where they all were he was delighted to see lucyann and agreed at once to have a game with her he liked her the best of the four probably because he felt she didnt make fun of him as much as the others well theyre disposed of all right said jack watching them go up the steps to the sports deck come on well make for the deckchairs kiki do decide which of my shoulders you want to sit on this flapping to and fro is most uncomfortable i wish youd have micky for an hour or two groaned philip hes like a hotwater bottle by my right ear this morning the passengers watched the three children with their parrot and monkey as they passed by they had got used to them by now and enjoyed the antics of the two pets mrs mannering was on the watch for them i wondered where youd got to she said wheres lucyann playing with lucian said jack he sat down by mrs mannering mrs eppy and her husband were on the other side of her jack spoke loudly so that his voice would carry well ive got a queer thing here he said an old old document i should think do you suppose mr eppy would be kind enough to look at it for me aunt allie well ask him said mrs mannering hes here chapter hidingplaces philip and dinah were sitting on the edge of the same deckchair together next to mrs mannerings jack was on the footend of her chair with his bit of paper they all looked very innocent and unconcerned i dont really like to bother mr eppy now said jack hes reading mrs eppy heard she tapped her husband on the arm paul she said jack wants to ask you something mr eppy knew that perfectly well but he had pretended not to hear he looked up very well he said grudgingly what is it just some old bit of paper we found said philip joining in probably quite uninteresting we cant understand anything on it of course it maynt be old at all said jack flipping his bit with his thumb it looks old said mrs mannering getting interested where did you get it i dont really know picked it up somewhere on one of the islands we visited said jack do you know exactly where dinah no said dinah truthfully ive no idea nor have i said philip pass it over said mr eppy sounding rather bored his wife passed him the piece of parchment he took it and glanced at it meaning to pass it back with a scornful remark what did these children know about old things nothing it was probably a bit of an old letter blown about by the wind that they had picked up in the street or maybe they had bought something and this was part of the paper it was wrapped in mr eppy looked at it and opened his mouth to say something contemptuous but he didnt say a word he went on looking and looking at the paper finally he took his dark glasses off and looked at it without them er is it genuinely old sir asked jack at last not able to wait any longer mr eppy didnt answer he was feeling in his pocket for something he took out a little black case and undid it inside was a strong magnifyingglass set in an eyepiece that could be screwed into the eye something like watchrepairers wear sometimes when repairing tiny watches mr eppy screwed the glass into his eye like an enormous monocle and once more bent over jacks piece of parchment he looked for a very long time the children waited almost breathless why didnt he speak why was he such ages it was mean of him at last mr eppy took the eyepiece out of his eye and looked at the children they got a shock because they had never seen his eyes without dark glasses before he hadnt nice eyes at all they were decidedly queer one was blue and the other was dark brown dinah felt a little shiver down her back how very very queer she couldnt help staring at him looking first at one darkblue eye and then at the other darkbrown one was one false no how silly he would have eyes that matched if one was false well said mr eppy and paused as if he was thinking what was best to say its er quite interesting er but is it genuinely old mr eppy insisted jack thats what we want to know the paper isnt all here said mr eppy and his eyes glanced from one to the other of the children this is only a piece of it and judging by the edges of the paper it has been recently cut rather queer that dont you think so this was most unexpected jack answered at once feeling that there must be no pause which might give them away gosh how very queer well i suppose weve just got hold of one bit sir er i wonder whos got the rest of it so do i said mr eppy looking at jack and swinging his eyepiece to and fro on his finger i should be very very interested to know why sir asked philip looking perfectly innocent much to dinahs admiration well i cant tell much from this one piece said mr eppy it would be a help to have the rest what can you tell mr eppy asked dinah he looked at her with his odd eyes i can tell that it shows part of an island he said an interesting island with some secret on it i could perhaps tell what the whole secret is if i had the other bit of the parchment what a pity you havent got it sir said jack holding out his hand for his piece where did you say you found this said mr eppy snapping out the question so suddenly that the children jumped we didnt say because we dont know said jack at once mr eppy frowned he put his dark glasses on again and became the familiar rather puzzling man they knew with his queer eyes completely hidden ill keep this paper for a while he said and actually took out a wallet to place it there id rather you didnt sir if you dont mind said jack im going to take it home er for the school museum if its genuinely old and all that yes its genuine said mr eppy dryly ill buy it off you im interested in old things as you know we dont want to sell it mr eppy said jack getting alarmed it cant be worth anything anyway we want it as a curio very well but i should like to borrow it for a while said mr eppy and he calmly slipped the parchment into his wallet and put the wallet into his pocket then he picked up his book and began to read jack looked at the others in dismay he was angry and crestfallen but what was he to do he couldnt snatch mr eppys wallet and grab his piece of paper from it and if he kicked up a terrific fuss mrs mannering would be angry and mr eppy would get suspicious if he wasnt suspicious already philip and dinah were dumbfounded the cheek of it taking their parchment like that would he give it back they wished they had taken a tracing of it if only they had now they might never get back their treasured bit of paper they got up and went feeling that they must talk about it mr eppy took no notice of their going jack did not dare to say anything more to him but he glowered at lucians uncle as if he could tear his wallet out of him they went to their cabin beast said jack surly fellow what sauce to pocket our paper like that hope we get it back said dinah gloomily theres one thing we jolly well know its old and genuine and holds something most interesting to mr eppy said philip cheering up a little we do know that he was quite knocked out when he first looked at it even had to get out that eyepiece arrangement i bet he knows it may be part of a treasureplan i dont think somehow it was a very good idea to take it to mr eppy said dinah there may be markings on it that tell a man like that who knows about old things far more than they would tell anyone else i hope he doesnt guess weve got the other bits said jack he does said philip i bet he does lucyann came bursting into the cabin hallo she said how did you get on i had to stop playing with lucian because that uncle of his came up and called him he took him off somewhere he did did he said jack i suppose hes going to ask him what he knows then good thing he knows nothing what happened said lucyann you all look rather downinthemouth wasnt it genuinely old yes but mr eppy has taken it and put it into his wallet said jack and i bet we dont get it back lucyann was horrified but why did you let him take it you idiot well what would you have done knocked him off his deckchair grabbed his wallet and run off with it demanded jack going through a performance of knocking somebody down and grabbing something kiki was astonished and rose into the air in fright squawking she settled on top of the cupboard in alarm jack took no notice of her he was really crestfallen at what had happened after all their wonderful careful clever plans too well just have to hope he gives it back thats all said philip and if he does it will probably mean hes got a very nice copy of it well have to find out what he has said to lucian said jack hell probably tell him to try and pump us about this bit of paper and find out if we have the other bits and where we got the thing from and when and where the rest of the plan is yes and well make up a perfectly marvellous tale and stuff him up like anything said dinah her eyes sparkling come on lets think of one if mr eppys up to some game well be up to one too now what shall we say if lucian pumps us well we said we didnt know anything about it so perhaps wed better pretend that lucyann knows all about it said jack looking more cheerful as he considered the idea of pulling lucians leg and perhaps mr eppys as well oh dear said lucyann in alarm have i got to tell a whole lot of fairytales to lucian no well do that for you said jack with a grin now then lets think how did lucyann get hold of that paper she was standing on the sports deck one day began dinah and she was feeding the gulls that live round about these islands and a great big gull came up with something in his beak went on philip he flew round lucyanns head and dropped a paper at her feet when he swooped down for bread said jack she picked it up and showed it to us and we thought aha only a very clever man like dear mr eppy could decipher this strange document handed over by a generous gull and so we took it to show him finished dinah she giggled its too silly for words lucian will never swallow that he will but his uncle wont grinned philip serve him right hell expect to get the goods from lucian when hes pumped us and hell find hes got rubbish well dont make me say it said lucyann id go scarlet the whole time listen isnt that lucian now said jack you go off lucyann look take this book and say youre taking it to aunt allie go on that will get you out of the way it is lucian i know his idiotic humming lucyann snatched a book and went to the door it opened as she got there and lucians rabbitface came round the door hullo hullo he said can i come in yes do said lucyann squeezing by him im taking this book to aunt allie but the others are here theyll love to see you chapter lucian in trouble hallo lucian said jack come in have a sweet oh thanks said lucian and sat himself down on the bed he took a large piece of peanutcrunch out of the tin jack offered him i say this is jolly good stuff like a game of decktennis asked philip er well actually i only like playing with lucyann said lucian who was so very bad at the game that even lucyann beat him hollow cant give you others much of a game you know i say my uncles been telling me about that bit of paper you showed him has he what did he say said jack well he thinks it may be the genuine goods all right but he cant tell without the other piece or pieces said lucian munching away oh i say look at that monkey hes snaffled an enormous piece of nutcrunch yes almost as big as your bit said dinah who noticed that lucian invariably took the largest piece of cruch from the tin oh i say did i really take a big bit said lucian have to watch myself you never told me about that bit of paper why didnt you id have liked to see it well it isnt very important is it said philip i mean we never thought youd be interested oh but i am like anything said lucian crunching hard micky was crunching too and kiki was watching him balefully she didnt like nutcrunch but she couldnt bear to see micky enjoying his you might tell me all about it you really might where you got it and er everything didnt your uncle tell you where we got it asked dinah innocently lucian looked surprised gosh no he said did you tell him well why on earth did he ask me to find out he had given himself away properly the others winked at one another well perhaps we didnt tell him said jack solemnly did we or didnt we didnt did didnt did remarked kiki thinking it was time that someone took notice of her but nobody did its a shame not to tell old lucian said dinah in a kind voice lucian beamed yes after all hes a friend of ours said philip lucian was so overcome by this remark that he swallowed a bit of nutcrunch and choked kiki immediately had a choking fit too she did that kind of thing remarkably well jack thumped lucian on the back whereupon micky actually went to kiki and thumped her too the children roared with laughter but kiki was furious with micky and chased him all over the cabin oh dear said dinah wiping tears of laughter away those creatures will be the death of me now what were we talking about about me being a friend of yours and so youd tell me about that bit of paper said lucian promptly oh may i really have another bit of crunch i say thanks awfully he took a bit remembering not to take the largest there this time oh yes said jack we were saying it was a shame not to tell old lucian well old chap it happened to lucyann actually lets see er she was standing on the deck ready to feed the gulls that fly over from the islands said jack lucian nodded he had often seen lucyann feeding them and suddenly a very large gull flew round her head holding something in its beak went on philip thats right isnt it jack absolutely said jack with a solemn face and lo and behold when the gull came down for its bread it dropped the paper at lucyanns feet said dinah what do you think of that lucian thats right isnt it jack oh definitely said jack in a firm voice lucian stared his rabbitmouth dropped open oh i say he said isnt that amazing i mean to say whoever would have thought of that as the three of them had thought of it quite easily they didnt answer dinah felt a dreadful urge to giggle and turned her face away lucian seemed quite overcome with the story i mean honestly its like a fairytale or something isnt it he said that gull dropping it at lucyanns feet the others agreed that it was exactly like a fairytale most extraordinary said lucian getting up and swallowing the last of his nutcrunch well i must be off thanks awfully for telling me all this oh i say whats happened to the bottle that the ship was in youve got the ship without the bottle now yes micky and kiki broke it between them said jack little wretches still its a nice ship and doesnt need its bottle lucian went out the others grinned at one another what a leg his was to pull poor old rabbitmouth he just asked for his leg to be well and truly pulled i can just see him spouting that all out to his disbelieving uncle said jack come on if i dont get up into the fresh air and have some exercise i shall expire lets find lucyann and have a game of quoits or something its too hot now for decktennis they played games all the morning and then went down to lunch all feeling very hungry indeed to their surprise lucian didnt appear at lunch they wondered if he was ill mrs mannering asked his aunt about him no hes not ill just a touch of the sun i think said lucians aunt hes lying down and keeping quiet i vote we go down to lucians cabin and see if hes all right said jack hes never minded the sun before down they went and knocked quietly there was no answer jack turned the handle and went in lucian was lying on his bed his face in the pillow are you asleep lucian said jack softly lucian turned over abruptly oh its you he said jack saw the boys face was blotched and tearstained whats up he said i say can the others come in theyre outside well if they want to said lucian who obviously was not welcoming visitors but didnt like to say so all four children were soon in the cabin lucyann was distressed when she saw lucians blotched face whats the matter she said is your sunstroke very bad it isnt sunstroke said lucian and to the childrens horror his eyes began to fill with tears its my beastly horrible uncle he buried his face in the pillow again to hide his tears whats he been up to said jack not very sympathetically because he thought it was too feeble for words for a boy of lucians age to behave like that he called me all kinds of names said lucian sitting up again he he called me a nitwit and a nincompoop poop said kiki nitwit now dont you start said poor lucian to the parrot he said i was a born idiot and a fool and but why asked lucyann astonished well i told him how lucyann got that silly bit of paper lucian told them you know just how you told me i thought hed be so pleased to think id found out what he wanted to know but he wasnt wasnt he that was too bad said philip thinking that lucian deserved his scolding for running straight to his uncle with the fairytale they had made up they had meant him to of course but what a tittletattler he was i said to him a gull brought the paper down to lucyann and laid it at her feet related lucian in a dramatic manner and uncle said what so i told him again and what did he say the next time asked jack trying not to laugh all the things i told you he was very insulting and offensive said lucian after all he believed all the other things i told him i cant think why he didnt believe that what other things did you tell him asked jack at once oh nothing much he just wanted to know if id been shopping with any of you and where and all that i told him id only been shopping with lucyann and how wed found that old ship in a bottle for her and he said ah of course the andra the andra just like that i tell you he was most peculiar altogether the others listened to this in silence mr eppy had certainly pumped lucian to some purpose he knew they had bought the ship and where he remembered seeing the name when they asked him what it was the andra he was putting two and two together probably he already guessed that the parchment had been found in the ship because that ass lucian would be sure to have told him that the bottle was broken and the ship free of it did you tell your uncle the bottle was broken that the ship was in asked jack er yes i think i did said lucian i say i havent done anything wrong have i i mean you dont mind my telling my uncle all this we didnt mind your telling him about the gull and the bit of paper in the least said philip truthfully im sorry your uncle is so disbelieving it was wrong of him to call you names like that it was wasnt it said lucian plaintively hes got no right to he called you a few names too well dont repeat them said jack you really ought to learn to respect peoples confidences lucian i mean it just isnt done to go round repeating to somebody else the things youve been told possibly in confidence now youre angry with me too wailed lucian jack got up in disgust this kind of behaviour was too much for him altogether he didnt even feel sorry for lucian for getting into trouble because of a cockandbull story that they had made up specially for him lucian just walked into trouble as fast as he could the others got up too only lucyann was troubled about lucian still even she was disgusted at his tears and selfpity really he ought to pull himself together they went out without a word leaving lucian feeling miserable upset angry and very very hungry come to our cabin for a minute said jack we ought to have a few words about all this mr eppy is putting two and two together a bit too fast what an idiot lucian is why did he have to blab about that ship so much wed better put in a safe place in case mr eppy borrows it as he did our parchment they went into the boys cabin and philip gave a cry that made them all jump look hes borrowed it already its gone chapter the second piece of the map it was true the beautiful little carved ship was no longer in its place of honour on the shelf it was gone the four children stared at one another in exasperation blow mr eppy what right had he to borrow things like this would he give it back whats he borrowed it for anyway wondered dinah if he goes so far as to suspect that we found the paper there i still dont see why he should borrow it hes got the paper anyway a bit of it only and he knows it corrected jack he probably thinks the rest of it is still in the little carved ship either that we havent noticed it or that we have kept it there and hes borrowed it to see stolen it you mean said lucyann scornfully horrid man i think hes awful shall i go and ask him if hes got it said philip he was feeling very angry quite ready to beard any lion in its den the others considered this suppose he didnt take it said jack it would be jolly awkward accusing him of it who else would have taken it demanded philip nobody look lets go and have a swim in the pool and forget it for a bit said dinah if you still feel like bearding the lion afterwards you can go its so awfully hot id love a swim all right said philip reluctantly but i might not feel so keen on going after mr eppy afterwards however he was still of the same mind after his swim the others couldnt help admiring him they really thought it was a brave thing to do to go and tackle mr eppy and accuse him of borrowing their ship he went off to find mr eppy he wasnt in his cabin he wasnt in his deckchair where could he be philip began to hunt over the ship for him determined to find him he saw him at last coming out of the radio office mr eppy said philip marching boldly up to him what have you done with our ship mr eppy stopped philip wished to goodness he didnt wear those dark glasses he had no idea if mr eppy was surprised angry or what he soon knew mr eppy spoke in a very snappy voice indeed what do you mean boy what ship do you speak of the little carved ship we showed you the one in the bottle called andra said philip wishing more than ever that he could see mr eppys eyes and read what was in them what have you done with it i think you are mad said mr eppy coldly quite mad as mad as lucian who comes to me with a fairytale about a little girl a gull and a piece of paper what nonsense what fiddlesticks and now you come to me with a question about a toy ship you think i have taken it to float in my bath perhaps did you take it mr eppy persisted philip no and do not dare to insult me with your fairytales and your crazy questions any more thundered mr eppy he strode off his mouth very grim philip was a little shaken well he hadnt got much change out of mr eppy that was certain blow the man philip felt absolutely certain he had got the ship he went down to meet the others in his cabin they would be waiting for him there he opened the cabin door and went in well he said its no go he says he hasnt got the ship but i bet he has i feel it in my bones then your bones tell you wrong said jack and he pointed across the room to the shelf on the wall look there philip looked and gasped the little carved ship of adventure was back in its place again where was it he asked gosh what an idiot ive made of myself accusing mr eppy of having it where on earth was it we dont know answered dinah we all came in here a few minutes ago after we left you on your way to tackle mr eppy and the first thing we saw was the ship there it was on the shelf just where we left it this morning said lucyann who put it back asked philip aha if we knew that wed know who took it said jack i still think it was mr eppy if you remember he came in to lunch after we did he could easily have slipped down here and taken the ship then and he could just as easily have put it back whilst we were having our swim if he saw us in the pool which was quite likely hed know that he had plenty of time to slip down here and replace it the knobs a bit loose said dinah we think he found how it worked all right and removed that wooden section and examined the inside of the ship thoroughly i see and when he found there was nothing there he generously brought it back said philip i dont like that man hell be hunting round all our cabins looking for our other bits of paper if we dont look out lucyann felt alarmed oh dear will he find them do you think he might admitted philip they seem jolly good hidingplaces to us but they probably would be easy enough for him to discover i say are we going to get the other bits deciphered now said dinah suddenly you know we thought wed ask the little greek woman who keeps the shop on the ship and the deck steward suppose mr eppy gets to hear weve been showing other people more bits of paper hell soon be after them yes thats a point said jack but if we dont get them deciphered were no better off than we were hidden treasure is no use to anyone if they dont know in the least where it is anyway we dont even know if the plan does show hidden treasure all we know is that it is a genuine old document and that mr eppy is distinctly interested i think we could trust the little shopwoman not to say a word said lucyann shes nice and she likes us if we told her it was a secret wouldnt she keep it after all weve got to ask somebody they debated whether the shopwoman was trustworthy or not they decided that on the whole she was she said shed show me some photographs of her children said lucyann shes got three on some little island or other she leaves them with her grandmother when she goes on the ship couldnt we all go and see the photographs and then ask her about the parchment trust lucyann for knowing everyones lifehistory grinned philip it beats me how she does it she already knows the names of the second officers children and she knows everything about the stewardesss old mother and what illnesses she suffers from and she even knows how many dogs the captain himself has kept during his whole life i dont said lucyann indignantly i simply wouldnt dare to ask him about dogs anyway he cant have had any on board ship im only pulling your leg lucyann said philip actually i think your idea of looking at the shopwomans photos and then springing our parchment on her or a bit of it is a good one lets go now then said lucyann looking at the clock everyone always has a sleep in the afternoon at this time noone is ever in the shop shell be alone they went off together philip had the idea of first finding out where mr eppy was just in case he should be snooping round he came back and reported hes asleep in his deckchair on the promenade deck his heads well back and hes not reading or anything how do you know hes asleep demanded jack you cant tell if his eyes are open or shut behind those awful dark sunglasses well he looked asleep said philip sort of limp and relaxed come on well go to the shop now they went to the little shop the greek woman who kept it showed all her white teeth in a pleased smile when she saw the children with kiki and micky ah kiki micky and what mischief have you done she asked tickling the little monkey and poking kiki in the chest one two three go kiki immediately made a noise like a pistolshot which was just what the little greek woman meant her to do she was quite familiar with kikis ways and always screamed with laughter when the parrot hiccupped coughed or sneezed tell him to snizz she begged i like when he snizzes so kiki obliged with a fine variety of snizzes much to mickys amazement then out came the photographs and the children were treated to a lifehistory of each of the three little girls she possessed dinah thought that surely never in this world had there lived such children before so sweet so good so loving so religious so incredibly beautiful and so extraordinarily boring then jack thought it was their turn to talk he nudged philip who at once brought out his piece of the map look he said to the shopwoman can you make head or tail of this for us its an old old document we found what does it say and what does it show the greek woman looked at it sharply with her bright black eyes it is a plan of some sort she said but you have not got the whole of it here what a pity it shows part of an island called thamis or themis i cannot tell which see here is its name in greek but you will not understand the letters of course your alphabet is different yes it is part of an island but where it is i do not know cant you tell anything else from the map asked dinah there is something of importance on the island said the woman perhaps a temple i do not know there is a building marked here or maybe it is meant to be a city again i do not know i could tell you more if i had the whole of the map the children had been so engrossed in all this that they had not heard the soft footsteps of someone coming a shadow fell across them they looked up and lucyann gave a gasp it was mr eppy his dark glasses hiding his eyes as usual ah something interesting let me see said mr eppy coolly and before anyone could stop him he had twisted the parchment out of the greek womans fingers and was looking at it himself philip tried to twist it out of his fingers but mr eppy was on his guard he held it aloft and pretended to joke he wont let mr eppy see bad boy bad naughty boy echoed kiki at once micky thinking it was a game of snatch suddenly leapt up in the air and lunged out at the paper he got it in his little paw fell back to philips shoulder and then still with the parchment in his hand leapt to the top of the shop and sat there out of reach chattering excitedly mr eppy knew when he was beaten what a funny little creature he said in an amiable voice that managed to sound quite angry too well well well have a look at the paper another time and with that he left the dumbfounded children walking off rapidly back to his deckchair chapter goodbye mr eppy well said dinah finding her voice first of all the cheek philip he couldnt have been asleep when you saw him in his chair he must have seen you looking at him and guessed you were up to something and looked about till he found us blow him muttered philip now hes seen two of the bits he knows what the island is too because the name was on that second bit thats an awful bit of bad luck they left the surprised little shopwoman and went moodily up to the bow of the ship glad to feel the wind in their faces micky had come down as soon as mr eppy had left them and philip had his bit of paper back in safety but the damage was done mr eppy had seen it if there is anything in our idea mr eppy has seen enough to cotton on to it already said jack gloomily i cant say that we have been at all clever over this anything but simply given our secret away said dinah were losing our grip anyway i dont really see what we could have done about the treasure said lucyann suddenly i mean we cant possibly go hunting for it even if we knew exactly where it was so we might as well give it up and if mr eppy wants to go hunting after it let him well i must say youre very generous giving up what might have been our treasure and just saying mr eppy can have it said jack exasperated all because you dont want an adventure again oh i say cried kiki and the children stopped talking at once kiki had given her usual signal for the approach of lucian up he came grinning amiably he appeared completely to have forgotten his last meeting with them in his cabin when he had been in tears his face still looked a bit blotched but otherwise he seemed very cheery hallo he cried where on earth have you been the last halfhour ive been looking for you everywhere i say look what uncles given me he showed the children some pieces of greek money i expect he was sorry for going for me like that dont you he chattered on anyway hes in a very good temper now aunt cant understand it the children could understand mr eppys sudden good spirits very well indeed they grinned wryly at one another mr eppy had got what he wanted or some part of what he wanted and he was pleased it struck jack that mr eppy probably always got what he wanted in one way or another he wouldnt much care which way he thought uneasily that they ought to find safer hidingplaces than the ones in the cabins for the remaining pieces of paper he felt very gloomy what was the use of bothering they would never be able to do much about the treasure how could they aunt allie wouldnt hear of it he knew and there would have to be some grownup in charge if only bill had come on the trip with them an idea came into his head im going off by myself for a little while he announced see you later off he went with kiki he had had an idea what about looking up the island thamis or themis whichever it was on a modern map and seeing if it was shown there it would be interesting to see whereabouts it was why it might be quite near where they were cruising he went down to the ships little library with kiki and asked for a good map of the islands the librarian gave him one and looked disapprovingly at kiki he didnt like parrots in his quiet library blow your nose kiki advised him wipe your feet how many times have i told you to shut the door pooh gah the librarian said nothing at all but looked down his nose he had never in his life been spoken to like that before and by a parrot too he was most irritated one two three go said kiki and made the noise of a pistol going off the librarian almost jumped out of his seat sorry about that said jack hastily afraid that the librarian would turn him out he tapped kiki on the beak manners kiki manners shocking shocking repeated kiki in a mournful voice and began to sniff in exactly the same way the librarian did jack pored over the map of the islands forgetting all about kiki in his interest for a long time he couldnt see thamis and then there it was under his eyes it was not a large island and was marked with what seemed to be a city or town just on the coast one or two small marks seemed to indicate villages but there was only the one town so that was where the legendary fleet of treasure ships went years and years ago they put in at that city by the sea sailing into the port at dead of night how did they unload the treasure were there people there in the secret where was it put it must have been hidden remarkably well if no one had ever found it in all the years that had gone by jack pored over the map his imagination giving him picture after picture and making him stirred and excited he gave a deep sigh which kiki immediately echoed if only he could go to thamis to that city by the sea if only he could just have a look at it but it would be mr eppy who would do that mr eppy who knew all the islands by heart and who could afford to hire ships to go from one to the other exploring each one as he pleased jack folded up the map with another sigh he put the whole idea away from him once and for all you couldnt go on treasurehunts unless you were grownup his common sense told him that all the plans he and the others had made were just crazy dreams lovely dreams but quite impossible jack strolled out of the library and up on deck they were heading for another island they were to go close by it so that the passengers might see the romantic coastline but they were not calling there at least so jack had thought as they came near he saw that he must have been wrong the ship was either going into the port there or people were going off in a motorboat that had come out to meet the ship the ships engines stopped at that moment and jack leaned over the side to watch the motorboat nose its way near it soon lay alongside the big ship rising and falling gently on the waves a ladder was shaken down the side of the viking star someone began to climb down someone who waved back to others on the boat and called out in a foreign language and then jack got a shock the someone was mr eppy he was calling goodbye to his wife and nephew he climbed right down to the motorboat and jumped deftly on the deck his big suitcase was lowered down on a rope and swung down on the deck beside him he looked up and waved again his dark glasses showing clearly jack scowled down angrily and miserably blow mr eppy blow him jack felt sure he knew why he was leaving the boat mr eppy knew enough to set things in motion for the grand andra treasurehunt he was going to thamis he would smell out the treasure that jack and the others had happened on in that old map it would be his and probably jack would never even know what happened about it never know if it was found or what it was or anything it was like reading a tremendously exciting book halfway through and then having the book taken away and not knowing the end of the story the motorboat chugged away from the ship mr eppy and his sunglasses disappeared jack turned from the deckrail and went to find the others he wondered if they knew about mr eppy he found them in the cabin micky had eaten something that disagreed with him and had been sick they were looking after him anxiously they hadnt even noticed that the engines of the ship had stopped and were now starting again there dinah was saying as jack came into the cabin hes all right now arent you micky you shouldnt be so greedy jack came in looking so gloomy that everyone was startled whats up said philip at once its all up said jack sitting down on the nearest bed who do you thinks gone off in a motorboat suitcase and all who asked everyone mr eppy said jack hotfoot after our treasure he knows the island hes guessed the andra treasure may be there and hes gone to set things going at least thats how i see it thats a blow said philip weve messed everything up properly he certainly doesnt let grass grow under his feet we may as well give up all our grand ideas said dinah what a shame i did feel so terribly thrilled i bet he had just been sending a radio message for a motorboat to take him off here when i met him coming out of the radio office said philip remembering just that first bit of paper must have got him going now hes seen the second and hes certain its bad luck said lucyann we dont usually mess up things like this hallo whos that oh i say said kiki at once and sure enough the door opened and in came lucian with his everlasting cry oh i say what do you thinks happened youve got rid of your uncle said dinah at once lucian grinned yes hes gone said he had had an urgent business message and couldnt fool about cruising around with auntie and me any longer gosh im glad hes gone yes hes not a pleasant person said jack im glad hes not my uncle some of his little ways are not what you might call attractive theyre not said lucian who felt he was quite free now to speak his mind about his uncle do you know he wanted me to take your little carved ship to him and not say a word to you about it what do you think of that not much said jack did you take it of course not said lucian with such indignation that everyone felt he was telling the truth what do you take me for nobody said what they took him for they felt that it would be a pity to spoil his pleasure lucian beamed round at them now we can have a jolly good time without my uncle cant we he said i cant say your uncle makes any difference to us one way or another said jack i dont want to talk about him any more hes an unpleasant subject for discussion theres the gong to dress for dinner lucian youd better go you had no lunch and you must be ravenous i jolly well am said lucian and went looking quite delighted with life the others however looked anything but delighted in fact they looked distinctly gloomy well thats the end of what looked like a most promising adventure said philip but he was wrong it wasnt the end it was really only the beginning chapter things begin to happen things began to happen the very next day the ship was cruising along as usual in a purpleblue sea and the sun shone down from a sky spread with dazzling white clouds and patches of brilliant blue gulls glided by and all kinds of other seabirds bobbed on the water or soared high above the ship everyone was peaceful in their deckchairs reading or snoozing waiting for the midmorning drink of iced lemonade brought by the stewards even the children were lazing in their chairs tired after their strenuous morning game at decktennis kiki sat on the back of jacks chair snoozing too she had been chasing gulls calling to them in a voice so like theirs that the poor things were completely bewildered now she was tired out micky was curled up in the shade of a lifeboat fast asleep a small pageboy appeared the one who ran messages and fetched odds and ends for the passengers he carried a long envelope on a salver he called out loudly as he went radiotelegram for mrs mannering please radio for mrs mannering please philip nudged his mother and beckoned to the callboy mrs mannering looked up startled to hear her name shouted out the boy came up to her and presented the radiotelegram she tore it open wondering who it was from she read it out loud to the listening children your aunt seriously ill and calling for you fly back if you can and ill take over the kids radio me please bill there was a silence oh dear said mrs mannering this would happen on a cruise what shall i do its all very well for bill to say fly back but where from and how can i leave you all dont upset yourself mother said philip ill see to things for you i know the second officer very well and hell tell me what youre to do as for us you neednt worry at all said jack you know were all right on the boat you wouldnt want us all to fly back with you surely oh no of course not especially after ive paid such high fares for you all on this cruise said mrs mannering still looking worried oh dear i do hate sudden things like this i really do mother dear its all right said dinah you can get a plane from the very next place we stop at if there is an airfield youll be in england tomorrow and bill will take over as he said hell probably meet you at croydon if the plane lands there see you safely on to your train and then catch a plane to join us hell enjoy the rest of the trip maybe youll be back too oh no i shant not if aunt polly has got one of her really bad turns said mrs mannering shes been so good to me and to you too that i must stay with her till shes quite herself again oh i do hate leaving you four by yourselves mrs eppy couldnt help overhearing all this she spoke to mrs mannering i can keep an eye on the four for you till your friend comes you know after all i have to look after lucian and hes much the same age i shall be pleased to do what i can well thats good of you said mrs mannering getting out of her deckchair helped by philip i suppose its idiotic of me to worry about them theyre all quite big now but they do seem to get into such awful scrapes sometimes she went off with philip he was very useful indeed he found the second officer and very soon he had worked out all the details with him the ship would go out of her way a little and call at an island that had an airport a radio message would be sent immediately so that a plane would be waiting in no time at all mrs mannering would be back in england we could wait at the island till your friend comes on his plane said the second officer after consulting with the captain it would only mean altering our programme a very little it is a very freeandeasy one as you know now do you want to radio instructions to mr cunningham so that he will know what time to meet your plane at croydon it was amazing how easily everything was arranged after all i was silly to get upset and flustered said mrs mannering to the children thanks to philip its all been arranged beautifully ill be away tomorrow and bill will arrive later probably that evening its wonderful the girls helped her to pack the viking star steamed to a large island where there was a good airport the children saw aeroplanes taking off as they came near for the airport was on the coast a motorboat came out to take mrs mannering off she kissed all the children goodbye now dont get into any scrapes she begged them be good keep away from danger and trouble give bill my love and tell him if he leads you into anything ill never never forgive him they waved goodbye as the motorboat chuffed away to the port they watched it through their binoculars and saw mrs mannering getting out on to the jetty with a porter carrying her cases shes got into a taxi announced jack now shes off to the airport shell soon be away half an hour later an aeroplane took off from the airport on the coast and rose into the air it flew towards the ship circled it twice and made off to the west that was mothers plane said philip i think i even saw her waving well safe journey to her and now we must look out for old bill a curious silence fell on the children they were all thinking the same thing but nobody quite liked to say it jack cleared his throat er you know now that this has happened er he stopped everyone waited politely well go on said dinah er i was just thinking said jack just thinking that now well with old bill coming and all er he stopped again dinah gave a little giggle ill say it for you she said its what weve all been thinking i know dear old bill is coming and we can tell him all about the map and the andra treasure and mr eppy and maybe maybe hell do something about it gosh yes said jack i didnt know how to put it without seeming a bit heartless as aunt allie has only just gone but things are a bit different now bill may think we ought to do something how simply super said philip drawing a deep breath just as wed given up hope we couldnt possibly drag mother into an adventure said dinah but bills different i mean he wont want us to plunge into an adventure i know but he may quite well think he ought to do something about it and we shall at least know whats happening said jack wont it be grand to show him the little carved ship and the map and tell him everything good old bill lucian came up with rather a solemn expression on his face i say im awfully sorry about all this i do hope your mother arrives safely philip and that her aunt will get better i hope all this wont spoil the rest of the cruise for you i am most awfully sorry thanks said philip we shall get over it oh i say i quite forgot to give you this went on lucian im so sorry my uncle gave it to me before he left and said i was to hand it to you i cant imagine what it is jack took it he guessed what it was and he was right it was the piece of the plan that mr eppy had borrowed he had put it into a sealed envelope with a little note thanks not very interesting after all p eppy jack laughed not very interesting says he i bet hes got a careful tracing of it much good may it do him he went off to put it into its safe place in the lining of his shorts he was glad that mr eppy hadnt seen all the other pieces of the plan still probably he didnt need to he might guess where the treasure was if he knew the island if so it wouldnt be there long the day went by rather slowly mrs eppy was rather annoying because she took very seriously her promise to look after the children she hunted them out at mealtimes and even told the table steward to seat them at her table but jack was not having that no mrs eppy he said firmly but politely we expect our friend bill cunningham tonight or at the latest tomorrow morning we will keep our own table and eat with him thank you all the same lucian was disappointed and sulked he didnt even smile when kiki and micky had a fight over a banana and ended by pulling it in half after the evening meal the children went up on deck hoping against hope that bill would arrive that night the second officer had had no message so thought he probably would arrive he would surely have radioed me if he was coming tomorrow he said he knows were holding the ship here for him all the same id go to bed if i were you kids he may come in the middle of the night they wouldnt hear of going to bed they sat up on deck and watched the sun go down in a blaze of gold they saw the clouds turn rosypink then they watched night creeping over the sea from the east and saw the water turn more and more purple till at last they could hardly tell it from the sky then the stars came out brilliantly and the water sparkled again lucyann was almost asleep in her deckchair when jack nudged her wake up theres a plane it may be bills she was awake at once and went to the deckrail with the others the plane went down to the airport landing ground it must be bills after about half an hour they heard a motorboat starting up its engine in the port its bill coming out now cried lucyann in excitement dear old bill the motorboat came nearer and nearer it stopped by the ship and a ladder was thrown down someone began to climb up lucyann could contain herself no longer bill she cried is it you bill bill up came a familiar voice ahoy there bill it is and bill it was he came climbing on to the deck and the four children ran to him at once they smothered him hugged him and were bearhugged back dear bill good old bill its grand to see you now everythings fine yes everythings fine said bill swinging lucyann right off her feet gosh its good to see you all now well have some fun chapter bill hears the tale bill was hungry and thirsty the children excited and happy took him down to the lounge where he ordered chickenandham sandwiches and a drink for himself and for a treat the same for the children though let me tell you youll have awful dreams tonight having a meal so late he warned them so if you are chased by bears fall out of aeroplanes or get shipwrecked in your sleep dont blame me we shant said lucyann anyway now i know youre here i shant even mind having nightmares youll turn up in them to rescue me the steward brought the meal smiling he had also brought a banana each for micky and kiki on two separate plates kiki was very much impressed with the plates it wasnt often she had a plate she insisted on putting her banana back on her plate each time she had taken a bite which amused the children immensely kikis gone all polite i see said bill taking an enormous bite of his sandwich gosh this is good i havent had anything to eat for hours well kids hows things weve a lot to tell you bill said jack jolly interesting too weve happened on something very exciting you would of course said bill but dont think youre dragging me into any harebrained escapade this time ive had enough of you and your adventures ive come out for a nice quiet restful trip kiki gave a tremendous squawk and made him jump micky youve taken kikis banana said jack philip smack him therell be a fight soon if you dont all right kiki ill get you another poor old thing thats what your good manners brought you you put your banana down politely on your plate after each bite and micky goes and takes it nice little monkey said bill tickling micky under the chin yours i suppose philip it beats me how you collect your pets wherever you go lets see youve had a fox cub a lizard a slowworm a snowywhite kid two puffins white rats and now a monkey well well so long as you dont collect a hippopotamus or a flock of lions i dont mind the children were bursting to tell him about the treasureplan but they felt they ought to let him eat his sandwiches first he told them how he had met mrs mannering at the airport in england and had seen her safely off to her aunt then he had taken his own private aeroplane and set off alone asked jack no with a friend of mine tim curling dont think youve met him said bill dont you want all your sandwiches lucyann right ill help myself yes tim came too and ive left him with the plane hes going to hire a motorboat and do a bit of cruising oh i wish we could too said dinah do you said bill in surprise but i thought you liked being on this big comfortable ship youre used to rowingboats and sailingships and motorboats this big ship must be a real change yes it is but well shall we tell you our news bill asked jack eagerly bill ate the last vestige of the sandwiches and finished his drink he yawned a vast yawn and kiki immediately did the same i suppose it cant wait till morning can it he said then he saw the disappointed faces of the children and laughed oh all right out with it fetch the little carved ship lucyann ordered jack ive got all the four bits of the map hurry well wait till you come back before we begin lucyann sped off she came back very quickly panting with the little ship in her hands bill took it what a beauty this is valuable you know where did you get it then out came the story of how lucyann had discovered the ship in the bottle with lucian and had bought it for philips birthday in low excited tones so that no one else could hear the children told of the breaking of the bottle and the unexpected finding of the parchment inside the ship then jack produced the parchment still in its four quarters bill glanced at it with great interest then he stood up come on down to my cabin he said i think it would be wiser to talk there this is all rather extraordinary very pleased with bills reception of their tale the children trooped down the stairs to the cabins they all crowded into bills they knew it well because it had been their mothers they managed to squash themselves on the bed with bill in the middle move micky up a bit will you said bill he keeps breathing down my neck now then whats this map its very old i can see that why is it in four pieces they told him they told him the old legend of the lost andra treasure they told him of mr eppys queer behaviour they told him of his departure and all that they feared bill listened intently asking one or two curt questions now and again when they had finished he took out his pipe and began to stuff it very slowly with tobacco the children waited they knew that bill was thinking hard their hearts beat fast what did bill think of their tale would he take it seriously would he do something about it well said bill putting his pipe into his mouth and speaking out of one side whilst he hunted in his pocket for matches well i think youve got something there but im basing my feelings on mr eppys behaviour not on your map which i dont know enough about to decipher youve been very ingenious in trying to get it explained to you and youve fitted various curious facts together very well such as finding the name andra on the little ship and noticing it again on the map yes that was a bit of luck said jack you really do think the map is genuine bill i mean do you think theres any hope of its really showing where the old treasure is i cant say said bill puffing away at his pipe cant possibly say id have to take the map to an expert get it deciphered properly find out all i can about the old andra legend it may be just a tale you know and see if there really is an island called thamis and what its like there is said jack triumphantly i found it on a map bill began to laugh i dont know how it is that you children always seem to happen on something extraordinary he said just when i thought we were in for a lovely peaceful trip i shall have to go hunting about for an expert on old documents and get him to translate greek so old that its probably impossible to read correctly and if theres anything in it i suppose well have to see this island called thamis bill will you really cried jack in delight and philip bounced up and down on the bed nearly upsetting everybody dinah clutched lucyann her eyes shining they were all so pleased because bill hadnt poohpoohed the whole idea wed better get to bed now said bill its very late well talk about all this in the morning but dont get excited we cant possibly do more than give this map to an expert and then maybe run over to thamis and back if its near enough just to give it a look over after all were on a cruise you know the children got up reluctantly bill went with them to their cabins im going up on deck to smoke my pipe he said happy dreams in the early morning jack and philip woke up with a jump they sat up in bed light was just filtering through their porthole and a curious noise was coming from far below them its the engines of the ship said jack in relief i wondered whatever in the world it was what a queer noise theyre making whats happening theyve stopped said philip after listening for a minute or two no there they go again clankclankclank they dont sound a bit right they dont purr like they usually do i hope nothings wrong now theyve stopped again said jack well if theres any danger we shall hear the ships hooter hooting and hooting and the steward will come along and bang on our door yes and our life jackets are ready in the cupboard so weve nothing to worry about said philip feeling sleepy again its nothing lets go to sleep but in the morning they found that the ship was still not using her engines she lay there on the purpleblue sea rocking a little with the airport island lying not more than a mile or two off funny said jack and dressed quickly he banged on the girls door as he went by with philip the two boys tore up on deck and found their friend the second officer whats up they asked him why have we stopped macs got trouble with his engines said the officer soon be all right i expect they saw bill coming along he had been up for some time walking round the deck for exercise they rushed to him and he grinned hallo ready for breakfast im ravenous hallo micky hallo kiki mickykikimickykiki mickyki began kiki jack tapped her on the beak thats enough take a bit of exercise go and chase the gulls but kiki didnt want to she was bored with the gulls now besides she wanted breakfast breakfast was nice on board ship because there was always grapefruit and kiki liked that she loved the cherries on top of the grapefruit halves and the children took it in turn to give her one when breakfast was over the children took bill all over the ship they were not allowed down in the engineroom because of the trouble with the engines mac was in a fearful temper and had been up all night long working on them a message was put up on the ships noticeboard that morning owing to trouble with the engines of the viking star we are putting back to port passengers will be notified further at six oclock this evening with a curious clanking and labouring the viking star made her way slowly to the island with the airport motorboats came roaring out to meet her and find out what was wrong in one of them was bills friend tim he was soon on board and bill introduced him to the children tim here are the four children ive told you about be careful of them or theyll pull you into a perilous adventure thats the kind of children they are put them in the middle of an iceberg and theyll find an adventure somehow the children liked tim he was younger than bill had a mop of unruly curly hair which the wind did what it liked with and eyes as green as lucyanns he had as many freckles as she and jack had and a most infectious laugh youd better come off in the motorboat with me hadnt you he said to bill come back to the island its interesting right said bill well have the day together come on you four down the ladder with you chapter bill makes a few enquiries they had a wonderful day on the island tim hired a car and away they went to explore they had lunch in a big town set in the centre of the island a proper town with shops and buses and cinemas after lunch bill disappeared ive heard of an old chap whos a real expert at old documents he told the children one of the greatest experts there are its a bit of luck ill go and see him youve got the four bits of the map with you havent you jack jack nodded the children had decided that it would be safer to bring them than leave them behind he gave them to bill in an envelope i do hope the expert will say its genuine he said earnestly i say shall we tell tim youd be quite safe to said bill tim is all right whether hell believe you or not is another matter so whilst bill was gone the children told tim their secret he was inclined to grin at first and laugh it all off as a tale but they were so serious that he saw that they at least believed in it all he tried to be serious too well its marvellous he said i believed in all these treasure tales when i was a kid too jolly nice of bill to take it seriously and go off to have your map explained the children saw that he didnt really take their tale seriously and they dropped the subject polite but disappointed a little doubt crept in lucyanns mind was it all a tale no surely mr eppy wouldnt have behaved so queerly if there had been nothing in it bill was a long time gone the children were tired of waiting and tim was just suggesting they should take a run in the car to a queershaped hill in the distance when he came back sorry to have been so long he said i found the old boy looks as if hes come out of the fifteenth century hes so old and dusty and so slow i could have screamed but he knew his stuff all right what did he say asked jack crimson with anticipation its genuine no doubt of that at all said bill and everyone breathed loudly in relief he doesnt know if its a copy of any older map or a fresh one made by a greek sailor a hundred or so years ago probably a mixture he says the island is thamis it is shown clearly on the map and even if the name had not been there it could have been recognised by its shape its curiously formed at one end yes i noticed that said philip go on bill the map is in two distinct parts went on bill one shows the island and on it is marked a city or a port he doesnt know the island himself so he cant tell the other part shows this same city or port and is apparently a guide or directions to some spot in the city where something valuable is placed he says it isnt clear if this valuable thing is treasure or a temple or even a tomb he only knows it was something of value to the person who first drew the map the children were listening all eyes and ears this was marvellous but doesnt he think its the andra treasure asked jack he apparently doesnt know that tale very well he says there are hundreds of old legends of pirates and treasureships and kidnapping and so on most of them untrue he hadnt much to say about that he is inclined to think its a temple i think its the andra treasure said lucyann her eyes shining i really do i got him to redraw the whole map for us with the greek words in english he speaks english extraordinarily well said bill and he spread out a nice new sheet of paper on his lap drawn with fine lines and marked with words the children pored over it too thrilled to speak yes there was the old map redrawn put into english the faded marks shown clearly how simply wonderful even tim was intensely interested and almost began to believe in it jack read some of the words out in a whisper labyrinth catacombs twofingers goddess bird bell gosh what does it all mean are the labyrinths and catacombs in this city or port was the treasure taken down them we dont know all we know is that a way is shown here to a certain place in the city where a certain valuable thing can be found if it hasnt already been found and taken away or destroyed said bill but you must remember that the original of this map is probably hundreds of years old the way shown on this map possibly no longer exists in fact the probabilities are that it doesnt oh bill do you really believe that asked dinah reproachfully well to be perfectly honest i do said bill disappointingly i think the map is genuine no doubt about that at all but i also think that as all this happened so long ago theres no hope of finding the secret way shown here it would either have been built over or destroyed or even completely forgotten so that there may not even be an entrance to the labyrinths or catacombs whatever they are but mr eppy obviously thinks theres some hope said philip oh that reminds me this old chap the one ive been to see knows mr eppy he says hes a real crank about these things quite dippy about them and goes off on all sorts of harebrained schemes said bill buys and sells islands as if they were books or carpets or pictures he admits that mr eppy knows a lot about the islands and about the antiques that can be found in them but he doesnt think that because he believes in the map for instance that necessarily means there is anything to get excited about rather the other way about i gathered blow said jack so there may be nothing in it after all in fact probably not in fact probably not as you say agreed bill all the same if we had the chance which we shant have of course i wouldnt mind hiring a motorboat and chugging off to have a look at thamis wherever it is oh i do wish we could said lucyann it would be lovely just to see it i could run you over there said tim unexpectedly that is if its not too far away no time said bill folding up the map weve got to be back by six as you know thanks all the same tim now wed better be off i think by the time they got to the port it was halfpast five the viking star had been piloted right in to the pier and was lying there looking very white and beautiful but with no sign of the bustle about her that usually meant she was soon sailing the gangway was down and passengers were trooping along it lucian was among them with his aunt they hadnt seen him all day except in the distance and then they had taken no notice of him not wanting him to tag himself on to them now they had bill he waved to them and shouted oh i say where have you been all day my aunt wanted you to come with us and have lunch with one of my relations on the island sorry we had other plans called back jack see you sometime whos the rabbitmouth enquired bill oh its the boy lucian i suppose the nephew of your mr eppy he must be a bit of a nuisance to you we can manage him all right said philip look heres the noticeboard theres a big notice up what does it say the notice was printed in chalk on the big black noticeboard passengers are regretfully informed that the viking star will have to remain in port for a day or two until damage to her engines is repaired passengers may remain on board if they wish or stay in a hotel provided by the ships company or may use the motorboats which the said company will provide for the use of any passenger wishing to explore this romantic part of the aegean sea l petersen captain the same thought struck all four children at once they turned to one another their eyes shining we could couldnt we said lucyann and the others understood at once jack nodded his eyes bright he slipped his arm through bills bill looked round at the children he smiled broadly and then laughed out loud to see the four eager faces looking at him all with the same question in them can we go to thamis after all thats what you want to know isnt it he said well i dont see why not it looks as if well be here a few days and if the company provide us with a motorboat well well agree to their kind proposal and off well go in one bill bill how marvellous cried everyone and jack and philip began to thump one another on the back and the girls squeezed bills arms till he yelled kiki and micky flew off the boys shoulders in a hurry and retired in surprised annoyance to the top of the noticeboard come on stop this pantomime said bill still laughing to see the childrens excitement lets get up on deck and make a few plans before we change into clean things for dinner get micky look hes beginning to rub out the top part of the notice with his tail they went up to a favourite corner on the promenade deck and sat down its too good to be true said jack delighted we keep on thinking things are no good well have to give them up and then something happens and everythings all right yes we knew we couldnt do anything without bill and he wasnt here and then he suddenly came said lucyann and then we knew we still couldnt do anything because wed have to go with the ship on her cruise said dinah and now shes held up and we can go off by ourselves extraordinary how you children get what you want said bill now about this motorboat tomorrow i rather think well hire one on our own if we take one that the company provide well have to go with some of the other passengers and they certainly wont want to go to thamis wherever it is and we wouldnt want them to either said jack no lets have a boat of our own can tim come too hes got other plans said bill but well tell him just in case hed like to come well it certainly will be a thrill i must find out exactly this evening where this thamis is ill get hold of the second officer and ask him if theres a sailor on board that can tell me anything well have to find out the precise route or we might go cruising among these islands for weeks oh bill isnt it grand said lucyann i cant wait for tomorrow jack philip were really going to see the treasure island after all we really are chapter to thamis at last bill soon got all the information he wanted thats the best of being grownup said dinah grownups always seem to be able to find out anything and get things cut and dried in no time yes bills found out where thamis is has ferreted out a map of the route and has even got the name of a greek sailor who owns a motorboat and knows the way said jack in admiration how did he find all that out asked lucyann got hold of a greek sailor below decks and found he had a brother who runs one of the motorboats said philip it was the following morning the children had had a big breakfast and had been provided with enormous packets of food to take with them by the steward who looked after them so well at table ive packed a whole grapefruit two cherries and four bananas for master micky and miss kiki he said with a twinkle in his eye lucyann went off into giggles oh it does sound funny to call them that miss kiki kiki did you hear that miss kiki misskiki kickmissy missmicky began kiki and cackled loudly they all walked down the gangway to the pier they found tim waiting for them he had heard the news hallo sir he said to bill can i do anything for you today well were going off to have a look at thamis said bill ive hired a motorboat from a greek who apparently knows the route like to come with us well if youve made your own plans sir i wont come today said tim ive got a chappy here who wants a spot of flying can i take the plane up yes of course said bill and if you fly over thamis wave to us said jack right said tim with a grin ill look it up and see where it is look out for us he went off and bill turned to find the boat he had hired a small dark greek came up with brilliant eyes and a shy smile he saluted and spoke in broken english i andros sir please my brother he say mister want my boat mister sir she here right thanks andros said bill and he looked at the spick and span little boat lying alongside very nice boat now you know the way to thamis dont you thamis yes mister but thamis poor place andros take you fine islands no thanks we want to go to thamis said bill firmly andros seemed surprised at their wanting to go to thamis poor island he said again visitors not go there mister sir i take you fine place look here dont you know the way to thamis said bill sounds as if you dont oh you do then to thamis please and lets get on with it thamis mister sir agreed little andros yes yes thamis old old island but nothing there now mister sir he glanced with interest at the parrot and the monkey they come too also of course said jack stepping into the boat and helping the girls in come on bill mister sir mistersir mistersir mistersir screamed kiki pop goes the weasel bang pop god save the king andros gaped at her openmouthed micky leapt on to his shoulder and back to philips chattering he was excited he even pulled kikis tail a very silly thing to do because kiki would now watch for a good chance to nip mickys and micky had quite a long tail to nip andros started up the engine the motorboat nosed out of the little harbour leaving behind the great viking star beautiful but silent soon they were out on the open sea skimming along bobbing up and down on the white horses that reared themselves every now and again the sun was hot but the wind was strong the girls hair streamed out straight and they laughed in delight to feel so much wind in their faces after the heat on the ship it was lovely how far is thamis asked jack andros turned his curly head four hours five hours he said do you go there much asked bill no no mister sir poor island i go to janos the next one where my sister lives said andros thamis dead island mister sir what does he mean wondered jack a poor dead island doesnt sound much of a place does it well there must be some sort of port or town there said philip the one marked on the map it looked quite a big one there must be plenty of people living there and that means shops and things it cant be quite dead it was a lovely journey to thamis the sea was choppy and yet was full of glints and sparkles the boat sped along like a live thing the engines purring away at twelve oclock they all had a picnic lunch and blessed the steward who had packed them such a fine one five different sorts of sandwiches four different kinds of cake half a pound of sweet biscuits rolls and butter and cheese and tomatoes and the grapefruit cherries and bananas for kiki and micky said jack lucyann sat contentedly eating with the wind on her face she looked very happy the others looked at her and nudged one another they waited they knew exactly what she was going to say she opened her mouth and at once all the others chimed in together you know we always think food tastes much nicer when its eaten out of doors lucyann stared at them in surprise how very queer i was just about to say exactly the same thing she said the others chuckled we knew you were said philip you always do say it lucyann we watched for you to open your mouth and begin and we said it for you idiots said lucyann and laughed andros laughed too he liked these children and their queer pets he had refused to share their food and was eating his own lunch it was made up of rather black bread some very highsmelling cheese and a jug of some kind of drink kiki and micky ate their dinner solemnly together micky was not very pleased with the terrific breeze that blew every hair on his body backwards or forwards depending on which way he sat nor was kiki pleased when her feathers blew round her like an umbrella turning inside out the two of them sat together in a little sheltered place sharing the grapefruit the cherries and the bananas micky politely peeled a banana for kiki and handed it to her he skins it just like we do said lucyann i always think hes so clever at that clever said andros pointing to micky good and clever micky unfortunately spoilt andross good opinion of him by throwing away the banana skin so carelessly that it landed on the sailors head hanging ridiculously over his right eye kiki gave one of her rich chuckles and was just about to add her banana skin to mickys when jack took it away from her mistersir mistersir mister pollysir squawked kiki trying to snatch it back the boat went on and on occasionally passing other islands one or two large ones but most of them small finally andros raised his hands and pointed to the east thamis he said mister sir thamis everyone looked eagerly to where he pointed they saw a small island purple in the distance rearing itself out of the waters as they sped nearer thamis was it really thamis the old island marked on the treasure map eagerly the children leaned forward and watched it take shape as they raced nearer lucyanns imagination began to work long long ago she thought this is where the fleet of treasureships stole up to in the night soon we shall see the city marked on the map the treasurecity perhaps she thought one of the ships was called the andra like our own little ship of adventure perhaps it sailed into the very spot were making for now were getting quite near we shall see the city soon the one marked on the map is there a good harbour asked bill turning to andros the man looked surprised oh no mister sir no harbour now only two places to land i andros know them both i take you to old city port good thought jack now we shall soon be therein the old city marked on the map i hope it wont be too modern like the towns weve seen on some of the islands ah now were getting in close they were they could see rocky beaches the waves pounded on them they looked for the town and saw buildings coming down to the waters edge it seemed queer that there was no proper harbour city ports always had a harbour the boat ran in gently andros looking out for rocks and taking a course he seemed to know he was making for a little channel that led inland the children fell silent as they neared the island their eyes were fixed on the city it didnt look right somehow something was the matter with it it looked well dead lucyann thought jack remembered his binoculars and put them to his eyes he gave an exclamation gosh would you believe it what said everyone at once impatiently its all ruins said jack and he lowered the glasses and looked at the others its a ruined city i never thought of that i andros told that said the sailor i tell you poor island dead island one farm two farms perhaps city gone nobody there all gone to other islands now they nosed into the little channel it was deep and calm you get out and i wait enquired andros not see much all dead and poor this island yes mister sir i take you better places well get out andros said bill bring the rest of the food jack we may as well explore now were here and well picnic in the old ruins they will be quite interesting i expect not knowing quite what to think the children leapt off the boat on to a ledge they climbed up some old worn steps and came into what must have been the main street of the old city it was overgrown now and difficult to walk in there were ruins everywhere bill looked at a few of them closely these are hundreds of years old he said i wonder what made the people leave thamis and go elsewhere i suppose the island couldnt keep them in food what a place its got such an old deserted feeling about it that i feel im living hundreds of years ago said lucyann i wish the city would come alive be full of the longago people walking and running here along the street looking out of the old broken windowopenings going down to whatever harbour there was to see the ships well i hope the city doesnt come alive said dinah id be scared stiff i dont like it much as it is either it was built on a steep hill and the old ruined buildings rose one above another some just a wall or two others a hollow shell and still others looking fairly habitable until the children peeped inside and saw the holes in the roof and the walls almost at the top was an old ruined temple one or two graceful arches still remaining its massive columns stood in a broken row with one or two gulls perched on the jagged tops bill scraped aside some of the grass that grew on the floor of the temple and pointed out old mosaic stones to the children bill is there anything here at all thats on the map asked jack somehow it was all so different from what he had imagined that the idea of hidden treasure now seemed ridiculous bill got out the redrawn map look this is where we came in with our boat surely said philip pointing it says creek well wouldnt you call that channel a creek and look the entrance or beginning of the way to the treasure is somewhere near the creek oh bill lets go back and explore along there said dinah bill laughed weve certainly got a bee in our bonnet about this all right come on itll be on the way to the boat anyway just lets get to the top of the hill said jack we could see over the rest of the island then its not very large right said bill and they climbed to the very top they could see away over to the other side of the island where the darkblue sea was tipped with white horses it was a bare rocky place but here and there were green patches and small buildings could be seen the farms andros spoke of i suppose said bill my word he was certainly right when he called it poor and dead its not quite my idea of a treasure island they turned to go down the hill on which the ruined city was built they made their way carefully halfway down lucyann stopped and listened i can hear something she said so can i said dinah its a bell ringing whatever can it be chapter a few surprises it seemed so very queer to hear a bell ringing in that dead and silent city that the little company felt really startled the sound came nearer dongdongdong kiki didnt like it either and crouched against jacks cheek micky chattered quietly dongdongdong somethings coming round that corner said jack suddenly and something did it was a donkey a little grey donkey with a big bell hanging from his neck with him was a small boy an imp of a boy riding astride with panniers each side of the donkey great baskets that were full of something covered in white cloths good gracious said dinah and she sat down on a big stone most relieved to see that it was just a donkeybell that had startled them all i dont know what i thought was coming i suppose the boys from one of the farms said bill looking puzzled but why has he come here there is nobody living here then an even more surprising thing happened the boy caught sight of the five people watching him and grinned a welcome he leapt off the donkey pointed to the pannier baskets and screamed out something that sounded like sheer gibberish but which the children imagined must be the speech of thamis then he brought the donkey right up to them and began to throw back the cloths that covered whatever was in the panniers its food said bill in amazement bread cheeses meat gosh hes unpacking the lot the boy unpacked everything chattering all the time he evidently couldnt understand why nobody helped him and addressed quite a few cutting remarks to the two boys who of course couldnt make head or tail of them here boy said bill whats all this he pointed to the pile of food the boy sent out a stream of gibberish again pointing to bill and then pointing to the food anyone would think he had brought all this for us said bill exasperated i cant understand it at all the boy mounted his donkey again he held out his hand to bill palm upwards that was plain enough he wanted money well well it beats me said bill astounded a very fine welcome to thamis i must say but most unexpected we dont want the food sonny we dont want it take it back no amount of shouting could make the boy understand he got very angry and tapped his palm smartly to make bill understand he wanted money in the end bill tipped a handful of coins into his hand he counted them carefully nodded his head grinned brilliantly and then very rudely spat at micky micky spat back and kiki growled like a dog the donkey backed away from kiki and began to bray eeeyore eeeeeeyore kiki was extremely startled but she soon recovered and produced a very good bray herself the boy gave a yelp of surprise kicked his donkey hard with both his bare heels and galloped away round the corner the donkeys bell ringing hard dongdongdongdongdong bill sat down and scratched his head well what do you make of that he said a present of some very fine country food sent by somebody we dont know who cant possibly have known we were here its a bit queer said jack i wouldnt mind one of those rolls they all had one they were very good they sat and munched them wondering about the boy they couldnt make head or tail of his appearance what are we going to do with this food said philip it wont keep if its left out in the sun it seems an awful waste of good food to leave it mouldering here it does said bill well the only thing we can do is to carry it into a cool place somewhere and hope that boy will come back they picked up the food and went into a nearby building there was a hole in the floor shaded by a halfruined wall they packed all the food there wondering what would happen to it now wed better go down to the creek and see if we can find the entrance or whatever it is shown on the map said bill he pulled it out of his pocket and looked at it the children looked too we shant find it so dont think it said bill who was now secretly of the opinion that there was nothing to be discovered in this poor dead island they went down the overgrown stonestrewn street and came to the rocky creek the motorboat was there rocking gently andros was fast asleep on the shady side of the boat the little party walked down the rocky ledge to the boat then they looked up the creek bill gave an exclamation of course thats it what bill said the children at once well twofingers is marked on the map apparently for no reason at all the expert swore thats what the old greek word meant i just thought it might be an old name for someone but now i see what it meant look up there the children looked where bill pointed and above their heads some way away to the left they saw a queer rock it was like a clenched hand with two fingers raised yes two fingers there they were and twofingers was marked on the map come on thats a guide of some sort said bill and they climbed along till they came to the queer twofingered rock they found a hole behind it a hole that would quite easily allow a person to step into it bill fumbled for a torch he switched it on there may be a passage of some kind he said yes there is this is really extraordinary i think jack youd better go back to the boat and get a lantern or two if you can find them my torch isnt too good jack sped down to the boat andros was still asleep jack spotted two lanterns and brought them carefully up to the twofingered rock handing them at awkward places to philip who had come to meet him good said bill well light these ill take one and you can take the other jack ill save my torch they lighted the oil lanterns inside the hole it wasnt big enough for a cave it really was just a large hole behind the queer rock but at the back was what looked like an entry into the hill could it possibly be the entrance shown in the map do you think it is bill asked lucyann eagerly when the lanterns were lighted and bill held one up to peer into the narrow rocky passage behind the hole no i cant believe it is said bill it must have been known for years by everyone in the city when it was alive with people its just a coincidence i expect the children of course didnt think it was they felt very thrilled indeed as they made their way along the dark little passage it went for a few hundred yards and then came out into a wide space bill held up his lantern it shone on to rocky walls but what was that at the back the wall looked different there he took his lantern over to it the beam shone on to large blocks of stone built like a great irregular door i wonder why that was built here said bill surprised he swung the lantern round to light up the rest of the cave the walls were of smooth shiny rock there was not the smallest opening there at all the only opening was the one they had come in by from the narrow passage bill swung the light on to the builtin stones again then he put the lantern down this was built to block up some other opening he said at last the childrens hearts sank it is immensely strong as you can see for yourselves a door of great blocks of stone a door that cant possibly be opened or got through in any way bill do you think its blocking up the entrance shown on the map asked jack dismayed well yes i do said bill its been built many many years its old as you can see why it was built goodness knows anyway there it is and were stopped right at the very outset if this is the way shown on the map the way that one must follow to get to wherever the treasure was hidden its impossible to follow it quite impossible oh bill said lucyann almost in tears its too bad isnt there any way through well send micky to see said bill if theres even a small hole micky will find it you know what monkeys are send him philip go micky go and hunt about said philip micky looked at him enquiringly he didnt like this business of exploring dark passages he leapt off philips shoulder and obediently went off on an exploration of his own kiki watched him and then flew to a ledge at the top of the immense stone doorway send for the doctor she said in a hollow voice pollys got a cold send for the doctor micky bounded up to join her he scurried about putting his little paw here and there into crannies and crevices but obviously there was nothing to find for he soon came back and leapt on to philips shoulder nestling closely to his neck no go said bill he set the lantern down on the floor meaning to put the map away just as he was folding it up lucyann gave an astonished cry whats the matter said jack startled look whats that over there on the floor surely its its a torch battery philip saw the thing she meant and went to pick it up he brought it to the light of the lamp yes thats just what it is an old wornout battery from a torch rather like bills bill you havent dropped a battery have you of course not said bill yes this is certainly on old battery somebody must have thrown it down and put a new battery into his torch whoever he may be we are obviously not the only ones to know this place lucyann shivered she was sorry she had spotted that battery now it made her feel queer who had been in this walledup cave and why lets go bill she said we cant do any good here its all walled up lets go back to andros i dont like this right well go back said bill in any case we ought to go now weve been here ages and weve got to get back to the ship tonight come along they made their way out of the cave down the narrow passage in the rocky hill and came to the hole they climbed round the twofingered rock and made their way to the creek and then they got a terrible shock the motorboat was gone they stared as if they couldnt believe their eyes wheres the boat said dinah feebly they looked up the creek and down no sign of the boat at all how very extraordinary and then jack gave a cry and pointed out to sea isnt that it look right out there they all strained their eyes and bill nodded his head grimly yes that looks like it what on earth made andros go off without us what an astounding thing to do he was fast asleep in the boat when i got the lantern said jack never stirred everything seemed all right then blessed if i understand it said bill looking bewildered he seemed a good trustworthy chap and i havent even paid him what in the world has possessed him to act like that the boats going pretty fast said philip almost out of sight now well well well here we are marooned on our treasure island sure as eggs are eggs lucyann was very much alarmed she took bills arm what are we going to do she said are we to stay here bill lucyann dont be an idiot said jack before bill could answer where are we to go if we dont stay here have you got an aeroplane stowed away somewhere ready for this emergency shut up jack said bill putting his arm round lucyann we shall be all right dont fret lucyann its only one of our adventures chapter all kinds of shocks they stood there for a little while not certain what to do it was all so very unexpected then bill shook himself and grinned round at the others well it looks as if weve got to spend the night here doesnt it and get our supper ourselves thank goodness weve got the food that extraordinary boy brought on his donkey and jacks got the rest of our picnic lunch as well oh yes id forgotten that said dinah pleased she had been thinking they would have nothing to eat we can go and tuck in straight away said bill well find somewhere to sleep all right its very warm and we shant take any harm i dont particularly want to go and find one of those farms we saw in case andros takes it into his head to call back for us he must have gone crazy it was a curious evening that they all spent on thamis they went to find the store of food and had a very good meal indeed they put the rest of it safely back in the cool place they had stored it in at first then they went wandering round the silent ruined old city again lucyann found an old pot with a broken neck which she was very pleased with jack found some kind of metal fork at least that is what he took it to be with two of its prongs gone bill had been hunting about for some place to sleep in he hadnt been very successful at last he chose a room not far from the ruined temple one that had three walls and a little roof left it was overgrown with thick grass and would have to do for a bedroom the sun was going down it would soon be gone bill decided to put the food in the bedroom too then it would be handy if they wanted any he and the boys removed it from the place it was in and put it carefully in some thick cool grass they were glad there was such a lot when the sun disappeared everyone felt tired lucyann was yawning her head off and so was kiki micky explored the ruined little room thoroughly approved of it and settled down on philip as soon as the boy had made himself a fairly soft bed in the thicklygrowing grass the four children fell asleep at once kiki perched herself quietly on jacks middle as soon as she knew he was asleep he had pushed her off two or three times but this time he didnt wake and she remained where she was her head tucked under her wing bill lay and looked up at the stars he could see through the holes in the roof he was angry with himself for bringing the children to thamis now they had landed in difficulties again all because of a legendary and most elusive treasure one that certainly hadnt existed for years if it had ever existed at all he puzzled over the boy on the donkey who had brought the food he puzzled over the blockedup entrance and the battery lucyann had found but more than anything he puzzled over the sudden disappearance of andros he was just about to fall off to sleep when he heard a noise micky must have heard it too because he stirred and his small head looked round the bedroom bill lay and listened holding his breath was it a noise he had heard then he heard the unmistakable sound of a voice then another voice deep and complaining where did they come from he sat up cautiously and listened again the voices came once more and then bill heard footsteps footsteps coming down the ruined city street he didnt like it at all who on earth was walking through the old dead city in the middle of the night kiki had heard the voices too she flew out of the room she was in and hid herself under the ledge of an arch waiting the footsteps came nearer the voices came too talking together bill silently posted himself beside a broken windowopening and watched there was only starlight to see by but he might be able to make out something two dark figures came up the street they stopped every now and again it seemed to bill as if they were looking in the ruined buildings to find something would they look into this one and find the children bill debated whether he should go out and accost these people who were they anyway then he decided that people who walk the streets of a ruined city at dead of night are not perhaps the best people to ask help from and he remained where he was the two dark figures arrived near by he heard their voices again but they spoke in a foreign language greek he thought and he couldnt understand a word they were obviously looking for something bill thought and then he suddenly guessed what it was the food perhaps maybe the boy had brought it for them and they hadnt been there but bill had and had got it instead now the men were looking for it sure that the boy had dumped it somewhere theyll look in here then sure as anything thought bill but they didnt just as they got to the broken doorway near where the parrot was perched kiki went off like a pistolshot crack the children all woke up at once and sat up they were too startled to make a sound and as soon as they heard bills sh they sat silently waiting the two men were most alarmed bill could see them clutching one another they said something rapidly obviously asking each other what that noise was kiki considered them she didnt like them she began to cackle with laughter and this horrified the men more than anything else could have done kikis laughter was so completely idiotic that it froze them to the marrow kiki stopped she swelled out her throat and began to make her famous noise of an express train screeching through a tunnel getting louder and louder and louder it was a magnificent effort and had very satisfactory results the men screeched too in panic and set off as fast as they could certain that something terrible was coming after them kiki sent another pistolshot after them and then relapsed into cackles well really kiki said bill when the two men were completely gone what a performance who was it out there bill asked dinah ive no idea said bill but i have a feeling it was two hungry fellows come to look for the food the small boy presented us with today anyway theyve departed in a great hurry kiki was marvellous wasnt she said jack good old kiki clever bird kiki gave an outsize hiccup pardon send for the doctor pop goes the weasel yes very nice but thats enough now said jack bill who do you think those men were ive just told you ive no idea said bill this place beats me come on lets go to sleep again i dont somehow think those fellows will come back and if we have any other visitors ive no doubt kiki will deal with them they settled themselves off to sleep again bill lay awake wondering a little more then he too fell asleep he didnt wake till morning the others were already awake jack had awakened very thirsty and had gone to look for water he found a well beside a tumbledown house some way down the hill and saw water in it it wasnt long before he had rigged up a way of bringing up the water which was crystal clear and cold he tied string round the broken pot lucyann had found and lowered it down the well it didnt hold much water because the neck was broken but it was enough for them all to quench their thirst they had breakfast off the rolls and cheeses and hoped the boy would come again that day go down and see if theres any sign of the boat jack said bill when they had finished so off he went and soon came back to report that the creek was empty no boat was anywhere to be seen well we shall just have to wait about thats all said bill it will only be a question of time till we are taken off tim will wonder whats happened for one thing or andros will discover hes done a crazy thing and come back for us at about twelve oclock they heard the dongdongdong of the donkeys bell again and round the same corner came the imp of a boy bill knew what to do this time he and the others unpacked the food the boy was paid and with the donkeys bell ringing loudly he departed much better pleased with his reception everyone stared after him really very extraordinary said bill lets hide the food quickly before the real recipients come along well have a meal ourselves too im hungry they dragged it to the room in which they had slept the night before and had a good meal before they hid it bill wondered if he should find his way to one of the farms for help but what help could they give and what kind of a reception would he get anything might happen to him on this lonely island he might be robbed and kept prisoner or even killed jack asked bill to give him the map to study the redrawn one not that its going to be much use said jack with a grin now that im on thamis i dont think so much of it as i did and its difficult to believe in treasure when all you can see around you is a lot of ruins bill gave him the map jack took it into the space once occupied by the temple and sat down in a corner lucyann came to sit with him kiki settled between them murmuring companionably the two red heads bent over the map together its got so many things on it that i cant make out the reason for said jack twofingers well we know what that means all right and now look here a lot further on it says bell well what does that mean bell what has a bell a donkey of course and schools have bells and churches said lucyann i expect this old temple had a bell once upon a time i wonder where it was she looked round and about but could see no place where a bell could have hung jack looked at her suddenly lucyann of course a temple would have a bell the temple may be one of the clues one of the guides to the treasure do you think so said lucyann doubtfully but surely the treasure would have been hidden deep underground somewhere not in the temple up here we know the entrance to the secret passage was far down the hill just above the creek would it be hidden under the temple perhaps said jack or somewhere near maybe the temple had vaults i say thats an idea if this one once had vaults they must still be there vaults dont become ruins like buildings theyre not exposed to wind and rain and sun vaults yes going deep down into the hill reached by an underground passage from the creek a passage that could be approached easily enough from the sea could be used by sailors who wanted to smuggle in goods lucyann there must be vaults come on well look for them lucyann half excited half disbelieving got up and followed jack he began to hunt all over what must have once been the courtyard it was too overgrown to tell if any way could be found underground they leaned against a great halfbroken column to rest themselves there was a large piece out of the column just above their heads and kiki flew up there to perch at that moment micky came bounding into the old courtyard of the temple followed by the others he saw kiki and leapt up beside her she wasnt expecting him and was startled and angry she gave him such a violent nip that he lost his balance on the ledge and fell backwards into the inside of the enormous column he shrieked with fright as he fell and kiki poked her head inside the hole to see what had happened to him all gone she announced in a hollow voice all gone dingdongbell you idiot kiki shouted philip hey micky micky come on up but there was no micky only a little whimpering cry came up hes hurt said philip here jack give me a legup ill go down into the column after him he cant have fallen very far jack gave him a legup he got on to the broken place swung his legs in and was about to jump down when he stopped and looked in cautiously hey bill he called hand me your torch id better look before i leap i think theres something queer here bill handed him up his torch philip switched it on and looked down into the hollow of the great column he turned and looked back at the others i say its queer it looks as if theres steps at the bottom of this column what do you think of that chapter exploring the treasureroute everyone was amazed steps stone steps leading downwards at the base of the hollow stone column jack gave a loud whoop i bet they go to the vaults what vaults asked dinah in astonishment but jack was too excited to tell her bill lets go down come on were on the track of the treasure didnt the map say bell well the temple must have had a bell i bet the treasures somewhere underneath youre talking double dutch said bill not following this at all philip come down dont attempt any scatterbrained exploration till we get the lanterns and till i have a look myself do you hear me yes right bill said philip reluctantly and jumped down mickys down there somewhere he must have fallen on the steps and gone bumping down i can still hear him whimpering i expect he got a bit of a shock said bill go and get the lanterns and also the food you boys if we are going underground wed better prepare ourselves before the boys returned micky had come back a micky very frightened and sorry for himself indeed he looked for his beloved philip but he wasnt there so he went to lucyann and let her nurse him like a baby he whimpered all the time and lucyann was very distressed now now you havent really hurt yourself she consoled him just a bruise or two i expect it was very very naughty of kiki still youve made a wonderful find micky really wonderful kiki was very ashamed of herself she went into a corner and put her head under her wing nobody took any notice of her at all the boys came back bill had had a good look down the hollow column with his torch it puzzled him how the ancient folk who had used the column as a way of getting underground had made an entry in it he could see no way of entry at all except of course through the great hole broken in the column its a narrow spiral stairway he told the girls probably jack is right it may lead down to the vaults of the temple a very secret way to them possibly known only to the head priest come on boys help the girls up ill go down first he dropped down deftly to the head of the steps he shone his torch down yes it was a spiral stairway as he had thought it would be very narrow here but probably got wider lower down he had almost to crawl down the first twelve steps and two or three times nearly slipped because the treads were so narrow and steep the girls followed helped by the boys dinah took one lantern finding it very difficult indeed to manage with it and at last had to hand it down to bill because she needed both her hands at the top of the stairway lucyann went down by the light of the second lantern held for her by jack the food was dropped in behind them might as well leave it there called back bill we can fetch it if we need it and its as good a hidingplace as anywhere else so they left the food at the top of the stairway on a stone ledge there and pretty soon all five were a good way down as bill had thought the stone steps grew very much wider and easier a little way down micky was now on philips shoulder again kiki had followed jack into the column very quiet and subdued down they went and down they came to the end of the stairway it finished in a vast cave or vault that stretched out endlessly in the rock of the hill the lanterns only lit up a small part of it yes here are the vaults all right said jack the way weve come to them must have been a very secret one i should think look theres another way up bill over there more stone steps straight ones this time not spiral going quite steeply upwards yes i should think that was the ordinary way used up and down to the vaults said bill the way we came is very well hidden see from here you cant even see it hidden behind that enormous rock he swung his torch up the wide sweep of steps to which they had now walked over ill go up and see where they lead to said bill and up he went they heard his steps going up and up and then they stopped they heard them coming down again came up against a stone ceiling he reported probably theres an exit there closed up by a great stone trapdoor overgrown now with weeds and grass that was obviously the ordinary way in and out well where do we go from here bill lets look at the map again said jack im sure we must now be at the place marked bell bell for temple you know by the light of bills torch they all pored over the map again bill traced the treasurepath with his finger twofinger rock he said we were there and were stopped by the walledin place yes then the next thing marked is goddess said philip cant think what that means something on the way from twofinger rock to here perhaps said jack we could go and see then look there comes tomb i suppose thats where someone was buried yes in a stone cell i should think said bill and then we come to bird which seems rather strange then to bell said jack triumphantly and thats where we are i bet yes but not where the treasure is said bill look you go on to here marked labyrinth not so good that whats a labyrinth exactly asked lucyann a maze a place where its so winding and muddling that you can easily get lost said dinah lucyann didnt like the sound of that at all labyrinth she said well whats next catacomb said bill and that apparently is where the treasure was put what a way to bring it lets go and find it said jack cheerfully he folded up the map and put it into his pocket come on weve got nothing else to do i must say its nice and cool down here after the heat up above in the sun the thing is which way do we go said bill one way goes to the labyrinth the other to the tomb but although the points of the compass are marked on the map to make things easy were not able to see the sun so we have no idea of direction anyone got a compass nobody had well well have to guess said bill theres only two ways to go apparently to the right or to the left lets go right so they set off to the right of the vault bill with his torch the two girls holding hands and each boy carrying a lantern the shadows were weird and the hollow echo of their feet strange and rather alarming kiki and micky didnt like it at all and each sat silent on the boys shoulders they went for some way and then came to a wide passage that led downwards in a smooth slope it went for a good way and then stopped short at what appeared to be a door it was a wooden door and had once been immensely stout and strong even now it was still good but one of the hinges had given way and as the children first pushed and then pulled it the other hinges gave way too and the door fell inwards almost on top of bill he just leapt away in time he shone his torch on it carved right across the door was an enormous bird there you are bird said jack pleased that was one of the clues wasnt it bill its an eagle beautifully carved too now we know which way were going the wrong way said bill still well go on now this is amazing leaving the fallen birddoor behind they went through the opening looking back they saw that the passage they were now following forked into two by the door evidently there were two ways to go there and the right one was the birddoor hence the clue called bird they went down a very narrow passage indeed it ran downwards as the other had done until it opened out into a narrow chamber there was a smooth stone ledge at one side at each end were wooden slabs carved with intricate symbols the little company stopped to look at them this must have been a tomb said bill possibly where a priest was buried there are many old buryingplaces like this the sailors who carried the treasure must have had to carry it through this tomb said philip perhaps they knew this way because they robbed tombs there was no door to the tomb but the doorway was cut out smooth and level possibly there had once been a door beyond it the passage began again sloping downwards more steeply still now for goddess said jack i say its a pretty good guide this map isnt it bill if we had been able to make our way through twofinger rock where the hole was you know we could have used the map as an absolutely accurate guide look out there are steps here now said bill cut in the rock it gets pretty steep here they went carefully down the steps at the bottom was a beautiful archway it was made of some kind of marble set into the natural archway of the rock beyond the arch was a marble floor still smooth and shining for there was no dust underground the walls were carved too the solid rock itself chipped out into figures and symbols eagles doves foxes wolves curious designs and patterns decorated the whole of the strange little cave this must be goddess said bill a place to worship some littleknown goddess i imagine hidden under the ground only to be visited in secret yes that must be it said philip isnt it strange i suppose those carvings are hundreds of years old and now for the last clue or first whichever you like to call it said bill twofingers we know what that is anyway but we shall come up against the other side of the stone door ive no doubt here we go my word its steep now isnt it no steps either be careful you girls they made their way stumbling down a very steep passage and just as bill had said they came up against the other side of the walledup doorway they had seen when they had gone into twofinger hole they stopped and considered yes weve found the treasureroute all right said bill now well start from here again twofingers and well work our way back past goddess and tomb and bird till we come to bell the temple vault and then well go on said jack almost trembling with excitement on to labyrinth and catacomb and treasure chapter kiki is very tiresome back went the little company through the curious little cell that must once have been a marble temple underground dedicated to some strange goddess through the old tomb and over the fallen door carved with the bird and soon they were back in the temple vault now we start off the other way to the left said bill who was now almost as excited as the four children come along down this passage here hold up your lantern philip my torch isnt very strong does this passage lead into the labyrinth the maze where people get lost asked lucyann a little fearfully shall we get lost no well find some way of keeping safe said bill he and jack looked closely at the map although this part is marked labyrinth it shows only one route or passage but every now and again the letter r turns up for right i suppose we seem to have to turn to the right six times well if we come to a fork we shall know what to do right every time come along put the map back in your pocket jack they went down the lowroofed winding passage for a little way and then jack called out to the others i say anyone got kiki they all stopped i havent yelled back lucyann nor has dinah bill said he certainly hadnt and as for philip he only had micky on his shoulder she flew off my shoulder when we got into the vault said jack remembering kiki kiki where are you there was no squawk or screech in reply blow said jack ill have to go back and get her ill catch you up he ran back the others went on jack had a lantern and could easily catch them up they soon came to a fork we take the righthand one said bill this way the passage twisted and turned extraordinarily often and it was impossible to know if they were going forwards or by so much turning and twisting were going in the opposite direction one right turn two and this is the third said philip three more right turns and well be at the catacomb ooooh said lucyann i hope it wont be long im tired of these dark passages this one is stony i keep hitting my toes against some stone or other i wish jack would catch us up said philip who was last i keep thinking i hear him behind me and when i turn he isnt there ought we to wait for him bill yes perhaps we ought said bill and they stopped but no jack came gracious what could he be doing lucyann began to feel worried jack she called jack are you coming better go back for him said bill puzzled i hope to goodness he hasnt missed the way he knew we had to turn to the right each time they went back for some way and then bill stopped i suppose were right he said i dont somehow remember this passage its got such a very very low roof ive just bumped my head against it and i certainly didnt do that coming along oh dear surely we havent missed our way it seemed so easy turn to the left each time going back groaned dinah it must be right bill bill was uneasy he certainly didnt remember this lowroofed passage he made up his mind well go back he said i think we missed the last leftturn somehow so they went back but soon they came to a dead stop the passage grew narrower and narrower and at last nobody could squeeze through that couldnt be right either wrong again said bill much more cheerfully than he felt secretly he was scared and horrified how big was this labyrinth how far did it go into the hill on the map it looked a short route but by the labyrinth itself might spread for miles intersected by mazes of passages crisscrossing wandering round and round its a real maze thought bill and probably there are only one or two direct routes across it and weve missed the one we ought to have taken goodness knows how long well be wandering about here i wonder where jack is said lucyann anxiously as they wound in and out of the curious passages of the labyrinth i do hope hes all right where was jack he had gone back to get kiki and had heard her talking mournfully to herself in the temple vault perched on the spiral stone stairway that led up to the broken column he called her kiki what are you doing there why didnt you come with us idiot now ive had to come all the way back for you kiki was tired of being underground she wanted to go up into the sunshine also she wanted a drink and there seemed to be no water below the ground kiki come along i want to get back to the others called jack send for the doctor said kiki preening her wings pollys got a cold send for the doctor dont be so tiresome said jack exasperated and he went over to where kiki sat she flew up a few steps and cocked her head at jack he could see her plainly in the light of his lantern and he was cross youre behaving very badly he scolded her come down and sit on my shoulder bad bird naughty polly send for the doctor said kiki who seemed to have got the doctor on her brain she flew up a few more steps jack had to follow blow kiki she would behave like this just when he wanted to catch up with the others he reached the parrot and she flew higher again finally she disappeared jack yelled up the stone steps angrily you wait till i get you you bad bird playing me up like this for the last time come down a mocking voice floated down to him wipe your feet dont sniff pop goes the doctor that was really too much for poor jack he climbed the spiral stone stairs as fast as he could finding it very difficult indeed at the top where they came up at the bottom of the broken column at last he stood inside the column he could see very well now for the sun shone in through the hole in the stone kiki was sitting on the broken edge of the hole preening herself in the sun she kept a lookout for jack knowing he was very cross oh i say she said loudly oh i say she flew off the edge of the hole and disappeared from jacks view he could still hear her calling out though oh i say oh i say saying all kinds of rude things about kiki under his breath jack found a rough foothold in the inside of the column and heaved himself up to the hole he swung himself through the hole and jumped down into the sunshine looking round for kiki there she sat not far off in a tree of some kind peering down the hill oh i say she cried in a shrill voice and then went off into a cackle of laughter jack ran to the tree angrily and then he stopped someone was coming up the hill someone quite familiar astonishingly familiar someone with teeth that stuck out in front and with a chin that was hardly there at all lucian said jack too much astonished to move and lucian it was no wonder kiki had suddenly gone off into a stream of oh i says lucian stopped and stared at jack as if he really couldnt believe his eyes oh i say he said oh i say hallo said jack feebly and grinned er what in the world are you doing here well i might say the same to you said lucian of all the extraordinary things well i never i cant believe it how long have you been here asked jack why are you here i only came today said lucian my uncles here you see goodness knows why i dont know when he came exactly anyway he got here and then sent for another motorboat to come to him here on thamis bringing some men he wanted and some goods and i thought id come along too the viking star is held up as you know and i was bored stiff i suppose my uncles going to get some antiques here or something jack digested all this in silence oho so mr eppy was there too was he he was hot on the track after all jack thought quickly what a pity he had met lucian now the boy would tell mr eppy jack what are yon doing here you really must tell me said lucian insistently its too extraordinary and kiki too where are the others why should they be here said jack he didnt want to tell lucian about them or where they were or how to get to them that would never do he thought hard but he couldnt make any plan that seemed good except that if he could get rid of lucian he would pop down the broken column get down the spiral stairway to the vaults and warn billbill would know what to do how could he get rid of lucian lucian wasnt likely to let him out of his sight at all and blow blow blow there was mr eppy coming up the hillside now with three other men mr eppy was too surprised to speak when he suddenly caught sight of jack and kiki he stopped dead and stared through his dark glasses he took them off rubbed them and was about to put them on again when lucian went off into one of his silly fits of giggling oh dear oh i say you cant believe your eyes can you uncle nor could i but it really is jack and kiki the parrot too for one wild moment jack wondered if he should run for it run from the surprised men and hide somewhere till he could manage to get back to bill and warn him but there was no time at a word from mr eppy the three men with him ran up and stationed themselves behind jack then mr eppy came up and stood in front of him and what exactly are you doing here he said in such a peculiar menacing tone that jack was astonished and scared where are the others we came to explore a bit said jack at last thats all anyone can come and explore these islands the viking stars engines broke down and the passengers were told they could hire motorboats and cruise among these islands why did you come to this one asked mr eppy still in a fierce voice lucian answered unexpectedly for him oh uncle i expect he came hunting for the treasure you told me about hold your tongue idiot of a boy said mr eppy almost spitting at poor lucian and now you he turned to jack again how dare you come trespassing on my island it isnt yours said jack it is i have just bought it said mr eppy ah you didnt know that but you know why chapter mr eppy again yes jack did know why mr eppy had bought the island he stared at the man miserably his heart sinking if the island was mr eppys then the treasure would be his too once again it looked as if the adventure had come to a sudden end you know why i have bought it repeated mr eppy tell me boy well i suppose you wanted to look for treasure on it said jack in a sulky tone but you wont find it you only saw two pieces of the map remember then you will tell me what was on the other pieces said mr eppy in a dangerous tone lucian was by now looking distinctly frightened here i say uncle he began i dont think you ought to talk to old jack like that you know i mean to say mr eppy took a step backwards and slapped lucian neatly across the mouth his hand made a noise like a whipcrack and kiki immediately imitated it then she scolded mr eppy naughty boy naughty boy nitwit mistersir lucian burst into howls he put his hand up to his mouth and stumbled away to a corner the three men didnt turn a hair that is how i treat foolish boys said mr eppy turning back to jack are you going to be foolish too jack said nothing mr eppy put his face close to him and hissed at him so startlingly that jack took a sudden step back and trod on the foot of one of the three men where are the others demanded mr eppy with his face close to jacks they must be here too i sent away your boat yesterday i threatened the man with prison for daring to land people on my island oh so thats why andros ran away said jack in disgust what a fool thing to do mr eppy dont you know hell come back again probably with help he wont said mr eppy he knows i shall put him in prison if he opens his mouth no no i knew what i was doing when i saw the boat there i guessed you and that big friend of yours were interfering here i have heard of him this is my island everything on it is mine all right all right said jack but why send the boat away without us why not send us off too if we had been told by you it was yours and i know you do buy and sell islands we wouldnt have trespassed without permission i wanted you here said mr eppy you have the plan have you not you did not leave it behind you ah no you would bring such a precious thing with you jack was silent of course that was why mr eppy had sent the boat away without them he meant to get the plan and as he thought of that jack also thought of something else something absolutely maddening he had the plan on him the redrawn one he had looked at it with bill underground and hadnt given it back suppose mr eppy searched him he would most certainly find it how could he destroy it before he was searched it was you i suppose who met the farmboy yesterday and today too and took the food i had sent for said mr eppy a most extraordinary thing to do i am not pleased with things like that they make trouble for me well goodness gracious how in the world were we to know that the food was for you when we didnt know you were here and couldnt understand a word the boy said cried jack your boat wasnt in the creek we didnt know anyone else war visiting the island i came to the other creek said mr eppy but i shall not tell you where it is no not till you tell me where the others are and then when i have the plan maybe i say maybe i will set you free from this island all of you who have come to interfere with my plans youre mad said jack in disgust we havent come to interfere bill would be the first to say wed all go if he knew you had bought the island where are the others barked mr eppy suddenly somewhere about said jack indifferently why dont you look for them and dont shout at me like that im not lucian has this bill the plan asked mr eppy his voice getting sharper why dont you find him and ask him said jack call him see if he answers if im here why shouldnt he be mr eppy gave jack such a sudden box on the ears that the boy had no time to dodge it kiki almost got the slap too but rose into the air in time she pounced down on the angry man and gave his ear such a vicious nip that he yelled in agony jack suppressed a smile serve him right good old kiki the parrot sailed to a high branch and perched there scolding hard bad boy naughty boy grrrrr go to bed go to the doctor go to the weasel mr eppy said a sharp sentence to the three silent men behind jack in a thrice they had him pinioned by the arms laid flat on the ground then with a practised hand one of the men searched him he drew out the plan at once mr eppy took it jack could imagine how his eyes gleamed behind the dark glasses and so you had it said mr eppy he unfolded it and saw that it was not the original plan he looked at it closely what is this it is drawn by someone who has seen the other drawn for you it has been deciphered and translated find out for yourself said jack still lying on the ground he expected a kick or a blow but mr eppy was so intent on the redrawn plan that he did nothing jack remembered that the man had seen only two parts of the map before enough to tell him which island to come to and that there was treasure there he must now be studying the other parts with eager interest twofingers he muttered then he looked at jack twofingers he said that showed on the piece i saw before and i found the twofingered rock but there is no way through oh so that was your old battery we found in the hole i suppose said jack sitting up we wondered whose it was mr eppy did not answer or seem even to hear him he was studying the map again he was muttering something to himself twofingers goddesstomb bird bell labyrinth catacomb that is the route they took the whole of it then he began to mutter in greek and jack could no longer understand him lucian was still holding his hand up to his mouth and his face was tearstained kiki was down by him pecking at his shoelace oh i say she was repeating oh i say have you found the way at all demanded mr eppy what way said jack innocently pah the way to the treasurechamber spat mr eppy pah spat kiki at once pah ill wring that birds neck threatened mr eppy answer my question boy no we havent found the way said jack truthfully feeling quite glad that they had gone the wrong way and not the right one in their following of the route all the same he wondered if bill and the others had managed to find the way by now without him but surely they would have waited for him they must be wondering what in the wide world had happened to him jack hoped fervently that they wouldnt all come climbing out of the broken column if they did theyd be taken prisoner by mr eppy and his men and bill would find it extremely difficult to keep his secret in fact it wouldnt be any good his trying now mr eppy had the map once mr eppy knows the way down the broken column the treasure is as good as his thought jack what a good thing lucian didnt spot me getting out of it i only hope the others dont make a sudden appearance im sure they will soon but they didnt for the very simple reason that they had lost their way in the labyrinth they were still wandering about the passages getting more and more anxious they had lost jack and had lost their way too this awful maze said dinah in despair look bill im sure weve been in this passage before i remember the way this horrid piece juts out it knocked my elbow last time and this time too im sure its the same were going round and round and in and out and goodness knows whether were near the vault or near the catacomb groaned philip bill was very worried he stood and thought for a moment trying in vain to get a sense of direction it was so difficult underground he set off again and soon came to a fork well he said i vote we go right here it may be one of the places where were supposed to go right so well hope for the best come on they trailed after him lucyann getting very weary of it all they reached another fork and turned right once more then they came to where the passages branched into four ways again they took the righthand fork bill was feeling a little more cheerful perhaps they were on the right road now they no longer came to blind ends and had to turn back as they had been doing before ah here was another fork well to the right again the passage ended abruptly in a downward flight of steep steps bill swung the lantern up high and peered down the steps weve come the right way at last he said these must be the catacombs underground caves and passages all joined together that were once used as hidingplaces burialplaces and goodness knows what oh bill have we really come right said lucyann in joy i thought we were lost for ever and ever do we go down the steps we do said bill ill go first come on down he went and the others followed carefully there were about thirty steps and it seemed to the children as if they really were going down into the bowels of the earth at the end was a queer place stretching out into the darkness lining its walls were stone shelves rocky niches hollowedout places that looked as if they had been used for storing things in or for people to hide in and sleep they came to a hole in the floor of this queer place bill shone his torch down it it was a shaft leading downwards and there were footholds in the rock im going down said bill ive got a hunch this is the place he disappeared down the shaft with his torch and soon his voice came back excited and loud this is it this is the treasurechamber the treasures still here chapter treasure and trickery the three children and micky almost fell down the shaft they were in such a hurry they handed bill the lantern and by the light of that and of bills torch they looked in wonder round the curious treasurechamber it was perfectly round as if it had been hollowed by machinery from the rock though actually of course it had been done by hand thrown higgledypiggledy into this enormous round cave perhaps flung down the shaft in a hurry were mouldering barrels and boxes and brassbound chests bursting out of them was a perfect medley of strange and amazing goods chains of some kind of metal set with precious stone brooches armlets anklets combs for the hair made probably of gold and set with tiny stones beautiful vases of metal perhaps gold perhaps brass but too tarnished to tell beautifully wrought daggers lay in one corner and what looked like armour of some kind in another all fallen from the mouldered chests and boxes or possibly burst out of these when they were thrown down the shaft so long long ago there were broken models of figures and things that looked like drinkingcups and bowls and yet other things whose use the children simply couldnt guess well well well said bill as thrilled as the children what a treasure hoard andras treasure maybe we shall never really know but whether it is or not it is certainly worth half a small kingdom because of its priceless age look at this dagger it must be hundreds of years old perfectly preserved down in this dry shaft i should think only our museums can show things like this now bill its super said philip his eyes shining in the lanternlight as he picked up treasure after treasure everything beautifully modelled and carved i suppose the things like robes and cloaks and shoes have all mouldered away said dinah regretfully id like to have dressed up in those oh bill weve really found it i wish jack was here said lucyann with tears in her voice he would have loved it so where can he be bill i should think he probably took a long time finding kiki and decided he wouldnt risk coming after us by himself said bill ill tell you what well do well go back and find him and then well take him here to have a look at the greatest treasure in the world but shall we be able to find our way back said philip doubtfully bill was very doubtful about this too also his torch was giving out and he was sure the oil in the lantern wouldnt last much longer it was very necessary to find their way back pick up jack and also have something to eat excitement had kept them going but now all of them were feeling very hungry indeed if we manage to get back quickly and find jack well all have a meal said bill then if jacks lantern is all right well use that to come here again but this time well be sensible and mark the walls as we go along actually i think we could find our way here easily enough if we concentrated on going right right right all the time we must have missed one of the right turns they climbed back up the shaft leaving the extraordinary hidingplace behind them what a strange treasurechamber how old was it had anyone else seen it since it had been put there they found themselves in the catacombs again it was easy to get back to the steep flight of steps up they went into the labyrinth and began to make their way through the passages now we must keep left left left said bill then we shall be quite all right but no once more they missed their way and began the everlasting wandering round and round and in and out of the maddening underground maze lucyann was almost crying with weariness all this time micky had been quietly on philips shoulder clinging to his head at awkward places he too was tired of the curious dark walk that everyone was taking he wanted to be out in the open he wanted something to eat and even more he wanted something to drink he suddenly leapt off philips shoulder and landed on the floor of the passage he began to scud along by himself philip called out to him hey micky micky come here we dont want to lose you too micky slowed down but he still went on bill called to philip leave him philip i believe he knows the way out animals have a queer sense of direction you know a kind of homing instinct maybe he can take us straight to the broken column micky didnt know what bill was saying but if he had known he would most certainly have agreed of course he knew the way of course his instinct told him exactly the right way to go left left left without any silly mistake such as the humans had made why he micky could have taken them straight back to the vaults at any time if only they had told him they wanted to go well here we are in the vault again said philip thankfully when in a very short space of time indeed they came out in the enormous temple vault lucyann was so thankful that she began to cry very quietly to herself nobody could see she wiped away a few tears then stopped her crying feeling rather ashamed she slipped her hand into bills he squeezed it comfortingly were all right now he said weve found the treasure and found our way back now well find jack as we havent heard or seen anything of him i imagine hes out in the open waiting for us jack was still in the courtyard with mr eppy lucian and the three men it was some time later and the boy had not been having a nice time at all mr eppy had been on and on at him trying to find out where the others were and whether jack knew the route to the treasure he had threatened jack had boxed his ears several times and had boxed lucians too when he had tried to come to jacks help jack had been surprised at lucian for that he had always thought him such a silly little idiot he looked at lucian gratefully thanks lucian he said but dont interfere old chap youll only get hurt i can look after myself your uncle will get into trouble for illtreating me dont you worry jack had begun to feel extremely hungry so had the others presumably because mr eppy changed the subject suddenly and began asking jack where they had put the food they had got from the farmboy jack remembered perfectly well where it was inside the broken column on the stone ledge at the base of it where the stone stairway began but how could he say that it would give the secret away completely so he sat silent shaking his head to mr eppys exasperated questions getting more and more hungry and getting really rather anxious about the others too where in the world could they be the sun was going down already and soon it would be night and then kiki began to talk excitedly she left jack and flew to the broken edge of the hole in the column she peered down it jack bit his lip oh kiki kiki dont give the game away kiki had heard the others coming she had heard bills deep voice as he came up the spiral stairway she had heard lucyanns high voice just behind she had gone to welcome them kiki called jack come here shut the door shut the door wipe your feet beg your pardon shouted kiki excitedly her head inside the column and then an answering call came from inside too hallo kiki old bird so there you are wheres jack it was bills cheery deep voice mr eppy sprang to attention at once he gave a short sharp order to his three men and they ran to the column waiting jack gave a yell look out bill danger look out there was a silence from inside the column then bills voice came up again whats up mr epp began jack and was silenced as mr eppy placed a heavy and very rough hand over his mouth bill shouted again whats up as he got no reply he appeared at the hole in the column and swung himself astride the edge the men were at the other side hidden waiting to spring bill saw mr eppy apparently holding down jack and he leapt off the broken edge of the hole in the column at once the three men sprang on him and bore him to the ground one sat on his head so that he could not shout jack squirmed under mr eppys hand kicking and trying to bite but the man was very strong indeed then up the column came philip wondering what had happened to bill and when he saw him being well and truly sat on he sprang to his rescue mr eppy shouted a few words and the men released bill he sat up at once feeling his nose and wondering if any of his teeth were loose what on earth is all this he began but before he could go on a wail from inside the column came to him it was lucyann bill oh bill whats happened can we come out bill considered im going to help the girls out he said to mr eppy who nodded and very soon both girls and a very scared micky were standing in the old courtyard with philip jack and bill whats happened said lucyann oh im so glad to see you jack i was dreadfully worried about you gracious theres lucian oh i say said lucian trying to put a brave face on things fancy meeting you here mr eppy said something snappy in greek and poor lucian collapsed again then mr eppy turned to bill who was now eyeing him with a very sinister look indeed bill was extremely angry and his injured nose was swelling rapidly look here eppy or whatever your name is he said youre going to run into serious trouble you cant roam round with a posse of shady fellows like these acting like gangsters what are you doing here anyway its my island said mr eppy with a note of triumph in his voice ive bought it you can clear off when ive found the way to the treasure with your help otherwise i shall have you arrested for trespassing and for trying to steal what is mine youre mad said bill in scorn absolutely crazy i dont believe a word of it you only heard of the island a day or two ago you havent had time to buy it thats a wonderful tale but you wont get me to believe it now you keep your hands off all of us and behave yourself or youre the one thats going to land in prison and pretty quick too mr eppy gave an order and bill was pounced on again by the three men he was down on the ground in no time and one of the men was tying his wrists and ankles together bill was strong but his strength was no use against the three mr eppy had jack by the wrists so that he could not go to bills help and as soon as philip ran to help he was struck by one of the men and sent spinning lucyann began to cry with fright lucian did nothing he was trembling in a corner kiki and micky were high up in a tree watching in amazement what was all this todo kiki swooped down and gave mr eppy a nip on the ear again and he nearly let jack go the pain was so sharp after bill was tied up the boys were tied too dont touch the girls threatened bill if you do youll get more than you bargain for when we get out of here it was no use dinah and lucyann were also tied though not so tightly as the boys dinah was sulky and mutinous and lucyann was very frightened and now said mr eppy now we go to find the andra treasure my treasure you had only the plan i have the island and i shall soon own the treasure thank you for showing me the way down he went inside the column and the three men followed him lucian was beckoned over and made to go down just behind his uncle he looked very frightened well said bill of all the scoundrels can we possibly get free whilst theyre down there its our only chance chapter prisoners everyone waited till the last man had disappeared down the column then bill spoke well im blessed if ill ever look at a treasure map again or listen to anything you kids have to tell me its fatal we plunge into trouble immediately jack philip can you possibly loosen your ropes ive been trying said philip and jack said the same those beasts know how to tie knots all right the rope is biting into my ankles like anything and i can hardly move my hands all of them had their hands tied behind their backs and it was really impossible to get free bill rolled himself over and over to the girls he was very sorry for poor lucyann dinah was tougher more like a boy but lucyann couldnt help being scared lucyann dont be upset said bill ending up just by her well think of some wonderful way to get even with these rogues i hope theyll get lost in the labyrinth said jack fiercely still struggling with the rope that tied his wrists they probably will said bill in any case theyll be a long time gone we must somehow get free before they come back the first thing i do when i get free is to hop inside the column and get some of the food we put down there said jack thats if the brutes have left us any i bet theyve taken most of it with them bill privately thought they probably would have taken it but he didnt say so he gave up trying to loosen the rope round his wrists it only made it cut into his flesh unbearably he looked round to see if there was a sharp stone he could perhaps rub his ropes on he saw one and rolled over to it but as his hands were behind his back he couldnt see what he was doing and cut his fingers on the stone till they bled he gave it up kiki was up in the tree muttering to herself all the shouting and struggling had frightened her she cocked her head down at jack and decided it was safe to go to him she flew down and landed on his middle send for the doctor she said her head on one side send for the doctor mistersir good idea kiki said jack with an attempt at a grin tell him to come quickly telephone him at once kiki at once gave an imitation of a telephone bell ringing it sounded queer in that old ruined courtyard even lucyann gave a little laugh hallo hallo said kiki pleased at the attention she was getting hallo shes telephoning now grinned jack good old kiki got the doctor yet tell him were all suffering from a nasty attack of eppyitis micky leapt down from the tree to join in the fun he too had been badly scared but now that everyone was talking and laughing and the noisy men had gone he felt safer he landed on philip and tried to cuddle on to his shoulder philip was sitting up his hands tied behind him sorry i cant stroke you old thing and make a bit of fuss over you after your scare said the boy but my hands are tied yes thats right go and look for them ive still got them but theyre behind me micky badly wanted to be nursed but he couldnt find any arms to cuddle into he went behind philip to investigate what had the boy done with his hands and arms ah there they were behind him micky pulled at philips hands with his tiny paws he wanted to be stroked and patted sorry micky nothing doing said philip he grinned round at the others micky cant understand why i dont use my hands to pet him hes pulling at them micky had discovered the rope that bound philips wrists together he was puzzled what had philip done with this rope why was it so tightly round the boys hands micky tugged at the rope and pulled at the knot philip sat very still thats right micky he said in a caressing voice thats right you tackle those knots then i can pet you all you like everyone pricked up their ears at once they looked eagerly at philip i say philip is micky can micky do anything dont know said philip hes fiddling about like anything go it micky pull those knots undone but micky couldnt his tiny paws were not strong enough to undo the tightlytied knots of the rope he gave it up but he thought of something else he put his mouth down to the rope and tried to gnaw it with his teeth what are you doing micky cried philip feeling the wet little mouth against his wrist gosh bill the clever little thing is trying to gnaw through the rope now everyone watched philip intently his face showed clearly all he was thinking thats it micky bite away he said good little monkey no go away kiki dont interfere with micky kiki had gone to philip and was now getting behind him to see what micky was up to she watched him one two three go she said for all the world as if she was encouraging him come here kiki leave micky alone in his good work ordered jack and kiki came obediently hows micky getting on asked bill fine i think answered philip trying his hands to see if they felt any looser i think the rope does feel not quite so tight go it micky it was a long job but micky was patient and persevering once he knew that he was doing what philip wanted he went on and on bill marvelled at the way philip understood animals and animals understood him any creature would do anything in the world for philip theyre getting loose exclaimed philip go on micky just a bite or two more and sure enough after another bout of patient gnawing the rope snapped when philip pulled on it he brought his freed hands round to the front of him groaning my word theyre painful thanks micky old thing you did a very good job of work wait till my hands feel a bit better and ill pat you from head to tail the rope was still dangling from one of his wrists the knots in it tied as tightly as ever philip picked it off with the other hand he opened and shut his numb fingers and then proceeded to pet the little monkey who delighted to be fussed snuggled into philips arms with contented little grunts nobody hurried philip nobody begged him to be quick and undo their bonds everyone knew that it was right for micky to have his reward now thats enough old fellow said philip at last i must see to the others you come and help philip put micky on to his usual place on his shoulder he felt in his pocket for a knife his hands still felt queer and stiff but they were rapidly getting more life into them he brought out his knife and clicked it open he cut the rope round his ankles and then he tried to stand up his feet felt queer for his ankles had been tied very tightly but he was soon able to walk steadily he went straight over to the girls he cut their bonds with his knife and lucyann gave a groan of thankfulness oh philip thank you thats better dinah are your hands all right bit stiff and numb said dinah rubbing them together wouldnt i like to tie up mr eppy and wouldnt i make the ropes tight the brute he must be mad soon everyone was free bill found it hardest to stand because his ankles had been tied very viciously and so had his hands it took him some time to get the blood flowing freely in them and it was a very painful process at first everyone made a fuss over micky and the little monkey enjoyed it all thoroughly chattering softly jack kept an eye on kiki she was jealous and was looking out for a chance to nip mickys long tail ill tie you up if you try any tricks kiki warned jack and tapped her smartly on the beak she put her head under her wing muttering to herself poor polly poor polly dont sniff use your hanky shes irrepressible said bill still massaging his wrists well i feel better now what about some food lads if its still there of course jack was halfway to the column already he had to get philip to give him a good legup because his ankles still felt weak up he went and dropped down inside he looked about for the food it was dark inside the column now for the sun had gone he felt about and to his delight found some bread and what felt like cheese he called to philip look out philip im throwing the food out philip waited out came bread cheese and a packet of some kind of meat wait a bit heres some more bread shouted jack and out it came jack climbed out again grinning they must have been in such a hurry to get to the treasure that they didnt even stop for a snack he said they must have seen the food there bill is it safe to sit and have a meal asked lucyann anxiously quite safe said bill im going to sit here by the column and i shall be very sorry for anyone who tries to get out whilst im here chapter what happened in the night it was getting quite dark now the sun had gone a long time ago and the children could hardly see one another as they sat together in the courtyard munching hungrily ive never known bread and cheese to taste so lovely said dinah actually i didnt think this cheese was terribly nice yesterday sort of sweetish but today its heavenly only because youre so hungry said jack giving kiki some of his its goatmilk cheese isnt it bill i say look at micky stuffing himself pop goes micky remarked kiki coming in at the right moment as usual one two three pop idiot said jack well bill what are you thinking about quite a lot of things said bill soberly weve had an extraordinary day and im just planning what to do about it wasnt that treasure wonderful said lucyann her eyes shining jack had of course heard all about their adventures underground by now and was very envious because he was the only one who hadnt seen the treasurechamber with its remarkable collection of riches he had listened with amazement and had wished and wished he had been with the others what are your plans bill asked philip feeling that he could think sensibly again now that he was free and had had a good meal i suppose we cant do much tonight no we cant said bill thats quite certain weve been through enough today without taking on any more adventures besides the girls are nearly asleep poor things so they were excitement and exercise had completely tired them out lucyann lay cuddled against dinah her eyes closed well im pretty sleepy myself said jack he yawned loudly i wouldnt mind a nice long snooze anyway bill what could we do even if we wanted to do anything tonight asked philip beginning to yawn too we cant escape andros wont come back thats obvious if mr eppy has threatened him with prison after all hes only a simple boatman i expect mr eppy gave him plenty of money too to make up for us not having paid him yes money and threats combined would soon send andros away said bill in any case andros would know of course that mr eppy had his own boat here possibly two boats as he sent for more men and goods so we shouldnt be absolutely stranded as mr eppy could always bring us back gosh yes his boats must be somewhere mustnt they said philip waking up considerably weve only got to find them bill and were all right hadnt we better snoop round now before the others come back from underground no nothing more tonight said bill firmly ive already planned to do that tomorrow when we find mr eppys boat or boats well be all right i hope now listen im going to be on guard for the first four hours and after that you jack and then you philip will have a twohour watch and by that time it will be morning what are we going to watch for are we to wait for dear old eppy to pop his head out and say hallo there asked jack with a grin exactly said bill he had now lighted one of the lanterns and it gave a weird light to the scene you two boys are tired you wont be any good at watching till youve had a sleep you can have your turn when i wake you right said jack settling himself against philip well let the big tough guy watch first as a matter of fact i believe im asleep already what will you do if the others appear asked philip with interest knock them on the head as they come out of the hole probably said bill and he lighted his pipe you dont need to worry about that good night ill wake you in four hours time the two boys were asleep almost before he had finished his sentence the smell of bills tobacco wandered round the courtyard micky smelt it in his sleep and cuddled closer to philip he didnt like the smell of tobacco kiki was standing on jack her head under her wing the girls were absolutely still sleeping soundly although they had such an uncomfortable restingplace bill put out the lantern only the glow of his pipe shone in the courtyard now and again he was thinking hard he went over all the happenings of the last two days he considered mr eppys assertion that the island was his he puzzled over the whereabouts of the other creek where probably mr eppys boat or boats were he wondered how the little party underground was getting on he hoped fervently they were well and truly lost in the labyrinth he made his plans for the next day they would find the boats that would be the first thing where on earth would the creek be the second creek that andros had spoken about perhaps it would a noise stopped his thoughts at once he put down his pipe and stood up a silent figure close beside the broken column he listened the noise had come from underground he was sure of that well if it was the company coming back he was in for a wakeful night bill picked up a large piece of wood that he had had his eye on all the evening it had probably been part of a door or windowframe now it would make a very good weapon he stood by the column listening intently a scraping noise came up to him someone was climbing up the last part of the stone spiral the noise stopped the someone was evidently in the column now what was he doing he appeared to be feeling about for something the food thought bill with a grin well its gone a little whimper came up to him and then a shaking voice said in a low tone jack philip are you there why its lucian thought bill in astonishment well he cant be alone he listened again the whimpering began once more rather like a miserable dogs there was no sound of any other voice or of anyone else coming up the stairway bill made up his mind he leapt up to the broken edge of the hole in the column switched on his torch and looked down lucian was standing below him his terrified face looking up tears streaming down his cheeks he put up his hand as if he expected bill to aim a blow down at him lucian said bill what are you doing here where are the others i dont know wept poor lucian they only took me down as far as that vault place at the bottom of these steps they wouldnt let me go any further with them they told me to stay there till they came back and not stir my uncle said hed half kill me if he didnt find me waiting for them when they came back didnt they come back then said bill keeping his torch flashed onto lucians face no and its hours ago wept lucian i dont know whats happened to them and im so hungry and cold and tired and im frightened down there too i didnt dare to have my torch on all the time in case the battery gave out bill believed the frightened boy come on up he said here take my hand and jump go on lucian jump surely you can leap up here poor lucian couldnt in the end bill had to get into the column and shove him up to the hole even then lucian looked about to fall off he was in a terrible state of nerves at last he was safely down in the courtyard and bill gave him some bread and cheese he fell on it as if he hadnt eaten for a month a thought suddenly struck him i say how did you get free i mean werent you all tied up yes said bill grimly we were but fortunately for you we got free yes all of us the boys are asleep over there and the girls near by no dont wake them theyre tired out if wed all been tied up still you would have stayed in that column all night not a nice thought lucian no said lucian and shivered i wish i hadnt come to this horrible island whats going to happen are you going down to look for my uncle he must be completely lost you know he can stay lost as far as im concerned said bill in fact it will do him good your uncle is not a man ive any kindly feelings for at present no hes horrible agreed lucian once hed found the treasure hed planned to leave you stranded here all of you and go off by himself to get more men to come and remove it nice thoughtful fellow said bill well young man youd better get some sleep and tomorrow youre going to help us to make up for the misdeeds of your nastyminded uncle oh id be very very glad to help you said lucian at once i would really im on your side you know that yes i expect you are said bill youll have to be from now on anyway how can i help you tomorrow asked lucian by taking us to the creek where your uncles boats are said bill at once oh of course if only i remember where it is said lucian anxiously im not awfully good at remembering routes you know but i daresay ill remember that youll have to said bill grimly and now go to sleep no dont go over to the boys just stay where you are and mind if your precious uncle arrives during the night theres to be no warning to him from you otherwise some unpleasant things will happen to you oh i tell you im on your side now protested lucian and settled himself as comfortably as he could good night sir see you in the morning chapter next morning in four hours time bill awoke jack in a few sentences he told the surprised boy about the arrival of lucian he keeps saying hes on our side now but you never know with a nitwit like that he warned jack so keep your eye on him and if you hear the slightest sound from underground prod me awake at once jack right bill said jack fresh from his sound sleep i say theyve been a long time underground havent they they must be lost i sincerely hope so said bill i dont imagine they will be lost forever however desirable as that might be that labyrinth isnt a frightfully big one well im going to sleep jack keep your wits about you jack was still sleepy he was afraid he might find it difficult to keep awake so he lighted the lantern and walked about round the courtyard he shone the light on to lucian he was so fast asleep that he didnt even stir philip was soundly off too and as for the girls not an inch of their faces was to be seen they were cuddled up so closely to one another kiki accompanied jack on his rambles round the courtyard she knew she had to be quiet so she whispered all the time she wasnt very good at whispering and tickled jacks ear till he couldnt bear it any longer he took her off his shoulder and made her perch on one of his arms his two hours went by without anything happening at all he awoke philip it took a long time because the boy was so very sound asleep as fast as jack rolled him over to wake him he rolled back again his eyes still shut jack took off one of philips shoes and tickled the soles of his feet that woke him up all right philip sat straight up and glared round at the lantern jack held what are you he began in a loud voice and jack shushed him at once sh idiot youll wake the rest sorry about tickling your feet but i simply couldnt wake you its your turn to watch now philip put on his shoe saying something uncomplimentary to jack under his breath micky woke up too and looked in astonishment round the yard he had forgotten where he was jack told philip in whispers about lucians arrival philip was amused so old rabbitmouth is on our side now he said well hes not a bad sort really only hes such a nitwit poor lucian i guess he was scared out of his life right ill keep my eye on him though honestly he wouldnt have the nerve to do anything he shouldnt and if our dear mr eppy pops his head up out of the column i shall have the greatest pleasure in conking him good and hard jack grinned well im off to sleep again he said good hunting philip philips eyes persisted in closing as he sat there keeping watch he got up and walked about as jack had done it would be an unforgivable thing to sleep whilst he was on guard quite unthinkable he wondered what the time was and glanced at his watch the hands were phosphorescent and showed him the time five oclock or getting on that way he looked at the eastern sky it was already silvering with the dawn it was almost at the end of philips two hours that the noise came by this time the sun was up and the sunlight was on everything clean and new and beautiful philip was enjoying the warmth of the first slanting beams when he heard the noise he pricked his ears and micky began to chatter softly sh said philip i want to listen micky was silent at once the noise came again the scraping of boots on stone theyre coming thought philip and he ran to where bill was sleeping face down in the grass that grew over the yard bill wake up theyre coming bill woke up at once he sprang to his feet all sleep gone in an instant jack awoke too and so did the girls only lucian slept on but nobody took any notice of him bill ran to the column he took the big wedge of wood from philip stand back he said to the girls i dont expect for a moment ill have much trouble but you never know im not standing any nonsense from eppy and co he stationed himself just under the broken edge of the hole in the column he listened voices came up to him someone was evidently now standing inside the column having come up to the top of the spiral stairway bill heard what he said but couldnt understand it however he recognized mr eppys voice and took a firm hold of his piece of wood mr eppy stood still for a moment and listened to someone shouting up to him from the stairway below then he called up in a low voice lucian are you there lucian lucian was there but he was fast asleep so of course he didnt answer mr eppy called again softly lucian bill answered in a grim voice im here bill cunningham and im waiting for you mr eppy the moment you try to get out of there i shall force you back with this weapon bill banged his wedge of wood down on the column with such a noise that everyone jumped violently and lucian woke up there was a dead silence inside the column then there was a scraping noise as if someone else was coming up the stairway voices spoke together very low how did you get free came mr eppys voice again did lucian free you hes not here no he didnt said bill the voices spoke together again then mr eppy called up urgently mr cunningham my men tell me that they have just found poor lucian down here badly hurt he needs help let us come at once this was a most astonishing piece of news especially to lucian whose mouth fell open in amazement he was about to speak when jack nudged him to be quiet bill was handling this sorry to hear that mr eppy said bill hand him up and well look after him but you remain below thats definite another conference took place in low voices then mr eppy spoke again i must ask you to allow us to come up with the boy he is seriously hurt i am very distressed about him lucians face was a study dinah almost giggled as she watched him bill answered at once nothing doing nobody comes up except er lucian hand him over as lucian was even then sitting on the grass in the courtyard it was quite impossible for mr eppy to hand him over lucyann whispered to dinah isnt he a terrible storyteller bill began banging idly on the column with his wedge well you dont seem to want to part with lucian he called now i warn you if anyone appears at the hole in this column theyre for it bang bang that was bills piece of wood on the column again it couldnt please mr eppy very much he was not a brave man and it was easy to imagine his feelings down in the column can we have some food he called at last no shouted back bill hardheartedly there is barely enough for our breakfast judging by the scraping noises that could then be heard mr eppy and the others had decided to go back down the stairs and have a conference bill jerked his head at jack give out the food thats left to everyone im staying here in case any of these fellows try something funny i have a feeling theres a revolver or two among them so whatever happens i cant let them appear at the top jack and philip shared out the remaining food bill gulped down his share keeping eyes and ears open for any movement or sound from the broken column but there was none he beckoned the others over to him at the end of the rather unsatisfactory meal now listen he said in a low voice i must stay here you can see that what you have to do is to go with lucian and find the creek where the boat or boats are belonging to mr eppy be careful there are no men left in them there are two men with two boats said lucian this was disappointing news bill considered again well the thing to do first of all is to find the creek with the boats said bill dont show yourselves just find the creek so that we shall know the way then come back here well hope that farmboy arrives with more food at twelve oclock as he usually docs we could do with it said jack so could our dear mr eppy and his friends grinned philip bill what do we do after weve found the creek and the boats and come back to report we send lucian down with a message supposed to come from his uncle to tell the men to come along up here said bill and we pop down and go off in the boats but i say youll go on the rocks protested lucian at once you cant come to these islands without a boatman who knows them youll be wrecked this was a problem to be faced bill considered again well well have to make up our minds about that when the time comes in the meantime off you go lucian lead the way lucian looking rather doubtful went to the sloping city street he set off down it and turned off to the left halfway down you seem to know the way all right said jack approvingly lucian looked at him uneasily i dont he said im absolutely no good at this kind of thing i never can find my way anywhere ive no bump of locality at all i shall never find the boats chapter unexpected visitors lucian was perfectly right he didnt know the way and he couldnt find the boats he was completely hopeless he simply wandered here and there making towards the sea but arriving at a rocky beach where no boats could possibly lie youre a mutt said jack in disgust mutt said kiki pleased with the word mutty send for the doctor nobody smiled even at this they were all too disappointed and disgusted with poor lucian he looked ready to cry its not my fault he said with a sniff if id known it was going to be so important id have taken careful note of the way but i didnt know now look here if you start to blub again ill park you down a rabbithole and stuff it up with seaweed said jack in disgust lucian looked alarmed i would remember if i could he said dismally but i do tell you this nobody can come or go from these islands in a boat without a seaman who knows the way there are hundreds of rocks just below the surface of the sea even an experienced seaman finds it difficult i know because ive so often visited them with my uncle jack looked at him well i believe you about that he said i shouldnt care to navigate a boat myself without a sailor who knew the way gosh were really beaten now no boats and if we had them wed probably wreck ourselves a very poor outlook indeed lucyann immediately had a vision of themselves and mr eppy and his friends remaining on thamis island for years and years she sighed i wish id never bought that ship in a bottle for philip she said if id known it was going to bring us such an adventure id have thrown it away they began to make their way back to the city as they went jack stopped and looked up at the sky whats that noise he said sounds like an aeroplane they all stopped then and listened looking for the plane soon it came in sight a small speck coming in from the north pity we cant make a signal of distress said dinah anyway im going to wave my hanky she took out a small hanky and much to the others amusement waved it wildly in the air do you really suppose for one moment that the plane can see your dirty little hanky and would come down here if it did demanded philip you never know said dinah still waving vigorously youre daft said philip and dinah gave him one of her best scowls leaving her waving madly the others went on still keeping an eye on the plane which by now was over the island it flew over it and then made a wide circuit and flew back its seen my hanky shrieked dinah its coming back dont be an ass said philip but the plane certainly had come back and what was more it was coming down low too making another circuit of the whole island as it flew theres a flat space over there look look screamed dinah to the plane as if she really thought it could hear her come down there oh dont pass it the plane swooped down still lower and came round again it seemed to see the flat place that dinah had yelled about and it came down neatly as slowly as it could its wheels touched the ground and for one awful moment it looked as if the rough ground was going to tip the plane over on its nose but it righted itself and came to a stop dinah looked at the others with flushed cheeks there you are it saw my hanky and it heard my yell the others were staring in delight at the plane it cant be friends of mr eppys cried philip it must be someone sent to look for us come on their feet flew along over the rough paths they saw two men getting out of the plane they waved to the children and went to meet them lucyanns sharp eyes recognized them first its tim she squealed tim bills friend and isnt that andros the boatman with him she was right it was tim and beside him was a rather shamefaced andros tim hailed them hallo hallo wheres bill are you all safe andros here came to me with such a wild story i had to come along and investigate yes bills all right cried jack and he pumped tims arm up and down in sheer delight at seeing him i say its good to see you did andros really come and tell you about us he told me a most extraordinary tale said tim he apparently chewed it over for a day or so and then decided hed better tell someone when he saw me down at the quayside trying to spot you all he recognized me and came up he said that he took you to thamis and dropped you there then he fell asleep waiting for you thats right said jack and then someone came and woke him up in a hurry and told him hed no right to be there and threatened him with prison said tim andros replied that hed left a party there a man and four children a parrot and a monkey and this fellow raved at him said it was his own island and if andros didnt clear out then and there hed have him arrested straight away mr eppy in a rage evidently said jack andros then pointed out that he hadnt been paid and this fellow poured money into his hands and then pointed a revolver at him so andros fled comforting himself by thinking that as the fellow had a boat somewhere he could at least bring you all off in his own good time that right andros i not understand all mister sir said andros bad man here very bad andros very sorry mister sir well now you tell your tale said tim to jack so between them the children poured out their story and it was such an astonishing one that tim listened openmouthed good gracious what a tale he had never heard anything like it in his life he soon grasped everything and grinned to think of old bill standing patiently by the broken column waiting for mr eppy or his men to come out and be dealt with i wouldnt mind dealing with them myself said the young man cheerfully biff thud kerplonk very nice too oh tim you do make me laugh said lucyann with a giggle i wonder if bill has been doing any biffing well if he has i hope its mr eppy thats getting the biffs to say nothing of the kerplonks said tim cheerfully well now whats our plan to be weve got to find the other creek and the boats said jack thats the first thing to do then weve got to get the two men out of the way the ones who are with the boats then somehow weve got to get the boats going and sail off safely without being wrecked on the rocks well andros will know where the creek is in fact i know myself said tim i saw it from the plane and saw the boats there too and andros and i will account for the two men all right no we know a better way than that to get them out of the way said philip and he told tim his plan to send lucian to them with a fake message tim nodded yes thats better really saves a lot of rough stuff not that i mind that but im not sure about our friend here hes not made of such stern stuff as he might be i think wed better get back and see bill before we do anything said jack and anyway we dont want to get the two boatmen out of the way yet and turn them on to old bill that wouldnt be a very good plan come on lets get back to bill so off they all went kiki chattering merrily knowing that the children were now feeling very much more cheerful mistersir she said to andros mistersir mister they got back to the temple courtyard and bill stared in surprise to see tim hallo he said well well well so it was your plane i saw coming over the island i couldnt see it come down from here but i hoped it had bit of luck your meeting with the children i suppose theyve told you all the news yes rather grinned tim pretty adventurous lot arent you any trouble with the chappies down the column just a biff or two a little while ago said bill not on mr eppys head unfortunately one of the other fellows i fear i havent heard so much as the flick of an eyelid since the sound of a bell came echoing up the ruined street dongdongdong pussys down the well screeched kiki suddenly remembering dingdongbell who put her in who put her in what on earths that bell asked tim startled are we late for school or what dont be silly said lucyann laughing thats our food it comes every day regularly at this time and im jolly glad im still hungry after our poor breakfast tim was amazed to see the imp of a boy coming along with the panniered donkey bill didnt leave his post by the column but handed out money to jack to pay for the food the boy emptied the panniers winked at tim and spat rudely at micky the monkey immediately spat back and his aim was a lot better than the boys pah said the little imp in disgust pah echoed kiki pooh dongdongdong pop goes the pah the boy gave her a look of amazement and climbed on his donkeys back he sent a stream of gibberish at kiki who copied him at once ending with one of her pistolshots the donkey reared in fright and then galloped off with the boy at top speed youll be the death of me one day kiki said bill weak with laughing now then hand out the food jack and i suppose wed better throw a bit down the column or our friends below will starve to death fortunately the boy had brought a great deal of food so there was plenty for everyone bill yelled down the column in a stentorian voice if you want food theres some coming but dont try any funny tricks or you wont get any more somebody evidently came up to get the bread cheese and meat that bill threw down he also threw some fruit feeling that the men must be as thirsty as he was there was no word of thanks from anyone in the column and no sound after the food had been taken wonder if they found the treasure said jack munching hard wish id seen it i bet i shant now and if i dont itll be the disappointment of my life chapter escape plans were made whilst they ate tim i want you to take the two girls off in your plane said bill i dont want them exposed to danger here one moment longer than necessary andros once we have got rid of the two men down in the boats you are to take charge of the better boat of the two and go off with the rest of us what bill do you mean to say were going to leave a boat for these scoundrels to escape in cried jack indignantly no im going to ask andros if he will kindly remove some small thing from the engine of the other boat so that it wont start up when the men want it to said bill with a laugh i think it would be a very good thing to leave them here prisoners till we report them and find out whether mr eppy has bought the island or not if he has hes in a strong position of course and nothing we say will be listened to with much attention hes always buying and selling islands put in lucian i expect he has bought this all right hes well known for that you may be right said bill do you want to come with us lucian or stay and welcome your uncle out of the column there was no doubt about what lucian wanted to do he was going with bill and the others they all felt a lot better after the meal tim set off for the plane with the two girls who hugged bill before they went and begged him to keep himself safe i shant set off in the plane till i hear your motorboat starting up and going off said tim goodbye for the present come on girls what people are going to say when i land with you at the airport i cannot imagine youre too dirty for anything regular little grubs andros lucian jack and philip set off for the boats it was decided that only lucian should go right up to the boats and give the fake message he was to say that the men were wanted up in the temple courtyard and give them directions as to how to get there as soon as bill spotted them coming he was to leave the broken column where he was on guard and go to the boats keeping himself out of sight of the two men then well be into one of the boats in a jiffy and off and away said jack joyfully what a sell for mr eppy andros led the way he knew the other creek well though he did not consider it so good as the one he had landed in when they got near to the boats lucian went on alone whilst the others hid themselves behind bushes lucian was nervous but tried not to show it he went up to the boats and shouted loudly ahoy there where are you the two men appeared lucian began to say something loudly in greek and the two men nodded they leapt from the boat to the beach and made their way up the shore lucian was telling them where to go pointing this way and that well i hope hes telling them correctly thought jack remembering how hopeless lucian had been at trying to find the way to the boats that morning lets hope he has been more careful at marking the way this time the men soon disappeared andros raced to the boats he chose the smaller one of the two as being the better he went to the other boat and tinkered with the engine he withdrew something from it and threw it into the other boat where it fell with a thud he grinned at the boys that boat no good now he said engine dead we get in here quick they all got in andros tinkered about with the engine there too it started up quickly and he stopped it at once the boys wondered how old bill was getting on had he spotted the men was he even now coming down to the boat keeping himself unseen they hoped so suddenly they heard shouts and they all sat up straight in their boat what was that bill was tearing down to the shore at top speed behind him were the two men also running at top speed andros acted quickly he started up the engine at once and called to the boys to give a hand to bill when he came red in the face and panting hard bill tore up to the boat willing hands dragged him in and almost as he touched the deck of the boat it was off and away its engine making a terrific noise in the calm of the little creek the two men leapt into the other boat at once shouting angrily andros gave a malicious grin bill saw it and knew what it meant the other boat was useless no amount of trying would make the second boat start up its engine was dead the two men realized that andros must have tampered with it and they stood up shaking their fists and shouting unintelligibly jack and philip enjoyed it all thoroughly but poor lucian was as white as a sheet well were off said bill getting his breath again gosh i had a narrow escape i was watching for the men and they came on me unawares they must have guessed there was some trickery about because they suddenly made a beeline for me and gave me a jolly hard run i was glad id got all directions from andros as to where the creek was i nearly missed my way as it was any sound from eppy and co asked jack bill shook his head no but theyll have heard the shouts and i expect theyll be out of the column by now and having a good snoop round theyll join up with the other two men and then mr eppy will have a few choice things to say to the two men who left the boats and so gave us the means of escape i expect he is thinking of quite a lot of things to say to lucian too for giving them that fake message lucian gave a feeble smile he was still very white i shall get a fearful beating he said you wont said bill ill see to that ill give your uncle something to think about when i get back to the airport island hes going to find himself in hot water very very soon i dont care whether hes bought the island or not hes a rogue the sound of an aeroplanes engine attracted their attention its tims plane cried jack and he stood up in the motorboat and waved ahoy there tim the plane swooped down low and kiki gave a squawk of terror micky hid his head under philips arm the boys cheered and yelled goodbye good luck tim hallo there girls at about six oclock in the evening the motorboat arrived at the airport island the first thing they saw was the viking star in the harbour still lying silent the second thing they saw was tim on the quayside and the girls with him they had landed a long time ago had had a good meal and then had come down to the quay to wait for the others ive been to the police said tim told the chief you had something to report and would he please not go home till hed seen you hes all hot and bothered it isnt often anything happens here bill laughed well i expect the report will really have to go to the mainland to be dealt with but as andros comes from here and mr eppy hired his boats from here and presumably saw lawyers here if he bought the island its best to see the chief of police of this island the chief was a small birdlike man with an intelligent face and quick darting eyes he spoke english very well he was thrilled to think there might be some important news for him he listened intently to bills remarkable story asking a few questions now and again the children added little bits when the inspector heard of the treasure he almost fell off his chair we must find out if this man eppy did buy the island he said i know him he is always buying islands and selling them i do not like him he is crazy a good deal of telephoning then went on with a few hallos from a rather bored kiki and some mistersirs and one two three pops at last the little man turned to bill his face beaming paul eppy did try to buy the island but it is not for sale it is not his it belongs to our government good said all the children together what a sell for mr eppy said dinah i hope he will not get away with any of that unique treasure said the inspector he is not an honest man he cant said jack with a grin andros tampered with the only motorboat there he cant use it hes a prisoner there and so are all the rest of them good i think that is very good beamed the birdlike man he turned to bill if you will be kind enough to put in a report sir a detailed one for me to forward to the mainland i would be very much obliged the children should read it and sign it and andros here should sign the part of it that refers to his doings in the matter right said bill and got up to go well thats that ive had some thrilling adventures with these four but this beats the lot i only wish we could have a bit of that treasure sir you shall said the inspector earnestly i will see to it personally my government will be very honoured to allow you to choose what you want from it a carved dagger for me said philip at once gosh what would the boys at school say come along said bill well go on board the viking star and take tim to dinner there with us i want a good bath a good shave a good meal and a good sleep in a comfortable bed and off they all went on board the viking star happy and excited talking nineteen to the dozen chapter happy ending after all in the night the viking star sailed once more bill didnt hear the engines starting up nor did any of the five children kiki woke up poked her head out from under her wing and then put it back again it was astonishing to find themselves at sea once more they were making for italy oh dear weve left the treasure island far behind said lucyann mournfully dont be a humbug said jack you know youre jolly glad you escaped from it yes i know that said lucyann but i just hate leaving all that treasure i never even saw it jack reminded her i feel ive been done out of something all because that idiot of a kiki took it into her head to fly off my shoulder just as we were going to look for the treasure nitwit nitwit echoed kiki pleasantly titbit she flew down and looked at a plate of grapes no you dont said jack and removed it from her no titbits for a nitwit and anyway youve helped yourself to about two hundred grapes already youre a greedy pig kiki i suppose the rest of this cruise will be as dull as ditchwater said philip he glanced at the little carved ship on the dressingtable of his cabin golly werent we thrilled when we found the treasure map inside bill says weve got to give that up to the greek museum but we can keep the redrawn map the one we used if we can get it back from mr eppy i wonder what mother will say to all this said dinah suddenly she wont be a bit pleased with bill will she shell never speak to him again well that would mean wed never even see him again said lucyann horrified at the thought i simply love bill i wish he was my father its horrid not having a father or a mother youre lucky you and philip dinah you have got a mother even if you havent a father well you share our mother with us dont you said philip at once you call her aunt allie and she treats you as if she was your mother yes i know shes a darling said lucyann and said no more she was worrying about bill suppose aunt allie really kept her word and refused to speak to bill again because he had taken them into danger that really would be dreadful it was maddening to sail away from all the romantic little islands just as they had had such an adventure all the children longed to know what had happened after they had left what did mr eppy do what happened to him how did he eventually get off the island or was he still there and what about the treasure that fabulous amazing treasure hidden in the round treasurechamber deep down in the heart of the old ruined city bill promised to let them know all he heard and he was as curious as the children the viking star put in at naples and then went on to spain it was there that bill got the first news he came straight to the children well youll be glad to know that eppy and co couldnt get off the island and almost went mad with rage about it then that police inspector chap sent a boat there and whats more went in it himself and had the whole lot arrested then and there what a shock for mr eppy what about the treasure asked dinah eagerly its all been brought out of the round rockchamber and is being sent to the mainland to be examined and valued a list of the things will be sent to us and we are each to choose a memento gosh said jack ill have a dagger like philip then i bet the girls will have jewellery is it the andra treasure asked lucyann they seem to think so said bill all their eyes went to the little ship on the dressingtable there it stood its sails set its greek name showing on its side the andra what a ship of adventure it had been whats going to happen about lucian asked dinah lucian was still on the viking star but with them not with his aunt and uncle this time his aunt in hysterical tears had remained on the airport island to be with her husband bill had offered to take lucian back to england and park him with a school friend till it was time for him to return to his school lucian is to go to other relations in future for the holidays said bill that is unless we can occasionally put up with him i feel sorry for that lad there was a silence its awful when you feel youve got to do something you dont like doing just because youre sorry for someone said lucyann with a sigh i dont know whether aunt allie will like to have him anyway and oh bill do you think shes going to be very cross with you about all this this adventure i mean yes i think she is said bill i telephoned her from italy and told her a little perhaps i should have waited till we saw her she wasnt at all pleased oh dear we shant have a very nice time the rest of the hols said lucyann i dont like it when aunt allie is upset or cross shell be tired too after looking after her aunt polly i do wish this adventure was going to have a nice end not a nasty one everyone was quite glad when at last the viking star arrived at southampton at the end of her long cruise after the exciting adventure in the middle of it things had seemed very tame and dull it was lovely to be on firm land again going home aunt allie was not going to meet them she was leaving her aunt the day before and going home to get things ready for the family lucian was to be left with a school friend of his on the way they were all going home in bills car the boy was sad to say goodbye when the time came he stammered and stuttered as he held out his hand to each of them in turn goodbye er i do hope ill sssee you all again ive had er er a lovely time and er im sorry for anything i did you didnt like and er ererer copied kiki in delight pah send for the doctor erererererer shut up kiki and behave yourself said jack vexed but lucian didnt mind i shall miss old kiki he said and micky too goodbye micky er think of me sometimes all of you he almost ran from them and lucyann stared after him rather distressed poor old lucian he was almost crying she said hes really rather a nice old er nice old nitwit said everyone and kiki yelled out too nitwit send for the doctor well hes nice for a nitwit then said lucyann she settled down in the car again now for home and dear old aunt allie ive got a frightfully big hug saved up for her mrs mannering was delighted to see them all though she was rather cool to bill she had a wonderful tea ready for them and kiki screeched with delight to see a plate laid for her and micky with a lovely fruit salad one two three go she said and settled down to eat keeping an eye on mickys plate hoping she could snatch a titbit from it after tea they all sat in the comfortable sittingroom and bill lighted his pipe he looked rather gloomy the children thought well allie he began i suppose you want to hear it all the hunt for the andra treasure and all that happened we had some jolly narrow escapes said jack fondling kiki and youll be glad to know aunt allie that kiki got two grand nips at mr eppys ear they began their tale mrs mannering listened in amazement her eyes went continually to the little carved ship on the mantelpiece put proudly there by philip as soon as he reached home there said philip when they had finished their tale what do you think of that mrs mannering didnt answer she looked at bill he wouldnt meet her eyes but knocked out his pipe very hard on the fender oh bill said mrs mannering sadly you promised me and you broke your word i shall never trust you again you promised faithfully not to lead the children into any kind of adventure again i wouldnt have asked you to look after them if i hadnt trusted you i cant trust you any more aunt allie what do you mean you cant trust bill any more cried lucyann indignantly and she went to bill and put her arms round him cant you see hes the nicest most trustable person in the whole world mrs mannering couldnt help laughing oh lucyann youre very fierce all of a sudden its just that every time i leave you alone with bill you get into horrible danger you know you do well why cant you and bill always be with us together demanded lucyann i dont see why you cant marry each other then wed always have bill and you could keep an eye on him to see he doesnt lead us into adventures bill exploded into an enormous shout of laughter mrs mannering smiled broadly the others looked at one another i say said philip eagerly thats a wizard idea of lucyanns wed have a father then all of us gosh fancy having bill for a father wouldnt the other boys envy us bill stopped laughing and looked soberly round at the four beaming children then he looked at mrs mannering he raised his eyebrows enquiringly well allie he said in a curiously quiet voice do you think its a good idea too she looked at him and then smiled round at the eager children she nodded yes its really a very good idea bill im surprised weve never thought of it before thats settled then said bill ill take these four kids on and youll see to it i dont lead them into any more adventures allie is that agreed well this adventure had a wonderful ending after all said lucyann drawing a deep breath her eyes shone like stars good old bill oh im so happy now god save the king said kiki excitedly polly put the doctor on send for the kettle pop goes bill the end
