the problem of thor bridge somewhere in the vaults of the bank of cox and co at charing cross there is a travelworn and battered tin dispatchbox with my name john h watson m d late indian army painted upon the lid it is crammed with papers nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which mr sherlock holmes had at various times to examine some and not the least interesting were complete failures and as such will hardly bear narrating since no final explanation is forthcoming a problem without a solution may interest the student but can hardly fail to annoy the casual reader among these unfinished tales is that of mr james phillimore who stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella was never more seen in this world no less remarkable is that of the cutter alicia which sailed one spring morning into a small patch of mist from where she never again emerged nor was anything further ever heard of herself and her crew a third case worthy of note is that of isadora persano the wellknown journalist and duellist who was found stark staring mad with a match box in front of him which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science apart from these unfathomed cases there are some which involve the secrets of private families to an extent which would mean consternation in many exalted quarters if it were thought possible that they might find their way into print i need not say that such a breach of confidence is unthinkable and that these records will be separated and destroyed now that my friend has time to turn his energies to the matter there remain a considerable residue of cases of greater or less interest which i might have edited before had i not feared to give the public a surfeit which might react upon the reputation of the man whom above all others i revere in some i was myself concerned and can speak as an eyewitness while in others i was either not present or played so small a part that they could only be told as by a third person the following narrative is drawn from my own experience it was a wild morning in october and i observed as i was dressing how the last remaining leaves were being whirled from the solitary plane tree which graces the yard behind our house i descended to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits for like all great artists he was easily impressed by his surroundings on the contrary i found that he had nearly finished his meal and that his mood was particularly bright and joyous with that somewhat sinister cheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter moments you have a case holmes i remarked the faculty of deduction is certainly contagious watson he answered it has enabled you to probe my secret yes i have a case after a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once more might i share it there is little to share but we may discuss it when you have consumed the two hardboiled eggs with which our new cook has favoured us their condition may not be unconnected with the copy of the family herald which i observed yesterday upon the halltable even so trivial a matter as cooking an egg demands an attention which is conscious of the passage of time and incompatible with the love romance in that excellent periodical a quarter of an hour later the table had been cleared and we were face to face he had drawn a letter from his pocket you have heard of neil gibson the gold king he said you mean the american senator well he was once senator for some western state but is better known as the greatest goldmining magnate in the world yes i know of him he has surely lived in england for some time his name is very familiar yes he bought a considerable estate in hampshire some five years ago possibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife of course i remember it now that is why the name is familiar but i really know nothing of the details holmes waved his hand towards some papers on a chair i had no idea that the case was coming my way or i should have had my extracts ready said he the fact is that the problem though exceedingly sensational appeared to present no difficulty the interesting personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the evidence that was the view taken by the coroners jury and also in the policecourt proceedings it is now referred to the assizes at winchester i fear it is a thankless business i can discover facts watson but i cannot change them unless some entirely new and unexpected ones come to light i do not see what my client can hope for your client ah i forgot i had not told you i am getting into your involved habit watson of telling a story backward you had best read this first the letter which he handed to me written in a bold masterful hand ran as follows claridges hotel october rd dear mr sherlock holmes i cant see the best woman god ever made go to her death without doing all that is possible to save her i cant explain things i cant even try to explain them but i know beyond all doubt that miss dunbar is innocent you know the facts who doesnt it has been the gossip of the country and never a voice raised for her its the damned injustice of it all that makes me crazy that woman has a heart that wouldnt let her kill a fly well ill come at eleven tomorrow and see if you can get some ray of light in the dark maybe i have a clue and dont know it anyhow all i know and all i have and all i am are for your use if only you can save her if ever in your life you showed your powers put them now into this case yours faithfully j neil gibson there you have it said sherlock holmes knocking out the ashes of his afterbreakfast pipe and slowly refilling it that is the gentleman i await as to the story you have hardly time to master all these papers so i must give it to you in a nutshell if you are to take an intelligent interest in the proceedings this man is the greatest financial power in the world and a man as i understand of most violent and formidable character he married a wife the victim of this tragedy of whom i know nothing save that she was past her prime which was the more unfortunate as a very attractive governess superintended the education of two young children these are the three people concerned and the scene is a grand old manor house the centre of a historical english state then as to the tragedy the wife was found in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house late at night clad in her dinner dress with a shawl over her shoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain no weapon was found near her and there was no local clue as to the murder no weapon near her watson mark that the crime seems to have been committed late in the evening and the body was found by a gamekeeper about eleven oclock when it was examined by the police and by a doctor before being carried up to the house is this too condensed or can you follow it clearly it is all very clear but why suspect the governess well in the first place there is some very direct evidence a revolver with one discharged chamber and a calibre which corresponded with the bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe his eyes fixed and he repeated in broken words on the floor of her wardrobe then he sank into silence and i saw that some train of thought had been set moving which i should be foolish to interrupt suddenly with a start he emerged into brisk life once more yes watson it was found pretty damning eh so the two juries thought then the dead woman had a note upon her making an appointment at that very place and signed by the governess hows that finally there is the motive senator gibson is an attractive person if his wife dies who more likely to succeed her than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing attentions from her employer love fortune power all depending upon one middleaged life ugly watson very ugly yes indeed holmes nor could she prove an alibi on the contrary she had to admit that she was down near thor bridge that was the scene of the tragedy about that hour she couldnt deny it for some passing villager had seen her there that really seems final and yet watson and yet this bridge a single broad span of stone with balustraded sides carries the drive over the narrowest part of a long deep reedgirt sheet of water thor mere it is called in the mouth of the bridge lay the dead woman such are the main facts but here if i mistake not is our client considerably before his time billy had opened the door but the name which he announced was an unexpected one mr marlow bates was a stranger to both of us he was a thin nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes and a twitching hesitating manner a man whom my own professional eye would judge to be on the brink of an absolute nervous breakdown you seem agitated mr bates said holmes pray sit down i fear i can only give you a short time for i have an appointment at eleven i know you have our visitor gasped shooting out short sentences like a man who is out of breath mr gibson is coming mr gibson is my employer i am manager of his estate mr holmes he is a villain an infernal villain strong language mr bates i have to be emphatic mr holmes for the time is so limited i would not have him find me here for the world he is almost due now but i was so situated that i could not come earlier his secretary mr ferguson only told me this morning of his appointment with you and you are his manager i have given him notice in a couple of weeks i shall have shaken off his accursed slavery a hard man mr holmes hard to all about him those public charities are a screen to cover his private iniquities but his wife was his chief victim he was brutal to her yes sir brutal how she came by her death i do not know but i am sure that he had made her life a misery to her she was a creature of the tropics a brazilian by birth as no doubt you know no it had escaped me tropical by birth and tropical by nature a child of the sun and of passion she had loved him as such women can love but when her own physical charms had faded i am told that they once were great there was nothing to hold him we all liked her and felt for her and hated him for the way that he treated her but he is plausible and cunning that is all i have to say to you dont take him at his face value there is more behind now ill go no no dont detain me he is almost due with a frightened look at the clock our strange visitor literally ran to the door and disappeared well well said holmes after an interval of silence mr gibson seems to have a nice loyal household but the warning is a useful one and now we can only wait till the man himself appears sharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon the stairs and the famous millionaire was shown into the room as i looked upon him i understood not only the fears and dislike of his manager but also the execrations which so many business rivals have heaped upon his head if i were a sculptor and desired to idealize the successful man of affairs iron of nerve and leathery of conscience i should choose mr neil gibson as my model his tall gaunt craggy figure had a suggestion of hunger and rapacity an abraham lincoln keyed to base uses instead of high ones would give some idea of the man his face might have been chiselled in granite hardset craggy remorseless with deep lines upon it the scars of many a crisis cold gray eyes looking shrewdly out from under bristling brows surveyed us each in turn he bowed in perfunctory fashion as holmes mentioned my name and then with a masterful air of possession he drew a chair up to my companion and seated himself with his bony knees almost touching him let me say right here mr holmes he began that money is nothing to me in this case you can burn it if its any use in lighting you to the truth this woman is innocent and this woman has to be cleared and its up to you to do it name your figure my professional charges are upon a fixed scale said holmes coldly i do not vary them save when i remit them altogether well if dollars make no difference to you think of the reputation if you pull this off every paper in england and america will be booming you youll be the talk of two continents thank you mr gibson i do not think that i am in need of booming it may surprise you to know that i prefer to work anonymously and that it is the problem itself which attracts me but we are wasting time let us get down to the facts i think that you will find all the main ones in the press reports i dont know that i can add anything which will help you but if there is anything you would wish more light upon well i am here to give it well there is just one point what is it what were the exact relations between you and miss dunbar the gold king gave a violent start and half rose from his chair then his massive calm came back to him i suppose you are within your rights and maybe doing your duty in asking such a question mr holmes we will agree to suppose so said holmes then i can assure you that our relations were entirely and always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with or ever saw save when she was in the company of his children holmes rose from his chair i am a rather busy man mr gibson said he and i have no time or taste for aimless conversations i wish you goodmorning our visitor had risen also and his great loose figure towered above holmes there was an angry gleam from under those bristling brows and a tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks what the devil do you mean by this mr holmes do you dismiss my case well mr gibson at least i dismiss you i should have thought my words were plain plain enough but whats at the back of it raising the price on me or afraid to tackle it or what ive a right to a plain answer well perhaps you have said holmes ill give you one this case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with without the further difficulty of false information meaning that i lie well i was trying to express it as delicately as i could but if you insist upon the word i will not contradict you i sprang to my feet for the expression upon the millionaires face was fiendish in its intensity and he had raised his great knotted fist holmes smiled languidly and reached his hand out for his pipe dont be noisy mr gibson i find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling i suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage with an effort the gold king mastered his fury i could not but admire him for by a supreme selfcommand he had turned in a minute from a hot flame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indifference well its your choice i guess you know how to run your own business i cant make you touch the case against your will youve done yourself no good this morning mr holmes for i have broken stronger men than you no man ever crossed me and was the better for it so many have said so and yet here i am said holmes smiling well goodmorning mr gibson you have a good deal yet to learn our visitor made a noisy exit but holmes smoked in imperturbable silence with dreamy eyes fixed upon the ceiling any views watson he asked at last well holmes i must confess that when i consider that this is a man who would certainly brush any obstacle from his path and when i remember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of dislike as that man bates plainly told us it seems to me exactly and to me also but what were his relations with the governess and how did you discover them bluff watson bluff when i considered the passionate unconventional unbusinesslike tone of his letter and contrasted it with his selfcontained manner and appearance it was pretty clear that there was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman rather than upon the victim weve got to understand the exact relations of those three people if we are to reach the truth you saw the frontal attack which i made upon him and how imperturbably he received it then i bluffed him by giving him the impression that i was absolutely certain when in reality i was only extremely suspicious perhaps he will come back he is sure to come back he must come back he cant leave it where it is ha isnt that a ring yes there is his footstep well mr gibson i was just saying to dr watson that you were somewhat overdue the gold king had reentered the room in a more chastened mood than he had left it his wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes but his common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would attain his end ive been thinking it over mr holmes and i feel that i have been hasty in taking your remarks amiss you are justified in getting down to the facts whatever they may be and i think the more of you for it i can assure you however that the relations between miss dunbar and me dont really touch this case that is for me to decide is it not yes i guess that is so youre like a surgeon who wants every symptom before he can give his diagnosis exactly that expresses it and it is only a patient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his case that may be so but you will admit mr holmes that most men would shy off a bit when they are asked pointblank what their relations with a woman may be if there is really some serious feeling in the case i guess most men have a little private reserve of their own in some corner of their souls where they dont welcome intruders and you burst suddenly into it but the object excuses you since it was to try and save her well the stakes are down and the reserve open and you can explore where you will what is it you want the truth the gold king paused for a moment as one who marshals his thoughts his grim deeplined face had become even sadder and more grave i can give it to you in a very few words mr holmes said he at last there are some things that are painful as well as difficult to say so i wont go deeper than is needful i met my wife when i was goldhunting in brazil maria pinto was the daughter of a government official at manaos and she was very beautiful i was young and ardent in those days but even now as i look back with colder blood and a more critical eye i can see that she was rare and wonderful in her beauty it was a deep rich nature too passionate wholehearted tropical illbalanced very different from the american women whom i had known well to make a long story short i loved her and i married her it was only when the romance had passed and it lingered for years that i realized that we had nothing absolutely nothing in common my love faded if hers had faded also it might have been easier but you know the wonderful way of women do what i might nothing could turn her from me if i have been harsh to her even brutal as some have said it has been because i knew that if i could kill her love or if it turned to hate it would be easier for both of us but nothing changed her she adored me in those english woods as she had adored me twenty years ago on the banks of the amazon do what i might she was as devoted as ever then came miss grace dunbar she answered our advertisement and became governess to our two children perhaps you have seen her portrait in the papers the whole world has proclaimed that she also is a very beautiful woman now i make no pretence to be more moral than my neighbours and i will admit to you that i could not live under the same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her without feeling a passionate regard for her do you blame me mr holmes i do not blame you for feeling it i should blame you if you expressed it since this young lady was in a sense under your protection well maybe so said the millionaire though for a moment the reproof had brought the old angry gleam into his eyes im not pretending to be any better than i am i guess all my life ive been a man that reached out his hand for what he wanted and i never wanted anything more than the love and possession of that woman i told her so oh you did did you holmes could look very formidable when he was moved i said to her that if i could marry her i would but that it was out of my power i said that money was no object and that all i could do to make her happy and comfortable would be done very generous i am sure said holmes with a sneer see here mr holmes i came to you on a question of evidence not on a question of morals im not asking for your criticism it is only for the young ladys sake that i touch your case at all said holmes sternly i dont know that anything she is accused of is really worse than what you have yourself admitted that you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof some of you rich men have to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed into condoning your offences to my surprise the gold king took the reproof with equanimity thats how i feel myself about it now i thank god that my plans did not work out as i intended she would have none of it and she wanted to leave the house instantly why did she not well in the first place others were dependent upon her and it was no light matter for her to let them all down by sacrificing her living when i had sworn as i did that she should never be molested again she consented to remain but there was another reason she knew the influence she had over me and that it was stronger than any other influence in the world she wanted to use it for good how well she knew something of my affairs they are large mr holmes large beyond the belief of an ordinary man i can make or break and it is usually break it wasnt individuals only it was communities cities even nations business is a hard game and the weak go to the wall i played the game for all it was worth i never squealed myself and i never cared if the other fellow squealed but she saw it different i guess she was right she believed and said that a fortune for one man that was more than he needed should not be built on ten thousand ruined men who were left without the means of life that was how she saw it and i guess she could see past the dollars to something that was more lasting she found that i listened to what she said and she believed she was serving the world by influencing my actions so she stayed and then this came along can you throw any light upon that the gold king paused for a minute or more his head sunk in his hands lost in deep thought its very black against her i cant deny that and women lead an inward life and may do things beyond the judgment of a man at first i was so rattled and taken aback that i was ready to think she had been led away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against her usual nature one explanation came into my head i give it to you mr holmes for what it is worth there is no doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous there is a souljealousy that can be as frantic as any bodyjealousy and though my wife had no cause and i think she understood this for the latter she was aware that this english girl exerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself never had it was an influence for good but that did not mend the matter she was crazy with hatred and the heat of the amazon was always in her blood she might have planned to murder miss dunbar or we will say to threaten her with a gun and so frighten her into leaving us then there might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off and shot the woman who held it that possibility had already occurred to me said holmes indeed it is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder but she utterly denies it well that is not final is it one can understand that a woman placed in so awful a position might hurry home still in her bewilderment holding the revolver she might even throw it down among her clothes hardly knowing what she was doing and when it was found she might try to lie her way out by a total denial since all explanation was impossible what is against such a supposition miss dunbar herself well perhaps holmes looked at his watch i have no doubt we can get the necessary permits this morning and reach winchester by the evening train when i have seen this young lady it is very possible that i may be of more use to you in the matter though i cannot promise that my conclusions will necessarily be such as you desire there was some delay in the official pass and instead of reaching winchester that day we went down to thor place the hampshire estate of mr neil gibson he did not accompany us himself but we had the address of sergeant coventry of the local police who had first examined into the affair he was a tall thin cadaverous man with a secretive and mysterious manner which conveyed the idea that he knew or suspected a very great deal more than he dared say he had a trick too of suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if he had come upon something of vital importance though the information was usually commonplace enough behind these tricks of manner he soon showed himself to be a decent honest fellow who was not too proud to admit that he was out of his depth and would welcome any help anyhow id rather have you than scotland yard mr holmes said he if the yard gets called into a case then the local loses all credit for success and may be blamed for failure now you play straight so ive heard i need not appear in the matter at all said holmes to the evident relief of our melancholy acquaintance if i can clear it up i dont ask to have my name mentioned well its very handsome of you i am sure and your friend dr watson can be trusted i know now mr holmes as we walk down to the place there is one question i should like to ask you id breathe it to no soul but you he looked round as though he hardly dare utter the words dont you think there might be a case against mr neil gibson himself i have been considering that youve not seen miss dunbar she is a wonderful fine woman in every way he may well have wished his wife out of the road and these americans are readier with pistols than our folk are it was his pistol you know was that clearly made out yes sir it was one of a pair that he had one of a pair where is the other well the gentleman has a lot of firearms of one sort and another we never quite matched that particular pistol but the box was made for two if it was one of a pair you should surely be able to match it well we have them all laid out at the house if you would care to look them over later perhaps i think we will walk down together and have a look at the scene of the tragedy this conversation had taken place in the little front room of sergeant coventrys humble cottage which served as the local policestation a walk of half a mile or so across a windswept heath all gold and bronze with the fading ferns brought us to a sidegate opening into the grounds of the thor place estate a path led us through the pheasant preserves and then from a clearing we saw the widespread halftimbered house half tudor and half georgian upon the crest of the hill beside us there was a long reedy pool constricted in the centre where the main carriage drive passed over a stone bridge but swelling into small lakes on either side our guide paused at the mouth of this bridge and he pointed to the ground that was where mrs gibsons body lay i marked it by that stone i understand that you were there before it was moved yes they sent for me at once who did mr gibson himself the moment the alarm was given and he had rushed down with others from the house he insisted that nothing should be moved until the police should arrive that was sensible i gathered from the newspaper report that the shot was fired from close quarters yes sir very close near the right temple just behind it sir how did the body lie on the back sir no trace of a struggle no marks no weapon the short note from miss dunbar was clutched in her left hand clutched you say yes sir we could hardly open the fingers that is of great importance it excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue dear me the note as i remember was quite short i will be at thor bridge at nine oclock g dunbar was that not so yes sir did miss dunbar admit writing it yes sir what was her explanation her defence was reserved for the assizes she would say nothing the problem is certainly a very interesting one the point of the letter is very obscure is it not well sir said the guide it seemed if i may be so bold as to say so the only really clear point in the whole case holmes shook his head granting that the letter is genuine and was really written it was certainly received some time before say one hour or two why then was this lady still clasping it in her left hand why should she carry it so carefully she did not need to refer to it in the interview does it not seem remarkable well sir as you put it perhaps it does i think i should like to sit quietly for a few minutes and think it out he seated himself upon the stone ledge of the bridge and i could see his quick gray eyes darting their questioning glances in every direction suddenly he sprang up again and ran across to the opposite parapet whipped his lens from his pocket and began to examine the stonework this is curious said he yes sir we saw the chip on the ledge i expect its been done by some passerby the stonework was gray but at this one point it showed white for a space not larger than a sixpence when examined closely one could see that the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow it took some violence to do that said holmes thoughtfully with his cane he struck the ledge several times without leaving a mark yes it was a hard knock in a curious place too it was not from above but from below for you see that it is on the lower edge of the parapet but it is at least fifteen feet from the body yes it is fifteen feet from the body it may have nothing to do with the matter but it is a point worth noting i do not think that we have anything more to learn here there were no footsteps you say the ground was iron hard sir there were no traces at all then we can go we will go up to the house first and look over these weapons of which you speak then we shall get on to winchester for i should desire to see miss dunbar before we go farther mr neil gibson had not returned from town but we saw in the house the neurotic mr bates who had called upon us in the morning he showed us with a sinister relish the formidable array of firearms of various shapes and sizes which his employer had accumulated in the course of an adventurous life mr gibson has his enemies as anyone would expect who knew him and his methods said he he sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer beside his bed he is a man of violence sir and there are times when all of us are afraid of him i am sure that the poor lady who has passed was often terrified did you ever witness physical violence towards her no i cannot say that but i have heard words which were nearly as bad words of cold cutting contempt even before the servants our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life remarked holmes as we made our way to the station well watson we have come on a good many facts some of them new ones and yet i seem some way from my conclusion in spite of the very evident dislike which mr bates has to his employer i gather from him that when the alarm came he was undoubtedly in his library dinner was over at and all was normal up to then it is true that the alarm was somewhat late in the evening but the tragedy certainly occurred about the hour named in the note there is no evidence at all that mr gibson had been out of doors since his return from town at five oclock on the other hand miss dunbar as i understand it admits that she had made an appointment to meet mrs gibson at the bridge beyond this she would say nothing as her lawyer had advised her to reserve her defence we have several very vital questions to ask that young lady and my mind will not be easy until we have seen her i must confess that the case would seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one thing and what is that holmes the finding of the pistol in her wardrobe dear me holmes i cried that seemed to me to be the most damning incident of all not so watson it had struck me even at my first perfunctory reading as very strange and now that i am in closer touch with the case it is my only firm ground for hope we must look for consistency where there is a want of it we must suspect deception i hardly follow you well now watson suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of a woman who in a cold premeditated fashion is about to get rid of a rival you have planned it a note has been written the victim has come you have your weapon the crime is done it has been workmanlike and complete do you tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by forgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reedbeds which would forever cover it but you must needs carry it carefully home and put it in your own wardrobe the very first place that would be searched your best friends would hardly call you a schemer watson and yet i could not picture you doing anything so crude as that in the excitement of the moment no no watson i will not admit that it is possible where a crime is cooly premeditated then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also i hope therefore that we are in the presence of a serious misconception but there is so much to explain well we shall set about explaining it when once your point of view is changed the very thing which was so damning becomes a clue to the truth for example there is this revolver miss dunbar disclaims all knowledge of it on our new theory she is speaking truth when she says so therefore it was placed in her wardrobe who placed it there someone who wished to incriminate her was not that person the actual criminal you see how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of inquiry we were compelled to spend the night at winchester as the formalities had not yet been completed but next morning in the company of mr joyce cummings the rising barrister who was entrusted with the defence we were allowed to see the young lady in her cell i had expected from all that we had heard to see a beautiful woman but i can never forget the effect which miss dunbar produced upon me it was no wonder that even the masterful millionaire had found in her something more powerful than himself something which could control and guide him one felt too as one looked at the strong clearcut and yet sensitive face that even should she be capable of some impetuous deed none the less there was an innate nobility of character which would make her influence always for the good she was a brunette tall with a noble figure and commanding presence but her dark eyes had in them the appealing helpless expression of the hunted creature who feels the nets around it but can see no way out from the toils now as she realized the presence and the help of my famous friend there came a touch of colour in her wan cheeks and a light of hope began to glimmer in the glance which she turned upon us perhaps mr neil gibson has told you something of what occurred between us she asked in a low agitated voice yes holmes answered you need not pain yourself by entering into that part of the story after seeing you i am prepared to accept mr gibsons statement both as to the influence which you had over him and as to the innocence of your relations with him but why was the whole situation not brought out in court it seemed to me incredible that such a charge could be sustained i thought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up without our being compelled to enter into painful details of the inner life of the family but i understand that far from clearing it has become even more serious my dear young lady cried holmes earnestly i beg you to have no illusions upon the point mr cummings here would assure you that all the cards are at present against us and that we must do everything that is possible if we are to win clear it would be a cruel deception to pretend that you are not in very great danger give me all the help you can then to get at the truth i will conceal nothing tell us then of your true relations with mr gibsons wife she hated me mr holmes she hated me with all the fervour of her tropical nature she was a woman who would do nothing by halves and the measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her hatred for me it is probable that she misunderstood our relations i would not wish to wrong her but she loved so vividly in a physical sense that she could hardly understand the mental and even spiritual tie which held her husband to me or imagine that it was only my desire to influence his power to good ends which kept me under his roof i can see now that i was wrong nothing could justify me in remaining where i was a cause of unhappiness and yet it is certain that the unhappiness would have remained even if i had left the house now miss dunbar said holmes i beg you to tell us exactly what occurred that evening i can tell you the truth so far as i know it mr holmes but i am in a position to prove nothing and there are points the most vital points which i can neither explain nor can i imagine any explanation if you will find the facts perhaps others may find the explanation with regard then to my presence at thor bridge that night i received a note from mrs gibson in the morning it lay on the table of the schoolroom and it may have been left there by her own hand it implored me to see her there after dinner said she had something important to say to me and asked me to leave an answer on the sundial in the garden as she desired no one to be in our confidence i saw no reason for such secrecy but i did as she asked accepting the appointment she asked me to destroy her note and i burned it in the schoolroom grate she was very much afraid of her husband who treated her with a harshness for which i frequently reproached him and i could only imagine that she acted in this way because she did not wish him to know of our interview yet she kept your reply very carefully yes i was surprised to hear that she had it in her hand when she died well what happened then i went down as i had promised when i reached the bridge she was waiting for me never did i realize till that moment how this poor creature hated me she was like a mad woman indeed i think she was a mad woman subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane people may have how else could she have met me with unconcern every day and yet had so raging a hatred of me in her heart i will not say what she said she poured her whole wild fury out in burning and horrible words i did not even answer i could not it was dreadful to see her i put my hands to my ears and rushed away when i left her she was standing still shrieking out her curses at me in the mouth of the bridge where she was afterwards found within a few yards from the spot and yet presuming that she met her death shortly after you left her you heard no shot no i heard nothing but indeed mr holmes i was so agitated and horrified by this terrible outbreak that i rushed to get back to the peace of my own room and i was incapable of noticing anything which happened you say that you returned to your room did you leave it again before next morning yes when the alarm came that the poor creature had met her death i ran out with the others did you see mr gibson yes he had just returned from the bridge when i saw him he had sent for the doctor and the police did he seem to you much perturbed mr gibson is a very strong selfcontained man i do not think that he would ever show his emotions on the surface but i who knew him so well could see that he was deeply concerned then we come to the allimportant point this pistol that was found in your room had you ever seen it before never i swear it when was it found next morning when the police made their search among your clothes yes on the floor of my wardrobe under my dresses you could not guess how long it had been there it had not been there the morning before how do you know because i tidied out the wardrobe that is final then someone came into your room and placed the pistol there in order to inculpate you it must have been so and when it could only have been at mealtime or else at the hours when i would be in the schoolroom with the children as you were when you got the note yes from that time onward for the whole morning thank you miss dunbar is there any other point which could help me in the investigation i can think of none there was some sign of violence on the stonework of the bridge a perfectly fresh chip just opposite the body could you suggest any possible explanation of that surely it must be a mere coincidence curious miss dunbar very curious why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy and why at the very place but what could have caused it only great violence could have such an effect holmes did not answer his pale eager face had suddenly assumed that tense faraway expression which i had learned to associate with the supreme manifestations of his genius so evident was the crisis in his mind that none of us dared to speak and we sat barrister prisoner and myself watching him in a concentrated and absorbed silence suddenly he sprang from his chair vibrating with nervous energy and the pressing need for action come watson come he cried what is it mr holmes never mind my dear lady you will hear from me mr cummings with the help of the god of justice i will give you a case which will make england ring you will get news by tomorrow miss dunbar and meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that i have every hope that the light of truth is breaking through it was not a long journey from winchester to thor place but it was long to me in my impatience while for holmes it was evident that it seemed endless for in his nervous restlessness he could not sit still but paced the carriage or drummed with his long sensitive fingers upon the cushions beside him suddenly however as we neared our destination he seated himself opposite to me we had a firstclass carriage to ourselves and laying a hand upon each of my knees he looked into my eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which was characteristic of his more implike moods watson said he i have some recollection that you go armed upon these excursions of ours it was as well for him that i did so for he took little care for his own safety when his mind was once absorbed by a problem so that more than once my revolver had been a good friend in need i reminded him of the fact yes yes i am a little absentminded in such matters but have you your revolver on you i produced it from my hippocket a short handy but very serviceable little weapon he undid the catch shook out the cartridges and examined it with care its heavy remarkably heavy said he yes it is a solid bit of work he mused over it for a minute do you know watson said he i believe your revolver is going to have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are investigating my dear holmes you are joking no watson i am very serious there is a test before us if the test comes off all will be clear and the test will depend upon the conduct of this little weapon one cartridge out now we will replace the other five and put on the safetycatch so that increases the weight and makes it a better reproduction i had no glimmer of what was in his mind nor did he enlighten me but sat lost in thought until we pulled up in the little hampshire station we secured a ramshackle trap and in a quarter of an hour were at the house of our confidential friend the sergeant a clue mr holmes what is it it all depends upon the behaviour of dr watsons revolver said my friend here it is now officer can you give me ten yards of string the village shop provided a ball of stout twine i think that this is all we will need said holmes now if you please we will get off on what i hope is the last stage of our journey the sun was setting and turning the rolling hampshire moor into a wonderful autumnal panorama the sergeant with many critical and incredulous glances which showed his deep doubts of the sanity of my companion lurched along beside us as we approached the scene of the crime i could see that my friend under all his habitual coolness was in truth deeply agitated yes he said in answer to my remark you have seen me miss my mark before watson i have an instinct for such things and yet it has sometimes played me false it seemed a certainty when first it flashed across my mind in the cell at winchester but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one and yet and yet well watson we can but try as he walked he had firmly tied one end of the string to the handle of the revolver we had now reached the scene of the tragedy with great care he marked out under the guidance of the policeman the exact spot where the body had been stretched he then hunted among the heather and the ferns until he found a considerable stone this he secured to the other end of his line of string and he hung it over the parapet of the bridge so that it swung clear above the water he then stood on the fatal spot some distance from the edge of the bridge with my revolver in his hand the string being taut between the weapon and the heavy stone on the farther side now for it he cried at the words he raised the pistol to his head and then let go his grip in an instant it had been whisked away by the weight of the stone had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet and had vanished over the side into the water it had hardly gone before holmes was kneeling beside the stonework and a joyous cry showed that he had found what he expected was there ever a more exact demonstration he cried see watson your revolver has solved the problem as he spoke he pointed to a second chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had appeared on the under edge of the stone balustrade well stay at the inn tonight he continued as he rose and faced the astonished sergeant you will of course get a grapplinghook and you will easily restore my friends revolver you will also find beside it the revolver string and weight with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and to fasten a charge of murder upon an innocent victim you can let mr gibson know that i will see him in the morning when steps can be taken for miss dunbars vindication late that evening as we sat together smoking our pipes in the village inn holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed i fear watson said he that you will not improve any reputation which i may have acquired by adding the case of the thor bridge mystery to your annals i have been sluggish in mind and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art i confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution and that i blame myself for not having attained it sooner it must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy womans mind were deep and subtle so that it was no very simple matter to unravel her plot i do not think that in our adventures we have ever come across a stranger example of what perverted love can bring about whether miss dunbar was her rival in a physical or in a merely mental sense seems to have been equally unforgivable in her eyes no doubt she blamed this innocent lady for all those harsh dealings and unkind words with which her husband tried to repel her too demonstrative affection her first resolution was to end her own life her second was to do it in such a way as to involve her victim in a fate which was worse far than any sudden death could be we can follow the various steps quite clearly and they show a remarkable subtlety of mind a note was extracted very cleverly from miss dunbar which would make it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime in her anxiety that it should be discovered she somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last this alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did then she took one of her husbands revolvers there was as you saw an arsenal in the house and kept it for her own use a similar one she concealed that morning in miss dunbars wardrobe after discharging one barrel which she could easily do in the woods without attracting attention she then went down to the bridge where she had contrived this exceedingly ingenious method for getting rid of her weapon when miss dunbar appeared she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred and then when she was out of hearing carried out her terrible purpose every link is now in its place and the chain is complete the papers may ask why the mere was not dragged in the first instance but it is easy to be wise after the event and in any case the expanse of a reedfilled lake is no easy matter to drag unless you have a clear perception of what you are looking for and where well watson we have helped a remarkable woman and also a formidable man should they in the future join their forces as seems not unlikely the financial world may find that mr neil gibson has learned something in that schoolroom of sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught
