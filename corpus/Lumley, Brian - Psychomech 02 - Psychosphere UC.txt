chapter i two fairs of eyes watched rlchard garrison and vicki maler leave their holiday residence and disappear into the maze of steep narrow streets leading down into the heart of the greek island village two pairs neither one aware of the other one pair belonged to a thief the other to an assassin the latter joe black by name was seated at a table on the raised patio of the taverna where the pair he watched normally breakfasteda taverna they were obliged to pass on any excursion away from their accommodationwhose openair eating area presented black with a distant but unobstructed view of the door to their courtyard seen above rising tiers of flat white rooftops the village dropping down into a valley or bay seemed to have been built on much the same lines as an auditorium or amphithea brian lumley tre for which kindness black gave the ancient architects a generous ten it made his task as observer that much easier black wore lederhosen and braces a widebrimmed straw hat and an openneck shirt loud with red and yellow flowers he was not germandespite his dress his fat face and cigar but cockney the hired hand of a middling mafia boss carlo vicenti who once owned a quartershare of one of londons less reputable and far more profitable casinos richard garrison now owned that quartershare a fact which irked vicenti more than a trifle hence joe blacks presence here in lindos rhodes the aegean black was not alone on rhodes a second hitman his brother bert waited in rhodes town itself bert was the hard part of the team on this occasion that is to say his was the hand which would directly terminate garrisons life brother joes role was simply to tell him when to do it just a minute or so after the subjects of blacks covert surveillance emerged from an alley into the narrow main street crossing it to climb wooden stairs to the breakfast patio he waited for them to seat themselves close by waited again until they engaged the waiters attention and started to give him their orders then folded his shielding newspaper and left he glanced only once at the pair as he went his eyes lingering momentarily on the blackasnight lenses and frames which garrison wore a blind man this garrison allegedly black psychosphere snorted as he descended the stairs to the street and made his way towards the open village square and coachandtaxi booking office huh the damnedest blind man he had ever seen and his mind went back to the first time he ever came into contact with garrison that had been at the ace of clubs where on occasion black had used to do bouncer the blind man had come in one night with his woman also blind the first time they had ever visited the place the last too if blacks memory served him correctly as patrons anyway he snorted again huh well and hadnt once been enough that had been oh six or seven months ago but black remembered it like yesterday remembered garrison buying one large pink chip worth fifty pounds sterling and the way he had casually crossed to the central roulette wheel to toss the chip onto the tables zero and how with the next spin the ball had dropped as if preordained directly into that very slothow in fact it had fallen into that slot twice in succession and how garrison had let the spoils of his first incredible gamble ridel the gasps of shock astonishment and appreciation that went up then had been the summons which brought the boss the ravenhaired carlo vicenti himself hurrying up to the table his face darkening under brows already black as thunder mr er garrison yes your custom was recommended the clubs misfortune it ap brian lumley pears he forced a smile well sir you have won a great deal of money in fact a fortune and and i want to let it ride one last time garrison had unsmilingly cut him short on the zero vicentis jaw had dropped garrison had frowned thoughtfully only halfseriously almost mockingly certainly on the zero why not but sir you have already won over sixty thousand pounds and sixtyfour thousand and eight hundred to be exact garrison had cut him short again including my stake of course but please do go on vicenti had leaned towards him then staring up into his dark heavy lenses and stating in a lowered tone but perfectly audibly sir unbeknown to you the operator of this wheel has already been obliged to ask the house for permission to cover your second bet normally you understand we would have a limit of one thousand pounds on this wheel and besides the zero cannot possibly come up a third time garrison had stood rock still apparently frozen to the floor by something vicenti had said his answer when finally it came was delivered in a voice steady firm and chill am to understand that this wheel is fixed vicenti was astounded what i said no such thing of course the wheel is not fixed i did not mean that the then it can possibly spin a third zero psychosphere but certainly sirexcept it is most unlikely and unlikely or not garrison cut in for the third time i wish to bet a halfapologetic shrug we cannot cover it and sir this time vicentis voice had been almost conspiratorial wheedling arent you being just a little frivolous with your money not with mine and now garrison smiled broadly with yours perhaps but not mine i only started with fifty pounds all of this joe black had witnessed from a position close at hand also the way vicenti had turned an explosive purple at garrisons last remark at that moment joe had known whatever the apparent outcome of this confrontation that the little sicilian would take a terrible revenge on the blind manin one way or another the one thing vicenti had never been able to stand was to be laughed atand here he stood an object of ridicule certainly in his own eyes possibly in the eyes of half of the clubs regular clientele who now gathered about the table in various attitudes ranging between awe and delight in fact it was mainly garrisons lucky streak which had fired their imaginations not vicentis discomfiture but the sicilian had taken their smiles their subdued laughter chuckles and excited whispers as being derogatory to himself wait he had snapped i need to confer and the wheel had remained stationary for a full five minutes until he returned well garrison had remained cool smiling brian lumley at least with his mouth for of course his eyes had been invisible and now vincenti had seemed eager that everyone should hear him mrer garrisoni am a partowner of this club indeed i own one quarter of all its assets even so i personally could barely cover tonights losses your winnings that is but i am a gambler and he had paused to smile a sharks smile teeth white and gleaming in a veritable deathgrin since you too are a gamblera most extraordinary gambler obviouslyi have a proposition which might interest you go on vicenti had shrugged continued i have been authorized to take full responsibility in this matter responsibility for the current er damage shall we sayand for my er proposition which is vicenti had then taken out his personal checkbook written a check for ј folded it neatly and delicately placed it on the tables zero take my check by all means orwe spin the wheel but on this understanding since the club does not have that sort of money if you win you accept my share of its ownership by way of payment which was where if garrison was a normal sober man and in his right mind he should have backed down and taken his winnings everything was against him namely the incredible odds against the zero and the fact that he could win no more real cash and at the same time vicenti stood to gain immeasurably for despite psychosphere the fact that all the odds were on his side still he had shown that he was indeed a gambler that he personally was willing to risk his all on this one spin of the wheeland that garrison was up against a man of equal verve daring and determination but more important by far to carlo vicenti there was no longer any laughter from those patrons crowding the table no more amused sniggers and whispers instead the mood had become one of tense excitement of breathless suspense quite simply it was now vincenti against garrison this had become a very personal matter then joe black remembered a very strange thing something which even now six months later made him shudder in a thrill of almost supernatural intensity garrison had seemedto change his very shape inside his evening suit had seemed somehow to bulk out to take on weight solidity he had becomesquarer his face too had taken on this squareness and his smile had completely faded away no one else appeared to notice these things with perhaps the one exception of the blind mans woman who backed off from him a little her hand going nervously to her mouthbut joe black was absolutely certain of what he had seen it was as if in the space of only a few seconds a different man stood in garrisons shoes a man with a different voice a harsh arrogant authoritative somehow germanic voice accept your gamble my little sicilian friend let the wheel spin but since so very much rests brian lumley upon itin your eyes at leastplease be so good as to spin it yourself thats most unusual vicenti had grated in return but so is everything tonight it appears very well and in utter silence he had moved through the throng which opened to let him pass spun the wheel raced the ball against the spinand waited rock steady he had stood there as the wheel gradually slowed and the ball skittered and clicked ramrod straight at the head of the table his face split in a frozen almost meaningless grin and the ball jumping rolling skittering and the wheel slowing and a sea of faces watching the wheelexcept garrisons which blind or not seemed turned upon vicentis faceand joe blacks which watched only garrison and the wheel still turning but the ball now firmly lodged in its slot vicentis eyes bulging a touch of foam at the corner of his madly grinning mouth concerted gasps sighs amazed little utterances going up from the onlookersand all of them drawing back from the swaying vicenti to give him space air and his halfgasp halfcroak as the fingers of his left hand clawed at the tables rim giving him support zero you have my address garrisons voice was still the new cold germanic one i shall expect the documents delivered in the near future goodnight to you and he had picked up vicentis check and pocketed it and without another psychosphere word had led his wife across the floor out of the room out of the club and into the night oh yes joe black remembered that night flow rage and utter hatred had blazed in vicentis feverbright eyes as he watched garrison leave how he had then switched off the tables overhead light and given the dealer and his assistant the rest of the nightindeed the rest of their livesoff telling them never to return and how he had retired rubberlegged to the clubs offices there he had consumed large amounts of alcohol being quite drunk later when after the club had said goodnight to its last patron he staggeringly returnedreturned with a fire axe and great gusto to reduce the table wheel and all to very small fragments mot a night black might easily forget it was the night vicenti had offered him the contract on garrisons life the second pair of eyes watching richard garrison and vicki maler belonged to a gentleman from genoa named paulo palazzi a gentleman that is to unacquainted eyes unlike joe black palazzi had no prior knowledge of garrison beyond the fact that he was a very rich man anyone with his own chartered aircraft sitting idle in a hangar at rhodes airport would of necessity be very rich this had seemed indisputable to palazzi nevertheless he had made several discreet local inquiries to prove the point and if further confirmation were needed there was always the fact that garrison and his lady had paid for and were now enjoying the luxury of brian lumley rooms large enough to accommodate three to four times their numbers privacy costs money a lot of money paulo palazzi was small slim immaculate in a white lightweight italian suit and patent leather shoes and bareheaded to show off his mop of curly black hair lightskinned cleareyed and freshfaced he could be anything between twentyfive and forty years of age a cheerful fairly welltodo italian touristto anyone offering him less than a very close scrutiny and indeed he was fairly welldoto on the spoils of various illicit occupations including his very successful summer trips this was one such a week on rhodes which with a bit of luck would pay for itself many times over he had been watching garrisons comings and goings for three days now sufficient time to acquaint himself quite intimately with the mans humors and habits only one thing continued to concern him garrisons blindness for plainly garrison was not blind despite the heavy dark glasses he constantly wore or if he was then his four remaining senses had expanded out of all proportionor more likely he was richer than even palazzi had reckoned for who but an extremely rich man could possibly afford the very special and miniaturized aids he would need to make so light of so serious an infirmity mot that garrisons blindnessreal or assumedgave palazzi any sort of moral pause on the contrary the thing was a positive boon or might be if palazzis plans needed to be altered mo it was just that garrison seemed to psychosphere see so very well for a blind man well doubtless he had his own reasons for the subterfuge if indeed it was such and for palazzi it must remain simply a curiosity one of the idiosyncrasies of a victimtobe palazzi sat upon a spread handkerchief his slim legs nonchalantly crossed his back to a merlon of the ancient battlements high over lindos on the precipitous wall of the acropolis itself he held a pair of powerful binoculars to his eyes in slender highly articulate and wellmanicured hands his gaze fixed upon the vine beneath which he could just make out the light blue of garrisons tshirt and the coolly contrasting greens of vickis skirt and top he smiled to himself idly reflecting upon his own cleverness his modus operand was simplicity itself perfected over the last three seasons three seasons yes for he had discovered lindos three summers ago lindos and its mighty rock from the old battlements courtesy of the crusading knights of st john of jerusalem he could see virtually all of the village not a single house or home shack or taverna was hidden from his scrutiny sitting here warm in the brilliant sunshine and breathing the sweet clean air of the aegean he could study any victims to and froings at will picking and choosing the perfect time to strike and occasionally just occasionally there would be enough in it to keep him in luxury for well for a little while at least as for the way it worked brian lumley tomorrow evening for example garrison and his lady would very likely go out they would eat drink talk a little in one or another taverna late into the lindos night their movements would be languid leisurely they were on holiday in no mood to hurry later they might go to a disco burn off a little excess energy but whatever they did it would make little difference palazzi having seen them leave their rooms would have plenty of time to get in discover their hidden valuables take what he wanted and get out and of course garrison would not be his only victim tomorrow night there was also a fat rich frenchman and his mistress who palazzi knew were booked to see a show tomorrow in rhodes and finally there was a swiss playboy and his girlfriend who invariably danced and drank the night away and all of them would be leaving their accommodation at approximately the same time their movements entirely visible in the magnifying lenses of the thiefs binoculars and the cost of remaining up here when the crowds of visitors were finally ushered out of the place and the acropolis locked its door oh a few hundred drachmas enough to keep the gnarled old watchman in ouzo for a night or two and in the early hours of the following morningwith the sun not long up and the local constabulary still rubbing the sleep from their eyeswhy paulo palazzi would be gone lone passenger in a taxi headed for rhodes town where he would change his suit his style un psychosphere load a few choice items for cash and readopt his real name under which four or five days from now he would fly back to genoa and business as usual and if what he had seen of mrs garrisons jewelry alone was anything to go by it would be quite a long time before he needed to do any serious work again which was probably why he was so cheerful nodding a bright good morning to a couple of pretty british girls with birmingham accents where they leaned out over the wall close by and oohed and aahed their awe at the scene spread below yes it was a very pretty scene and a very good morning hopefully tomorrow would be just as good and especially tomorrow night putting his binoculars away snapping shut the catch on their case and standing up palazzi smiled at the girls again one of them had the most exquisitely jutting breasts he licked his lips a pity this was a purely business trip butwell business is business five minutes after joe black left the elevated patio where his intended victim now breakfasted garrison paused with a forkful of scrambled egg raised halfway to his mouth suddenly upon his minds eye leaping into view from nowhere he had viewedsomething a scene not a true memory but something else entirely just what he couldnt say except that for a moment all of his senses had seemed electrified into a tingling defensiveness the scene had been dim and smoky and had depicted a male figure seated his hand spinning a small rou brian lumley lette wheel which he held between crossed legs the thing had lasted no longer than a split second mow it was gone beyond recall richard vickis voice reached him something with your egg he unfroze relaxed shoulders grown too tight and lowered his fork ho he smiled its fine ive had enough thats all you looked so strange just then she was concerned did i oh i was probably miles away she tilted her head questioningly is it nice there um he was still distant what were you thinking thinking he shrugged shook his head said the first thing that came into his mind something which mildly surprised even him did you notice the man who left a few minutes ago with the leather pants and flowery shirt yes a german like me or rather more typicalor at least how you english believe a typical german should be she smiled a bit loud really you were thinking about him too loud garrison answered and not at all german and yes i suppose i must have been thinking about him not german but he looked so she stopped smiling you were eavesdropping listening to his thoughts but why richard actually i wasnt he said truthfully hell i hardly noticed the bloke butoh i may have seen him before somewhere hes not german though you can be sure of that psychosphere and does it matter his nationality i mean he wrinkled his nose gave her question perfunctory consideration grinned and said shouldnt think so flow vicki relaxed reached across the table and took his hand laughed out loud oh richard you really are the strangest man and because it had been spontaneous she failed to see the significance of her words garrison continued to grin outwardly while inside oh yes he thought really am but there are stranger things in heaven and earth vicki my sweet stranger by far and he knew that one of those things those ohsostrange things was even now beginning or perhaps it had started long ago and only now was coming to a head like pus gathering in a boil all about garrison the psychosphere eddied and swirled pulsing endlessly apparently ordered and serene but occasionally it carried the ripples of far distant disturbances beyond his understanding such ripples were there even now they did him no harm but they troubled him he felt like a fish swimming in the great sea of the psychosphere and like a fish he sensed the presence of some mighty predator out there somewhere in the fathomless deeps a shark that was an interesting thought a shark in the psychosphere and garrison not so much a ftsh as a spearfisherman while he preyed on smaller denizens of the deeps some brian lumley psychosphere where close at hand a large predator circled him but he wasnt afraid or at least not wholly afraid for he had his speargun exceptifa confrontation was in the offing would his gun be powerful enough its oncetough rubber hurlers were getting old growing weaker from continued stretching worse than this would he even see the enemy if it cameor would it coast up silently behind him jaws agape suddenly fearful lost in his fantasy garrison cast about with his mind terror was the spur boosting his esp even as it boosted his adrenalin searching he peered deep into the psychosphere somewhere somewhere there that mottled marbled shape silent as a shadow intent upon the pursuit of some other prey showing no interest in garrison whatsoever until the sharkshape turned suddenly in garrisons direction came at him in a blind headon fury a dullgray bullet snarling through the matterless stuff of the psychosphere it was close looming closer it sensed him richard vickis voice reached in to him causing him to start as if slappedwhich in turn made her jump wandering again she nervously asked garrisons face felt drained of bloodbut he forced a grin rose and reached across the table to draw her up with him he hoped she couldnt feel the trembling in his arms good idea he said to wander mean lets walk down towards the beach but even as they set out she could tell that he was still not entirely with her chapter more tham fifteen humored miles northwest of rhodes it was midday and brilliant with sunshine london was abustlebut in charon qubwas mindcastle all was cool shaded and calm as a somnolent beast the castle did not sleepit never sleptbut qubwa had been alone all morning in his private quarters and not to be disturbed which was about as close as the castle as an entity might ever get to the stasis of slumber the castles staff qubwas soldiers went about their tasks almost robotically corpuscles in the castles veins the machines and computers and support systems throbbed and pumped rustled and ticked and whirred organs by which the castle lived but charon qubwa himself rather the qubwa consciousness the id the mind of the placehe had in part removed himself psychosphere physically he was there for he was also the castles pulse without which it could not function and would have no purpose but mentally this was one of those days when qubwa practiced his arts when he exercised his mind as more orthodox men might exercise their bodies except that where the latter were bent upon physical creativity the structural improvement of themselves qubwas exercises were designed for the mental degradation and eventual destruction of others and they were in truth exercises training tasks he set himself to carry him to the very threshold of an objectivebut not to cross it not yet not until the time was ripe when the result could only be total victory and in this respect qubwa was a general whose weapons were the telepathic and hypnotic powers of his own mind the castle and its staff they were merely his armor the world outside the world of common men that was his objective eventually but qubwa was tiring now his exercises had lasted for close on three hours and he was beginning to feel that mental strain which ever accompanied such excesses of mind he was seated in a massively padded armchair before a great glass tube which reached vertically from floor to ceiling within the tube a large globe of the world with its continents and oceans etched in realistic basrelief and color hung in electromagnetic suspension qubwas eyes were closed he sat completely relaxed physically indeed he might well appear to be asleep but he was not brian lumley upon his lap lay a computer remote its tiny screen glowing with this word and coordinates moth moth was the codename of one of britains polaris submarines and the coordinates told her location midway between iceland and norway roughly halfway along an imaginary line drawn due north between the shetlands and the arctic circle on qubwas globe this location showed as a steady point of light in the western reaches of the norwegian ocean a telltale glow which served purely as a guide a focal point for his intense telepathic transmissions the coordinates had been snatched from the unsuspecting mind of the duty officer at the pen in rosyth roughly corroborated by a similarly unwitting mind in the admiralty and given final definition by moths captain himself where he went about his duties feet beneath a sparkling choppy sunflecked surface and that was where qubwas mind was at this very moment seated astride the mind of moths commander the castles master was well pleased with the way the mornings exercises had goneso far but this was his last visit of this session and it was the most important it would determine his mood for days to comeit might one day determine the fate of the world as for the rest of the mornings work work already completed strategic air command had been a hard one the americansespecially their military ele psychosphere mentshad a rigidity of mind difficult to crack they were mentally obstinate usads pilots were no exception the united states airborne deterrent had often been described as a neverending flirtation with disaster but it was also the symbol of a nations securityconsciousness carried to the nth degree never a moment of the day or night went by without some of those planes were in the sky and the minds of their pilots were never easy to find and had proved singularly difficult to penetrate be that as it may qubwa knew most of them by now and yet not one of them knew him his knowledge was the result of over three years covert surveillance a gradual insinuation of himself into their minds this was a continual process which he must forever update and change to suit circumstances air patrol routes were changed from day to day and pilot turnover was fairly frequent because of the nature of the task however pilot substitution or replacement never occurred en bloc there were always halfadozen easily recognizable susceptible minds open to him most of which he had learned to control in one degree or another for control was the real object of these exercises to control minds such as these was to control world destiny literally this morning qubwa might well have started world war iii and it was his intention one day to do exactly that for example he might have caused one or more of the supersonic nuclear brian lumley armed american bombers to enter into russian airspace ignoring all commands to turn back simultaneously he might have bombed or nuked as current jargon would have it detroit boston and ottawa and if he had also managed to maintain radio silence there would have been no way to convince the pentagon and us authorities that such an attack had been carried out by their own planes even had they accepted the unacceptable conditions worldwide would by then have been rapidly disintegrating with every country of major military capability elevated to or accelerating towards a red alert situation at which stage a little pressure applied to a certain jittery mind controlling the firingbuttons of a nest of missiles in their silos at vytegra ussr and and then there had been the chinese qubwa had been there tooto a selected location in the scattered chain of silos along the border of the north sinkiang desert the chinese still did not have the wests or russias targeting technology but what they lacked in sophistication they more than made up for in muscle and their bombs were incredibly dirty a chainreaction of hysterical buttonpushing there could well result in a thousandmile wide band of nuclear destruction and desolation reaching from the aral sea to siberia all very gratifying and charon qubwa might well congratulate himself on the success of the mornings exercises so far he had broached these various thresholds without breaching them which remained a step for the future but psychosphere now in the mind of moths commander he desired to apply one last test before terminating todays training session and this was a test which would require a delicate touch indeed or a brutal one depending on the point of view qubwa had long since learned all of the atomic submariners habits and idiosyncrasies and he was well aware of captain gary fosters wont to catnap the subs commander was one of those people who work best under pressure the more extreme the better whose mind and body performed at their highest levels of efficiency under a workload others would deem crippling and when called upon he could perform under such stress for long hours at a stretch even days his secret lay in an equally impressive ability to fall asleep however briefly at the drop of a hat this he was given to do as often as three or four times in any period of twentyfour hours always to the amazement and occasionally the consternation of his immediate subordinates and crew for while they themselves would normally sleep for six or seven hours at a stretch between duties their commanding officer rarely went down for more than two hours and often made do with as little as fifteen minutes in the middle of a watchor a good read of playboy or a hand of pokerwhen by all rights captain foster should be deep in slumber he would silently unexpectedly appear in a hatchway or through a bulkhead door his sardonic humorless grin cold as the wind from the pole so that brian lumley moths company was aware to a man that there was never a time nor even a moment when they could guarantee that their captain was offduty it made he was in the habit of reminding them for a very tight ship it was good for discipline and it made charon qubwas task that much easier sleeping minds were far simpler to penetrate in sleep a mans mental defenses are down where often a mere suggestion may carry the weight of a command using his usual technique of gradual insinuation over many short visits qubwa had found that he could slip in and out of certain minds as easily as unlocked rooms inhabiting and using them as he saw fit and from the sleeping mindwhere certain deeply embedded posthypnotic commands could be left to take root and germinateit was usually only a short step to the waking mind when qubwas unwitting host would become quite literally a zombie working to his command thus it was with several of the usad pilots and thus he intended it to be with moths commander it is nevertheless a rare brand of hypnotism indeed that can cause a man to do that which his nature would not permit at its normal level of consciousness and this was the purpose of todays test run to see if it were possible so to manipulate gary fosters mind that he would perform contrary to the fundamental elements of his own nature ideals and training in short psychosphere to see if he could be made to press the button fiot to actually cross that threshold no but certainly to stand upon its doorstep qubwa had found foster taking a catnap a habit of the captains around midday and had crept into the unguarded sleeping mind there had been no dreams as such merely an awareness of the great gray metal shape surrounding mind and body as it cruised in the deeps powerful as the atomic engine which propelled it and semisentient with its computercontrolled mind and sensors with no dreams to usurp qubwa had simply inserted a phantasm of his own its cold outside bitterly cold we are three hundred miles inside the arctic circle edge of the barents sea lying still on the bottom at thirty fathoms moscow is miles away this is no exercise the alert state is red it is red all over the world this is what your training was all about gary this is what it was for now you can only wait you wait in the ops area your radio op has just received info through the decoder his face is white drawn in his tiny cabin foster moaned and turned over on his narrow bunk droplets of sweat stood out suddenly upon his brow he mumbled some incoherent query but in his dream his words were sharpetched brittle with tension what is it carter russian bombers are on the edge of our air brian lumley space others are coming over the roof closing on canada american bombers are already inside red airspace and and yes carter foster snapped come on sparks what is it carter nodded gulped were to initiate nucac nucac first phase of a missile launch following which there would be nucacs then and finally and would signify the launch itself foster almost said no i dont believe it but he held the words back instead he said action stations all nucac op immediate other nucacs imminent mate his ic mike arnott nodded briefly grimly nucac required both of them in the hands of one man alone it would be too dangerous unthinkably dangerous carter called out corns cut between moscow and washington the keys code had come through with the nucac order carter had already punched the code into moths ops computer twin red lights were flashing on panels in the curving walls the panels slid open foster reached up and took out a bunch of harmless looking keys from one recess likewise arnott from the other to one end of the ops area built into the bulkhead stood a booth only slightly larger than a telephone kiosk its windows were dark tinted its sealed door bore the legend nucac cell psychosphere foster and arnott crossed to the booth inserted duplicate keys in locks on opposite sides of the door turned them the seals snapped open interior lights flickered into life foster slid the door aside and they entered cramming themselves into tiny padded seats and facing each other across a table whose center was a screen foster reached up and pulled the door shut outside in the ops bay sparks plugged in their audio system and gave them direct access to all incoming signals good said qubwa fascinated by the progress of the dream he had instigated foster glared across at arnott and barked good what the hells good about it the other stared blankly back both men put on headphones nucac said gubwa jesus christ foster hissed through clenched teeth its all coming apart almost automatically he and arnott pressed twinned buttons fed coded coordinates into the computer for its translation watched the illuminated reticulated tablescreen coming to life between them in lines of red and blue light glowing with figures times everchanging computations gubwa was now the voice of incoming signals he painted a scenario of chaos madness seven red bombers intercepted amd taken out over manitoba satellites report increased activity round silos in russia and intermediate missile batteries in east germany french silos sabotaged brian lumley by th columnists paris nuked icbms fired in ussr and in usa cruise missiles launched on ussr from europe inner london nuked jesus jesus jesus foster was whispering over and over nucac said qubwa no foster gasped its all wrong it has to be wrong we wouldve been the first to know not the last theyre blowing up the world out therebombers icbms cruiseand were only on nucac sweat dripped from his chin plastered his shirt to his back outside his dream fosters body struggled out of his bunk staggered from his tiny cabin nucac said qubwa its all yours captain said arnott feeding the final code into the computer a tiny panel snapped open in the tables surface beside fosters right hand in the recess a large red firingbutton blinked onoffonoffon captain said arnott nucac qubwa snapped for a moment fosters right hand hovered over the buttonthen shot across the table and grabbed arnotts throat dream he was babbling dreamnightmareit has to be nucac qubwa squeezed fosters mind but arnott was dissolving away in fosters grasp the outline of his face and form melting down and the nucac cells lights and fittings were blurring shifting like melting wax foster was waking up despite qubwas every effort to restrain him psychosphere the man was breaking free his situation had been too nightmarish the ultimate nightmare and he must wake up foster gasped no must failure qubwa was furious there must be a fault in his scenario he hadnt built it carefully enough foster was almost awake and his mind was agitated a whirlpool crowded with terror confused and yet resolute qrimly determined to to wake up useless in this condition useless to charon qubwa the exercise was over the castles master withdrew from fosters mind at which precise moment in lindos rhodes richard allan garrison was fantasizing about the great mottled mindshark captain captain foster qary someone was yelling the voice was arnotts but choked strangled foster felt his grip broken was hurled back the slender thread which remained linking him to the world of dreams snapped the last revenant of qubwas hypnotic scenario vaporized as foster felt the pain of slamming backwards into a bulkhead but hands were there to grab him and hold him up he shook his head stared about through eyes which refused to focus shrugged off the two crew members who stood gaping at him what in hell then he looked down at himself where he stood trembling in shock brian lumley dressed in loose sweatsoaked issue pajamas he remembered now he had intended to sleep for an hour maybe a little longer across the ops area mike arnott was perched on a table massaging his throat foster moved unsteadily towards his ic mike what you tell me sir said the other hoarsely you floated in here like a ghost just a minute ago you were gabbling somethingdont ask me what i only caught one word nucacthen you grabbed me by the throat foster wasnt yet oriented i grabbed you youre on watch of course and nothing unusual no incoming signals fosters eyes were wide now staring only well this arnott answered the rest was routine he grabbed the others trembling arms held him steady gary what is it where are we the captains breathing was slowing down regulating itself he peered at location charts sighed his relief an hour from turnabout thank god where did you think we were arnott was incredulous were you asleep dreaming foster nodded only explanation sleepwalking too apparently he almost fell into a chair reaction catching up with him it was the big onenucac arnotts eyebrows went up he nodded to the crewmen you two wait outside a minute they left sir thats a funny sort of dream youve had he shrugged understandable consider psychosphere ing our job but been pushing it too hard perhaps foster looked at him narrowed his eyes that could be the answer i suppose dont concern yourself ill have a checkup but id like it if this didnt go any further speak to those two will you he nodded towards the hatchway of course good now id better get some clothes on foster turned away glad that his cabin was close by as for the checkup he would speak to the ships doctor and hed see another doctor laterjust as soon as moth got back to rosyth thwarted on leaving fosters mind qubwa should have soared instantaneously back to his own seat of consciousness in the castle but something intervened another mind moved in the psychosphere was close almost on a collision course there was no real contact but an awarenessfrom which qubwa recoiled no less sharply than the other two wary forces facing each other drawing back finally fleeing in mutual panic and gubwa snapped open his eyes in the castle starting at once to his feet if he had been furious before now he was doubly soand not a little worried now what had that been who of course there were other minds in the psychosphere the psychosphere was the essence of all sentience of mental intelligence but the vast majority of minds were no more aware of brian lumley the psychosphere than a bird is aware of air this mind had been aware or had seemed so and qubwa had sensed fear perhaps in which case the close brush had probably been accidental the castles master knew that the russians had their own telepaths as did the americans they had a certain raw talent these espers but they were amateurs compared with qubwa fifty percent of what they learned was guesswork none of it could ever be trusted polaris submarines were almost impossible to detect through technology so it could have been a russian mind qubwa had come up against even an american for that matter and because it had been unexpected qubwa had panicked he snorted obviously the usa and ussrone of them at leastwas making some progress in the training and use of espendowed surveillance agents telepathic spies it was something which would bear looking into but meanwhile there was the other problem the fact that foster had broken free of qubwas control had refused to press the nucac button oh in a genuine crisis he would respond to training of course he wouldbut even then he would have to be absolutely certain of the nature of the situation this uas his training had to be the world could not afford that kind of mistake given the smallest loophole or blind spot in even the most perfect scenario foster would reject it qubwa couldnt win the castles master cursed vividly it was a problem if he could not control fosters single psychosphere mind how could he hope to control both his and his ics simultaneously trust great britain to build these sort of dualcontrol failsafe systems into its hardware well facts must be faced up to moth was out of the question the other polaris subs too unless slowly a poisonous transformation took place in qubwas gross features suddenly smiling he cursed againcursed himself for a fool the easy way is always the simplest way why even attempt to control two minds simultaneously or fouror sixwhen you can control the mind which controls those minds after all moth got her orders by radio didnt she and the operator who sent them was only one man wasnt he one mind and if there was trouble there why qubwa could always take it higher he laughed out loud of course he could right to the admiralty itself chapter vicki maler redhaired and marvellously goldeneyed her slim elfin face cocked a little to one sidevicki maler oncedead and cryogenically suspended at schloss zonigen in the swiss alps returned to life through the will of her lover richard allan garrisonstood now beside the bed where garrison tossed and turned in the throes of nightmare she did not wish to wake him despite the occasional spastic twitching of his limbs and the starting of salty droplets from his neck and the hollow between his shoulder blades no for one could never be certain of his mood when first roused from sleep not these days hot any longer vickis thoughts were her own they were as private vital and original as any she had conjured in her previous life or as she thought of psychosphere it now in that earlier time before the final hideous acceleration of the creeping cancer which had ravaged her body to its painful death and because she was intelligent because she knew garrison to be the instrument of her revival her reincarnation the fact that her mind retained its individuality vaguely surprised her for not only had garrison replenished her body and driven out the killing cancer but also her mind he had revitalized it intact inquiring and unique as any mind and not at all a product or substructure of his own expanded muitimind she was in short her own person mo she corrected herself she was garrisons person for he had left her in no doubt as to her fate should any accident befall him when she must surely return to her previous state whose clay shell however vital now must crumble as a centuried mummy exposed to air and light oh yes for if vicki seemed bright and unflickering an electrical glow in lifes filament then garrison himself was the light switch and if he were switched off as a girl in her teens vicki had read poe lovecraft and wilde she well remembered the horrific demise of m valdemar and that of dr munoz her fate too should garrison die but she was more inclined to associate garrison himself with the terrible fate of dorian gray not that garrison had ever been a man of great vices he had not but things had happened to him things vicki supposed she should be grateful for those things but still she preferred to remem brian lumley ber garrison as he had been in that earlier time then he had been well just garrison but that had been before the changes before her rebirth odd but despite the fact that she was the same girl she had been earlier vicki nevertheless felt yes reincarnated after all eight years had gone by without her active physical presence in the world when she had laindormantin her cryogenic crypt at schloss zonigen but for garrison they had been real waking years and strange ones moreover vickis body had all the vitality and strength of her precancer years or at least of those years before the disease had commenced to drain her so that in a sense she had been born again into a younger body than the one she last remembered she shuddered at the thought the body she remembered the husk the painriven shell the bewildered flesh whose contamination had bloated and burned and filled her veins with the fire of stricken cells in ravenous monstrous mutation a body full of cancer livid with pain no with agony vicki shuddered again she not only remembered the cause of her death but death itselfor himself she had actually known his touch the cruelly constricting fingers of the grim reaper and not merely his touch but his iron grasp and in her case those bony fingers had been of fireor of acid death the old man the oldest man in the psychosphere world who could not die himself until he had snuffed out the very last life immortal therefore immortal and cruel certainly in the worst of her painracked days vicki had felt that someone enjoyed her agony else why should she suffer it if all were to balance then there must be an enjoyment equal to her suffering well finally she had the last laugh for death the one immortal now had a second immortal to contend with the old man must now wait on the demise of one richard allan garrison and garrison did not intend to die not ever garrison stirred and mumbled something in his sleep then flopped over on to his back he was through the worst of his nightmare and the sweat was drying on him vicki listened to his nearinarticulate mouthings he mentioned schroeder she thought and roenig the sounds coming out in a jumble vicki allowed herself a third this time quite deliberate shudder and peered intently into his face it seemed calm now resigned almost but beneath those closed eyelids she straightened and stepped silently to the rooms giltframed mirror the gold of her eyes matched the yellow glow of the frame burning in the reflected fire of the days last ray of sunlight she marvelled at her own eyesthose golden eyes which had been blind in that earlier time blind for many yearstheir sight now restored through the will of garrison his own eyes too blinded by fire and blast repaired miraculously in glowing uniformly golden orbs brian lumley eyes which saw more much more than those of other men miraculous yes garrison performed miracles his powers were very nearly infinite they had seemed so at one time but he himself did not knowhad never fully exploredthe extent or limitations of his powers in fact of late he had kept an uneasy silence on the subject she turned to him again where he lay her movements edgy nervous and silently she repeated to herself miracles but wasnt that a godgiven gift the power to work miracles and if there really was a god why should he so reward garrison or any human being for that matter or perhaps there actually was a godnow had there been others with garrisonss powers vicki wondered what of the old legends what of merlin and the great wizards of immemorial myth her thoughts became blasphemous what of jesus christ he too had restored sight to the blind raised up the dead walked on the water hadnt he but no cases were different his miracles were generally accepted as having been all to the good garrisons were sometimes other than that her thoughts turned abruptly to their whereabouts the decision to go to the aegean had been made as were most of garrisons decisions on the spur of the moment his pilot had been on holiday and psychosphere so not immediately available which was why just one week ago he had chartered a private plane and crew to fly them out to rhodes airport there was a second route he once might have takena rather more esoteric routebut in the world of passport controls a world where miracles would doubtless attract attention he had chosen the much more cumbersome and in his own words mechanical flight method the house they had hired in lindos consisted in fact of a nest of three holiday villas or apartments with their own secluded courtyard they occupied only the largest room leaving the other two standing empty they had eaten out with only one exception when garrison had cooked a pair of large gray mullet selfcaught on the trident of a rubberpowered speargun purchased in rhodes garrison was an excellent swimmer and spearfisherman his prowess in the latter deriving from three sundrenched years in cyprus as a corporal in the royal military police here in lindos however he had quickly lost interest in the sport he had soon realized that there was little skill involved and no thrill whatsoever when one might simply command the fishes to impale themselves upon the tines of ones harpoon and so in a matter of days they had settled down to an existence of hot idle days and balmy nights of not unreasonable wines and cheap island brandy and of good local meats and fruits in the village tavernas and yet even in this nearexotic idyllic setting of lindoswith its narrow brian lumley psychosphere white labyrinthine streets church towers elaborate archways its draindwelling nightventuring frogs and tumult of catseven here they had not felt totally at ease the problem as most of their problems had its roots in garrisons multipersonality usually the schroeder and koenig facets took a back seat or were subsumed in garrisons far stronger seat of consciousnessbut on occasion they would come bursting to the forefront often vicki thought unnecessarily and far too forcefully her thoughts took her back to an incident as recent as yesterday one which perfectly illustrated her point after their openair patio breakfast garrison had suggested they walk they had taken the path that led out of the village to a quiet sheltered bay of yellow sand between white flanking rocks and looming perpendicular cliffs feeling the heat of a suddenly breathless midday they had wandered from the path to seat themselves on tumbled boulders beneath the overhang of screeshod cliffs that reached up to the mightier precipitously concave rock of the acropolis itself at their feet where they sat lay a large bed of cabbageleaved plants sporadically decorated with small yellow flowers much similar to the english primrose with many green oval fruitpods some two inches long each pod hanging heavily from its own individual stem as they had sat down so garrisons leg had brushed against one of these fruits which with a quite audible squelching or popping sound had at once jetpropelled itself from its stem to go bounding about amidst the thick leaves until it found a gap and fell through to the shaded earth beneath at the moment of the explosion garrison had jerked away from the plant but not before feeling a splash of liquid on his hand and forearm you should wipe your hand vicki had been a little concerned that juice is mildly causticor poisonous i cant remember which but ive read about it somewhere or other garrison had sniffed at his wrist wrinkled his nose and grinned catspissl he snortedbut he had nevertheless used his handkerchief to clean the affected areas and vicki had laughed at his exclamation for of course this had been garrison pure and simple garrison himself the man she had loved in that earlier world a natural man and unselfconscious a couple of greek youths had taken the same welltrodden route to the beach walking a little to their rear neither vicki nor garrison had attached any significance to this it was a free world in any case the youths seemed little more than kids fifteen or sixteen at most and brothers by their looks and by far the great majority of lindos people were kindly and utterly charming there had been few people aboutone or two couples slowly negotiating a rough ramp cut in the cliffs face down to the beach and a scattered handful on the beach itselfbut that was just exactly how garrison had wanted it this had been his prime purpose in coming out to rhodes in the first place an escape from the brian lumley rush and bustle and pressures of a life which for the last year at l ast had seemed to catch him up like an insect in the cogs of some vast machine but an insect of carbon steel which could not be crushed and without which the machine itself could not function for garrison controlledno he wasthat machine not quite selfmade but certainly selfsustaining selfservicing even the finest machine needs a little oil however and this holiday was to have been just that light lubrication for the gears of a life suddenly grown vastly complicated more than that it was to give him time to consider his future to ponder what best to do with the powers his multimind controlledthose powers which with each passing day he felt weakening in him draining from him like the slow trickle of sand from the glass globe of an hourglass vicki had been silent dwelling a little sntrospectively on her life with garrison happy just to sit beside the calm apparently greatly relaxed and benign figure of her companionat least until she heard the clatter of pebbles and the indolent slap slap of sandals which announced the arrival of the two greek boys at that she sighed she had known then why they had been followed taking little pride in the knowledge that her own brown and beautifully proportioned body was the magnet which had drawn these adolescent islanders after her she felt only a niggling annoyance she was skimpily dressed true in a tiny green halter green figurehugging psychosphere shorts and white sandalsbut surely these lads could find themselves a pair of girls more their own age to ogle while it was still fairly early in the tourist season still the village was full of just such apparently unattended young ladies english german italian scandinavian or perhaps the youths had mistakenly suspected that vicki and garrison had something other in mind than merely sitting in silent contemplation in the shade of the rocks garrison too had noticed the approach of the boys and for a moment he had grinned goodnaturedly he had of course immediately guessed their motive and a glancethe merest peepinside their minds had confirmed it well boys are boys and greek boys are greek boys and no complaints there but then as the youths had taken seats upon rocks in the middle of the podbearing plants and openly stared at garrison and his lovely companionparticularly and pointedly at vickithe grin had quickly slipped from garrisons face one of the minds his own had touched upon was a distinctly unpleasant one whose strong sexual overtones were warped and vicious he was full of animal lust in garrisons brief glimpse inside the youths head he had found him savagely assaulting vicki slimy with sweat and sex the attack was unnatural as it was murderous nor were these mindscenes mere fantasies but repeats of an earlier assault a real assault but with vickis face and figure superimposed the youth was or had been the author of a rabidly cruel rape brian lumley and as garrisons face had hardened and taken on a grimmer aspect so he had slowly risen to his feet drawing vicki up with him he had hissed in her ear that older boys a rapist what but how could you possibly she beganand paused for of course she knew that if anyone in the world could know such a thing that someone was garrison and when he cant do it he likes to think about doing it garrisons voice had turned to a snarl doing it to you his face had twisted in rage its color rapidly draining away vicki knew that behind garrisons heavy sunglasses with their builtup sides his golden eyes were burning bright come he said wir gehen he halfdragged her from beneath the shade of the rock hurriedly picking a way through boulders and coarse shrubs and grasses back to the path stumbling behind him she had known fear his being was in flux its change betrayed by a voice which retained very little of richard garrisons true nature there was a certain harshness about that voice and those words he had spoken in german he paused to fill his lungs drew her up alongside him his fingers tightened on her side digging into the flesh of her waist he glanced backand his face was no longer garrisons not quite thomas vicki whispered her companions eyebrows formed a frown drew together dipped down in the center be psychosphere hind his special glasses his gaze was upon the pair of youths where they stood now amidst the patch of podbearing plants for their part they stared back the face of the older one wearing a contemptuous grin swine garrisonschroeder said but the word had sounded more like schwein to vicki she had known instinctively that he scanned the youths mind more deeply now richard vicki had clutched his arm its not your business but it has to be somebodys he told her harshly and you are my businessand that bastards thinking things about you he needs a lesson and again his eyebrows had drawn together at that very moment vicki had heard the sudden yelping of the youths she had followed garrisonschroeders gazeand behind her own special sunglasses her golden eyes had gone very wide she gasped at what she saw the younger greek was stumbling jerkily out of the patch of podplants backing away from the other youth until he came up against the white rock of the cliff the older boy the unwitting subject of garrisons manipulation stood as if rooted to the spotwhile all around him the sprawling bed of vegetation went totally insane it was a scene of madness an alien scene or one perhaps from earths prime when the flora could more ably match the fauna in ferocity the plants tossed and churned each leaf violently flapping pods straining swelling and bursting brian lumley from their stems with sounds like muted machinegun fire and their juicesconcerted directedfell upon the greek youth where he stood wildly windmilling his arms his feet apparently mired in the now sodden earth then in a final frenzy a last burst of vegetable violence the entire patch ejaculated into his eyes the youth screamed and clapped his hands to his face his hair the skin of his face his entire upper torso was drenched in plant fluidbut at last he could move and now he commenced a grim hopping dance of agony no vicki had cried nein richard bitte blind ihm nicht garrison had glanced down at her in his face she had seen something of him also a lingering trace of thomas schroederbut mainly the blunt hardness of willy koenig garrisons third facet had surfaced the most ruthless facet of all as you will garrisonkoenigs voice rasped and youre right of course vickifor we know what its like to be blind dont we but mis gaze fell once more upon the terrified youth the podbearing plants were dead now wilted and shrivelled black and stinking their stench wafted to garrison and vicki on a breeze suddenly blown up from the sea the greek youths agonized dance had slowed to a moaning stagger his feet stumbling in the slop of decaying vegetation he still clutched at his face but in another moment stood still and tentatively took away his hands peering gingerly unbelievingly all about him the pain went out of his eyes and psychosphere blotched face and he began to laugh hysterically but only for a moment a lesson garrisonkoenig repeatedand with his words the greek youths eyes suddenly stood out from their sockets he gave a great howl threw his hands down as if to protect his groin bent forward and fell facedown in the rot of decay and there he lay his body threshing spasmodically upon the putrid earth garrison climbed up on to the path and turned towards the village vicki ran after him her red hair flying behind her richard you didnt mo i didnt he answered her unspoken question i didnt ruin them merely kicked him in them a sort of forever kick a forever kick she caught him up grabbed at his hand he paused in his striding to put an arm around her the strength in his fingers was hard rough in no way the gentle firm grip of richard garrison not of garrison alone he nodded i simply put another kink in his minda kink to counter those already there from now on whenever he looks at or thinks of a woman that way like a beast hell feel like hes just been shot in the balls but in effect thats castration right but its less than what id have done to him if you hadnt stopped me chapter that had been yesterday amd by the time they got back to their rooms garrison had been himself once moreor as much himself as he ever could be there was an aftermath however inevitable in the wake of any resurgence of his schroeder and koenig facets a scratchy unreasoning irritability vicki totally aware of garrisons jekyll and two hydes existence and as well versed as could be expected in such matters had coped with the problem in a manner tried and trusted namely she had plied garrisons senses with a bottle of dirtcheap brandy strange how this simple device always seemed to turn the trick or perhaps not so strange when one thought about it bad brandy had been garrisons tipple ever since his cyprus initiation when on occasion psychosphere usually after several losing hands of threecard brag a bottle of onestar had been all he could afford to buy and so he had actually come to like even to prefer the stuff on the other hand but of equal consequence bad brandy had certainly not been thomas schroeders drink whose taste had always been impeccable and therefore far more expensive nor had koenig a born schnapps drinker ever greatly fancied garrisons favorite the way brandy worked vicki suspected was simply as a stabilizer it helped him stay in characteror helped his character stay in him on this occasion lindos too had helped for the old garrison had been very medconscious had loved the mediterranean from first sight and a third stabilizer was their sex even though their affair in that earlier time had been brief it had been intense she had remembered his preferences and in the two years flown since her resurrection had practiced pleasuring him until she was expert no woman knew or had ever known garrisons body or the way it responded to sexual stimuli better than vicki maler as for the schroeder and koenig facets their tastes were entirely different moreover they respected garrisonso far at leastand they had never intruded or in any way attempted ascendence in this respect for that vicki was naturally glad but in another way and however paradoxically she was brian lurnley not so glad she was fairly sure that garrison himself was faithful to her but there had been more than a few occasionsalways when he had found it necessary to let one of his alterfacets take ascendencywhen his body had absented itself from her bed often for two or three nights at a stretch twice she had found evidence of his visiting highclass london call girls and she was well aware that a onetime secretary of thomas schroeder one mina qrunwald now lived in mayfair where garrison was in the habit of seeing her this then was vickis problem the reason for her yes jealousy that while she knew that the schroederkoenig facets respected garrisons privacy she could not be one hundred percent certain that he respected theirs after all his was the original dominant facet and it remained housed in its own body vicki was not yet quite used to the idea that when the subsidiary facets were in ascendence they could use that body to sate their own sexual appetites fortunately neither one of the subsumed or adopted characters had been overtly sexual in their own bodies else vicki might not have been able to live with her own feelings and emotions but then again what could she have done about it she knew for a certainty and quite literally that she could not live without garrison or so she had been led to believe at any rate her ploy had worked yet again when the cheap brandy her own body and the greek island atmosphere had all combined perfectly to dampen garrisons excitability and psychosphere bring about a complete resurgence of his true identity at eight in the evening he had desired to go out they had eaten in the villages best taverna where he had consumed a little more of the local brandy following which they had found a disco and danced the night away so that the stars had already started to fade in the sky by the time they had returned to their rooms garrison had been tired by then perhaps too tired to sleep and it was plain there was somethingperhaps many thingson his mind things he must talk about having changed into cool night clothes the pair had sprawled themselves upon a wide raised lindos bed to talk and sip coffee and after a while garrison had asked vicki how much have i told you ever i mean you never asked me a hell of a lotnever pushed it anywaybut how much have i really told you some things you told me richard some i guessed after i woke up mean when lived againyou told me a lot of things you didnt really say anything not in words but was made to understand a lot you remember oh yes he nodded was kind of a god wasnt i could just get into your mind and make you understand for the first time since her reincarnation vicki definitely felt his uncertainty amazingly garrison seemed to be displaying insecurity his words were all past tense i was a god i could get into your mind your powers are still godlike richard she told him brian lumley you mean demoniac he replied but without venom my powers when use them are safe safe they dont hurt anyone not much anyway not deliberately but vicki he caught up her hand almost pleadingly when they use them oh richard know but you dont know not everything some of the things theyve done they go way over the top they protect me yes but they overprotect they wont let me run my own life my own body hell its riot my own bodyits theirs too he was nervously massaging her fingers drawing comfort from her presence how did it come about she eventually asked i mean at the beginning garrison sighed lets see if can break it down for you thomas schroeder wanted to be immortal he was deep into parapsychology augury transmigrationall that stuff we were in northern ireland him on business me as a soldier id been having this recurring dream about bombs that wasnt odd in itself lots of the boys over there dream about bombs its all part of the job but my dream my nightmare was different it wouldnt go away it came to me night after night a warning about something i could neither escape nor even avoid so it happened my first glimpse of esp in action the first hint that maybe my mind was different from the minds of other men there was a bomb blast i saved schroeders life the lives of his wife and kid they were ok but he was psychosphere badly chopped up inside and i was blinded afterwardswell it worked out that he thought he owed me he did owe you richard i remember all of that like it was yesterday you coming out to the harz how proud you were how smart in your uniform oh yes all of that garrison grunted but before i got out there things had happened for one thing schroeder knew by then that he was dying and he didnt want to stay dead reincarnationin me she nodded i knew something was going on that his interest in you should be soconsuming garrison smiled wryly consuming yes he repeated her anyway i had always had a quiet interest in schroeders sort of thing the paranormal mean and i admit he fascinated me but at the same time i didnt believe he could do it you know it was too weird i might just have washed my hands of the whole thing but there was a carrot for the donkey that carrot was a friend of schroeders a guy called adam schenk he predicted schroeders death yours too a lot of things and for me he predicted id see again this would be made possible through schroeder himself and through a machine what sort of machine he shrugged i didnt know not then anyway out there in the harz things were happening to me schroeder had a lot of tricks up his sleeve a whole building full of them gear for testing a mans esp potential he tested mine and it was high very high and all the time i was brian lumley psychosphere becoming more and more convinced that he really had something and anyway how could i lose all the dice were loaded in my favor i was blindhe offered me sight i was an exsoldier crippledhe offered me money money beyond my wildest dreams i was a nothing a nobody with nowhere to goand he offered me power and position how could refuse you couldnt vicki answered i didnt we made a pact garrison shrugged again simple as that no big deal we just agreed that when he died if something of him remained and if it could find its way to me then that id receive it he could live again in me in return there was the chance however remote that id see again meanwhile there were a couple of tricks to help me find my way around the blindness i had special spectacles that worked on sound instead of vision i had bracelets for my wrists too which worked the same way and i had suzy my dear wonderful suzy shes getting old now but i look after her helland hasnt she looked after me for a moment he grinned damned right she has the smile slipped a little and he nodded and of course there was willy koenig willy looked after me toojust as hed always looked after thomas his beloved colonel the smile slipped away completely just as hes looking after us even nowdamn him richard she gripped his hand dont you only make it easy for them he relaxed grunted youre right of course i do make it easy for them and i really cant afford to riot any longer again the insecurity what is it richard he shook his head let me tell it my own way in my own time schroeder made me rich before he died after he died i was incredibly rich now even i dont know how rich i am you see since coming back hes opened up sources only he had the keys to funds which had doubled and sometimes trebled during the years passed between his interests were worldwide even in his lifetime he made some of your socalled tycoons look like penniless paupers by comparison and all of that is mine nowor ours his mine koenigs thirty guys have a big office in londonmore a block of offices really they look after my interests some of my interests anyway there are other people in zurich hamburg hong kong you name it but none of them knows what im really worth suddenly the world of international finance was open to me and i couldnt resist it and no risk involved with my esp powers working for me i couldnt pick a loser i was a midas everything i touched turned to gold and then then one day i heard about the machine i stumbled across psychomech as he paused vicki said youve missed something out richard what about your wife brian lumley psychosphere you never did tell me about her vickis voice was soft low or does it hurt too much he shook his head it doesnt hurt at all not now terr was something that had to beshed been foreseen by adam schenkand without her id never have found psychomech you might have remembered something about terri and her lover something unpleasant but i made you forget i removed it from your mind believe me it really doesnt matter now again he paused then continued in a burst anyway i found psychomech a machine that could blow up a mans darkest fears to giant sizeuntil theyre about to crush him or drive him insaneand then give him the strength to fight back to defeat them a tremendous boon to psychiatry a mechanical psychiatrist a tin shrink but think about it what happens if you totally liberate a mans mind if you rid it of all its fears would there be any limits to the scope of such a mind and what if that mind were already rich in psychic energy powers almost beyond imagination vickis golden eyes were wide behind dark lenses thats what happened to you she sighed the birth of a god he nodded or a demon yes but on my own i wasnt ready for it wasnt big or strong enough i had to have help had to let schroeder in fulfill our pact then we let koenig in vicki shuddered i seem to remember something of that willy was there and you told me not to be afraid and thenhe wasnt there any more garrison said it was the only way he wasnt like schroeder and me he was clever in his own way but not in ours and was a god psychomech had blown me up into something awesome i was bigger than myself bigger than schroeder and myself bigger than psychomechor so i thought my powers seemed immeasurable godi brought you back didnt i took away your agony gave you life sight absorbing willy was he shrugged a mere nothing ultimate power ultimate ego infinity stretching away and out before me infinity vicki with all its infinite possibilities until yes until something went wrong im not sure what or maybe i am maybe im ready to admit it now for a moment he was silent his mind miles away then anyway i destroyed psychomech he sat up and took her hands with psychomech i was could have been immortal without psychomech im a man a threedimensional body flesh and blood how could i hope to contain all of that power in this little battery i couldnt the battery leaks the power is leaving me more every day and now each time i useeach time they usethat power i grow just a little weaker do you remember my gambling phase london monte carlo las vegas do you know what that was all about i mean didnt you ever ask yourself what i got out of it me rich as croesus playing cards and roulette winning money on brian lumley the horses the football pools hell i wouldve enjoyed that sort of thing when was in the army but with my sort of money so why did i do it ill tell you why at first it was the sheer excitement oh i knew i couldnt lose but still it was exciting to win do you see every gamblers ultimate fantasy maybe my powers were wasted eh fantastic beautiful wonderful powers all locked up in an ordinary greedy conceited little body but in the end i stopped gambling i realized that the thrill had gone out of itthat i was doing it now for an entirely different reasondoing it because i had to mo it wasnt a vice i wasnt hooked on it mot that way but i had simply been testing myself because i knew that if ever the day came when i should lose then that your powers would be failing you she finished it for him nodding thats it he said thats it exactly i mean after psychomech i was a godfor a fortnight a month then i was a godlingfor how long a year mow a superman and tomorrow she wrapped her arms around him would be satisfied with you as a man richard just a man thats all you were when you first loved me when i fell in love with you and his laughter brittle as ice choking itself with its cold bitterness cut her short no vicki no he finally shook his head you dont see do you mow his words sounded strangely hollow and yet full of a sadness you would not be satisfied because you simply would not be you psychosphere areyou existbecause of my power because i commanded it but i ive tried to explain before vicki what would become of you if i were simply a man what will become of you if that day should ever arrive when my commands go unheard unheeded she had no answer only a memory the memory of acid in her veins a burning current in her blood the whitehot grip of deaths bony fingers yes garrison had nodded grimly thats it exactly after that there had been little more to say and then it had taken them a long time to get to sleep when finally they did garrison had dreamed chapter garrisons dream began as had another dream some ten years earlier with a machine the machine the machine known as psychomech it was not a car or a motorcycle or an airplane that machine not any sort of conveyance one might readily imagine and yet garrison rode it his journey or quest was symbolic for symbolism is one with the very nature of dreaming but like any ordinary dreamer he was not given to know that he had not known it in that earlier dream neither did he know it nownor indeed that this new dream would be equally prophetic and much more of an omen but he rode the machine he rode it through weird alien valleys where tall lichenclad rocks cast ominous ochre shadows flew it high over dazzling furnace deserts psychosphere and yast tundras of yellow marshland sailed it across strange gray oceans whose giant squidlike denizens rolled up their saucer eyes to gaze unblinkingly upon him and with it threaded previously unvoyaged paths through the mazy gorges and passes and precipitous needlepeaks of scarlet mountains he rode effortlessly with authority towards quests end without ever knowing what the end of the quest would be but for all his apparent mastery of the machinethat machine which while it seemed almost omnipotent for the moment he nevertheless and naggingly suspected to be slowly failing gradually leaking its energies and wasting them uselesslystill he knew there would be obstacles in the way in this world as real to garrison as the dreamworld of any dreamer there were always obstacles had he not faced them before oh yes he had been here before several times this much he knew but he could not remember when or why or what his quests had been on those previous occasions he did know he had not been alone there had beenfriends friends yes suzy had been one such suzy the name was warm in garrisons mind a comfort to him suzy the dog the black doberman bitch and almost as if he were a magician as if remembering her had conjured the physical suzy out of midair he became suddenly aware of her presence she was there even now seated on her haunches close behind him on the broad back of the machine one great paw firm on his shoulder her warm breath on the back brian lumley of his neck and her occasional muted whining a reassurance in his ear suzy garrisons familiar spirit how long she had been there he could not say perhaps he really had conjured her out of thin air for certainly he controlled stange powers he remembered that now how he was gifted with powers far beyond the grasp of mundane men a magician garrison smiled at the thought yes a magician a wonderworker a warlock and suzy his familiar but what sort of warlock who could not remember the nature of his quest or how he came to be here or even where he came from or perhaps some other warlock more powerful yet had robbed him of his memory garrison became wary were there enemies here close by in his mind he began to check off points in his favor he was strong and he had powers he had the machine and he had suzy and he frowned forcing himself to concentrate there had been otherfriends their names came to him in a sudden vivid flash of memory schroeder and koenig strange namesand stranger friends now he remembered schroeder had been the mangod and koenig his familiar but that all seemed so very long ago and where were they now these two garrison shuddered as a tiny voice from within seemed to whisper closer than you think richard much closer the images of schroeder and koenig burned bright a while longer in the eye of garrisons psychosphere memory the former lean and pale small and balding older than garrison and wise in the ways of men wise as the bright eyes that gleamed huge behind thick crystal lenses and koenig huge and blocky bullnecked and pigeyed his sandy hair cropped in a crewcut with hands and feet and body and head all honed to a perfect razors edge in deathdealing arts their images burned bright before flaring up and blinking out like snuffed candles they were gone but their names remained schroeder and koenig and again that tiny voice seemed to whisper in garrisons mindor perhaps it laughed or maybe it was not one voice at all but two a sudden chill drew him from his reverie that and suzys great paw insistently scratching at his shoulder lost in thought as he had been his mechanical mount had continued to forge ahead under its own direction the machine had negotiated the maze of mountainous needlepeaks and now paused at the rim of a canyon whose sides sank sheer into a haze of mist and depth and darkness it was a canyon whose deeps were unplumbed whose secrets remained unfathomed and whose name was death death has many shapes and sizes colors creeds and guises garrison knew that also instinctively he knew that this canyon was one such guise he jerked his body back from the yawning gorge hauling on mental reinsand the machine reared beneath him like a startled horse cold and afraid he yet gentled his metal and brian lumley plastic steed while behind htmsuzys breathless barking and pawing warned him that his fear was not unjust garrison felt it in his guts like an icy blade he feared death but how so he was a wizard and immortal and immortal his mind grasped at the word the concept crushed it and held it close examined it immortal undying why then should he fear death unless unless he was mistaken perhaps he was not immortal after all perhaps that was the nature of his quest to seek out and seduce the goddess immortality and to do thatwhy naturally he must first overcome death himself in whichever guise he found him very well the canyon was one such guise and so he must cross it but what if he should fall he nodded and smiled however wryly fall he could not fall the merest command by word or thought and he would bebuoyed up he remembered the word for it levitation and himself a master of the art how then might he fall consciously he could not unconsciously the fall would crush his body and so kill him a large stone banged against his head would break it and also kill him left alone he might just be immortal but if some accident should occuror an unsuspected hand directed against him oh yes a clever enemy could kill him he could be made to die perhaps that then was his quest the search psychosphere for true immortality and only death standing between himself and quests end death and his minions motionless the machine stood in air with evening on the one hand staining the far horizon and on the other a sinking sun whose rim showed like a scythe above far purple hills and directly in garrisons way this canyon whose gaping maw split the land as far as the eye could see no way round it garrison knew now it was here to test him a moaning wind came up and stirred the dry dust of the canyons rim into spiralling devils whipping at the legs of garrisons tattered trousers it was a chill wind reminding him of night which drew closer by the minute no good to be caught out here exposed in the open when darkness fell he scanned the far side of the chasm a flat expanse wooded in places reaching back to low hills beyond which a darkening horizon merged with a darkening sky he must cross and soon he felt a sudden urge to ride furiously forward now out over the rim without another second wastedbut suzy seemed to read his mind and whined afresh in his ear her paw digging insistently into his shoulder he turned to her where are they girl eh where do they hide deaths soldiers she licked at his ear her moist eyes anxious then pointed with her muzzle down into the gorge the loose flesh of her mouth drew back in a snarl exposing sharp ivory fangs and her ears lay flat upon her head left and right she gazed brian lumley and up into the high sky and her black coat bristled into a million spines that stood out stiff from her body then the spell was broken she lay down panting offering up a series of baffled curious short yelping barks garrison smiled grimly everywhere eh well i suppose i knew that then his grim smile became a frown and he grew angry againat his own frailty his indecision weakness and him with such powers to command tool he cursed himself wasting time like this he quickly set the machine to rest upon the canyons rim climbed down from its back and stretched his limbs suzy jumped down beside him easier now her tongue lolling her eyes gazing at him inquiringly he patted her great black head lets see whats in store for us eh qlrl and placing his hands on his hips he lifted up his head and arrogantly threw out his voice across the darkening gorge death his voice was strong echoing loudly i know you seek to claim me well that wont be so easy im no ordinary man simply to die at your command be sure and now i command you show yourself death show me your soldiers your devices your pitfalls so that ill know them and give you a better fight or are you really the great skulking coward i suspect you to be he waited expectantlyperhaps just a little nervously despite his bold stancebut no answer psychosphere the wind from the gorge moaned louder and garrison felt its chill more keenly he shivered his flesh shuddering as shadows started to creep and what now for plainly he had been correct in the first instance not only had some greater warlock robbed him of his memory but also of his powers there once was a time when he might have drawn strength from the machine but now it was worth a try he laid his hands upon smooth metal flanks searching for those weird energies which had sustained him through so many strange adventures nothing the machine was cold lifeless as an old log steed he snarled snatching back his hands in frustration you a steed a beast of burden a burden sure enough an anchor carry me on the contrary i carry you yes and you weigh me down he turned his back on the machine and roared his rage and defiance out over the shadowed gorge death ill not be denied if you wont show yourself then ill not come to you why should i meet a challenge dont understand right opponents i dont know cant see no ill simply wait here or go back the way i cameand to hell with questing richard came a faint whisper seemingly from within his own mind richard i can help youif youll let me garrisons hair bristled on his head and his flesh grew clammy he knew that voice soundless except in the immense caverns of his own brian lumley mind that insinuating whisper from within it was the voice of the vanished mangod schroeder who in another world he had called his friend is that you mangod he sought confirmation or are you in fact death seeking to make a fool of me if you really are thomas schroeder then show yourself the voice within chuckled however drily oh you know me well enough richard and you know i cannot show myself not in the flesh not any more but i can still help you if you will let me garrison was still suspicious you help me true you were a mangod thomasbut no more how would you help me ghost i am flesh and blood and youa mere memory a voice in my head more than that richard the whisper was stronger now gaining in confidence and if your memory was whole youd know it myselfand willy koenig toowere more than mere voices in your head and we can still help you just as we helped you before garrison listened to the whispering voice and frowned more darkly and at his side suzy whined and tugged at his trousers with her teeth finally he said i do remember something of it that you helped me yesbut also that your reward was greater than your effort warranted but you paid readily enough in the end the voice in his head answered else your life your sanity your survival were forfeit thats a lie garrison snarled i paid grudg psychosphere ingly despite the fact that i bought my mind my life but you had tricked me into a pact and i would not break it he calmed himself down before continuing this much i remember at least that you sought to serve yourself not me he shrugged still i suppose thats in all of us as for koenig he was my true friend but you i too was your friend richard i am now i seek only to help you and night draws on garrison turned up the collar of his ragged jacket schroeder was right for the sun was almost down and the shadows advanced visibly but still he was suspicious i paid you once for your help and didnt like the price you asked oh i cant remember what you took from me but i know it had great value i know that it was worth too much what fee is it youll demand this time eh the whisper grew stronger almost eager and its reply was instantaneous equality equality explain you want to be my equal yes garrison pondered it what did it mean whats in a word equality is a stone equal to another stone and men a man is a man after all but i came the whisper knowing his inmost thoughts am little more than a revenant a ghost you said so yourself you desire flesh for your thoughts is that it ill explain no more i desire equality nothing else and for koenig in answer to that garrison sensed a mental shrug then as if an afterthought koenig is brian lumley koenig i am me or desire to be the echoes of the whisper faded away and garrison suspected that the unseen whisperer had almost said too much but equality what did schroeder the ghost who was once schroeder the mangod mean this was very important if only garrison could remember all of it buthe could not how can i promise whats not mine to give he asked eventually simply promise it came the eager whisper very well on one condition name it that youll aid me wherever you can to quests end and now laughter welling up from inside pealing laughter from within subsiding slowly into a dry chuckling and finally petering out my friend how can deny you yes and you shall have koenigs help too agreed said garrison and nowshow me what you can of the way ahead show me my enemies the soldiers of death show methe future ah the whisper was thin now receding not so long ago you would not have needed me for that it would have been a very small magic but your powers are deserting you richard you are their master still but for how much longer youre right garrison snapped the machine is dead or dying and my powers are failing along with the machine but his anger went out of him in a great sighing breath why are psychosphere these things happening thomas do you know the answer if you do and if you really are my friend youll tell me faintly a mere tremor in his mind dont you remember richard you stopped the machine you killed the beast this thing you carry with you is only a cold metal and plastic carcass even more of a revenant than i am psychomech is dead dont go garrison cried afraid once more the futureyou promised indeed came the very sigh of an answer very well lets see what we may see and the whisperer was gone garrison blinked his eyes started gazed wildly all about the machine sat there leaden dead suzy whined and cringed at his feet her tail tucked between her legs cragcast shadows crept closer still and the vanished sun shot up a few last beams to lend a dying glow to the distant horizon soon that horizon would be black soon night would spread her blackest cloak upon the land and the canyon still to be crossed and the tale of the future as yet untold then when garrison had all but given up hope a spark in his mind a glowing point of light emanating from that inmost region where schroeders ghost held dominion a light growing brighter by the second expanding blossoming intoa vision a vision so dazzling that the earth seemed to reel under garrisons feet sending him staggering stumbling falling to his knees a vision so brian lumley real that he not only viewed it but lived it was part of it a dream within a dream seeming more vital than the dream itself a dream of the future his future a dream and a nightmare but in the first instance the dream the beautiful dream chapter garrison saw the goddess immortality beyond any doubt even though her back was towards him he knew that it was she and he believed he knew why her face as yet was denied him for who might guess the consequences of gazing unprepared upon such a face but certainly it was could only be the goddess herself the beauty of her form was undying her figure her posture the incredible garment she worethe very throne upon which she sat carved from the rock of life everlastingall offered mute witness to her immortality but her face was something which for the moment mercifully garrison could not see of her flesh however of thigh and shoulder and neck where they showed they were of the misted marble of eternity the softest and yet brian lumley most durable surface imaginable so that garrisons entire being seemed to sigh and sway forward drawn by the magnet of immortalitys flesh her hair was the jet of deepest space the nails of her fingers and toes were crimson as the blood of time and her garment it was of the shimmering silver micromesh of unbreakable continuity but her voicethat voice when it camemust surely be the final proof positive of her identity who might describe it that voice whose texture if ever garrison should later attempt its recall was or would be all things to all men soft as winter snows warm as summer suns pure as purest gold and yet earthly as living loam someone seeks my seduction the million millionth man would live forever the voice laughed and slowly majestically she rose up from her throne turned and allowed garrison to gaze upon her face and framed by those blackest tresses of space he sawa void the void the great void which is filled with all things the roaring rushing reeling sucking spacetime continuum itselfinto which in a single instant he was irresistibly drawn sucked in rushed like a mote across the vault of the universe to gaze down uponthe all the sight was blinding unbearable and garrison closed his eyes not in terror or horror but at the sheer awesome beauty of it and the thought occurred to him if there is a place would be this is that place if theres wine i might drink this is the wine if for every man theres a destiny then let this be mine and if i psychosphere am not to be immortal if i am to die then let it be at once here and now but that was not to be in another moment whirled and hurled out into a cold and cruel reality he cried out his agony and vainly grasped at that which was already beyond his reach he grasped clutched and the nails of his fingers split open where they scrabbled uselessly at stone made slimy under a beating rain garrison cried out againhowled his frustration this timeas crazed lightnings beat all about him amidst the roaring of tumultuous waters and the earthshaking pounding of great hammers or of engines built by gods he made to rise found himself upon a steep slippery slope slid and rolled and clattered down the face of a screelittered decline to a jutting rocky ledge finally he came to a halt and lay there in the mud and the downpour all the wind knocked from him soaked and sucking at sodden air here in the partial lee of black rocks where they balanced on this precarious ledge at last he dared open his eyes fully and drag himself wearily to his feet and now he gazed out upon a bleak and monochrome scene a scene of wild desolationand of mans imposition on raw naturea scene monotonous in its power and wearying to the eye with one exception lightning crashed again lending the air a momentary brightness and causing garrison to shrink down and shutter his eyes but the scene of a moment ago still burned on his retinas his brian lumley location was halfway down the wall of a small valley perhaps a mile across dammed at one end where a manmade lake reached back its windtossed expanse of dark water into the cliffguarded recesses of a forbiddingly gloomy reentry water arced in six enormous spouts from the dams face its thunder the mighty hammering garrison had mistaken for the engines of gods he gazed out from a position almost directly above the great wall of the dam and the trembling of the earth was the vibration of its mighty generators and the rain which soaked him was that thrown up by the controlled eruption of pressured waters shielding his eyes against stinging spray and cold mist garrison peered across the valley at a wild skyline where once more he spied an unmistakable mark of man a platoon of titan pylons carrying ropes of cable marching doublefile away across the hills but while both dam and pylons were certainly human artifacts in the valley itself towards the far wall and in a timbered belt higher than the course of the old dammed river there stood that sole exception to the scenes almost awesome drabness a hemisphere of golden light like the bulge of some small sun halfsunken in the earth whose pulsating dome rose tall and dazzling over the tall pines it dwarfed lines altered by ego crept into the observers mind from some forgotten source in xanadu did garrison a stately pleasuredome decree butwas this really a pleasuredome or might it not be a temple a temple to a goddess psychosphere the goddess of immortality the thought persisted that this was indeed that temple wherein a moment ago he had come face to eternity with the goddess of his desire but why here in this desolate spot with the works of mere mortals so much in evidence and the throbbing golden glow of the dome why should it tug at his memory so of what did it remind him a good many questions and no time to explore them time barely to pose them before the scene shrank grew small as garrison was drawn out of himself his spirit snatched up in some great unseen fist and lifted at breathless speed into the sky until he looked dizzily down upon valley dam dome himself and all from a windy aerial elevation amongst the boiling clouds except except that even as he watched the scene grew dim and under his eyes the valley dam and dome disappeared were replaced by a parched plain of bones and skulls and hot white sandsand himself ragged and desiccated now gaunt as a starveling with puffed cracked lips and red staring eyes and behind him dragged inch after interminable inch across those burning sands the machine all rust red and trailing frayed cables and crusts of corrosion and now garrison felt his aerial observerself being set down upon a floor and he saw that the desert of bones and the starveling garrison and the crippled machine were only images trapped in an otherwise milky sphere a scene viewed in a shewstone a crystal ball and he himself or brian lumley his spirit now sat crosslegged in a circle of wizards or demons all intent upon the struggles of the garrison in the shewstone and the place where they sat was like the floor of a great pit with smoky flambeaux to give a little light and the atmosphere of the place was full of the reek of death and the sting of sulphur then knowing these seated beings for his enemies garrison gazed upon them each in turn and fixed them as best he might in his minds eyes so that he would know them if ever he saw them again and he saw that they were dressed in the various robes of wizards and that they carried the wands and charms and injurious devices of such one of them wore a black immaculate evening suit and bowtie and his features were dark and greedy and he spun a small roulette wheel between his crossed legs occasionally pausing to deal sharpedged cards at the shewstone as if to pierce its crystal and so harm the struggling garrison within and his wand was a heavy one and hung unseen in his armpit like a familiar toad causing the breast of his jacket to bulge where he sat among the wizards another was tall and slender and gray as a night cat covered head to toe in a zippered suit with bandolier and belt grapples and grenades and all and this ones eyes were steel in his face which was pale cold and emotionless and he toyed with a string of dark prayerbeads sometimes psychosphere slipping its noose over the shewstone as if to snare the beleaguered man within yet another was small and yellow with slanting eyes set in a face inscrutable as that of the sphinx and he sat motionless as carved from yellow stoneexcept for his eyes behind whose slanting slits the feral pupils followed each tiniest action of the miniature garrison trapped in the crystal ball and there were others all at odds and different in dress and mode of application but all of them muttering runes of destruction so that garrisons fear grew in the face of their massed enmity and he started slightly as he noted a pairseated close together and a little apart from the rest where shadows obscured themwhose looks were as the looks of two he remembered from a former time the looks of schroeder and koenig but he could not be certain for their forms and faces were made lumpish and vague in the flickering light from the pits flambeaux their interest did not seem inimical however rather the reverse for they shied from the others and their occupations about the shewstonebut still he gained the impression that their business here was a sly one and more in their own interests than in those of the tiny garrison one other he especially noted there in the gloom this one stood arms folded well back from all the rest and overlooked them and his outline was very wavery and unsolid so that garrison thought perhaps he gazed upon a ghost a ghost cloaked in a robe of secrecy brian lumley whose face and eyes even as garrison strained to see them more clearly turned full upon him and beneath the cowl of the secret ones robe gray eyes of a keen intelligence set in a face of stone a very solid ghost this or a most mysterious and secretive man but certainly not an enemy garrison could sense that much rather a covert watcher a guard perhaps and perhaps a friend a secret one indeed this man of stone at that very moment it seemed to garrison that following the lead of the secret one all of the other pitdwellers slowly began to turn their faces towards him it was as if for the first time they sensed that he was here and such was the malignant effect of this concerted movement this awful awarenessthat he sprang to his feet in a terror in which same moment he felt himself drawn up as if on invisible strings out of the pit to hover light as air over the concentric tiers of a great amphitheatre of the gods gods yes and the amphitheatre full of them about their pursuitsbut false gods garrison quickly saw who used their powers entirely to their own ends and not those of their followers and occasionally one such false god would go to the pits rim and look into it and nod his satisfaction or frown his disdain or disappointment so that garrison knew that the false gods controlled and approved the vile sorceries of the pitwizards for these gods were worse than the sorcerers and demons they governed and in their su psychosphere preme arrogance and insolence they had put on such robes of honor and wisdom as were never theirs rightly to wear they wore the great wigs of judges and the bowlers of politicians the learned aspect of leaders and scholars and the airs and manners of gentlemenbut behind their backs they carried the whetted knives of assassins and in their mouths were words of treachery and one and all they wore in their eyes the monocles of jewellers and did obeisance to one who was everywhere present in the amphitheatre whose name was avarice and garrison knew them now that they were the false gods of high finance and occasionally of justice and power and sometimes even of law and order and government so that even as he was taken up yet again in the fist of the unseen gianttaken up and whisked aloft into a darkness from which to gaze down upon the amphitheatre of false godsgarrison took note of them and nodded grimly and vowed never to worship them but even peering upon them from on high suddenly he sensed that he was not alone that some other was here who also observed and took note and hovering there in darkness over the amphitheatre over its central pit of wizards over shewstone and allbuoyed up and suspended in air by some force or power beyond his knowledge and great as any power of levitation he had ever controlled garrison strained his senses to locate the whereabouts of that other whose presence was like a dark omen brian lumley psychosphere and he heard the breathing of the other slow and measured and deliberate and he sensed the slow pulse of blood through the others veins like a throb of power and he felt the very eyes of the other burning through him and unaware of his spirit as they too gazed down upon the works of the beings below and in the silence of that high place these signs of the other caused garrisons hair to rise up on his head so that he shrank down into himself and grew afraid but he grew angry tooat his own fear partly but also angry that the things he had seen which could only be of that future he had desired to know had not been shown to him more clearly for which omission having no one else to blame he illogically blamed the other and so he deliberately turned his eyes upwards to seek out the others formand what he saw was strange beyond all strangeness above him the darkness writhed was filled brimmed over with evil a diseased evil insidious as cancer gray as leprosy and warped as insanity itself a vast octopus of evil whose countless tentacles twisted and twined with many sucker mouths that gaped and showed their sharp hooks whose tossing flesh was livid with inimical energies and whose eyes whose eyes burned feral with a bestial lusting beyond any lusts garrison could ever imagine as existing in the mind of man the mind of man the thought was icy in its utter terror freezing his brain but surely what he saw was not could not be a man and yet garrison drew breath in a gasp for his every instinct told him that it was some sort of man this creature of evil a man whose true form lay hidden behind or had been overwhelmed by the massive evil within him so that garrison saw only the evil itself but what sort of man whose aspect must needs carry this monstrosity of a mask garrison called upon his own powers the esp magic he controlled to seek beyond the octopus guise he saw me closed his eyes and concentrated his will upon the discovery of the octopusobscured evil one and and in a flashone brief instant of clearsightednesshe viewed upon the surface of his minds inner eye the being behind the monster he saw himand in turn was seen two minds touched garrisons and that of the other touched and exploredhowever briefly and drew back in mutual shock and astonishment and both knew that this was not the first time they had met and despite their shock both were equally curious but though garrison might have attempted to look again that single glimpse was all that he was allowed for in the next moment he felt himself snatched up yet again and transferred his spirit melting down into his body his body starting to shuddery life where it kneeled at the rim of the canyon his brow cold where it rested upon the metal flank of the machine and in the fastfading light he saw streaks of rust like freshdried blood upon those same i brian lumley flanks and he heard suzys whining where she tugged at his ragged sleeve and he saw that night walked the land and touched the stars into cold glittering life then garrison sighed and gathered shaky legs beneath him and stood up and before that last vision could escape him utterly he gave thought to what he had learned of the other that evil one who wore the guise of a bloated diseased octopus neither white nor black that otherneither man nor woman neither sane nor insaneand yet all of these things and human human yes howgarrison could not say could only shake his head in wonder and finally he sighed again and climbed wearily up on to the machines broad back calling suzy to jump up behind him then lifting the now pitted machine into the air he pointed its prow out over the canyon and with a gradual acceleration moved out beyond the rim and started across and he knew no fear for if what he had seen of the future was real then he knew that the canyon could not stop him no for there was a long long way to go yet before his eyes would light upon immortalitys temple and and why then was he falling curving down into the throat of the gorge like a hurled pebble at the end of its flight faster and faster the machine plummeted into blackness and suzy howling like a banshee where she crushed to garrisons clammy back and the chill air of the canyon whistling through his hair and ragged billowing clothes and gar psychosphere rison straining to bring the rushing descent to a halt straining to use powers seemingly defunct in him of which he had once been master and his own voice screaming his desperation his hatred liar schroeder you lied you showed me a false future and in his head schroeders whispered denial no no richardi told you no lie there is a future our common futurebut this is merely a warning and a throaty chuckle fading and becoming one with the bluster of rushing air and man and dog and machine falling falling falling chapter cmaropi qubwa had also dreamed but at the moment of contact he had been shocked awake a minute latera mere minute to allow for orientationand he lay still in his vast bed listening to his own pounding heart a dream yes but more than just that qubwas defenses had been down breached and such turbulence when the barriers were broken a potential enemy a powerful enemy had located him had penetrated his mindcastle but how it had never happened before should not even be possible but yesterdays incident was still fresh in qubwas mind took on a new significance in the light of this latest incursion he had thought the polaris encounter an accident but now no whatever had gone wrong it could hardly be accidental once maybebut twice psychosphere which meantqubwa must now assume that garrison had been looking for him had actually sought him out richard alien garrison qubwa whispered the name to himself his thoughts darkly seething and more than a little awed oh ive sought out your mind on occasionor rather the minds of those close to youbut i hardly suspected you would ever come looking for mine not twice in twentyfour hours garrison yesit could only be him who else could create such a turbulence in the psychosphere only two men in the whole world had that sort of power garrison was the other one qubwa heaved his great trunk upright and rested for a moment panting from the exertion until he could exercise his will upon himself and take command of his huge obese and obscene body then as the blood began to course more freely in his veins and his respiration regulated he peered about in the dim glow of a tiny red ceiling light am qubwa stretched yawned on his right lay a sleeping white woman who should have been beautiful her face almost perfect but a little too thin her chest rose and fell evenly smooth and unscarred despite the absence of breasts surgically removed perfect plastic surgery it could almost be a male chest except there were no nipples not even the perfunctory nipples of a boy and yet she was not sexless on the contrary she lay on her back shapely legs spread wide exposing a huge and gaping vulva that vanished brian lumley into her body like a tunnel in sleep her mouth was wide open and even as qubwa looked at her gaped wider yet utterly toothless it was the entrance to a second tunnel the ribbed vault of her throat her master knew both entrances intimatelyyes and a third for the moment hidden on his left lay a young male black entirely naked of hair he was heavylipped squatnosed slopeheaded utterly uglybut his breasts were a womans breasts with great square ebony nipples his penis was a flabby pipe without the support or benefit of testicles a eunuch but hardly the harem guard rather an intimate a favorite at the court of qubwa yes both of them were of the flock both man and woman wives to charon qubwa two among many qubwa eased his bulk down the bed until he sat feet upon the floor at its foot he stood up his great flaccid penis reaching close to halfway down his thigh its glans like the head of some dead cobra dangling in the shadow of his great belly folds of flesh heaved as he crossed the room the effort quite literally more mental than physical he lightened himself as he went the closest he could come to actual levitation his forte was of course telepathy with hypnotism coming a close second and the other esp abilities trailing behind and while he was greatly practiced in his powers still he knew their limitations as for garrisons limitations qubwa would psychosphere give a lot to know them they were what made the man so dangerous to him and to his cause too dangerous but qubwa was satisfied that the contact had been too brief to constitute a real breach of his security he had after all been asleep and presumably dreaming and it was not impossible that he qubwa himself had subconsciously sought out garrison it wouldnt be the first time hed visited the minds of others in his sleep oh it was unlikely but the man had been on his mind a lot lately but even that couldnt explain yesterday and it certainly didnt explain the failure of the mindguards mot this time qubwa donned easternstyled slippers and a red voluminous kneelength robe doors opened for him with a pneumatic hiss as he billowed towards and through them out of his bedroom and into his general living quarters this room was spacious highceilinged with resilient rubbertiled floors its dimly lighted decor almost industrial in slategray and silver tones to one side stood a great heavy metal desk above which carved into the striated bedrock of the wall the squat angular basrelief figure of a naked man arms akimbo stared stonily down into the room the carved figure was that of qubwa as he had been fifteen years ago when first he took up residence here and closer examination of its stony features would show that he was notnot entirelya man or perhaps something more than a man depending upon the mental perspective of the viewer for like qubwa himself and like brian lumley the eunuch still sleeping in his bed the great basrelief had pendulous breasts but there any comparison between qubwa and the eunuch ended for between the spread legs of the carving the heavy penis was deliberately shown erect with bulbous testicles drawn to one side displaying the parted lips of a female organ clitoris swollen and extended like a small penis the figure was hermaphroditicas was the living creature it depicted its feet were set firmly upon a great globe in basrelief bearing carved representations of earths islands continents and oceans qubwa crossed to the desk stabbed at a button with the forefinger of a massive left hand and spoke into the grill of an intercom qubwa to guardroom there has been a mental intrusion check the mindguards and report to me at once he took his finger off the button moved round behind the desk and seated himself in a padded steel chair he waited mused explored the possibilities of the situation the mindguards were qubwas answer to the insomnia of the telepath a sleeplessness he had suffered at intervals for twentyfive years before discovering the remedy awake he could control channel and direct his contact with outside minds they were at his mercy to be read like books and picked clean of information most of them anyway but asleep it was a different story asleep they impinged infested his mind with their own innumerable fears and poisons or they had used to before the mindguards psychosphere there were always four mindguards on duty at any one time men and women whose narcotic dependence was total addicts long departed the real world to dwell in the permanent twilight zone of their own deliriums qubwa was happy to let them live this way to supply the drugs which alone kept them alive when he was awake their chaotic nightmares could not affect him and when he slept the mindguards slept guarding his mind that was their sole function there was a drug supplementary to their addictions which effectively switched them offcast them into a mental void created within them what amounted to temporary braindeathwhich was the absolute negation of thought and which created around them a barrier impenetrable to the random thoughtstreams of the outside world impenetrable also to any thoughtprobe or so qubwa had always believed and that was important for there were people who could probe with their thoughts just as qubwa himself but without his expertise often without even knowing that they did it their minds were simply broadcasting stations sending out a constant stream of telepathic waves and they generally ignored or failed to recognize incoming messages the dangerous ones were those who could actually read the minds of others and one such was garrison garrison the worlds greatest telepath whose thoughts whose directed thoughtshad now seemingly penetrated qubwas barriers and shocked him from sleep brian lumley garrison would not have recognized him but he most certainly would have detected something of qubwas strength and if he had been probing why unless he actually suspected the presence of one whose esp abilities might challenge his own if that were so then it was also qubwas worst fear realized where was garrison now suddenly anxious galvanized by an insecurity previously unvisioned gubwa typed garrisons name into his computer the machines screen immediately responded aegean dodecanese rhodes lindos gubwa questioned the machines authority it quoted date time destination and departure flight number from gatwick its source was the airport computer gubwas anxiety turned to impotent rage one day the tentacles of his organization would reach out to envelop the entire world and then he calmed himself for the present he had nothing on rhodes the island was one of the many places as yet beyond even his ever widening technological sphere which was the best money could buy as were the completely illegal systems through which that technology was channelled he stabbed the intercoms button again guardroom his voice was harder now slightly threatening when i say at once mean at once he released the button stood up took psychosphere his computer remote and went to his globe in its clear glass cylinder seating himself before it he keyed globe rhodes and limdos on the remote and watched the miniature world rotate until the greek island came to rest directly before his eyes a pencil beam within the globe shone outwards upon rhodes its center the village where garrison and vicki maler were staying gubwa began to sweat this wasnt to his liking there was always the possibility by no means remote that he might reveal himself but he had to know vicki malers thought patterns were familiar to him very well since he dare not carry out direct mindsurveillance on garrison he must go instead to the girl he stared once more at the aegean island the point of light the location of the tiny village he pictured the girl and allowed her image to swell large in his minds eye his physical eyes he slowly closed sending a telepathic probe out out searching the ether searching until he found her touched upon her mind a touch nothing more no awareness of his presence innocence innocent thoughts mildly worried thoughts worried for garrison he entered unsuspected less than a ghost in her head and in the next instant charon gubwa brian lumley gazed out through vicki maters eyes at the sleeping garrison sleeping for the moment yes but in the throes of nightmare and even now she was reaching to wake him qubwa withdrew at once soared back into the castle into himself and opened his eyes garrison was asleep or had been asleep at the moment of contact some minutes earlier garrison and gubwa both gubwa sighed and sank down heavily into his chair what he had seen made for an easy acceptable explanation it seemed that garrison had not sought out gubwa but that indeed the reverse had been the case because he had been concerned about garrison in his sleep he gubwa had unconsciously involuntarily sought him out all well and goodbut what if the other had been awake garrisons telepathic ability was in a word fantastic gubwa hated to admit this even to himself but it was so the man might easily have trailed him back here back to the castle itself and what then gubwa did not want to kill garrison not yet there might be a great deal he could learn from the man but secretly which brought him once again to the question of the mindguards for just as their mental negativity kept unwanted thoughts out when gubwa wished to sleep so should they keep his in or at least suppress them when he was in fact sleeping that is if they were operating with their accustomed efficiency and four of them psychosphere had always been sufficient until now yesterdays meeting of minds had occurred as it were outside the castlebut this mornings intrusion it was most suspicious as if to confirm gubwas doubts his intercom suddenly barked number three mindguard has pegged it sir shes dead gubwa quickly crossed to the desk and pressed his button stay there he snapped im coming gubwas castle was not the most heavily fortified inhabited retreat in the world but it was one of the most secret indeed its ramparts were not at all in evidence small by any ordinary castles standards the castle had but one level it was square in shape some thirty by thirty yards with one perimeter corridor and two diagonal corridors in plan a square with a cross in it forming four triangles equal in size and area one of these contained gubwas persona living quarters his command center and his harem another held his extensive library study mindlab and swimming pool a third contained the barracks accommodation for his two dozen soldiers also a gymnasium and other recreational facilities and the fourth was the utility area housing the castles air filtration heating electrical and general lifesupport systems the four mindguard cells were located in the castles turrets that is to say at its four corners which could only be reached along the perimeter corridor brian lumley the corridors were better lighted than qubwas private rooms so that he was obliged to squint his eyes as he made for cell number three his eyes were weak unable to cope with any but the dimmest light for which reason here in the castle all lighting was subdued riot even the corridors were bright by normal standards but they were still too bright for charon qubwa outside the castle there qubwa wore tinted contact lenses but such trips as he was obliged to make were extremely few and far between being physically agoraphobic he went out only when he had to go which had become virtually never with the exception of food and stores which qubwas quartermaster must of course periodically replenish the castle was to all intents and purposes selfsufficient moving his bulk along the perimeter corridor whose outer wall was solid rock and whose inner wall was plasticcoated steel qubwa arrived at the cell in question there a white man named gardner one of his most trusted lieutenants waited for him coming to attention at his approach what took so long mr gardner gubwas voice was cold gardner was dressed in the castles gray tshirt and slacks uniform his left breast emblazoned with a silver g he stood himself at ease before answering guard on duty was showering sir its his right a shower before knocking off as you well know sir i chivvied him up sent him to check the mindguards he checked this one last couldnt psychosphere get any readings he unlocked the cell entered checked found she was dead contacted me i contacted you at once gubwa nodded who is this guard and where is he now gardner inclined his head towards the heavy metal door of the cell inside with the girl gubwa pushed by him and entered the cell the girl lay upon her bed dressed in the attire of the mindguard a short sleeveless shift that reached halfway down her thighs she washad beenquite pretty her breasts were small beneath the material of the shift but firm her legs were long and shapely her mouth was full in a youngold face which showed all too well the stresses and strains of her addiction gubwa looked at her laid his great hand upon her breast drew his forest of white eyebrows together in a grim frown then he looked at the guard his glance this time was cursory apparently disinterested flickering from the features of a nervous young black to gardners own impassive face gardner i want to speak to you in private you again he glanced at the young negro go and fetch one of your fellowsfor disposal duties and a stretcher ill call one up sir the guard answered his adams apple bobbing he undipped a tiny walkietalkie from his waistbelt i said fetch gubwa stopped him his thick voice suddenly icy now go and etch the young man nodded gulped turned on his heel and went out his footsteps echoed away brian lumley down the corridor close the door gardner said qubwa his voice now soft and nowhelp me get her shift up gardner lifted the dead girls hips while gubwa hoisted her single garment then the two stood back ah said gubwa a word which carried all the menace in the world gardner glanced again between the girls legs it could only have been him he said jackson or you gubwa told him gardner shrugged knew better than to argue or me yes sir gubwa probed his mind discovered no fear at least not in connection with this but it wasnt you who attacked this girl noit was jackson or what about the others on duty seven of them all sleepingbut i was awake of course and theyd have to get past me theyd all done their stint jacksons was the last hed finished was getting ready to knock off for the day showering when you called hes not usually so particular but this explains it it was jackson all right together they pulled down the girls shift my orders are clear enough wouldnt you say gubwas voice had grown softer more dangerous yet yes sir the mindguards are not to be disturbed in any way isnt that so again yes sir and i pay enough that my orders should be obeyed psychosphere more than generous sir gardner nodded yes gubwa mused and i also keep the men well supplied with all of their personal little needs sowhy a bit of illicit crumpet gardner shrugged you know what they say sir stolen apples are always the sweetest even the sour ones gubwa smiled grimly nodding his agreement he pursed flabby lips i shall dismiss him of course today personally will you be able to recruit a replacement of course sir any time as many as you like within reason good gubwa answered as footsteps sounded in the corridor then recruit two he turned away from the bed i shall attend to the er disposal arrangements myself as for you gardner as soon as your shift is relieved you may fall out no need to wait for these two i understand sir the lift cage descended from the castle into black bowels of rock and earth at its lowest extremity the shaft bottomed out on to a ledge over a natural chasm a single red fluorescent tube flickered into life illuminating the shelf and as it came down the shaft the cage the doors folded back and gubwa stepped out followed by the stretcherbearers jackson and smith put her down said gubwa his voice echoing in the unseen but felt subterranean vastness where the dim red light of the fluorescent tube covered and colored them with its brian lumley ruddy wash he stood on one side of the stretcher facing across it and out over the rim of the fissure stand there he pointed and there smith was white a little older than his colored colleague with nothing on his conscience nothing to fear he was quick to obey jackson moved a little slower they positioned themselves as indicated opposite qubwa and facing him their backs to the chasm qubwa steepled his fingers forearms horizontal in front of him he lowered his head and its great round bush of white hair until his forehead rested upon the tips of his fingers jackson and smith glanced at each other their eyes puzzled questioning we have come qubwa kept his head bowed his voice deliberately sepulchral to send this poor girl to her last resting place it is her due she was a faithful servant he put down his hands lifted his head straightened up he nodded then put your hands between her body and the stretcher and lift her up he commanded they did as they were instructed holding the girls corpse before them like some grisly offering she was surprisingly light good said qubwa towering over the men and the dead girl they supported in their arms he lowered his head again reached out across the empty stretcher and laid one great hand on the girls thigh the other on her shoulder it was as if he were about to bless her psychosphere perhaps in that last moment jackson and smithespecially jacksonsensed dooms rushing approach but they were much too late to avoid it go to your rest my children said qubwa his sepulchral tone sharpening on the last word and with that last word he pushed with all the weight of his great body the two men shouted their alarm were forced back off balance they flailed their arms their cries turning to screams the rim crumbled beneath their feet they were gone the body of the girl too only their echoing screams remained fading seconds later there came a clattering of dislodged rocks and stony rubble followed by three distinct splashes and the sounds of lesser debris striking deep water then silence qubwa stood for a moment at the rim then bent down and dragged the stretcher into the lift his face was without expression the cage doors closed on him and the lift climbed its shaft the red fluorescent light flickered out as charon qubwa rose up through the strata of centuries so a second lift moved in another shaft carrying gardner and the six remaining members of his team gardners cage moved slowly would take all of fifteen minutes to pass through two hundred and seventy feet of shaftbut this was not inefficiency on the contrary brian lumiey the slowrunning cage was necessary to the complete efficiency of charon qubwas operation his organization for these fifteen minutes were the minimum required for the debriefing which occurred whenever his people left the castle and that debriefing was in progress now perfectly synchronized with the monotonous creep of the cage the cage itself was in neardarkness its gloom barely relieved by the regular pulsing of a single electricblue ceiling light and in that strangely ethereal atmosphere the seven men leaned against the walls and listened to qubwas deep even sonorously hypnotic voice although it was only a recording still that voice was not one to be ignored denied or in any way defied for qubwa was a hypnotist without peer and his words merely reiterated and reinforced previous orders this was the third and last time that the seven men would hear those orders on this occasion for the lift was slowing more yet as it approached its terminal this was what the voice of qubwa said to them your work is done and you are now free of duty you will next report for work at the time shown on your duty roster only genuine sickness will prevent such reporting in which case your immediate superior will be informed in advance of the work you have performed and the things you have seen you will remember nothing you will take nothing neither material nor memory of the castle with you when you return you will bring noth psychosphere ing neither material nor intent with you into the castle your only intent will be to do my service you will know only those things i require you to know and your answers to questions concerning myself my organization the nature of the castle itself or anything at all concerning the work you perform for me will be the prepared answers i have ordered you to learn you will keep your minds open and receptive to mine at all times you will obey without question or hesitation any and all commands i care to issue spoken or telepathic except the occasion arises when to do so would not be to my benefit at any such time you will offer explanation and i will decide the outcome you will do no deliberate wrong outside the castle but obey the common laws of the land causing no unwanted attentions to be focussed upon yourselves neither will you proceed furtively or in any manner likely to arouse suspicion you will in short live your lives normally within the periphery of my beneficence and you will be satisfied in the event that you are compromised and that any enemy of mine seeks to subvert you or extract from you information whose divulgence i have forbidden and further that you are in any way made incapable of refusing such informationthen you will simply cease to function you will die these are the words of charon qubwa i have spoken so let it be the lift came to an almost unnoticeable stand brian lumley still and the pulsing blue light went out the doors opened and qubwas zombies stepped out they were in a dim basement room behind them the doors closed and the lift sank from sight gardner took out keys went to the rooms single metal door unlocked its twin locks he and the others passed through and he locked the door behind them now they were in what looked like an underground car park thick with dust in which no cars were parked from somewhere overhead came the dull rumble of traffic footsteps echoing the seven crossed the concrete floor and entered another lift and gardner thumbed its single button three levels up they walked out into sunlight crowds and a street full of heavy traffic the lifts doors closed automatically behind them an outer door closed over the inner doors a sign above the outer door said not for public use and down below more than three hundred feet straight down the castle lay hidden mysterious and forgotten for them at least silent until now gubwas men yawned blinked their eyes in the light of day nodded farewells and went their own ways to all intents and purposes they were ordinary citizens about their business clad in the ordinary clothes and wearing the ordinary expressions of common everyday life gardners way took him a couple of streets to where he would catch his bus waiting at the psychosphere stop he lit a cigarette and engaged himself in conversation with a sweaty fat lady in a feathery hat just across the road a sign on the corner of a building said oxford st wl chapter ninety minutes earlier in llmdos vlcki maler had awakened stretched and checked the time am am local and the sun was high in the sky and blazing over the great rock of the acropolis vicki yawned and stretched again she had had oh maybe six sixandahalf hours sleep the same for richard it was almost time to wake him up while he didnt particularly like being awakened neither did he care to sleep too long he had begun lately to complain that things passed him by while he was asleep in any case now would be a good and sensible time he was nightmaring again and had started to moan she had heard him mention schroeder and koenig and he had cursed once or twice his temperature was up too sweat gleamed on psychosphere his brow and in the hollow of his collar bones he shook his head from side to side as if seeking a way out of some terrible predicament yes she should wake him after all he had awakened her with his tossing and turning liar the word suddenly gurgled from between his clenched teeth seemingly in denial of vickis last thought and falling falling she went quickly to his side and laid a hand upon his shoulder but as his frantic jerking and tossing grew still more pronounced she shouted richard richard wake up its all right he came awake in a moment his golden eyes flashing open his body jerking upright from the waist back ramrod straight on the raised wooden bed as his hands flew into a defensive position in front of his face and chest so vicki stepped quickly back out of range then his wide molten golden eyes blinked focussed and he saw her he licked bonedry lips lay back trembling god a bad one he angled his head to stare at her managed a shaky laugh a beauty it must have been she told him you were shouting oh what was i shouting something about a liarand falling she deliberately left out the other bits of mouthing about schroeder and koenig falling oh yes he frowned i remember that something of it anyway but a liar he shook his head do you remember anything else she asked brian lumley he got up still shaky and put his arms around her then he released her tugged open her robe and hugged her again she held him tightly feeling something of her old love for him flooding her veins her body her old love for him had something changed then with her face buried in his shoulder she bit her lips controlled her thinking occasionally richard eavesdropped on her mind he was not doing so now but he nevertheless felt the tension in her body something wrong vicki only that i worry about you what we talked about last night and these dreams of yours he released her and began to pull on his clothes i know he said but you know theyre not entirely my own i mean i am dreaming for three of us do you understand she nodded yes i do and surely you understand why i worry he returned her nod of coursehe paused frowned then pulled on a tshirt only this timewith this dream yes he shrugged this time i believe i was dreaming for myself i only wish i could remember more about it i feel it was special important important a dream ive had dreams before vicki and some of them were damned important but and again he shrugged maybe itll come back to me later but for all his shrug as he finished dressing psychosphere and slipped his feet into his sandals she could see that the dream continued to preoccupy him she tried to drive it from his mind asking arent you going to wash eh he looked up halfsmiling oh no wont bother now a dip in the sea a shower on the beachits today were to visit the acropolis isnt it oh yes she was enthusiastic well have a wonderful view from up there as long as you promise not to go too close to the edge his smile disappeared completely and she bit her lip again knowing she had erred only dreamed i was falling vicki he reminded her awake it simply cant happen you know that oh yes she knew it of course i only get dressed now wont you he turned away from her gazed out of the window into the vineshaded black and white cobbled courtyard we can have brunch in the village on our way down to the beach some nine hours later right on cue paulo falazzis fat frenchman departed lindos he and his much younger mistressa nymphet with big loose breasts which she loved to bounce about all over the lesser of the villages two beachesleft town in a local taxi their faces glowing shinyred from too much sun the girl wore a loose evening gown presumably for the sake of her sunburn palazzi was pleased to note that she didnt seem to be wearing too much jewelry doubtless the weight of gold and stones brian lumley would constitute a great irritation against rapidly roughening skin how then he wondered with a grin could she possibly cope with the far greater weight of her lover the poor rich fat slob butwhere theres a will then a nervous twenty minutes later he saw the swiss party appear from the doorway of their spacious highpriced villa laughingly making for the village center where already the tavernas were growing boisterously raucous happily the pair left an upper window hanging ajar true it was unseasonably warm even for the aegean but there would be more than the breeze off the sea and a couple of mosquitoes going in through that window tonight palazzi grinned again this time at his joke and at the thought of the mosquitoes the buzzing little vampires would have to wait their turn for rich swiss blood tonight he paulo palazzi would be taking first fruitsand his sting was far more painful and then there was garrison at the thought of the socalled blind man palazzis eyes narrowed this one was more problematic erratic less likely to adhere to any sort of regular schedule he might not even go out tonight which would be bad news but not necessarily an insurmountable problem the man probably slept quite heavily certainly would sleep heavily if the amount of local brandy he consumed was anything to go by or perhaps he drank the brandy because he slept badly whichever only time would tell and time for the next few hours anyway was on the side of the thief it was growing dark now would be quite dark psychosphere by or palazzi had promised the night watchman he would be off the rock by then that promise had been made as he returned from his midday meal in ellis taverna toting a small cheap bottle of ouzo to reinforce their friendship but still palazzi didnt wish to outstay his welcomeor give the old boy any reason to question his motives he picked at his wellgroomed fingernails for a little while then took up his binoculars one last time and found garrisons courtyard where it was lighted by the glow of shaded lamps above the inner doors and even as he watched so the lights went out one by one and straining his eyes he saw a pair of dim figures moving amongst the courtyards shadows thenthere they were hand in hand their pace leisurely as they descended into the maze of streets and dressed for dancing yes garrison in a paperlight white suit and openneck shirt his woman in a halter and culottes hs woman pasazzis eager wolfish grin slipped a little another enigma she too was supposed to be blind at least she too wore a blind persons spectacles well blind she may or may not be but beautiful she most certainly was and her figure palazzi allowed his thoughts to wander back to the topless girls he had watched on the little beach funny how binoculars bringing those naked breasts so close you could almost pucker your lips and kiss them seemed at the same time somehow to set them in another alien brian lumley realm much more exciting to actually be within reach even if one mustnt touch and the pretty english girls he had seen two days ago they had been close especially the girl with the big ones braless her nipples stiff with excitement shaping her blouse as she leaned out over the ramparts palazzi suddenly felt himself erect his penis huge in his pants nothing new the thrill of anticipation piot sexual rather environmental but pleasing anyway he stroked his hard through his trousersthen jerked guiltily alert as he heard a rattle of stones a jingle of keys and a wheezy boozy inquiring greek voice coming he called out his greek only soso just coming he scrambled from the wall dusted himself off made for the great stone arch which would lead him to the steep winding descent but such a lovely night i quite forgot the time its the solitude i like you know just sitting up here on my own he wasnt sure the old fellow really understood him you enjoyed the ouzo good and yes thank you the sunset really was quite beautiful from far below music and the sounds of muted revelry began to drift up into the darkening air lindos was rising from its evening torpor palazzi could feel its spiced lamb and retsina breath in his face beckoning him to the feast all through the day garrisons mood and morale had gradually deteriorated vicki had sensed it psychosphere had seen how he tried to keep a rein on feelings and emotions he himself did not fully understand and she too had grown restless in sympathy with his nearschizophrenic mood she had known that it was his own schizophrenia springing perhaps from a delicate suppression of the two livein mentalities which were now permanent facets of his id his psychehad known that neither schroeder nor koenig had outwardly manifested themselves during the course of the daybut the mere thought of the effort of will he must exercise simply to remain ascendant was chilling she doubted if she would ever become accustomed to it she traced the source of the trouble back to this mornings dream possibly as far back as their encounter with the greek youths until then all had seemed to be going well their holiday had been doing both of them a great deal of good but now tonight now he fidgeted and frowned a lot he had toyed with his food and argued over the bill then stomped angrily out of the taverns where they had eaten he had also consumed too much brandy had allowed himself to get upset too easily when the music of a particular taverna wasnt just exactly to his liking and had complained bitterly of rowdy drunken grockles when in fact the holidaymakers were as yet quite sober and extremely well behaved he was in short on the point of boiling over blowing up to release the tensions brian lumley seething within and that was the last thing that vicki wanted oh no for she knew that just beneath the surface of the garrison she had so loved there lurked others only too ready to spring into being vicki knew that sheand lindos too for that mattercould well do without the advent of flerr willy koenig late of the schutzstaffel and personal bodyguard to his beloved colonel thomas schroeder and her sentiments or lack of them applied just as well to the colonel himself oh she had been fond of both of them in life in the flesh but now that they dwelled in garrisons head in his very being she was afraid of them and hated them neither one of them must be allowed to surface tonight which was why at her first opportunity she allowed garrison to catch her frowning and stroking her brow oh he was quick to query leaning towards her across their wicker table nothing a headache coming on i think garrison was immediately sympathetic reaching to touch her browand his face clouding over in a moment knowing she lied if you had a headache he told her quietly i could cure it in a moment you know that tired then she tried desperately to cover up perhaps im just a little tired he shook his head no not that either we slept for an hour or two this afternoon after our climb he pursed his lips breathed deeply began to look angrythen let psychosphere out all of his air and anger in one great sigh what the hellits me eh oh richard she gave his hand an urgent squeeze its just that you seem to be working yourself up to something and dont know what to she let the sentence taper off her voice breaking a little he stared at her for a moment and it was as if she could feel the warmth of his golden eyes right through the dark heavy lenses of his glasses a warmth that drew something of her anxiety right out of her i dont know either he admitted its a feeling thats all that im missing something that somethings wrong with the world with me hell you know whats wrong vicki look she squeezed his hand again why dont we call it a day have an early night we can sit in the courtyard ill make coffeea lot of it coffee and brandyand a cigar for you youll like that we dont have to do anything except sit there and relax and listen to that little bird singing his one sad note garrison nodded smiled however wanly yes he is sad that little bloke with his poop poop poop i wonder what he looks like maybe hes ugly vicki said rising and putting down money on the table perhaps thats why he only comes out at night and later as they climbed through the narrow streets and rose above the babble of bright crowded tavernas garrison added and maybe brian lumley thats why hes so sad eh being ugly i mean and only one note to sing but such a beautiful note vicki answered as they reached the door to their courtyard like liquid moonlight garrison caught her round the waist kissed her hungrily and gently fondled her breasts in the darkness listen what do you say we forget the coffee and brandy eh why dont we help the little guy out and make some music of our own together they stepped over the threshold closing the door quietly behind them palazzi had started with the swiss pair staying only one narrow streetor rooftopaway from his own less than splendid accommodation they had seemed the obvious choice on leaving the rock of the acropolis he had spent a few minutes on the lower slopes of the climb talking to the old greek lace ladies where they tidied away their wares for the night finally telling them goodnight and ensuring that they were watching him when he entered his accommodation at the foot of the rock then five minutes to change into his working clothes and climb out through a window high in the rear wall of his room and a few more to flit across the flat shadowy roofs and ahhow the adrenalin had flowed in paulo palazzis veins night was his element in which he was less than a shadow and the sheer excitement of the night was an almost physical force within him but his excitement had quickly ebbed the psychosphere swiss couple were a bitter disappointment pickings in their rooms wouldnt even cover the cost of palazzis holiday a fistful of cheap jewelry some drachmas a few swiss francs miserable disgruntled he was out of the burgled room only a little after pm now he was tempted to go after garrison the big onebut he resisted he knew that his urgency was spawned of disappointment and greed no better first to do the french job and let the garrisons settle into their evenings entertainment besides the frogs accommodation was closest also well palazzi still had a sort of feeling about garrison and his woman something about them that made him nervy the thiefs instinct served him well for at as he entered the darkened courtyard of the french couples villa and began silently to pick their lock garrison and vicki were just having their conversation about the music of a different sort of nightventuring bird and entering their own accommodation had palazzi gone there first he must certainly have been disturbed as he went about his business of course he was not to learn this until some thirty minutes later when coming at a crouching gliding lope across the roofs he saw the lamp over their door glowing yellow and heard their muted voices from within at that palazzi cursed long vividly and silentlybefore resigning himself to a serious revision of his plans and while his mind worked he stretched himself out on the roof almost directly above the pair brian lumley on their raised wooden bed listening to the sounds of their lovemaking of their actual conversation he could hear very little breathlesshoarse murmurs panting sighs and moans of pleasure but the soft slap slap slap of perspiring bodies in loving collision was very distinctand protracted they knew how to do it these two despite the necessary revision of his plan palazzi began to feel excitedsexually this time and his penis grew fat elongating itself within the zippered confines of his jump suit for he could picture that beautiful body down there the body of garrisons woman all open and soft and pinkly moist her thighs spread wide inviting as garrison rode in and out of her in and out and those breasts of hers nipples erect slippery with perspiration and spittle as the blind mans mouth worked on them and sucked them into a life of their own blind man jesus the poor bastard didnt even know how good she looked how good and ripe and golden not if he really was blind palazzi licked his lips stifled a lump rising in his throat forced himself to concentrate upon the plans revision and gradually calmed down actually there wasnt a great deal to revise if he was to be out of lindos tomorrow he must do the job tonight he didnt like the idea of doing it while they were asleep in there butthey must at least be partblind mustnt they and certainly theyd be exhausted and sleeping like the dead in any case he had no choice for the froggy psychosphere too had disappointed him less than ten thousand drachmas no french currency at all only an old goldplated rolex oyster and some bits of jewelry worth maybe three hundred thousand lire in the right market terrible but garrison ah he was different his womans jewelry aloneno half of itwould be worth a small fortune if only theyd get finished with their rutting and get to sleep already and they were still at it five minutes later the noises began to come faster for a moment or two they grew frantic and then a little cry sharp and sweet gurgling down into a sigh and garrisons hoarse panting gradually subsiding and finally silence silence for a few minutes then the weary slap of naked feet upon the floor and the lights blinking out the courtyard light too and again silence the rustle of a sheet a sigh and palazzi patiently waiting on the roof neither garrison nor vicki dreamed anything of any importance that night not before palazzis visit and certainly not afterwards as the thief had expected their lovemaking had drained them except for their deep regular breathing they lay still and silent as he went about his business of discovering and pocketing their money and personal valuables and there was plenty to find more than enough to make up for all other disappointments but it hadnt been all that easy there had been a point when the thought had crossed palazzis mind that perhaps he had better turn back that brian lumley had been shortly after entering through an open windowto discover garrisons woman stretched out at his very feet palazzis night vision was trained to a marvellous degree gloomy as the large room was and the moon in the wrong quarter of the sky and only starlight ghosting through the small windows still he had been able to make out every object in the room with clear definition the faint beam of a pencilslim torch had supplied what little extra light was needed for the serious work but the girl garrisons woman sprawled there at palazzis feet with her face turned to one side and a handkerchief loosely knotted over her forehead its folds covering her eyes her chest rising and falling rising and falling waked under a sheet the points of her breasts sticking up and forming peaked hillocks of white linen on her chest her arms thrown wide legs open under the sheet feet protruding an attitude of unconscious abandon across the room garrison had the large bed to himselfthe bed where the two had made love it was typical of the raised greek beds much in evidence throughout the village but the womans bed was also raised higher in fact lyingupon a sort of square landing or platform its deep mattress rested upon the ceramictiled roof of the tiny bathroom shower and toilet unit and spreadeagled the womans form almost filled the railedoff bed space so that the thief had to step carefully indeed to avoid touching or disturbing her careful too to avoid the possibility psychosphere of his shadow falling on her face even with her eyes covered by the handkerchief still she might sense his presence and then the wooden stairs to negotiate and upon the floor the jumble of their discarded clothing piled where they had stripped their bodies naked a little heap of the womans jewelry lying on a tiny casual tableher open purse hanging from the knobbed newel at the foot of the stairsand garrisons wallet in the inside pocket of his coat flung casually across the back of a chair and the jewelry not half but all of a fortune palazzi was tempted to whistle tempted again when he saw the contents of garrisons wallet a fat wad of crisp english ј notes at least thirty of them and an equal amount of high denomination drachmas the womans purse also bulging at that point some of the pieces of jewelry had moved and chinked dully in palazzis pockets garrison too had moved only a slight movement true accompanied by a little grunt of discomfort but sufficient to freeze palazzi to the floor as if taken root there he waited watching listening garrison lying facedown was starting to snort a little blowing air into his pillow he threw out an arm and automatically adjusted his position stopped snorting palazzi waited starlight silvered and softened the rooms sharper edges all was quiet once more palazzi waited no longer it was time to get brian lumley out the night was moving on when they had finished making love he had waited on the roof for over an hour before making his first move since when hed been in here with them for a full fifteen minutes the time now was exactly am the swiss couple would still be dancing the froggies on their way back from rhodes unless they had decided to stay over for the night and palazzi was still one hundred percent safe but he knew he couldnt afford to waste any time now and nothing to waste time on not really nothing to linger over climbing the open stairs back to where vicki maler lay stretched out on her back palazzi found himself glancing across the room at the sleeping form of her lover the man must be wearing a luminous watch on his wrist its dial glowing close to his face for there was a distinct patch of yellow light on the pillow where he lay facedown a sort of golden luminescence suddenly palazzis desire to be out of there swelled up strong in him he foolishly allowed a stair tread to creak as he crept higher which caused him to freeze again for a moment and hold his breath before he dared to continue he was allowing himself to become spooked but why what was there to worry about he had removed light bulbs as he went putting them all safely out of the way even if garrison and his woman woke up and hit the switches the room would remain in darkness and of what use bright lights to their eyes anyway no nothing to worry about here why they psychosphere didnt even have a telephone the entire village could only have a dozen or so palazzi stepped over the sleeping womans form and seated himself on the marble sill of the open window as he swung one leg over the sill onto the flat roof outside she stirred her right knee bent straightened the sheet got hooked up on her foot sliding down her perfect body her brown beautiful breasts were exposed starlight gleamed on the round globes of flesh increasing their desirability tenfold palazzis hands were free and so was his personal demon he slowly carefully unzippered the front of his jump suit took out his suddenly stiff penis gripped it and stroked the taut skin to and fro then released it and raised his hand over the girls right breast he readied his other hand over her mouth and lowered both hands simultaneously she came awake felt the strange hands on her mouth her breast one hand clamping the other squeezing molding pinching hot hands feverish not garrisons richard she would have cried out but couldnt it made no difference garrison heard her anyway three of them heard struggled to come awake to take command and in situations like thisfor all that garrison had been a soldier in his own right with lightning reflexeswilly koenig exschutzstaffel specialist had always been the fastest and by far the deadliest garrisons body rolled over onto its back and brian lumley sat up its eyes flying open their light filled the gloom with golden lances of fire palazzi released vicki gurgled some inarticulate thing as he gazed across the room into the blazing eyes of hell go to sleep vicki said the icy voice of the owner of those eyes forget thisit isnt happeningits all right schlafen sie and she simply collapsed back onto her pillows palazzi made to dive through the window but found himself picked up insteadsnatched up like a toy and suspended in air floating towards the center of the room now he too would have cried out but couldnt the zips on his jump suit flew open his loot tumbling free the naked man seated upon the bed smiled a nightmare smile humorless as that of some ghastly luminescent zombieand pointed with a zombies stiff arm hand and finger go he said palazzi felt himself shot out of the window rushed across the rooftops in a great hand high over the tavernas where they catered to their late customers he soared up into the nightmouth gaping cheeks filling with aireyes bugging streaming tears as the rush of his motion stung themhis suit billowing and flapping like crazed black wings up and away across the great rock of the acropolis and the lights of lindos glowing far below and the lanterns of small fishing craft bobbing on the gentle swell of the slumbering aegean and out across the sea sped palazzi a mile psychosphere two and a great jet plane thundering by overr head its windows like rows of eyes and and palazzi floating stationary now with only an icy wind blowing on him across the sky floating and spinning a mile high in the air and the deep deep sea below no he screamed hoping that someone somewhere somehow would hear him mo i didnt intend to harm her mercy have mercy but no one was listening certainly not the owner of the great invisible hand which now without warning hurled him down chapter at am garrisomil garrison now for the koenig facet had retreated once moredrank his fifteenth cup of coffee smoked his twentieth cigarette and shivered in the light of the new day it was not cold but he shivered he sat on the edge of his tumbled bed and gazed out of his window listening to a frantic cocks crowing and the early morning rumpus of distant donkeys his thoughts were confused in disarray lindos rhodes the aegean what the hell was he doing here anyway and last nightno in the early hours of this morninghe had killed a man ho he gritted his teeth correcting himself again willy koenig had killed a man and he garrison had been unable to stop him or even try to stop him and schroeder had a hand in it too thomas schroeder protecting psychosphere not only vicki and garrison but also himself oh yes and that was the rub as garrison saw it he garrison wasnt allowed to live his own life because the others lived it for him what happened to him must also happen to them and so they must protect him and the constant conflict the conflict was draining him he had to face up to it he was being drained of physical strength of his psychic energies perhaps even of his sanity and no use a stake against vampires such as these no for they dwelled within him sometimes he felt quite quite mad he had felt it just a few hours ago and even knowing it was not madness but maddening frustrationthe frustration which comes of having no control which in itself might or might not be a definition of insanitymade it no less frightening he was not his own man his body was not his alone he shared his powers tooand they were being used up a leaky battery in a communal torch in an eternal night and no way to recharge pretty soon the light would go out the battery would spill its acids the whole thing would melt into a rusty mass and become totally useless and darkness would reign over all his mind clung to part of that last thought and examined it no way to recharge and at the very back of his mind it seemed that he heard a tiny whispering voice say dont you remember richard you stopped the machine you killed the beast it was schroe brian lumley ders voice and he recognized it but it could only be memory for his alterfacets were incapable of independent communication he couldnt talk to them and they couldnt talk to him or to each other he was them they were him so where had he heard those words spoken and what did they mean garrison believed he might at least have the answer to the second half of the question and he paled psychomech oh yesthat was one beast he really had killed out of jealousy so that no one could ever follow him into into what this misery misery yesborn of fear his powers were failing and he knew it right now he felt utterly exhausted drained unable to face up to whatever it was he felt closing in on him it wasnt simply lack of sleep wasnt the knowledge that he had killed a manthat bastard had probably deserved it anywaywasnt even the way vicki sometimes looked at him now with something less than her old customary adoration it was simply that he feltusurped usurped yes the incident with those greek youths for instance his anger certainly but schroeders and koenigs action and this mornings burglar the same thing and garrison paying for it his energy draining away a battery leaking its vital spark or having that spark leeched by parasitic thieves and no way to recharge but maybe there was a way psychosphere he shivered again stood up and crossed the room glanced at and caused the water to boil in its kettle atop an unlighted gas ring he climbed the open wooden stairs behind him the jar of instant coffee poured two perfect measures into a pair of mugs a carton of milk tilted itself the kettle too until the mugs were filled the level of sugar in its bowl went down by exactly one spoonful a little whirlpool raced in garrisons mug there had been a time he would have performed these small feats in front of vicki but no longer she was asleep now anyway and so could not see them but once once in the beginning she would have been amazed would have laughed delightedly later then she became apprehensive and now mow such magic only served to frighten her he sat down beside her where she lay and touched her arm warm alive and yet once not so very long ago he knew that she would remember nothing of the affair with the burglar no for he had told her to forget it that it wasnt happening since then she had not stirred had not even changed her position her chest rose and fell rose and fell garrison stared looked closer listened to her breathing felt his own pulse quickening was there something wrong here some imperfection some deterioration her skin looked paler somehow despite her tan and her respiration seemed a trifle jerky there were previously unnoticed lines at the corners of her eyes her mouth wot age lines brian lumley no not crowsfeet more the marks of a subtly altered metabolism of of something he did not wish to contemplate with fingers that shook slightly he eased the knotted handkerchief from her eyes lifting their lids with the pressure of his thumbs she slept on as he jerked back horrified beneath those now trembling eyelids sightless orbs had seemed grotesquely huge and pallid in the frames of their scarlet sockets the golden glow had been missing from vickis eyes garrisons panic fuelled his powers see he commanded be filled with light life warmth energy take of my own energy and slowlyat first a faint pulse of yellow burning beneath her pale eyelids then brightening to a glowthe gold returned the lines faded out smoothed into her skin her pulse and respiration steadied awaken and she came slowly awake opened those great golden orbs of eyes and smiled at him and garrison leaned his back against the windows frame and tried to control his trembling its morning vicki he managed to tell her at last ive made coffee morning yes and garrison had determined that this would be their last morning in lindos there were things he must doand without delay while there was still time joe black had left small sums of money in the hands of various unsuspecting informers in lin psychosphere dos advance payment for that tipoff which was vital to his and brother berts planned hit one of these informers was not the young pretty shortsclad local representative of a small british tour operator who awakened him that morning bright and early and being only halfawake when he answered her knock black might easily have given something of his real interests away he was not dullminded however and quickly caught on to her own interest in garrisons affairs yes he mumblingly admitted yawning and rubbing sleep from his eyes his face peering from behind his door i am interested in the er adonis studios in all three rooms yes far superior to this place but and he shrugged to my understanding the chap who has them will be there for another four or five days piot at all mr er schwartz she smiled hes moving out this morninghim and his lady flying back to london i understand i got the tip from costas mekos one of the taxi drivers here that was just before he set off to drive the garrisons into rhodesabout twenty minutes ago now black understood all costas mekos was one of those into whose eager hands hed placed a little cash buttwenty minutes blacks heart gave a lurch i see and you being a skymed tour representative and the adonis studios being skymed accommodation you i hate to see such good rooms go to waste yes she sweetly answered you see mr gar brian lumley rison has paid for his rooms in advance and the money is nonreturnable and so you can let me have the rooms at reduced rates well i maybe a thirty percent discount now i cant be absolutely specific off the top of my of course not i understand well miss er just call me linda skymeds lindos linda you see she tilted her head and smiled sunnily of course well linda id invite you in but behind this door im quite naked can i contact you later you see ill have to get in touch with friends of mine in rhodes and i really cant make any spur of the moment promises they may have got themselves fixed up by now oh i see she was a little disappointed well my office is in i know where it is black smiled thinking go away you silly bitch he decided to speed her departure listen i know its early yet but i have a very nice bottle in here and i was just going to make myself a little breakfast if youd care to er and he opened the door a fraction wider she got a glimpse of a muscular hairy thigh black was not a pretty sight not any time but worst of all unshaven and after a nights uneven sleep with whiskey fumes still heavy on his breath the trick worked as he had known it would lindos linda backed off in the face of his leer psychosphere her smile becoming falsely fixed her friendly tour operator manner evaporating in a moment thank you but ive already breakfasted the early bird you know ah yes pity he started to close the door but jesus what now youre not german i mean you know your name and ive seen you in the village and i thought my wife is german he lied ive spent a great many years there he opened his door wider still of course my wife isnt with me right now and but lindos linda was already smiling her farewell backing away into the sunsplashed cobbled village street bert was the suave one he had played his part with his usual efficiency fixing up garrisons twoman aircrew with booze and birds worming his way into their confidence and along the way acquiring the affections of their leggy air hostess it had been one long party ever since he arrived and he hadnt needed to be too careful about protecting his identity after all they werent going to be talking about him it had been expensive true the masquerade but the brothers could afford it on what carlo vicenti was paying and anyway bert had always liked the good life he had played it that way too a lucky punter on holiday looking for pleasant company to help him spend his winningsbut not too fast for he wasnt quite used to being rich yet the brian lumley crew of garrisons jet at loose ends and not wishing to blow too much of their earnings on the high life had proved an easy mark after a day or two bert had mentioned his interest in aircraft they had fixed it to take him out to the airport and see their plane he had been like a kid with a new toy like a malicious kid who pulls the wheels off or in this case the guts undercarriage and all the major flightcontrol cables the device had been small deadly something he could carry in his pocket a limpet armed it would cling to metal it now clung behind a bulkhead in the planes tiny hold as yet it did not tick wouldnt until bert gave it the remote control signal which would be as the plane took off then then the bomb would tick away the seconds to disaster it would tick for one hour and somewhere over the aegean midway between greece and turkey the sea was five six hundred feet deep there the plane and its contentsspecifically its human contentswould probably never be found bodies would decompose turn to sludge the plane would rot crumble away the sea would roll overhead as it had for half of time and carlo vicenti would be very happy and joe and bert black would have earned their bread bomber bert black rarely dreamed and he never suffered from nightmares he was a man without a conscience which was just as well in his line of business lacking morals his morale was abnormally high unlike his brother he psychosphere could wake up happy at peace with the world even on a day when he would shatter that peace beyond restructuringfor some this morning he woke up at the buzz of his telephone and lifted the handset smoothly from its cradle before it could awaken the girl curled beside him it was joe on the other end and the others tense whisper told bert all he needed to know theyre on their way the word is theyll fly today sure bert answered giving nothing away taking no chances that the girl wasnt really asleep you can do it yeah its doneall but the coup de grace oh yes and you still in your hotel get your arse down to the airport be cool bert grinned into the mouthpiece he glanced at the girl and she snored obligingly fast asleep and little wonder after the night theyd just had they wont leave without me being there they cant what listen what the hell are you cool cooh bert insisted ill explain later just believe me its all fixed thats all hellill be there to wave them goodbye he put the phone down cutting off joes sputtering then he turned over carefully spilled the girl onto her back gently parted her legs and kneeled between them he was drawing up her brian lumley knees when she awakened and blinked at him sleepily bert my god again hey he told her its a beautiful day if we start it right itll stay right he eased himself into her enjoy baby and to himself cop it while you can sweetheart the next guy who takes a bite at your sweet little pussy will have gills and ftns and slimy slimy scales who were you waving at garrison asked the stewardess when she came into the planes tiny luxurious lounge after the takeoff you were all at the hatch laughing waving oh she smiled that was just a friend we met up with in rhodes nice chap more money than sensebut you know nice ah vicki smiled romance on a greek island eh the girl wrinkled her nose well not exactly he was pleasant enough i suppose butoh i shouldnt think ill see him again anyway there was something about him she shrugged good fun yes but a bit too calculating for my likes too cold by far she frowned for a moment thoughtfully then smiled it helped pass the time now then mr garrison mrs garrison what can i get you to drink while you choose a meal for yourselves garrison and vicki drank a little icecold lager picked at cold meats and salad from the limited menu finished with ice cream coffee and liqueurs while they ate they talked psychosphere you promised youd tell me what it was all about vicki worriedly pressed him when they were alone dropping the witty happy attitude she had adopted for the benefit of the crew why are we going home richard why now halfway through our holiday garrison gazed out of his window for a moment sipped lager used his fork to toy with a piece of chicken breast vicki you remember our conversation the other night well now im ready to face up to whats wrong and im ready to start doing something about itwhile theres still time and is there something you can do about it she asked with a bit of luck yes what went wrong was this i destroyed psychomech simple as that but thats not an end to it flo for ill build the machine again or rather ill have it built the man who modified gareth wyatts original psychomech now works for me if i give him a helping handor mindthere should be no problem mo problem she nodded and sighed but you felt it was sufficiently urgent that it couldnt wait she sighed again i really did like lindos a lot but no buts about it vicki he cut her short it is urgent i thought you understood that from our conversation the other night if i told you just how urgent i believe it is then im sure it would frighten youas it frightens me it frightens me anyway she answered the brian lumley thought of a mindexpanding machineand you at its mercy fie chuckled however mirthlessly psychomech wasnt a monster he told her even if the men who built it were monsters the machine was just a machine i was at its mercy yes but only because i placed myself in unscrupulous hands anyway that backfired on the people who would have hurt me backfired badly again his chuckle my multimind was the result but thats all history now except i have to do it again for myself yesand for you she knew what he meant could suddenly feel it in her bones she fed on garrisons power no less than the others was kept alive by it and his battery was leaking she shuddered cringing as her mind conjured once more the agony she had known in those tortured days before before she had died remembering she clutched at garrison and began to say something perhaps she had something to say perhaps not in any case it went unspoken one hour had gone by since the plane had taken off in rhodes they were now out over the aegean heading for the yugoslavbulgarian border beneath their feet down in the little jets luggage hold bomber bert blacks device stopped ticking an electrical connection was made the floor jumped as from the blow of some mighty hammer and the plane gave a great shudder in answer to a strangely dull booming explosion psychosphere debris flew past the windows as the small craft lurched and shook then like a mortally wounded dragon the jet screamed her agony as her nose tilted and she commenced a tight spiral down the sky chapter charon qubwa sat in his study although the metalwalled room was a large one with two great desks and with steel shelves along three of the high walls still the place was cluttered its chaotically untidy appearance was to qubwa a luxury in his own eyes his life was very ordered so tightly ordered indeed that a measure of personal imperfection or imbalance was a necessity books were piled everywhere in apparent disarray and empty spaces gaped along all of the shelves those books which were in their places however displayed qubwas passion for socalled fringe sciences his consuming interest in that paranormal of whose powers a perverse nature aided and abetted by the equally perverse science of man had gifted qubwa excessively but quite apart from these there were dozens of psychosphere works offering mute witness to their owners other leanings for alongside books on parapsychology there were numerous volumes dealing with politics and political doctrines world religions and mythologies warits causes and effectsaftermath and survival and a host of biographies of warlords dictators kings emperors and tyrants there were too a large number of books concerning themselves with mans inhumanity to his fellow man and bulky treatises on the effects upon human beings of narcotics carcinogens other poisons acids and lethal chemicals and radiation a workbench displayed a fantastic array of halfassembled or disassembled instruments and gadgets some of whichintended eventually for qubwas mindlabwere or would be tools for the measuring of forces and stresses other than those of mass space and time and in and about the general clutter stood devices of hypnotic or brainwashing natures ranging from revolving mirrors and faceted crystals through common stroboscopes to a small pulselaser the fourth wall was a melange of large framed photographs depicting sex in all its many phases and facets from simple love through gross indecency to the lewdest forms of perversion sadism and bestiality in short the study was nothing less than the den or lair of a twentiethcentury sorcerer and its magics were not white but black amongst all of this apparent disorder the sole brian lumley item kept impeccably tidy was the tall filing cabinet in which qubwa kept the records of his workforce from this cabinet he had taken a file whose cover bore the name charles edwin jackson the case was now closed the file dead as its subject qubwa felt no sorrow no regrets no guilt such feelings were for fools he riffled once more through its pages scowled tossed it into a wastebasket waste yes as everything and everybody must waste in the end unless one were immortal of course qubwa did not pursue that line of thought it was one which already occupied enough of his time and time was always a pressing matter more than twentyfour hours had gone by since he mindprobed vicki maler and they had been busy ones the castles internal security had been shown to have loopholes and qubwa had needed to plug them the rape of one of his mindguards should not have been possible and that was worrying it had showed a weakness in the systems qubwa employed to make and keep his soldiers subservient all of them were addicts to a greater or lesser degree slaves of the common and occasionally not so common drugs available to qubwa through various markets not all of them had come to him that way however but their complete dependence upon him was his most powerful ally dogs were loath to bite the hand that fed them jackson apparently had been a dog of a different color at least until qubwa had looked psychosphere a little closer at the mans records then a previously overlooked pattern had become immediately visible first of all jackson had been partially resistant to hypnosis but resistant not immune there were men who could not be hypnotized but jackson was not one of them his resistance probably sprang from a constant battle of wills between himself and his parents during his teen years which had made him not only highly argumentative but also very strongwilled and singleminded there was that in his mind which resisted outside interference or commands contrary to his nature or natural desires this was present in all men but had been more so in jackson an additional manifestation of which was his closeness of mind the fact that qubwa found some difficulty in reading his thoughts having for so long been obliged to hide his feelings and thoughts from his parents jackson had developed a real resistance to mindprobing secondly his metabolism had been erratic the drug he used would take him in a variety of ways normally qubwa could keep a fine control over the dosages his soldiers requiredthey could not be allowed to become inoperative through their addictionbut again in jacksons case there had been complications during the last twentyfour hours outside operatives had discovered at least one external supplier who had admitted catering to jacksons needs and how many others obviously jackson had brian lumley moonlighted supplementing qubwas drug allocation with privately contracted and often inferior supplies this meant quite simply that he had made himself partly independent of qubwas control had become a rogue in the organization not only was he less likely to listen to qubwas hypnotic commands but he might well read or translate them to his own advantage especially considering his ghetto background and upbringing for instance qubwas orders that his soldiers would do no deliberate wrong outside the castle but live their lives normally and so on jackson had never considered it wrong to take drugs it had been a way of life in the circles he frequented and his view of normalcy was hardly the common one the ghetto is not a normal place and it has its own laws of the land in this connection jackson could no more be said to be contemporary with societys majority than charon qubwa himself and finally there had been the simple fact that jackson was a rapist this had not been proven and qubwa had not seen fit to follow it up but in the police had twice connected him with attacks upon women in enlisting jackson qubwa had merely noted this additional warp in the fabric of his psychology this additional appetite to be fed for it was one which along with drug addiction must in the end increase jacksons dependence less fortunately it had also increased his unpredictability where sex is free and freely given the rapists violent psychological need becomes starved psychosphere and so a lesson learned and charon qubwa had no one to blame but himself indeed he might be seen as more to blame than jackson by the simple expedient of allowing his soldiers more knowledge of the purpose and nature of the mindguards he might well have avoided the entire incident in this episode the needtoknow basis he usually employed had failed him for the fact was that in the mentally negative condition in which the mindguards protected him they were totally susceptible to even the slightest physical movement or exertion their condition could be compared to a dreamless mental hibernation when all their brains were capable of was the basic control of bodily lifesupport systems and they must be allowed simply to sleep the condition off and the drug out of their systems just as creatures forced from hibernation will often die so too qubwas mindguards fortunately there was in his harem a woman whose drug dependence fast approached critical she was useless now except as a sex surrogate for even her lovernaking was unreal well her fate was decided she would finish her service to qubwa as a mindguard and at the last the pits beneath qubwas castle were deep and uncaring for full fifteen years those pits had offered mute unprotesting service and would continue to do so as long as they were needed the castles master stirred himself from his musing time was wasting and that irritated him more than twentyfour hours on this one brian lumley investigation and important things waiting to be done which could wait no longer qubwa had set pots boiling all over the world unless he stirred them occasionally his special brew might lose something of its flavor he left his study passed through the mindlab out into the castles central corridor junction and made for the command center in his private quarters the entire route was no more than thirty strides from start to end but as he went qubwa planned ahead singling out those garden minds he must once more infiltrate and the seeds he must sow in them gadaffi for example a little pressure there and qubwa could turn libyas eyes south to nigeria chad and the sudan not too much pressure however for here there was a fine balance to be maintained the mind was volatile enough without external influences too sharp a probe might well overbalance the whole thing better to keep things on the brink just keep the pot boiling then there were the generals chan tan masung and lipan dang on the sinosoviet border an incident or two there wouldnt go amiss and it was time too that france offered argentina the new excism iii airtosea missile with its infallible antijamming system that would give the falklands and the british government something to think about for of course qubwa would see to it that news of the sale was leaked worldwide nor must he forget the flo since israels crippling blow against them almost a year ago they psychosphere had been far too quiet a gentle squeeze or two an idea implantedin the minds of the at present lowlying leaders of the organization might just succeed in elevating young ali zufta into prominence and power overnight but there was a mind to be watched qubwa must be careful not to create that which might grow beyond the measure of his control but at the same time it would be remiss of him to forego a little mental agitation in certain israeli powercircles he reached the command center and issued instructions that he was not to be disturbed then took his computer remote and seated himself before the great globe now where to start qubwa smiled keyed globe and washington dc on the remote and as the globe spun and steadied he fixed his eyes and thoughts firmly on the north american capital in his minds eye he formed a picture of the white house remoteviewing its inner chambers the mind he sought was in residence was taking a nap preparatory to a busy evening ahead that was all to the good gubwa probed dreams of grain wheat endless conveyor belts carrying countless bags of it buckets and bushels and tons of it golden grain to fill the rambling bellies of the ussr peace and goodwill and ice splintering and melting from a glass containing coldwar cocktail leaders of nations smiling shaking hands brian lumley across a table embracing their flags side by side on a wall behind them money for the farmers the poor folk work for all peace prosperity votes no qubwa insinuated his own thoughts would you feed the devious bastards and make them strong enough to go to war with you would you really bow to the dirtgrubbers pander to the workshy for the sake of a few votes and in any case who in his right mind would vote for a man weak as that chaos a dream growing into nightmare pictures chasing themselves in endless procession grain wasting empty russian ships turned back thin russian faces hungry children grain again heaped in the docks rotting ratinfested chaos and horror nogubwa pictured a vast iron hand smashing down destroying the idle conveyor belts scattering mountains of foul grain left and right he pictured russian factories workers building

almighty america america the starspangled banner the white house retreating now in the minds eye of charon gubwa he opened his eyes sighed smiled good very good now then in moscow the time would be oh early morning very well now would be as good a time as any to see what he was up to gubwa keyed globe moscow into the remote his mind seeking the kremlin his eyes narrowing as the suspended sphere reacted to meet his requirement the plane spiralled down out of the sky like a lazily falling autumn leaf or a great silver moth singed by the candle sun ten seconds had passed since the explosion inside the floor tilted at fortyfive degrees and gforce held garrison and vicki together crushed to each other and to the curving wall beside garrisons seat and window the engines had stopped their howl replaced by the whispering hiss of sliced brian lumley air cabin pressure had somehow been maintained but the main controls were gone the situation was hopeless the spiral was tightening as the angle of descent increased forward the door to the cockpit slammed back on its hinges and a moment later the hostess staggered through billowing curtains literally dragging herself or climbing up the length of the small lounge blood poured from her nose her eyes were wide bright in a face filled with fear going down she needlessly gasped garrison halfpushed halflevered vicki back into her own seat said how bad is it before she could answer he had read her mind very bad she was totally panicked a mind full of chaos and thoughts of imminent death and yet her training had brought her back here an automaton working only to the book your seat belts she gasped and life jackets garrison shot his probe past her into the cockpit the copilots mind was blank unconscious he must have banged his head the pilot was fighting with the controls knowing he must fail but still desperately trying to command some sort of response from the crippled aircraft a frightened man who knew he was going to die but brave garrison probed deeper abombabloodybombabloodybomb over and over again and nohopenohopenohopenohopenohopel and bombnohopebombnohopebombnohope and shitshitshltshitshitshitshttshitshit garrison spoke in the pilots mind there is hope and was at once denied psychosphere nononononononononono have faith faith it was as if the man had suddenly realized it was not his own voice he heard in his head but that of some other even above his fear and horror garrison could now sense awe in him the man was catholic deeply religious a believer faith he repeated fly her cantcantcantcantcant shescrippledcrippled crippledcrippledcrippled garrison knew he could save himself and he could probably save vicki teleportation he could get them out of the plane set them down on terra firma somewhere anywhere but what about these people and just how much power could he muster what if he was wrong and anywaydamn it to helllhe couldnt just leave them to die but if they were to be saved he needed the pilots help needed his faith it is not your time my son he told him myqodgodgodqodgod the pilots hands worked at the controls garrison lifted with his mind levitation he squeezed his eyes tightly shut gripped the plane levelled out its plunge my god adrenalin ebbed a little in the pilots system his hands shookbut the plane seemed to be answering the controls my great heavenly merciful god correct your course said garrison yes oh yes yes yes oh yes garrison kept his eyes closed his mind tightly in control and spoke to the girl we seem to brian lumley have levelled out the pilot will need you if only to make coffee she blinked at him gave him a silly grin giggled hysterically then spat coffee her sudden laughter was a cackle fucking coffeel she laughed and again holy fucking mother of coffee terror had almost robbed her of her senses tears were in her eyes her face a mad white mask stained with blood from her still dripping nose coffee yes said vicki standing up and slapping the girls face almost knocking her from her feet the blow stung some sense back into her she held her face as hot tears gushed more freely now before turning and stumbling back towards the cockpit vicki fastened garrisons seat belt halfcollapsed into her seat and fastened her own she knew garrison was doing thissaving all their livesknew it and dared do nothing which might interfere lift her up garrison told the pilot take her up to her normal altitude no power ho engines impossible the pilot was crying tears streaming down his face he was talking to god faith the plane began to climb powerless she flew higher her wings slicing the wind vicki garrison gasped from between clenched teeth i need your help richard what can tio dont touch me he shrank back as she psychosphere leaned across just liftl will the plane to fly to keep on flying repeat over and over to yourself these words well make it well make it well make it repeat them and believe them vicki took a deep breath sat back and closed her eyes she clenched her fists well make it well make it well make it the copilot was coming out of it garrison probed him wake up we need your help were going to make it were going to make it garrison cut the probe and groaned he could feel his mind beginning to buckle it wasnt strong enough he needed help much more help he felt himself beginning to slip to slide to fall it was as if he fell into a great hole in the earth a chasm but even as he rushed down into blackness others were released to finish what he had started his mind split the garrison facet receded but the other facets surfaced were free garrisons body slumped in its seat his face pale as death his hands twitching the body was useless now except as a shell a house for three minds two of these were now free to fly the plane but garrison himself he fought a different battle flew a different machine the machine psychomech except psychomech wasnt flying but plunging to destruction liar garrisons yell drowned out suzys brian lumley howling liar schroeder liar but schroeder was gone and still the machine plunged garrison hung on for dear lifeor deathand bared his teeth in the rush of frigid air from the depths below and behind him the bitch clung to his back her fear no less than his own and suddenly from nowherelike a cold cloak thrown upon him by some unseen handthere was a chilly calmness a clearness of mind a feeling which went beyond fear a desire to know whose design this was whose hand had brought him to this end who was it down there down in the depths and the darkness whose magnet mind drew him like a meteorite falling from the night sky oh yes for someone had engineered this be sure of it this was the work of some dire enemyperhaps one of those enemies spied in the pit of the wizards but which one garrison must find out his magic was weak now true but not so weak he didnt feel the urge to fight back he must at least try to fight back garrison sent his mind winging back back to his dream within a dream he sat once more in the circle of wizards and he gazed once more upon them where they cast their strange runes and made their dark magics and one he saw whose face he knew at once a dark face and greedy belonging to a swarthy wizard whose immaculate attire could not conceal the evil that lurked within he shuffled cards and occasionally spun a small roulette wheel which he held between his crossed legs this one and his eyes smouldered psychosphere with hatred where they stared unblinkingly at the tiny garrisonfigure in the crystal ball and sure enough the garrison in the shewstone rode a tiny psychomech and man and machine and dog all plunging to their doom in a lightless chasm and now garrison knew that this was the one still falling and knowing the fall soon must end garrison quit his useless ineffective levitating and drew his powers in he wrapped them about himself as a man wraps a robeor coils a whip he reached out his mind into another world another placethe pit of the wizardsand hurled his energies in one final blast full in the face of the wizard with the cards and the wheel it was business as usual for carlo vicenti and as usual his business was dirty a thoroughly dirty game his knightsbridge penthouse flat was the venue two of his boys were bitpart players the star performer was one of vicentis girls caught once too often taking too much of the ante she had a lesson to learn as all of them did at least once in their short working lives and vicenti was just the one to teach her now she was held down in a straightbacked dining chair fatso facello on one side and toni murelli on the other they had torn her dress down the front and jerked up her brassiere so that her normally proud breasts were forced down a little beneath the black material of the bra and made to bulge vicenti considered all women cows to be milked dry and now the way this little tramps udders flopped thereswollen brian lumley and bruised by the rough handling of his thugs whod taken turns with her on the thick pile carpet for a warmupthey only served to affirm his conviction mary said vicenti almost genially waving his thin cigar in the air in an expansive gesture as he drew up a second chair in front of her and hung his arms lazily over its back you have given me problems things to think about fiow this i dont like smooth operations i like girls doing as theyre told i like whores making money and taking their cut i like but taking my cut tooor not even telling me theres a cut to takethis i really do not like his voice had hardened wot one little bit do i like it he reached out caught up her bra in one tight fist and wrenched it from her its elastic had left a horizontal groove in the flesh of her breasts two inches above her small nipples just over the rim of her large prominent areolas scared to death the girl panted she was blonde youngno more than twenty twentyone years oldand the perspiration of panic and terror gleamed on her face she would normally be pretty but now her eyes were bright darting pinpoints in the bloodless face of a trapped animal vicenti thought why is it that when theyre scared they always look so ugly finally she gabbled out they were just a few spare tricks mr vicenti honest and in my own time he gave a short harshly barking laugh which was echoed by amused grunts from the thugs holding her down your own time heyyour psychosphere times my time little woman didnt anyone ever tell you anything and my time youve been wasting but i didnt but you did he leaned forward tilting his chair wow listen and ill tell you how its going to be youve maybe been working too hard and got kind of confused forgot your loyalties you know so see im a nice guy really what ill do is this ill give you a couple of weeks off a holiday wo work of course that also means no money but youll get by on what you got stashed and just to make sure you dont work he drew deeply on his cigar blew the white crust of ash from its glowing tip reached it towards her breasts no mr vicenti no please dont mark me please she cowered down then tried to surge upright facello and murelli grunted as they tightened their grip holding her rigidly immobile see vicenti said again almost conversationally theres not too many guys will suck on scabby tits you know they get to wondering how they got that way they think you know maybe she has a bad case eh he reached out his free hand pinched her left nipple until it stuck out between his thumb and forefinger brought the hot tip of the cigar closer what happened then was too fast and too fantastic for vicenti facello or murelli to follow the girl halffainting her eyes shut in a face deathwhite and quaking didnt even see it vicenti seemed suddenly to squash down into brian lumley himself as if someone had placed a massive unseen weight upon his shoulders he crashed through the debris of his splintering chair and slammed against the floor he didnt cry out had no air left in him for that and even as his soldiers let go the girl and went to help him he was lifted up away from them and hurled against the wall fortunately for him the wall was of softboard on thin timbers more a fancy partition than a true wall with tiny shelves for expensive knickknacks and oddsandends fortunately because it gave beneath his weight caving in on him as he went through it then for a moment it was as if a howling wind filled the room curtains flapped angrily and magazines were scattered in the rush of frenzied air pictures rocked crazily where they hung on the walls doors and windows slammed and small ornaments fell from shelves in all it lasted no longer than three or four seconds then the winds were gone and in their place silence vicenti lay groaning barely conscious halfin halfout of the walls debris his soldiers crept towards him eyes wide mouths agape unable to take it in the girl seeing her chances bunched up the tatters of her dress in front of her chest and fled the room facello and murelli may have heard her go but they made no move to stop her boss murelli croaked shocked almost dumb where he kneeled beside his hoodlum master get me uhl a doctor vicenti told him and later you can pick up those psychosphere uhl sons of bitches the black brothers jesus i want to see uhl those bastards they were supposed to uhlkill the guy not him kill me guy murelli turned bewildered eyes upon the gaping facello and shrugged questioningly obviously vicenti had banged his head he wasnt making much sense what guy boss vicenti coughed and tried to lie still he didnt know which part of him hurt the most what guy he managed to reply you have to be kidding are you uh blind you two didnt you even uhl see him who boss who facello kneeled beside murelli and stuck his fat scarred pigs face close who do you mean eh uhl garrison thats who you two uhl you didnt even see him idiots i dont know uhl how he got in here or what he uhl hit me with butoh god get me a fucking doctor will youbut it was uhl him ok yeah and with that he lay back his head and let the pain roll over him bearing him swiftly away upon a dark red cloud of unconsciousness garrison hurled his bolt of espenergyand in his minds eye he saw the wizard struck and hurled back from the satanic circle butno time to stay and savor the event no time to wait and see if this wizard lived or died time merely for a ftnal glance at the shewstone before returning his mind to the plunging machine one glance but sufficient to tell him all he needed to know brian lumley for in the shewstone the toy machines monstrous descent was halted and a tiny triumphant garrison stood upon its back howling his victory shaking his fists and beating his breast garrison thrust the vision away returned his mind to the here the now the chasm and the plunge and the wind no longer howled past his head psychomech no longer plunged suzy no longer yelped her terror but licked his ear and whined worriedly the machine stood still upon the air held there by garrisons power returned and if he had stepped down from the machine then he could have stood upon the chasms boulderstrewn floor that close he did not step down but stood up stood tall upon the machines broad back and howled his victory and shook his fistbehaving even as the tiny garrison in the crystal had behavedand suzus sardonic baying gave strength to his own until the chasm rang to the echoes of their laughter then upward to the narrow crack of starscattered sky which was the great rifts mouth garrison rode the machine upward and outward and away upon his quest chapter the meetiriq was of ten men if mot the most important or influential men in the british isles certainly their representatives it had been convened secretly through government channels and its chairman was the head of an obscure branch of the secret service obscure in the sense that it dealt with obscurities current jargon for tasks which were too intricate problematic sensitive or bloody for the talents and tastes of its contemporaries the chairman was an extremely tall slim man whose highdomed head and shifty piercing blue eyes spoke of a foxy intelligence his hands were very long delicate and fragilelooking as were his features but there was nothing fragile about his mind that was a steel trap of the others gathered about the long polished table with the sole exception of a small brian lumley and wiry yellow man they were white in the main british or of european extraction their fields were finance mineral rights and mining transport telecommunications weapons and espionage there was also an official observer governmental of course and finally a man from the inland reserve mi had brought someone along for the ride his aide apparently a silent grayeyed stonycalm wedge of a man whose movements despite their almost robotic precision were remarkably adroit hinting at great speed strength and coordination he sat back a little from the table unobtrusively reading from a file which lay open in his lap some of those about the table knew each other however vaguely or knew of each other but in the main they were strangers and in other circumstances might be more than a little cagey though their interest was a common one still they made strange bedfellows the object of the meeting was that which formed this common bond amongst them making friends or conspiratorsfor the moment at leastof otherwise potential antagonists the venue was the chairmans country house not far from sutton surrey and the meeting was set to commence at pm on an early june day mo one had been late psychosphere gentlemen the chairman rose to his feet when all were settled down thank you for being here and for your punctuality ill try not to waste your time but get straight to the point when this er gettogether was planned some months ago it was not projected as an extraordinary meeting but more an overview from which to glean essential facts upon which to act he shrugged in whichever ways were considered necessary in short while a problem was foreseen it was not yet known quite what we were dealing with and were still not sure he paused looked around the table at each face individually and finally continued in his dry wellmodulated voice since then continued investigation has lent the matter a deal more urgency so that we must now consider the subject extraordinary as stated but with a definite emphasis on extra all of you with the exception of he almost said our oriental friend but at the last second checked himself merely including his head in the chinamans direction and receiving a similar acknowledgement who has his own sources were furnished with brief details from which to prepare your own pointsof information the findings of your preliminary or subsequent investigations are what now bring us together to discussagain as an overview but with more positive action in mindthe very serious nature of the er possible disruption again he paused while his opening address had been couched in terms which must surely mystify any unin brian lumley formed observer the circle of faces meeting his own showed no sign of misunderstanding or misinterpretation each and every one of them knew what he was talking about to be more specific he eventually went on the problem quite simply is a man a very strange immensely talented highly enigmatic and incredibly rich man his name as you are all aware is richard garrison the assembled personages stirred someone cleared his throat another shuffled his feet yes the chairman nodded you all know his name well enough individually but perhaps as a group you are not aware of the interactions of his influence his influence that is in so manyand such diversespheres perhaps the bank of england would like to start us off as the chairman sat down b of e a stocky middleaged man of medium height whose smalllensed spectacles and jutting jaw gave him a sort of aggressively fishy pikelike look stood up wine years ago ahem he began mr garrison was a customer of ours a fairly important respected customerahem that is to say we helder you understand i am not at liberty to disclose actual figuressome ahem millions of pounds of his money in cash disposable assets and various investments a lot of money for one man yes but a mere drop in the overall financial ocean recently however well things have changed somewhat in fact they have changed a great deal he paused to take out a handkerchief and wipe his suddenly perspiring brow psychosphere to illustrate my point i might say that if mr garrison ahem were to withdraw or transfer his cashhis cash alone you understandthen there could be problems the drop in the ocean you see has become a bucketful indeed a lake oh we could cover it of course but even the b of e might have to call on certain reserves he paused again to let that sink in though no one at the table seemed in the least surprised a little over a month ago b of e continued acting on rather special instructions i contacted friends in switzerland to confirm their backing in the event of just such a massive withdrawal or conversion this had become necessary when in the space of just a few weeks mr garrison had added ahem considerably to his account various deposits totalled half as much again as his original holdings well as a result of consultations in zurich it came to my knowledgeand of course this is in the strictest confidencethat garrisons accounts abroad ahem make his british holdings seem a pittance by comparison the sweat was heavy on his brow now and he had stopped wiping it in fact gentlemen he is capable of moving millions about like you and i might move pieces in a game of chess but far more devastatinglyahem and he never loses a piece before we sat down at this table i took the opportunity to speak to an acquaintance of mine whose interests also are financial perhaps he would care to enlarge upon what i have said he carefully sat down his eyes steady upon brian lumley those of a redhaired very fat and florid man seated opposite as financial friend heaved wheezingly to his feet the general consensus of opinion taken from those seated about the table would have been that if overeating didnt get him pressure of work would and at least half of those present would not have minded that at all financial friend was from the inland revenue and he was not in the right job his shirt and jacket were far too tight and when he spoke his voice was far too highly pitched gentlemen he wheezed pufflly mr garrison pays his taxessome of them anyway he pays an awful lot he would pay a great deal more except that he has the very best accountants in the land possibly in the world working for him that is no exaggeration i suspect that he pays them more than he pays us what he does pay us is he shook his head and blinked his eyes rapidly in an expression of astonishment is an awesome figure believe that someone once said of the beatles that if we had another ten equally successful groups then we could abolish income tax for the masses that was an exaggeration of course but if said of our mr garrison it would be much more literally true awesome yes and yetas has already been said in connection with him a mere drop in the ocean in garrisons ocean that is and getting hold of even that drop might well be likened to squeezing blood from a stone i only wish there was a wayand you may psychosphere believe me when i say we are working at itof getting hold of some of the taxes were sure he has avoided paying thats all he continued to wheeze for a few moments more then collapsed flabbily into his seat the chairman at once rose and took up the thread redirecting the meetings course of course gentlemen we must be careful not to allow ourselves to dwell too deeply on mr garrisons considerableor should we say incrediblewealth nor upon his attachment to it which is only natural some might even say laudable how he got it might be much more illuminating for quite frankly his roots were only very austere in fact only a little over ten years ago he was a corporal serving in the royal military police and he might still be a member of that estimable corps if a terrorist bomb had not blinded him in belfast after that and he went quickly on to vaguely outline something of garrisons relationship with thomas schroeder and of the benefits he had acquired upon the german industrialists death in all he was on his feet for some twelve minutes after which he was glad to sit down again and hand over to mi intelligence was not at all typical in no way a stereotype small grubby with badly bitten fingernails and unevenly cropped sandy hair he more readily portrayed a sleepless bankrupt greengrocer only when he spoke did it become apparent that his appearance was a front his voice was clear and cutting his sentences short and void of the usual security or police jargon he gave the impression too that he would have brian lumley been delighted to avoid the use of the word alleged but that in garrisons case such was quite impossible gents the implication of this meeting is that garrisons a crook by crook i mean a criminal local or international or both well if he is then hes the cleverest of them all put it this way hes off and running and already overtaken the hare hes so far ahead we dont have a hope in hell of catching him not yet but if he is a crook then hell make a mistake they all do sooner or later okay lets assume he is first of all ill tell you what hes not intosimply because we dont yet know what he is into hes not into gambling even though he owns a big slice of a london casino thats not to say he doesnt gamble he does and phenomenally well but theres no legislation against a mans good luck he doesnt organize gambling thats all hes not into drugs he doesnt use them or push them hes not into sexvice that is oh he occasionally fools around with a couple of highclass ladies and he has a regular ride in the citythat is to say a mistress a kept womanbut his heart would seem to belong to the woman he lives with one vicki maler an alleged german national actually we dont quite know what to make of her her case is as weird as his maybe weirder but ill explain that in a moment right so we can strike narcotics prostitution and gambling he is not into the protection rackets not into smuggling or gunrunning or fraud not that we can discover anyway he has psychosphere no big deals going with any known crime syndicate here or abroad which means we can also strike the mafia extortion etc he paused and sighed garrison would appear therefore to be on the up and up honest as the day is long well maybe not too honest inland revenue doesnt like him because he dodges he shrugged but if thats a crime were a nation of criminals so what are we left with he doesnt mug old ladies doesnt even spit on the pavement a thief a terrorist that isnt even in his nature hes an excop albeit a military cop so to echo our chairmans question where did he get his money youd think wed have trouble finding out eh well we had a little trouble but not a lot in fact as soon as we stopped hunting haggis and began to accept the facts at face value it was easy everything he has is legitimate everything mi glanced out of the corner of his eye at inland revenue with the possible exception of what he is alleged to owe certain parties in certain quarters so why has it taken us so long to discover hes legitimate again he shrugged easy how can any guy with that kind of money be legitimate is it possible well it would certainly appear to bebut not without a few mildly disturbing discrepancies ambiguities and anomalies let me explain i said garrison isnt a racketeer or terrorist that seems to be true enoughbut there do appear to be tenuous links as you already know brian lumley he was blinded by a terrorist bomb ira belfast mow let me make a point here and say he is officially blind ive seen the records army records medical records the lot permanently blind he stood nodding his head for a moment knuckles on the table blind yes but ill come back to that two years ago the ira were after him again at least thats the way it looks a londonbased irishman with old ira cosinections tried to kill him something went wrong the faddy blew himself to bits instead that sort of thing happens but leave it for the moment then theres a much more sinister sort of organization called nazism thomas schroeder was an exss colonel thats not strangea great many of their top ranks were set free and lots of them still occupy positions of power contrary to popular belief they werent all villains schroeder so far as we know wasnt a villain or he was but not in the usual poisonous jewkilling sort of way anyway he wasnt taking any chances he never was brought to tria him and a young ssscharfuhrer called wilhem klinke later willy koenigknocked over a truckload of ss bullion and disappeared with it probably into switzerland but we dont know that for sure we dont know that they stole the gold but it seems a fair bet that was towards the end february when schroeder died some ten years ago koenig went to work for garrison for some reason known only to himself the old colonel not only made sure his money was transferred to garri psychosphere son but also his main man so a link however tenuous with nazism and another link is a guy called qareth wyatt wyatt was a doctor a psychiatrist whom many supposed to be a quack certain parties tried to tie him in with a british escape route for the type of nazis who were villains well when the ira had their second bash at garrison they also had a go at wyatt we dont know why except that garrison had been undergoing treatment at wyatts place the psychiatrist had a house in sussex say he had a house because when the ira or whoever were finished there was no more house they took it out they also took out wyatt and garrisons wife that is to say the two died in the explosionif it was an explosion he paused and frowned mow this is a funny thing funny peculiar not haha wyatts house was big and old your old country home sort of place in its own grounds much like this one just what happened there what really happenedwill never be known but the house isnt there anymore mot a brick the grass grows green over the place where it stood underneath he shrugged the foundations are fused like blast furnace slag anyway about the same time we also have the disappearance of willy koenig not dead no simply lets say retired where to who knows but definitely not dead koenig is a very rich man in his own right as well you might expect if you remember the ss gold and he still makes good use of his money a lot of it is tied brian lumley up with garrisons but disappeared is certainly the right word because no one seems to know where he is he simply isnt seen anymore lets go back to garrisons blindness to put the record straight and no matter what the old medical records say garrison is not blind he hasnt been for at least two years since about the same time as his wife and wyatt got hit one theory in my branch is that his blindness was psychosomatic and that wyatt was treating him and was successful that might also explain the link between them anyway he was blind isnt now but continues to wear a pair of blindman specs so does the new woman in his life this vicki maler plow for a long time apparently garrison has had dealings with a german firm of oculistsor not exactly oculists but specialists in mechanical aids to sight this firm supplied him with a lot of expensive equipment when he really was blind their latest job for him is the manufacture of several sets of contact lenses for both him and vicki maler but these are to be very special lenses contact lenses to let light in but not out like oneway windows he wants to be able to see things without his eyes being seen okay but surely ordinary contact lenses would suffice or again maybe its a special condition of his eyes he paused stood for a moment longer said a break i think gents youll excuse me but id like a cigarette also id like to sit a while would you mind if i carry on seated and smoking psychosphere no one minded all of them were fascinated mi sat produced cigarettes lit one and relaxed a little in his chair before continuing okay we were talking about special conditions anomalies and such garrisons lady vicki maler is just such an anomaly shes in the process of becoming british but holds a german passport which says she was born in that would make her thirtysix years old but she looks ten years younger than that red hair elfin features lovely figurebeautiful they travel a fair bit garrison and the woman and they use airports her passport has been checked outdiscreetly its genuine and was issued in hamburg in when she was thirteen the only thing is he paused cleared his throat and looked at the faces watching him that the vicki maler the passport was issued to died in oh and one other thing she too was blind fine so for some unknown reason garrisons woman has assumed an identity other than her real one or has she well here are a couple of pretty macabre facts for you onein the early summer of the body of one vicki maler was placed in socalled cryogenic suspension at schloss zonigen in the swiss alps twothis was done on the posthumous instructions of thomas schroeder dead since and threetwo years ago that same vicki malers frozen remains disappeared right out of the schloss brian lumley as for the swiss authorities well theyve neatly tied the whoe thing up and buried it and i cant say i blame them one thing however is very definite vicki malers name has been lifted from the register that is to say not only is there no longer a corpse answering to her description in the fridge but the records say there never was one now theres a lot more about garrison that we know some of it very interesting some not so interesting dont propose to bore you with trivia and there are those of you yet to have your say but there are two more things of major importance one is garrisons money its source it wasnt easy to dig up all the facts out of their various crevices and theres doubtless a lot weve missed but most of his bedrock resourceshis bulk cash and holdingsall came his way at that same time two years ago through thomas schroeder now schroeder had been dead since but hed left his executors with clear and foolproof instructions garrison got the lot next i said he didnt control gambling thats true but he doesor didgamble not so much now not at all that i know of but he did this was something else that started two years ago in fact for a period of something like four months shortly after the wyatt business he seems to have done little else and very successfully he hit just about every major football pools syndicate in the worldeighteen of them in all top wins that isand jackpots every time but psychosphere never with any publicity we were called in by littlewoods to see how he was fiddling it he wasnt but we stuck to him anyway and what that led us to was literally unbelievable gents when garrison gambles he doesnt lose ever he doesnt even come close to losing under various pseudonyms he reduced almost every major bookmaker and gambling consortium in great britain to nearbankruptcy he did the same in the worlds greatest casinos some of the smaller ones tooand finally he took las vegas and he took las vegas like no one ever took it before so well that overnight he went to number one on the mafia hit list except that when they got around to it there was no one to hit hed simply disappeared moved on with money and credits totalling some twentyseven million dollars and all of this done more or less openly with only a minimum of effort to cover his tracks as if he had absolutely nothing to fear and why not for as an honest upright member of society what would he have to fear oh he went to vegas in a sort of disguise with a retinue of his staff also disguisedbut can you blame him my guess is he knew he would clean up knew it for a certainty and when it was over he simply desired to fade out of sightwhich is what he did since then he hasnt gambled a penny its as if it was something he wanted to trya system maybe or just something in his bloodand having got it out of himself he lost all interest in it crazy he sat shaking his head lit a second ciga brian lumley rette finally looked up thats me finished my branch is still on garrison of course but at a distance we dont intend to harass him and im pretty sure we wont get anything on him hes clean one very last thing i think youll discover pretty soon when the rest of you have had a chance to speak that weve all of us underestimated garrison its just a feeling i have thats all underestimated the chairman was on his feet again will mi take a moment more to explain mi nodded okay i think that if we could really see garrison all of himi mean if we could really get under his skinwed find were fooling about with one of the most powerful men in the world powerful in just about any way you care to mention and barring any accident any deterioration in his health shall we say i think hes destined to be the most powerful very shortly mo one spoke after a moment the chairman said thank you he stood looking round the table unsmiling tall and gaunt and strangely cold finally he suggested a break for coffee gentlemen following which well continue and i think by now that were all beginning to see just why this meeting was called the seated men remained silent then one by one they began to stand up and stretch their legs after coffee it was the turn of mineral rights and mining followed by transport and finally tele psychosphere communications all told similar tales in the last two years garrison had gone from strength to strength he andor his companies were the majority shareholders in almost every big business one might care to name he was the man behind the men in control and no one outside this room knew it but thats just the problem gentlemen the chairman took pains to point out when once more he had the floor if garrison were the aga khan or the maharaja of mogador or some despot oil sheikhif his name was rockefeller or getty or onassisif he was the president of the usa or the head of the cosa wostra then wed know what or what not to do about him and if he had any of those backgrounds wed more ably understand him and not need to fear him but he isnt and he doesnt what he is is an exmilitary police corporal turned big businessmanno supertycoonwho seems destined to become the richest most powerful man in the world and no one knows except us and a handful of others how he does the things he does is not importantthough id dearly love to know whats to be done about him is important quite simply if mr garrison turned nasty he could pull the chairs out from under all of us he can ruin our economythe worlds economy he can cripple airlines shipping communications industry may have already begun to do so if only as an exercise in the manipulation of power oh yes thats a possibility already he may have flexed his muscles maybe more than once or twice brian lumley that is very true said finance jumping to his feet look at the recent ahem fluctuationssupposedly inexplicable fluctuations in precious metals look at the collapse of certain airlines the much more devastating collapse of entire economies the shuddery state of banking of wall street and the stock exchange my god inland revenue wheezed also on his feet but i didnt know the half of it not the tenth part of it he was trembling in every ounce of fat he ran jelly fingers through his flaky hair hes made complete fools of us must owe us millions hes wait the chairman thumped the table gentlemen please remain seated please they sat obviously you have seen the light yes garrison is a potential bomb and yes he would seem to have his finger on his own trigger but but youd be advised to stop right there mi broke in his voice calm controlled i beg your pardon the chairmans voice was sharp his eyes suddenly hooded before you say anything else said mi theres another little thing you should know he glanced at government observer a very young man whose silence throughout had been generally mistaken for lack of understanding or experience then stared directly at the chairman i was given the option of telling or of holding back now i think youd better know all of you before hysteria sets in its just one psychosphere more anomaly if you like simply this garrison is british and he is patriotic with the exception of the chairman mis audience looked blank the chairman guessed what was coming and groaned inwardly he had hoped mi didnt have this information but too late now a pity it had all been going so well garrison has made out a will mi continued pausing to wave the others down as they all began to question at once please his will is simplewithin its vast scope of courseand so worded or constructed as to be quite irrefutable incontestable it was received by her majestys government just a few days ago before garrison went abroad on holiday he also left instructions that he didnt want to talk about it the government is to be executor in the event of garrisons er sudden demise and everythingthat is everythingis to go to the country to england there was stunned silence the chairman bit his lip someone must have leaked this to mi as it had been leaked to him perhaps observer on instructions from above finally mi went on so you see he doesnt intend to pull the chairs out from under us after all doesnt want to be king of the world isnt bent on chaos destruction which makes me wonder just what were all doing here as he slowed and came to a halt so his eyebrows lowered in a dark frown he gave a last look around at the staring faces then turned brian lumley his eyes down and began to pick at his already ragged nails the chairman decided to take a chance find out what their reactions would be nothing has changed he said this this will of his could be a blind a ploy a safeguard against deeper investigation the fact remains while hes alive garrison is a potential bomb but gentlemen said the small yellow man for the first time he was on hisfeet smiling bowing he straightened up now if i may speak his voice was a whisper extremely gentle and soothing exemplifying everyones conception of an englishspeaking chinaman almost a caricature my master arrived at these same conclusions some time ago for which reason he has taken a special interest in mr garrison now he wishes it to be said that whatever else may be decided mr garrison is not to die that would not bebeneficial again the stunned silence or maybe not so stunned but in another moment the entire room was on its feet what the chairman had watched and was guided by the immediate reactions of the rest and was the first to shout his denial covering his tracks can believe my ears do you really imagine that i was suggesting that we would even consideruntil even his strident denials were lost in the general hubbub however and for all that he continued to protest his mind was on different things such as his masters instructions that indeed garrison was to die the country would benefit beyond the wildest most psychosphere optimistic dreams of any economistand so would the branch the potential for the expansion of espionage and counterintelligence would be enormous the cia would soon be smallfry by comparison these were the reasons the chairmans boss the head of the branch had suppliedbut the chairman knew there was at least one more his boss was a man of means and greedy he had admitted that he more than merely played about with stocks and shares everything he had was tied up in the game and he had hinted that he might easily double his holdings in certain areas but for the interference of a couple of large shareholders namely messrs garrison and koenig thus garrisons death would be of great personal advantage to him as thoughts such as these passed through the chairmans head the row taking shape about the great table had increased twofold mineral rights and mining was also shouting the little chinaman down who the devil is your master anyway does he think the authorities in this country are coldblooded murderers mr chairman demand to knowuntil his voice also became one with the uproar but in the back of his mind he too was already considering the prospect of great britain as a major controlling influence in opec and of the advantages of large slices of the south african and australian mining pies it was the same with most of themwith the notable exceptions of the chinaman himself mi and his ic and observer the first of these brian lumley psychosphere had merely followed charon qubwas instructions was not greatly interested in the furor his cautionary words had sparked mi simply sat back and took stock of things his narrowed eyes were on the chairman and his mind seethed with dark suspicions he had always believed in the service as a whole but never in the chairmans somehow sinister selfgoverning branch of that body honor among thieves indeed as for observer he sat still blandfaced and observed after a while the din died down a little through it all the chinaman had remained on his feet smiling still mow he took the opportunity to make for the doors which at that moment opened to admit the chairmans uniformed man he went straight to his employer and handed him a note then turned on his heel and left he would have closed the doors behind him but the chinaman stood there smiling for no apparent reason suddenly everyones attention seemed riveted on the chairman he seemed to be having some difficulty reading the note but at last he cleared his throat and looked up the corner of his mouth twitching a little gentlemen he finally said it seems that any actions we er might have consideredany further investigations that is to sayhave been preempted his voice was just a little shaky by that i mean he hurriedly went on it would appear that some other or others have found mr garrisons er talents equally troublesomeeven more so he cleared his throat again this had not been of his doing if it had been then it wouldnt be bungled as it was it was an embarrassment but on the other hand it might provide the cover of an authentic precedent in the event of a future more successful enterprise mr garrisons plane he went on glancing at the note has recently landed at gatwick the landing wasit says herea miraculous escape the plane was sabotaged a bomb pio one was hurt but mr garrison has been taken to a private hospital severe shock it appears his words sank in slowly their heads turned to stare at the little chinaman he stood at the doors smiled back at their frowning expressions then he bowed and his sighing voice seemed to fill the room gentlemen i am sure you will now have other items for discussion hopefully one of them will be measures for the protection of mr garrison my time however is limited i bid you good day no one objected as he silently left the room chapter the meeting had broken up shortly after receiving the news of the sabotage attempt on garrisons plane mi and friend had come up by train from waterloo government observer in his car how walking across the chairmans drive together observer invited the other two can i give you a lift back into the city that way i could save both of you some time and perhaps we could have a little chat thank you m agreed at once all three got into observers old rover and sat there waiting for the rest of the departing delegates to move their cars when the way was clear observer drove out of the grounds down the driveway and onto the road for the city from an upstairs window of the house the chairman watched them go psychosphere the chairman was not happy he was in fact angry angry with mi with whoever had tried to blow garrison out of the sky for failing but mainly with charon gubwa who for some time had been getting a little too big for his boots the chairman used gubwa as an intelligence source had done so for more years than he cared to think about and in his turn gubwa used him like garrison gubwa was into business did a little financing and etc the chairman had never worried too much about the etc but it had made gubwa rich very rich the chairman suspected though not on garrisons scale but then who was rich on garrisons scale oh gubwa was bent most definitely but he was also one superb grass the chairman had built his early reputation on charon gubwas tipoffs what he couldnt understand was gubwas sudden interest in garrisonin his continued good health that was to say it could be of course that gubwa worked for garrison but the chairman doubted that gubwa didnt really work for anyone except himself in many of their dealingscertainly in recent yearshe had always suspected that gubwa got far more out of their intelligence transactions than ever he did it had dawned on him too that perhaps gubwa was a doubleagent working not only for the chairman and his branch but also for a number of foreign agencies yes unfortunately that did seem a strong possibility brian lumley but qubwas organization did have a serious weakness the chairman knew the location of its headquarters and he had long ago formulated certain courses of action this was not a thought he let himself dwell upon too often qubwa had an uncanny knack of knowing or predicting things before they happened it would not be in the chairmans interests to have qubwa discover the axe that he held over him not until he was ready to let it fall at any rate as for qubwas headquarters in early when it had been rumored that adolf hitler might get the abomb first several underground command posts had been built in and around londonsubterranean shelters from which the war effort could be directed to the last these had been kept operational until the late s when costs had gone through the roof the least viable of these shelters in central london had been due for closedown an unused dusty dark place deep underground built in a natural cave halfway down a great fault in the bedrock charon qubwa had bought it and turned it into his home and headquarters the place had always been secret and qubwa had kept it that way but the chairman knew of its existence and had even been down thereonce that had been all of ten years ago but the chairman remembered it well now despite the fact that the house was quite warm he shivered the thought of that great steel coffin down there in the bowels of the earth qubwas castle always did that to him he hadnt seen all of the place but enough enough to know that he psychosphere could have put qubwa out of business there and then and that he should have the reason he hadnt was simple the man had more leads than a telephone exchange if the chairman had wanted to know something about anybody or anythingliterally anybody or anything qubwa could usually get that information for him in return all the chairman had to do was keep people off qubwas back at least until he was better established well perhaps hed done a little bit more than that the chairman soured at the thought no hed done a lot more than that when the computer age had come rolling in he had been instrumental in extending qubwas eyes and ears that is to say he had seen to it that qubwas own computer had access to external sources and systems he had known of course that he could shut down qubwas operation whenever he desired as soon as the man outlived his usefulness but what he had not foreseen was the massive buildup of computer technology the extensive use of the damned machine in almost every aspect of life and facet of society he had in effect given qubwa an intelligence system second to none had built a wall of technology about qubwas already formidable castle of secrets and that was a weapon which eventually might be turned against the chairman himself and against his branch it would not be used nonot as long as he played the game with qubwa but there had been times recently when he had not wanted to play the game like at this very moment brian lumley and of course if the chairmans chief ever discovered that old mistake of histhat old old mistake with all its implications including the fact that it had remained unreported uncorrected through all of these long yearsthen the chairman was finished then his head would well and truly roll but who was there to tell him mot the chairman and the only other person who knew of it was charon qubwa himself of course the only way to put qubwa out of business now would be to go down there with a squad of trusted branch heavies and literally rip the place to bitsand in the process destroy any evidence linking qubwa to himself yes and it just might come to that if the man had any more tricks up his sleeve like this last one the chairman had known of course that qubwa was sending a representative to the meeting he himself had agreed to it but he had certainly not foreseen the idiot demanding that garrisons life be spared mot there and then just like that the way it had been done had only served to accentuate the fact that the chairmans branch had considered garrisons removal as a serious proposition indeed only the timely arrival of that note telling that someone else had already tried to kill garrison had averted what might have proved to be a very damaging scene the chairmans anger began to boil over he snatched himself away from the window poured himself a drink tried to control the heat he felt bubbling up inside the last of his guests had psychosphere gone now and the day had grown well into late afternoon pretty soon the chairmans chief would be on the blower demanding an explanation or at least asking awkward questions the chairman took his drink down to his study locked himself in picked up the telephone qubwa was more or less expecting the call he halfsensed it was coming if he had attended the meetingthrough the mind of johnnie fongthen he would have been sure it was coming but he had not done so too frequent or prolonged use of his esptalents invariably tired qubwa so that wherever possible he used them sparingly in any case there had been other things to do therefore when the telephone in his study buzzed a precognitive tingle told qubwa that it was the chairman he smiled as he picked up the telephone and how are you today sir harry he inquired his voice oily listen charon you know bloody well that im angry came the answer have you any idea how much you might have embarrassed me today the might puzzled gubwa he had been sure that the other would be embarrassed he did not yet know of garrisons brush with disaster he decided to play it straight but without being too inquisitive but it was my intention to embarrass you he laughed i knew you would be considering garrisons removalfor the good of the brian lumley country and all thatbut it doesnt suit me to have him removed riot just yet i simply brought it out in the open thats all showed how it might serve a variety of purposes if he were eliminated thats my way of ensuring that nothing does happen to him for if anything does nowwhy theyll all be looking to you for the answers and that really would be embarrassing sir marry listened to all of this in growing dismay and anger qubwa had got too big for his boots he might have to bring his plans for the man forwardsomewhat mow listen charon i ho you listen garrison must not be harmed there is a lot i have to know about him first things which could be of great benefit to both of us after that he let the sentence hang there incomplete qubwa could almost hear sir harry grinding his teeth qubwa you who works for who around here oh now sir harry gubwas voice was dangerously soft you know better than that who works for who indeed why were partners you and and ive just explained that its to our benefit that garrison livesfor a while longer anyway charon youre pushing your luck i have my orders you cant interfere with that and anyway if dont get him its likely the others will theyll make a better job of it next time you can be sure of it qubwas pulse quickened the others what others and what next time he did not want to psychosphere ask the chairman what he was talking about not directly so wait he said he knew where sir harry was he closed his eyes sent his mind soaring out entered the others thoughts they were guarded as usual but gubwa could get in he probed saw withdrew sir harry didnt even know hed been there wouldnt have believed it if gubwa himself had told him there wont be a next time gubwa said his mind racing damn it who had tried to kill garrison and why it looked like he must now put everything else aside and concentrate all of his energies on this one project on richard garrison not until im ready as for my pushing my luck if thats a threat sir harry forget it i would survive you on the other hand might not be so lucky now whos threatening charon gubwa didnt like the sudden chill in the others voice this was a man you mustnt squeeze too tight look he said why are we fighting damn it you know why that was a dirty trick of yours charon id never have let your chinky chappie in the house if id known what you were up to his presence at the meeting would have been difficult to explain away as it was but now people are bound to start asking who and why and what dont you understand ive been told to deal with garrison now i cantnot without difficulty anywaybecause youve screwed it up brian lumley then let me do the job for youbut in my own time when ive got what i want this sounded better how much time sir harry was cautious qubwa thought about it said a month six weeks at the outside that should be time enough time enough for what charon what is your interest in garrison ah sir harry cant we keep a few little secrets to ourselves you and be satisfied that ill kill him thats all the chairman still wasnt quite satisfied i dont know and ill do it in a way that lets you and the branch out entirely rio possible connection that sounded much better sir harry lingered over the proposition letting himself be swayed and why not after all no one had set a time limit on garrisons life six weeks should be quite satisfactory and when gubwa had done the job that would be time enough to sort him out fortunately gubwa was not probing any of this fortunately for sir harry all right he finally agreed well do it your way good said gubwa and theres something you can do for me i could do it myself but this way is quicker oh sir harry was cautious once more yes ill need to know the name of garrisons minder i dont know if hell have one yet gubwa laughed oh im sure he will proba psychosphere bly your friends at mi theyre a trustworthy lot in the main do find out for me wont you ill do my best the chairman growled fine well that about concludes it i imagine unless theres anything else youd care to mention mo well then it was good to hear from you again sir harry and save it for true believers the chairman told him drily six weeks then and charon no mistakes eh and without waiting for an answer he put the phone down on their way back into the city mi and observer engaged in what was at first a wary conversation the man in the back of the car mis aide sat in silence apparently little interested er what you were saying about garrison observer opened did you mean it about him being straight i mean oh yes straight as you or ino disrespect you understandand probably a sight straighter than a lot of the others at that little gettogether observer grinned relaxing a little i know what you mean we rub shoulders with some strange ones dont we mi nodded all part of the game i suppose youve little in common with sir harry then a tentative probe the chairman when i started with mi during the war his branch didnt even exist it came later most of the murky stuff came later i mean its all cloak and dagger youll appreciatebut brian lumley with that lot its mainly dagger buti suppose we need em you know what they say it takes one to know one well they deal with some pretty weird jobs with unpleasant people and nasty situations socalled obscurities he glanced at observer out of the corner of his eye but you know that of course something about it yes theyre a closemouthed lot i know that much sort of a law unto themselves ill not mislead youive a good many colleagues whod like to see them shut down mi nodded you dont surprise me theyre a damned sight too heavyhanded for my liking and as for sir harry he sucked his teeth that guys a snake er my personal opinion of course but its common knowledge he numbers several more than shady characters among his friends and informers and he probably protects them that chinaman for instance who did he represent eh umm said observer id wondered about that myself but as ive said theyre pretty closemouthedand so far theyve had good cover from up top he let his eyes flick up brought them down to glance knowingly at his passenger she is happy with much of their work personallysir harrys being a snake isnt just your opinion im afraid he chuckled wryly thats why i want you to look after garrison it really wouldnt do if anything were to happen to him oh mj seemej genuinely taken by surprise you mean me personally psychosphere youor your best man we trust you and that covers anyone you care to recommend in fact i especially appreciated the way you stuck your neck out for garrison yes i liked that mi thought about it of course id need authority orders you shall have them in fact you have them as of now the papers will come later okay ill see to it to be truthful i halfexpected the job and i have the very man for it hes not much known over here worked mainly abroad but hes good stuff flame of stone phillip stonebut of course thats strictly between you and me behind him in the back seat stone merely sat and said nothing he had wondered why hed been called to attend this meeting today and now he knew good said observer then get him on the job just one thing make sure he does it with discretion this garrisons a funny type if he was to cotton on that someone was minding him well hed be almost sure to make a fuss about it which would only make the job that much more difficult oh hell not get wind of this guy i can safely promise you that hes one of the best ill take your word for it said observer easing his foot from the accelerator as they moved into heavier traffic incidentally do you have any idea who might have bombed garrisons plane mi shrugged could be the ira are still after him or the mafia brian lumley mafia mi nodded that vegas job i was talking about and if hes been holidaying on rhodes its their neck of the woods you know close enough to it anyway he shrugged on the other hand it could be anybody he mustve stepped on a few toes to get what hes got observer grunted his acceptance of that then said well lets just make surefor the immediate future anywaythat nobody steps on him fhillip stone suited his name well he was like stone a crag of a man seventythree inches tall and all of it with hard edges and they had needed to be hard as an intelligence agent stone had several things going for him no one who looked so rough and ready could possibly be that intelligent and no one who acted so unconcerned and disinterested could possibly be the datacollecting machine which stone was his third asset was his hardness itself which over the years hed accumulated like a stalactite collects calcium layer upon layer the hard way nothing had ever been easy for stone when youre big and roughlooking theres always someone waiting to knock you down if only to prove hes bigger and rougher stone had been knocked down a good many times in a good many ways until at last hed learned to stay firmly on his feet life that offered neither threat nor thrill was no life for phillip stone at eighteen hed joined psychosphere the parachute regiment just to jump out of airplanes and at twentythree hed been cashiered out for his persistent disobedience to the orders of his senior officers which had culminated in a brawl with one such where hed broken the mans jaw stone had never understood how hed become an officer in the first placehe hadnt wanted to be onebut being broken out of the army hadnt bothered him jumping out of airplanes had bored him in the end and anyway it had entailed all that other junklike doing what youre told to do no he was a lone wolf and the regiment had been just a little too clannish he still had fond memories even now but there had been other places to see other things to do he had inherited a little money from an aunt hed never known and the army had given him a thirst for travel and so his idea had been to work his way round the world except it hadnt turned out that way hed got as far as cyprus before falling in with a bunch of lads in nicosia on a drunken night out believing they were squaddies from one of the local british camps hed gone along with them had even let them talk him into going through some form of silly ritual hed been drunk and couldnt remember a lot about it but they hadnt been squaddiesregular soldiers anywayand the ritual hadnt been silly not in their eyes no it had been their form of enlistment and when stone came out of his drunk he was somewhere in africa and someone had given him a rifle brian lumley under orders again this time from colonel crazy dave clegg also late of her majestys forces phillip stone had found himself a mercenary in the wildest outfit any man could ever wish to desert from but he hadnt deserted instead hed proved himself worth his weight in gold to crazy dave the business they were involved with came to a rapid and fruitful conclusion stone had soon found himself back in blighty and a civilian once more two weeks had been too much there was a girl hed known in minden he decided to look her up and boarded a plane for germany meanwhile crazy dave clegg hadnt forgotten him stones name was soon being whispered in the esoteric vaults of mi connections were made stones reunion with his fraulein didnt work out he fell in with a couple of middleaged but sprightly american tourists exqis whod been through this way during the war in a few days theyd persuaded him to accompany them to frankfurt shortly after that stone had mislaid his passport but a call to the british consulate soon solved that onewith a speed and efficiency he later had cause to remember his new passport unlike the old one made no mention of him being an exarmy officer but since he no longer was an officer hed seen nothing sinister in that mor in the next port of call of his american friends which just happened to be berlin only a few jumps later had seen him ferrying innocuouslooking little letters to and fro between east and west berlin his exqis had ladies psychosphere over there remembered from the war but they hated tearful and fruitless reunions and besides they were married now and the jump after that had been straight into jailon the wrong side of the wall only then had he stopped to add things up things which in all his prior experience had only ever happened in thriller or spy novels by which time he was on his way to moscow apparently hed asked for political asylum there or at least thats what the reds told mi he was interrogated brainwashed became a doubleagent without ever first being a singleagent later having been returned to frankfurt where he was picked up by the cia he was debriefed shipped back to blighty interrogated by intelligence and reemployed in hong kong there he went to school became a fullyfledged agent improved his unarmed combat and surveillance techniques was finally moved on into china as a student of oriental customs architecture and antiquities in the chinese authorities finally cracked his cover he was given the full treatment by the nasties in peking only the blossoming chinese love affair with great britain and the usa saved him he was kicked out with a minimum of publicity and a freshscrubbed mind had his brain repatriated by mi and finally ended up back in germany as a junior counterintelligence adviser to wato well and hed wanted to see the world hadnt he but the brian lumley world hadnt quite finished with him yet nor he with it the job in germany wasnt to his likingtoo quiet he became restlesspossibly as a result of hearing a rumor that certain parties were trying to recruit a gunrunner for afghanistan supplying the khashlun tribesmen with arms to fight the coming russian invasion and so stone had moved on becoming part of the afghan underground the invasion had come on his own initiative stone had founded a wellorganized guerilla group london had got wind of this and whipped him out of there lawrence of arabia had been different they told him we had been at war then since when hed puttered round with the idea of selling himself to the israelis or of removing to south africa where several exsoldier friends had settled or of moving into industrial espionage in america meanwhile mis and had kept him employed however lowkey usually on surveillance or in a minder capacity how he was to be minder to richard garrison which stone had already decided would be far too tame for him but a job is a job and at least you could live on the money this was the last time though and after this it would probably be the good old us of a for him you could still find a little fast action across the big fond these were his thoughts as he left the mi offices in whitehall where hed chosen his cover and been kittedup and made his way across london via the underground for his flat in richmond there hed pick up his car and head for psychosphere haslemere where garrison was in a very private and very exclusive hospital he did not see the small sturdy businesssuited chinaman who followed him out of the tube and into the evening at richmondjohnnie fong was an expert at not being seenand he was not greatly interested in the pushingandshoving argument between two hulking boozy yobs in a shop doorway along his way but after that the yobs were on him like sacks of coal pinning him to a wall in a moment and in the next moment before he could muster either mind or muscle the little chinaman was in front of him unloading the contents of a large hypodermic right through his shirt and into the wall of his stomach stone recognized the chinaman at onceand then he reacted he hurled one of his attackers from him and swung his free fist round in an arc crashing it into the face of the other but by then he already knew that it was all over a car had pulled up the street was melting like soft toffee his attackers one of them with a mangled profusely bleeding face were levering him into the back of a large black station wagon he still moved his arms a bit but they felt like rubber with no bones in them his legs had long since surrendered and his mind was last to go or maybe his vision he would later recall that before passing out he saw the chinamans face close up and his broad slash of a smile that sinister yellow smile receding down a long black tunnel and stones thought going with it you just wait fu manchu ill be seeing brian lumley you again you again again againagainagainagainagain but in fact he never would see him again richard garrison wasnt the only one in hospital carlo vicenti was there too in a gentlemans ward in a large central london general he had been there all afternoon and evening while they fixed him up and was now mildly sedated where he sat propped up deep in painful conversation with three sharplytailored meanlooking and somewhat swarthy visitors yeah yeah we know marcello pontellaris nasal voice was full of sarcasm three cracked ribs a busted collarbone a sprained wrist and a busted pinkie oh yeah and lots of bad bruising wowl his sneer was deliberately exaggerated isnt that terrible girls we carve with razors or burn with cigarettes guys we pave roads with or dump in the river and you somebody breaks a small bone or two and you scream like all hell not just somebody vicenti snapped grimacing at the pain his reaction caused in his bandaged shoulder garrison it was himmustve been himor his twin brother your boys saw nothing mario the dwarf angelli blew rings from his cigar they say you acted crazy but nobody was there idiots vicenti snapped again and again groaned what in hells wrong with you guys you think i threw myself through that wall frankly said ramon navarro de medici ramon the rat as he was known throughout psychosphere the rank and file of londonbased mafiayeah thats what we think least thats what your boys tell us a fit they said he went nuts they said went nuts vicenti snorted i tell you i saw the guy yeah we knowthats what we came to check its why were here the big guy sent us you know vicenti grew silent the big guy the first successful mafia boss in england he was interested in this why see de medici went on your boys have to be right dead right garrison wasnt there couldnt be there he was trapped in a crippled plane somewhere between the greek islands and england a crippled plane the black brothers a bomb vicenti nodded his understanding yeah your bomb de medici answered you had him contracted out the black boys we got it from facello you did it personal and private which aint exactly in the rules but but vicenti shook his head but he was there mo medici was emphatic he was on a plane with bert blacks bomb but this time bert fucked up the plane didnt go down anyway that dont change anything garrison was on the planecouldnt have been anywhere near you vicentis mind was chasing itself in everdecreasing circles i dont understand he said i just dont hour and a half after you say he worked you brian lumley over garrisons plane was coming in on a wing and a prayer at qatwick pio wheels controls no nothing but a neat landing garrison in hospital nerves pilot crazy as a loon says they were saved by god vicenti fell back on his pillows groaning as his shoulder gave him more pain but his injuries now took second place to his confusion his disbelief what the hell he whispered he squeezed his eyes shut shook his head again yeah said marcello pontellari his tone sarcastic as ever what the hell listen carlo said de medici just ignore pontellari and listen the big guy is interested in all this see youre not the only one who hates this garrison the boys in vegas hate him too but see they dont want him dead vicentis eyes popped open whats that yeah de medici continued you remember vegas a year year and a half ago something big went down there bunch of punters cleaned em out good took millions and disappeared and all legitimate they won the fucking money can you imagine that they won the mother vicentis eyes were narrow now he ground his teeth jesus oh yes i can imagine it christ didnt he do the same thing to me this garrison didnt he clean me out he stared at de medici and his lips curled back from his teeth so the big guy and the boys in vegas think mot think de medici cut him off they know he did it to vegas just like he did it to you they know it was him cos they finally tracked him psychosphere down a guy with more tricks up his sleeve than a cardsharp but well you can see why the big guy has to cancel your contract on garrison okay vicenti frowned come again see right now this guy is worth a lot more alive than dead the vegas mob wants to know how he does it yeah and so do we wed like for no one else to do it againnot ever so after they let him walk were going to pull him in then when we get through with him he shrugged hes all yours if you still want him vicenti nodded okay but what about the blacks can you find em get a message to em call em off yeah its done already they get back from rhodes three days from now monday pm into gatwick by that time you should be out of here and on the mend theres a general meeting monday at the big guys usual offices the blacks be there you too all of us hey this is big carlo vicenti pursed his lips rolled his eyes and stared up at the ceiling he frowned yeah big he grunted but it still doesnt explain how i thought i saw him when he wasnt there and yet you know somehow i had a feeling he wasnt really there he paused and gazed into the eyes of his visitors then lowered his eyebrows in reproof hey dont look at me like that were talking about the same guy bust me out of the ace of clubs remember tricks up his sleeve brother you can say that again chapter philup stone hiqhtmared and when he woke up he had difficulty deciding just where the bad dream ended and the reality began he had dreamed of the kgb of the goons in peking of mans inhumanity to man but he had never in his life dreamed of anything quite like charon qubwa the man was a hill of pallid flesh standing he would be inches taller than stone he had at least twice stones girth must weigh almost four hundred and thirty or forty pounds and his arms and hands were like great knotted clubs making stones seem fragile by comparison as for the pallor of his flesh it wasnt sickness stone saw but albinism he was a pinkeyed mottled gray albino negro and that wasnt all he was stones eyes werent quite in focus yet and his mind was certainly way out psyghosphere but he knew a monstrosity when he saw one whoever the big manwoman was he was a monstrosity the light was pretty dim and stones senses were all in conflict with one another either he was upside down or gravity had no meaning herewherever here was but his orientation chiefly the weight of his own body and the way his clothing fell told him that he was seated normally and that down was where his feet were while the crick in his neck said that his head was tilted back which meant that what he was looking at was on the ceiling he closed his eyes for a moment thought about shaking his head to clear it and very slowly carefully opened his eyes again and this time he understood the ceiling was a mirror or at least a large area in the ceilings center was a mirror what seemed to be happening up there was actually happening directly in front of stone but for the moment he was content to witness it secondhand he didnt want to attract anyones attention not just yet first he would like to know where he was he already knew how he came to be here more or less but he would also like to know why he was tied to his chair or maybe he knew that too for if he wasnt tied down then by now somebody even several somebodies would be suffering a few choice agonies from stones extensive list of such all of that however could waitwould have brian lumley to wait for the moment he would just sit here and watch the action and the action was something else the great mottled albino freak lay on what looked like a widerthanaverage masseurs table where three girls worked on the doughy obesity of his body their punching and pummelling was performed to the tune of the monsters sighing grunting and moaning and all fourslaves and master alikewere naked as the day they were born time was when stone would have looked at the girls first but right now he was more interested in the creature on the masseurs table with his white hair forming a huge frizz of a bush upon his head and his incredible pink eyesthemselves anomalies in a typically negroid physiognomyand above all else the sexual organs of both man and woman stones mind reeled not only from the contemplation of this most inhuman of human beings but also from the effects of the drug which had stunned him and facilitated his kidnapping whatever the stuff had been his head now felt as if it had been kicked twice too often there again it might have been kicked he remembered making a mess of the face of one of his attackersperhaps the man had avenged himself while stone was out for the count whichever it was like the very worst hangover hed ever known and stone had known quite a few he fought back the nausea he felt welling up and looked at the girls who were working on on the thing psychosphere another mistake another anomaly only two of them were girls as for the otherstone wasnt sure it had breasts small but definitely female but the rest of the gear was maleagain small like a young lads but male and he liked his work that one he had an erection anyway what there was of it and so did the mountain of meat he was working on stone now saw that this was more than simple massage it was the full treatment fascinated despite his nausea he watched the thing through to its end one of the girls was plying the hermaphrodites great penis with one hand and toying with his opposing parts with the other the second girl and the boygirl were rubbing warm oil into his flabby body the latter was also sucking with feminine lips upon the black giants great swollenslug nipples how long this had been going on stone couldnt say but the end came quickly the huge body began to quiver and heave massive hands flopped over the side of the table fluttering like stunned birds the hermaphrodites sperm erupted into the face of the girl working his shaft who smiled her relief and pleasure obviously it was important in more ways than one that her master should be completely satisfied stone turned his eyes away then as that swollen knob of muscle emptied itself in long bursts but not before the hermaphrodites pink eyes had met his own in the mirror and not before he had seen the slow smileof sexual pleasure yes but also in recognition of stones recovery brian lumley his consciousnesswhich gave the thick graymottled lips the curve of a sharphorned leprous moon the pink eyes were like magnets they held stones gaze drew his head round to look again as a snake draws a bird before striking then youre awake mr stone splendid it was a deep sonorous voice negroid but with its charm and lilt almost cultured out possibly an adopted voice falsified but stone thought not and deep underneath despite its masculinity there were strangely feminine nuances girlish or womanish undertones but the female facet was definitely subservient stone found himself wishing he knew more about hermaphoditism in human beingsin anything for that matter oh it wouldnt do you any good mr stone said the voice believe me i am in no way typical indeed i am not a type at all i am unique the effect of those wordsso casually but fluently composed so easily spokenwas like an electric shock in stones mind he knew his thoughts had been read as accurately as if hed spoken them out loud but the concept was simply too incredible for him to accept as fact more accurately the creature on the masseurs slab smiled again and that is a fact men dont always express their thoughts accurately but they do think them accurately now stone believed he was stunned but he believed precisely the point of the exercise said the creature the proof of the pudding stone thought quite deliberately psychosphere is in the eating mr stone i agree impressive stone found himself hardput to be phlegmatic but why bother to show me it is important that you know and if i had simply told you you would not have believed this way i would hope that you will not try to hide anything from me the talent is tiring you see all of the espabilities are and i do not wish to tire myself unnecessarily on the other hand i dont wish to be duped for which reason i will from time to time occasionally read your mind do we understand each other so far stone thought well i am waiting yes said stone we understand each other and he realized hed learned nothing at all from that last ployexcept that perhaps the freak spoke the whole truth and why should he lie after all he held all the cards stone knew there were espers in mi but he would never have believed that anyone could reach such heights of perfection in the art actually hed always considered it a waste of time and money but now espionage indeed good the other nodded he held out his arms and his paramoursslaveseased him upright until he could swing his legs from the slab he stood and a robe of towelling was draped across his shoulders he fastened it about his vast waist waved the two girls and the boygirl away stone heard a door open and close pneumatically that must be disconcerting said the creature approaching looming larger in the ceiling brian lumley mirror you can move your head mr stone why not look at me directly i am not of the qorgons you know stone raised his head upright and it hurt lights flashed before his eyes and inside his skull causing him to wince jesus he said it will pass said the other stone winced again screwed up his eyes blinked them rapidly he was glad the lighting was subdued okay mr whoever you are whats it all about qubwa said the other charon qubwa i doubt that you ever heard of me no need to doubt it said stone trying now to be flippant i never heard of you but im all ears if you want to tell by now he had ascertained that he was securely strapped in his chair his arms as well as his legs apart from his head he couldnt move by so much as an inch there was absolutely nothing he could do no physical action he might take and so it seemed best simply to sit here and listen at least that way he might learn somethingbefore the other decided he had learned enough oh but i want you to learn everything mr stone said qubwa proving his point yet again and paying no heed to stones wit everythingfor reasons which i shall now explain first when you know all about me youll stop wondering about me this will leave your mind free to think more clearly about what i require of you second you are intelligentindeed a member of an intelligence organizationand wily devious minds have always fascinated me psychosphere third your natural curiosity pleases me as that of a child pleases his instructor and finally finally nothing you tell me will do me any good because im never going to talk about it correct qubwa agreed smiling again in fact when im finished with you not only will you not talk about it you might not even think about it stone nodded flexed his muscles one last time against his bonds shrugged and gave it up im very angry qubwa but im sure you already know that you probably also know that if i could get out of this chair id wreck you so dont suppose it does much harm to tell youl as for the rest of it i suppose you could cail me a captive audience that is also correct qubwa laughed but to stone his laughter sounded like the rattle of a snake qubwa was rubbing it in gloating on stones helplessness and knowing it brought out the agents mean streak listen your uniqueness he growled did you ever stop to think that maybe youre not so unique that maybe youre just another freak qubwa moved behind him surprisingly quickly for a being of his size and bulk stones ears tingled but nothing happened then the chair spun silently round on rubber wheels qubwa steered it towards metal doors that hissed open oh but i know im a freak he said thats what makes me unique i was born before my time like jesus da vinci einstein and i am no less than them in my way indeed i am more than them i am the destiny of the brian lumley human race mr stone and i shall remold that race in my own image homo sapiens bah hermaphro sapiens they passed into qubwas command center and stone found himself wheeled to where he could stare up at the massivelycarved figure of the albino where its feet straddled the globe of the world and at last the agent began to know something of awe and of fear the man meant it his aim was conquest empirewith himself as emperor of earth he was as mad as a hatter right on the one hand wrong on the other qubwa snapped i dream of empire yes but am not mad indeed i am utterly sane most madmen think theyre sane stone growled i do not intend to argue with you merely to inform you then you shall work for meat least for a little while longer if you are sensibleand finally welt i shall leave the end of it up to you you are as have said intelligent i could find a place for you in my organization but do please remember mr stone that yours is hazardous work at best and no one will worry too much if you simply go missing that is why you are paid so well after all the x factor dangermoney stone remained silent very well mow listen to what i have to say i shall begin at the very beginning my greatgrandfather was the son of a southafrican chief of the blood of shaka and cetewayo unlike those two he mined yellow metal and blue stones for his white masters and the psychosphere earth was also rich in pitchblende uranium that was one generation as a child and a young man my grandfather worked the same mines until the precious metals and stones were gone by which time there was a new interest in the previously useless metal finally my father and mother worked for whites too and my father ended his days cleaning the vats in a refinery he had been bald since he was eighteen and his teeth had fallen out before he was twentyfive but do not think i hold all this against you white men for i do not no in a way i owe you a debt perhaps i was meant to be twins i dont know but thats not how it worked out you see i was really the product of three parents the one in the middle was radiation i was born neither black nor white but graynot even a true albino you see unique i had the parts of both male and female equally well developed i do not have a womb no but all the rest of the equipment is theresensory certainly my breasts are real not merely cosmetic adornments and my passions are of both man and woman i have pink eyes and they are weak but in the darkness of a postholocaust world they would be ideally suited my size is godlike towering and my body has the mass of solidity my frame freakish according to you is a leaders frame that of a great emperor and my powers what do you know of esp mr stone mo do not answer first let me tell you what i can do i am telepathic as you have discovered i read brian lumley minds but that is only one of my powers i cannot yet levitate not yet but i do have great potential here let me show you he went to an upright weighingmachine and stood upon its platform the needle spun dizzily and twitched to a halt at just over four hundred and thirty pounds now watch ordered gubwa he closed his eyes in a matter of moments a fine beading of sweat stood out upon his brow the needle on the dial crept down down three hundred pounds two hundred and ten one hundred and seventy qubwa opened his eyes sighedand the needle shot up again he stepped off the platform and that is a measure of power i must use constantly mr stone else movement itself would be cumbersome hypnotism is another art of mine in which i excel but you will discover that for yourself soon enough i am also what you might call a seer i prognosticate not unfortunately very accuratelybut i can see something of the future the immediate future quite clearlythe distant future dimly suffice it to say that when i put my money on a horse it usually wins in all matters of gambling i am rather unbeatable stone frowned in all matters of gambling his mouth fell open garrison so that was how he did it qubwa had chosen that very moment to read his mind his pink eyes became slits in his puffy leprous face his version of a knowing smile indeed his voice was very low very psychosphere sinister richard garrisonand you have been given the task of protecting him stones mind went back to garrisons fileall he had read and memorized of the manbut in the next moment he gasped gritted his teeth and bit his lip until it hurt deliberately dragging his mind away from that subject gubwa laughed a deep almost hearty laugh oh do not concern yourselfl i know more of garrison than ever you could tell me far more though not yet enough sincerely mr stone there is nothing i want of you in the way of information nothing i want out of you at all instead let me tell you something about him he quickly outlined the relevant facts even went so far as to mention several things stone had not previously known until the agent once more relaxed in his chair gubwa was right there was nothing stone had that he didnt already know so what do you want of me qubwa pursed his lips then shrugged again it can do no harm to tell you i havea friend in a rival branch of your socalled secret services he would dearly love to see garrison dead also to discredit mi your branch sir harry stone scowled close enough gubwa nodded actually sir harrys boss working through him he smiled again but you see you are intelligent and being so intelligent perhaps i need explain no further im getting the picture stone answered but id still be happier hearing it from you i mean youre the telepath not me brian lumley qubwa raised his eyebrows you disappoint me but as you will i shall explain by using you to achieve my aims i will kill garrisoneventuallyand at the same time perform a service useful to sir harry mi will carry the burden of the blame now this is not allimportant to me this service i propose to perform no for eventually i will be obliged to deal with sir harry too that is to say kill him but being in league with him shall we say does give me a little security in the event that my plans are not immediately successful it is simply a matter of being careful lets get this straight said stone you see yourself as the future emperor of earth right qubwa nodded yes i see and youll bring this about through er holocaust not er holocaust mr stone a holocaust the neutron bomb chiefly though there will be other nuclear devices involved yes stone nodded very slowly and after that you intend that the human racewhats left of itshould become a gang of freaks fermaphro sapiens like yourself i will see to it that several genetic engineers clone technicians etc survive yes they will be the fathers of the new earthfiguratively speaking of course i in fact shall be the true father my own sperm shall be the seed of future generations stone sighed nodded slumped down in his chair as best he could after a moment he looked up you really are quite mad you know that i psychosphere mean surely this is something straight out of james bond just lets suppose for a moment that you can do all you say youre going to do mentally manipulate the world to disaster kill us all off and start again with a selected fewyes and even breed a race of superfreaks to ah qubwa stopped him no i said nothing about that i would never allow the development of another whose powers were as great or greater than my own that would be strictly controlled i see what do you see said qubwa looking into the agents mind his great gray face grew angry then he approached towered over stones chair looked down on him youre wrong stone i fear no man except garrison i said i fear no man mr stone no man qubwa spelled it out you are homo sapiens the world i envisage will be a world of hermaphro sapiens but if i am right in what i suspect of garrison hes not a man a manof sorts homo superior i suspect and you want to know what it is hes got that makes him homo superior right correct and when i have the answerthen he dies so what it boils down to man or superman you do fear him you see qubwa hissed towering closer still so very intelligent wasnt i right about you mr stone he clubbed one mighty fist and brian lumley raised it and for a moment stone believed he would strike him then he quickly turned away and pointed throwing out the fingers of his fist straight and stiif in the direction of the basrelief figure astride the earthimage nothing must be allowed to interfere with that mr stonenothing and garrison could is that it qubwa turned and stared at him perhaps he nodded yes perhaps he could but that in itself is not my dilemma no you were right the first time i want to know what makes him tick you see i know where my powers come from they are born of the atom as were the body and mind that house them therefore i will admit to being as you say a freak a mutation but garrison is not how then is he what he is a telepath stone seemed surprised surely lots of people have claimed to be claimed gubwa exploded he threw back his great head and laughed telepath how little you know you have no idea mr stone what garrison is what he can do telepathy indeed oh much more than that so much more he is he threw his arms wide forming a great cross incredible let me tell you about garrison let me fill in a few more of the gaps in your knowledge where to start oh yes i have always been aware you see that certain minds are different my own for instance and those of several others ive come across over the years there are a great many menwomen toowhose esp centers are developed away and beyond the norm or average indeed psychosphere one might grade them as the numismatist grades his coins first there is ungraded or poor common man in all his billions who knows nothing whatsoever of esp let alone controls the power and fair who occasionally finds himself whistling some obscure tune precisely at the same time another begins to whistle it for he has received an impression of it from that others mind then there is fine who knows instinctively when his father diesthough they are miles apartor who can feel that something is about to happen of him there are many thousands do you see the structure stone nodded i follow you go on very well above fine we would place very finethe man who can fairly accurately read the minds of his wife or children and who usually has a leaning towards the socalled occult that is to say this one knows he is different alas he is only a little different but rising through the grades we now find extremely finethe gambler whose chances are far better than average perhaps the policeman or detective whose hunches always seem to work out these are few and far between and with them the power goes far beyond mere bloodties or friendships rarer still however are the topmost grades who can read most minds with little difficulty and whose control of esp is far more extensive than mere telepathy recently in tibet discovered an entire cache of this latter gradea rare find indeed i became jealous caused the communist chinese brian lumley psychosphere authorities there to suspect them of being fifth columnistswhich they wereand was directly responsible for their extermination all of this without once leaving this retreat of mine how utterly charming of you said stone coins qubwa continued ignoring his sarcasm and their grading i wandered there for a moment finally i must grade myself well as i have said i am unique i suppose you might say that i have been overprinteda rare coin made rarer still by having been struck twice on one disc or perhaps i am an exceedingly high denomination mistakenly minted in a base metal just sobut this is a far different grading to the one i used to apply to myself before the advent of garrison oh yes for there was once a time when i considered myself fdcthat is to say fleur de coin but i graded myself too highly it was a gigantic vanity only garrison is truly fdc and only he is truly unique there is no other like him telepathy that is the most meager of his talents mo untrue it is merely one of them consider he was blinded mow he sees consider his woman was also blind she sees ah but that is not all she was dead at this stone snorted his derision the body of a certain vicki maler was placed in cryogenic suspension at mot a certain vicki maler mr stonethe vicki maler garrison revived her i know have been inside her mind she was frozen against the chancethe milliontoone chancethat science might one day discover a means of reviving her garrison already has that science and consider this she was riddled with the terrible cancer which killed her mow she is perfect that too is garrisons work finally there are his most recentshall we continue to sayworks occurring within the space of the last twentyfour hours they are perfect examples of his power only yesterday for you have been unconscious overnight mr stonehis plane was bombed that was over the aegean sea he flew that crippled plane to england to gatwick and landed it there safely without engines without any means of aerodynamic control without wheels and the plane landed like a feather the most perfect of perfect crashlandings i know about that said stone a miraculous escape a rubbish gubwa snapped you know nothing a miracle is in the eyes of the beholder it is usually the occurrence of a highly unlikely event the impossible on the other hand cannot occur because it is impossible what will the authorities make of it i wonder when they discover that garrisons plane came in ninety minutes too soon from the moment the bomb exploded and crippled it it must have been travelling at a speed far in excess of its maximum possible speed stones mind was whirling again mow that is what i call levitation gubwa continued the pilot is still convinced it was an act of god oh the effort tired garrison cer brian lumley tainly for which reason he is now restingbut is that difficult to understand think of it think of what he did moreover he discovered the author of the crime and struck back except that here he was much more lenient than i would have been now youve really lost me said stone ah of course for you do not yet know who tried to kill him well shall tell you it was the mafiaor rather a small member of that crude and unwieldy organization his name is vicenti carlo vicenti weve been interested in him and his pals for some time are you sure it was him how did you get onto him so quickly i am sure yes qubwa answered the bomb could only have been planted in rhodes an ugly pair called the black brothers are there have been in bomber bert blacks mind it was them he himself planted the device wait said stone his gravelly voice suddenly weary too fast if they are still in rhodes how could you have been in bombers mind how do you know they are there anyway qubwa turned stones chair to face his huge desk you see my computer there i know the blacks are in rhodes because my computer told me it talks to the computer at qatwick also to those at new scotland yard and to many others even to your own machine at mi hq his smile was broader now than stone had ever seen it ah and at last you begin to see mr stone and perhaps i am not so crazy after all eh psychosphere but how did garrison know it was vicenti and how did he strike back at him qubwa sighed losing patience when the bomb went off he became aware that he was a target he looked for people with a grudge vicenti was one such a quick look inside his mind he shrugged you mean he tackled vicenti after his plane landed before he went into hospital while his plane was in the air mr stone distance is nothing to the true telepath not if he knows his target he visited vicentis mind as i visited bert blacks at least i suppose that is how it was and he then delivered vicenti a psychic blow several of them but not fatal vicenti too is hospitalized he should consider himself lucky if i were garrison i would have killed him stone now seemed weary to death but you cant be sure that garrison did it to vicenti he might simply have been involved in an accident but i have been in carlo vicentis mind too he knows that it was garrison he doesnt know how but he knows it was him its all over my head stone seemed genuinely lost maybe im not as smart as you think oh but you are gubwa laughed you have a very agile mind you have soaked up every word ive uttered even as a sponge soaks up water your weariness is an act you must not take me for a fool mr stone for i am not nor brian lumley have you led me on as you assume i have told you nothing i did not wish you to know stone wasnt a good loser shit he said through clenched teeth he sat up a little straighter okay ill stop pretending and lets say i believe all you say or at least lets say im open to suggestion there are still some things id like to know for one how did you get onto garrison in the first place that is how did you twig him for an espmaster two years ago qubwa answered a good many strange things occurred all centered about him until then i had not been interested in garrison did not know he existed the world is full of minds i visit only those i wish to visit garrison was of no interest to me since then however i have discovered all that i now know of him which isnt yet enough but it will be soon it was then two years ago that he regained his sight then that he returned vicki maler to life cleansed her of her disease gave her back her sight in other words that was when garrison first became aware of his power or gained full control over it as to how i know it again his shrug i am a telepath and every telepath in the world must have felt something of it gubwas voice had fallen to a whisper was filled with awe if i believed in god mr stone which i do not then i would have known that god was come down amongst men do you know what is meant by the biosphere stone nodded its what youll pollute with neutron bombs psychosphere again qubwa chose to ignore the jibe then picture a great meteorite rushing through earths atmosphere and causing the most violent storm you could ever imagine picture the air and the ocean whipped to a frenzy the elements enraged do you have it good mow take it one step further picture a psychic biospherea psychosphere if you wishin which esp talent and potential takes the place of life in the biosphere and picture that psychosphere torn as by some mental meteor that was garrisons coming his awakening mr stone and that explains the paradox why on the one hand i want him dead while on the other he must not die stone looked blank numismatics my friend said gubwa me is fleur de coin the only one in the batch where was he minted by whom if you were a collector and such a coin came into your hands wouldnt you ask yourself these questions of course you would and if you checked the metal discovered that it had been melted down from old stock and restamped a counterfeit said stone just so gubwa excitedly agreed but better than any original the work of a genius and what question would you next ask yourself who made it correct gubwa clasped the agents shoulders in iron hands and surelyhow was it made he looked down looked deep into stones unflinching gaze what happened to him two years brian lumley ago that gave him powers comparable to those of a god stone narrowed his eyes believed for a moment that he had found qubwa out why dont you ask him he said why dont you just get inside his mind and he saw his error qubwas eyes had shot open were now wide and pink and bulging what he hissed have you learned nothing believed nothing man i would not even approach garrisons mind i would sooner swim in a pool of piranhasyes with the veins of my wrists open and bleeding chapter f course i sought to discover the source of this vast disturbance in the psychosphere i had to the thing was wild it lured me and to find itwhy all i had to do was close my eyes and send my mind blindly out out and the very aura of garrison did the rest i found myself hurled about like a twig in a whirlpool a leap in the very maelstrom enter his mind i have been on the threshold it seethes boils crashes with energies i would be a fly caught up in a highspeed fan and if i survived if mind youhe would know me would follow my limping trail home and knowing me he would destroy me he didnt destroy vicenti stone pointed out but he hurt him gubwa was quick to return and how then would he deal with me who brian lumley stands at the back of it all charon gubwa the grand engineer of all his trials you how flow but didnt i set those minds in action which now work against him it was a testing dont you see only it got out of control i dared not go against garrison not personallydared not try him outand so i arranged for others to do it for me who else do you think put garrison in the minds of all those ohsointerested parties if not me i can influence the minds of others mr stone dont forget it indeed i am an adept havent i told you i destroyed those monks in tibet ah but they werent of garrisons mettle still the wheels i have set in motion must eventually crush him one way or the other or i will crush him by discovering his secret but until i know it he must not be crushed storte slowly nodded his head and thats where i come in right correct garrison has a weakness a chink in his armor the woman vicki maler i believe that she knows his secret or if she does not actually know it then at least the clues to it are buried in her mind i shall dig them out why havent you already done so if all you say of your telepathy is true you no o no gubwa shouted in stones mind electrifying him afresh you still dont understand do you garrison is close to the woman she is like his child resurrected herwhy one might go so far as to say he made her he is never very far from her mind and if ever he found me there psychosphere and so you cant really tackle her said stone oh but i have tried i have tried it had seemed to me that recently within the last six months garrisons strength was waning when chance permitted i actually found and entered vicki malers mind there were several such occasions and i was always lucky or perhaps it was not simple luck perhaps my esp told me the best times but in any case the contact was always briefnever long enough to learn much no time to be discovered the last time was only a matter of days ago while she and garrison were still in rhodessince when he has performed these miracles weve spoken of proving that hes as powerful as ever or at least powerful enough to constitute a real threat stone frowned so how will you do it if you cant get at her how will i cant get at her as you have it while shes out there beyond these walls but in here there are ways here i am the master and i am not without protection stone saw it coming im to bring her here gubwa smiled nodded indeed you are so you really are crazy after all if what youve told me of garrison is only halftruewhy hell mince me that is a distinct possibility gubwa blandly agreed and one to be avoided he smiled again and through me hell find you and mo the other snapped his smile disappearing in an instant he will not find me if you are brian lumley discovered your mind will simply selfdestruct it will burn itself out before telling anything about me oh yes mr secret agent stoneyou would die before talking or before having the facts extracted and in any case i wont do it qubwas smile was back growing wider by the minute he began to nod his great white head oh yes you will he took stones chair and wheeled it across the floor doors hissed open at their approach im now going to show you my mind laboratory mr stone being as you are a secret agent youll be familiar with the term brainwashing yes im sure you are well my mindlab is a veritable laundry and of course ive already mentioned my expertise in the field of mesmerism yes along the corridor the great albino paused for a moment dear oh dear mr stone why im really quite surprised at you those are not very kind thoughts at all now are they while charon qubwa worked on stone in the mindlab vicki maler sat by garrisons bedside in a small whitewashed hospital room in haslemere surrey it was an austere place by any standards but garrisons private doctora much respected man whose patients were extremely rich and or very important persons allliked austerity to him sparseness was synonymous with cleanliness and cleanliness was the basic necessity of all good medicine at the moment vicki was alone with garrison indeed at present he was the psychosphere only resident patient but dr jamieson was about somewhere the rooms window look out under the branches of willows across a closecropped fenced garden beyond the fence a stream or beck sparkled in early morning sunlight in fact the place was not a hospital at all in the accepted sense of the word but jamiesons home it was very expensive but not at all an easy place to find and vicki was satisfied that garrison was safe here safe from what she could not say from his own waking fears maybe from killerssuch as the wouldbe killers who had sabotaged the planethat remained to be seen until now their personal security had not been a problem to concern her safety usually went hand in hand with garrison to be with him was to be safe or had used to be she looked at him sedated he slept and he needed it his face was drawn his forehead lined his hands twitched occasionally however faintly on top of the bedclothes vicki had arrived an hour earlier she had been greeted by the doctor and his nurseassistant probably his wife richard would not be up and about until monday morning since today was friday that would give him three more full days and nights of rest and dr jamieson would ensure that they were three full days the police had been on the telephone twice requesting a statement from garrison in respect of the bombed plane but the doctor had put brian lumley them off his patient could not be disturbed he had told them garrison was physically and mentally rundown teetering upon a nervous brink and the only sure way he could be revitalized was by resting there had also been the matter of the contact lenses which had arrived while garrison and vicki were in rhodes she did not know what richard had done to dr jamieson but the business of her own and garrisons eyes didnt seem to be at all problematic he had already fitted garrisons lenses and upon vsckis arrival he had worn a pair of tinted spectacles to fit hers after a few minutes she hadnt even known she was wearing them then she had been taken to richards room and left there since when she had simply sat here at his bedside very carefully she now took one of his hands in hers his flesh was cool seemed somehow fragile almost brittle a plastic hand she squeezed it just to reassure herself but of what to confirm that garrison was real that she was real vicki found herself trembling was she real the fact that she no longer loved garrison suddenly bloated in her mind like some strange orchid one minute it was absent the next it had opened hybrid and scentless it was not beautiful but strangely it was not ugly it was merely there a fact not even a hard one to assimilate for how can one love a constant threat the axe that hangs over ones head the fraying threads of rope by which one hangs from the psychosphere cliff the clock relentlessly ticking away ones final hour you cannot love that which you dont know she had once known garrison briefly and through her long illness his remembered beauty had remained with her buoyed her up the joy of having had him sustained her to the end and she had thought that she could have loved him and she had lovedadored himin the new beginning then the rope had started to fray the axe had seemed so heavy hanging over her the ticking of the clock had grown incredibly loud a roar of sound in her ears if garrison died she diedand this time she would stay dead vicki had been there once it was a fearful place she couldnt remember the limbo of it and didnt want to but she had hated it she hated the thought of it the threat of it garrison was that threat him she did not hate but she was even more certain that she did not love him and how long before she did hate him and how shortly after that must he know it being garrison perhaps he had already seen it coming she stayed with garrison for a further halfhour suzy garrisons black doberman pinscher bitch whom vicki had left waiting patiently in the car sat still until she had the door halfopen then squeezed out the dogs tail wagged and she iolled her tongue at her mistress but no amount of persuasion cajoling or threatening could get her back inside the car again angry vicki followed suzy back to the door of brian lumley the doctors house dr jamieson stood upon the step smiling a little awkwardly waiting for her to leave he was a stocky moonfaced man in a very old tweed suit its all right my dear she can stay he reassured vicki richard said shed probably be along oh said vicki yes she doesnt like to be too far away from him suzy wagged her tail came and licked vickis hand she was aware now that she could stay but her head kept turning in towards the house she wanted to be with garrison as vicki finally drove away both jamieson and suzy came down to the gate at the bottom of the drive to see her off but as soon as the car cornered out of the leafy lane suzy left the doctors side and ran back to the house in she went and straight to garrisons room where she waited until jamieson opened the door for her then she entered and jumped up on the chair beside her masters bed she sat there straightbacked her head slightly forward ears erect eyes fixed firmly upon him where he lay she watched him intently listened with twitches of her ears to his steady breathing then she settled down a little gave one small whine lay back her ears and made herself a little more comfortable jamieson left the door open for her she would come to him when she was hungry garrison had reached a junction in the driedout bed of the stream he followed here where it split psychosphere the walls which miles back had been mere banks were now cliffs of red stone rising sharp and sheer for hundreds of feet the bed of the stream had seemed the easiest trail to follow but now garrison snoofc his head in disgust it seemed unthinkable that the lie of the land could have changed so swiftly there had been green banks a little water gurgling below a gently winding watery way to follow then the grass had become scrub as the banks grew boulderstrewn and steep and finally the water had petered out then garrison might have left the stream and headed for higher ground but he had been tired or lazy or both had failed to make the effort but simply allowed himself to drift on and the banks had grown even steeper and craggier above a narrowing river gorge until now at last the way divided a cleft in the shade of the towering cliffs and now which way to go right or left left would be the wizards way of course the lefthand path that would seem garrisons natural choice but the way seemed narrower to the left he would hate to find the trail narrowed suddenly to an impassible crack in solid rock and then have to come back all this way the righthand path seemed fairly wide its dusky veil of gloom was parted here and there with shafts of light from above there should be no baleful magics there to blight his course suzy crouched closer to his back and whined ominously garrison frownededged the machine forward right then left and paused brian lumley cursed and set psychomech down upon the cracked bed of the stream he climbed down from the broad now rusttainted back of the machine suzy jumping down beside him where its base stood upon hard earth the machines metal was actually scabbed with rust some of it already flaking and its hard plastic casing was showing cracks within fraying cables were visible behind blistered tubes and blackened piping garrison grunted better to leave the thing here and go forward on foot except that that would be like shooting an old horse just because hed lost a shoe garrison grunted again and shook his head no it was worse than that and he knew it a horse with a broken leg or even a broken back but in any case he could not simply leave the machine behind no for it had been there with him in his vision of the future that agonizing vision of the parched desert glimpsed in the shewstone of the circle of wizards and so the machine must go on with him but along which path if only he might glimpse the future again see his way clear ahead richard oh richard came the merest whisper of a soft female voice fast on the heels of his fleeting thought what garrison fell into a crouch gazed all about first at the lefthand path then the right where who but suzy her coat bristling knew no such indecision no the bitch stared straight into that well of shadows which was the lefthand path and her growl was all the answer garrison neededfor now psychosphere so thats the way is it girl he said his eyes narrowing and you heard it too did you suzy whined in answer pressed closer to his knee richard please came that womans sigh again please help me oh please please let me go help her let her go what did it mean garrisons flesh crept wizardry witchcraft a very black magic certainly and yet he knew or had known that voice in some other place some other time he grasped at that last thought some other time could it be he wondered a voice from his future auguring some event yet to come he had after all expressed his desire to glance once more beyond the veil of the present and into future time and was this his answer he strained forward his limbs shaking his eyes already stinging from fathoming or attempting to fathom the vault of shadows which lay behind the entrance to the lefthand path did something move there the figure of a girl seen fleetingly a wraith amongst the shadows a girl hiding fleeing from shaded place to shaded place fleeing from whom from garrison possibly for she had begged to be let go why then had she called on him for help and if not fleeing from him fleeing fromwhat something else moved in there garrisons flesh crept again violently rippling on his limbs and body like the ripples on a pool cold sweat started from his forehead something moved hanging from above drifting swaying along the zigzag flitting brian lumley route taken by the girl several somethings trailing somethingslike tentacles the other that diseased evil insidious as cancer gray as leprosy warped as insanity that vast octopus of evil from garrisons dream within a dream his enemy of enemies he waited no longer but clambered back onto the machine suzy made no effect to mount behind him but raced beneath as he rode psychomech into the gap of the lefthand path in there was a deeper gloom than had been expected a chill gloom and clammy as fog but garrison knew it for a psychic thing the depression was in his mind its external oppression springing from the heaviness of spirit within but now too he found that he must go cautiously for here where overhead the cliffs actually met in placesor rather where the upper strata remained but had been undercut by ancient watersgreat stalactites depended to bar his way with their looming mass forming columns where upthrusting spires had long ages since cojoined and between and around these limestone relics he must drive the machine never knowing what lurked beyond or when it would strike but ever aware that terror was here breathing in the centuried stone then far down the cleft where the way grew narrower stillanother movementa fleeting inkblot amongst the shadows pressed low to the ground suzy cried garrison wait girl and her bark coming back to him echoing with his own voice and dying into chill silence but no he psychosphere must not call her back she scouted the way for him and that was good tie urged a little more speed from the machine and as his eyes grew more accustomed to the everdeepening darkness bore along the old watercourse whose walls continued to close in on him and thus suddenly from a claustrophobic realm into a wide expansive elfland or perhaps a place of ogres so it seemed to garrison as bursting from the now completely archedover tunnel he entered through a portal into a huge irregular cavern of strange beauty and even stranger horror and here he brought his machine to a halt perhaps it was the sight of suzy cowering that caused him to apply mental brakes perhaps the sure knowledge that this was the subterranean lair of evil itself oh of shimmering beauty the cavern had its share but so does the web of a spider the place had a domed stone daggerfestooned ceiling irregular perimeter columns of stalagmitic rock a fairly even floor though dotted here and there with weird mushrooms of dripstone and the ghostly luminescence of the longentombed a firefly glitter that lent illumination and wonder to an otherwise lightless hole garrison skirted a column of massive girth which obstructed his way and his view and came to where suzy crouched panted and whined she immediately scrabbled up behind him pressing to his back and shuddering as from a drenching in icy water brian lumley and now garrison saw the reason for suzys dread and understood his own for without a doubt the being which sat upon or floated over its stalagmitic throne at the far side of the cavern was that same other of his inmost dream the manytentacled blasphemy whose nature was neither male nor female neither black nor white neither truly sane and human nor insane and inhuman but other than these things redeyed that horror and glaring intently sear chinglubut not in garrisons direction no for at the foot of that beings throne here lay the phantom girl whose sobbing was audible only as a distant sighing whose shape and form were hidden in an ethereal glow or nebulosity from beyond the grave and though garrison could swear he knew or had known this creature now he saw that she was indeed a wraith a ghost and knowing this he knew the other for a necromancer a wizard who raises up and questions the dead but to what end and how and why should it concern garrison in what way might the dead instruct the living and how might garrison possibly be endangered by such instruction with his flesh freshly acrawl still he urged the machine forward across the open floor of the cavern and emerging from the shadows of encircling columns was checked he found himself shut out beyond a certain point roughly halfway the machine would not go had seemed to come up against some invisible wall or impenetrable barrier garrison had met with such before and knew their breaking was impossible or at best most difficult weary and debilitated as he psychosphere uas through his fear he could not summon the strength even to attempt such a breaking how then might he help the ghostgirl or in any way interfere with the wizards necromancies it seemed that he could not moreover slowly it was dawning on him that what he saw was not real or at best some symbolic vision from an as yet inchoate future else why had the other failed to detect him the answer seemed simple he had asked to see the future the other in that future had not asked to see the past garrison could observe but could not interfere his frustration knew no bounds he must help the poor shrinking luminescence the ghostgirl of whom no single detail could be gleaned beneath her ethereal glimmer but whose whispered pleas had raised ghosts of their own the ghosts of garrisons memory but how might he help too weary now even to think clearly he could only look on as the tableau enacted itself beyond his and the machines and suzys rangebut in another moment he held his breath at something else he saw for within the impenetrable area were not two figures but three the third emerging with some stealth from behind a row of thin stalactites that arrased the upward curving far wall like a curtainand garrison knew the intruder it was the secret one also from his dream within a dream and clad in his robe of secrecy an acolyte of the other perhaps but that did not explain the way he glided silent and stealthy now darting to place himself between ghostgirl and monster and brian lumley drag her up and out of the clutches of that dread being across the floor of the cavern they fled the secret one bearing up her luminescent form where she lay halffainting in his arms and after them the now enraged other clearly bent upon their destruction his many tentacles outstretched with all their hooked suckermouths gaping and constricting in a frenzy of loathsome anticipation for a moment it seemed that all would be well that the pair might possibly escapebut then they came up against the inside of that very wall which kept garrison outand behind them the monster leprousgray and pulsating with rage no garrison cried out his frustration his anguish no this must not be and whatever part of him it was that issued forth from him at that moment to sear the wallwhatever esp power he inadvertently unleashed which attempted to transcend time itself and strike for the futureit seemed that it drained him utterly for the moment at least the machine settled to the floor and teetered there an instant then lay inert and garrison fell in a halffaint to sprawl across its broad back yet still he clung to consciousness long enough to see the secret one straining forward through the weakened wall and the ghostgirl bundled in his arms and long enough to watch them make away safe now from pursuit then the darkness swept in upon him and only with the greatest effort of will was he able to keep his eyes open and witness the final wonder that psychosphere of the other in all his monstrousness writhing and raving and fading away back into that future whence garrison had drawn this strange and inexplicable vision it was not unconsciousness that claimed garrison then but a psychic numbness a spiritual exhaustion or weary lassitude from which with her pawing and whining suzy eventually contrived to rouse him she knew wise creature that this was no place to sleep that they must be up and about away on their quest and surprisingly for all the aching weariness of his body head and limbs garrison discovered that he could now sit up moreover that he could lift psychomech up from the floor and however sluggishly guide the machine from the great cave where the other had writhed on or over his stalagmite throne there now opened a gloomshrouded tunnel and far along its curving length a glimmer could be seen as of daylight slowly yard by aching yard man dog and machine made for that glimmer that glow of life which grew and expanded with each passing moment of the three suzy seemed least affected merely eager to be out of the place garrison had gone beyond tired could only sway and nod and groan where he sat and the machine below psychomechs belly a wornthrough fraying cable dangled and in the machines wake lay frequent patches of red fallen rust chapter at am on the following monday carlo vicenti released himself from care his doctor argued with him likewise the nurses on his ward but vicentis boys helped him dress and gave him what assistance they could to limp out of the place through the worst of it one thought made it all worthwhile that when the big guy was finished with garrison then it would be his turn vicenti knew exactly what mr garrisons fate was to be concrete boots and a deep very damp grave and garrison going down slow with a gag in his mouth terror in his eyes and gaping bubbling nostrils as for the subject of vicentis plan as coincidence would have it garrison left dr jamiesons house in haslemere at about the same time vicki maler took his great silver mercedes to pick him up but from the moment she parked the psychosphere car and got out of the driving seat she knew something was wrong there was a sign she could hardly fail to recognize one she had come to know all too well suzy was sitting outside the open front door of the house her expression one of complete dogdespondency the great black bitch had not been beaten or even chastised vicki knew that it was simply that she had sensed a change in her master this was how she was affected whenever one of garrisons gestalt facets took ascendence on this occasion that facet was thomas schroeder and vicki knew him as soon as he appeared with jamieson in the open doorway oh it was richard garrisons body and shapethough even these seemed strangely altered so that at best his suit was illfittingbut the alien gestures and posture and voice particularly the voice quite gave him away while the vocal cords were garrisons the accent and inflection could only be schroeders vicki my dear he greeted her and punctual as ever thank you for coming for me he took her hand like an old friend which of course he was or had been but there was a chill in his flesh and a feel to it that vicki couldnt quite stomach his kiss for all that it was the merest peck was almost unbearable she knew exactly how suzy felt and was glad when finally garrisonschroeder released her and turned to dr jamieson just let me know what i owe you he told him smiling you shall have my check by return brian lumley of course mr er garrison the doctor briefly took his hand and shook it then turned to vicki piow do take care of him young lady wont you hes still not as strong as he should be and and you fuss too much my friend garrison schroeder was smiling still but his tone had grown harder the german accent coming through a shade stronger i shall be just fine i needed a little rest thats all some peace and quietwhich you and your home provided most admirably and for which you will be paid of course of course jamieson was quick to placate him its just a doctors natural concern for his patient thats all quite garrisonschroeder nodded his head well thank you again but now we must be on our way time is mistakenly thought of as a commoditybut none of us ever really has enough of it and it is something we cant buy more of he led vicki to the car helped her into the front passenger seat and opened a back door for suzy the black doberman whined as she jumped into the back to sit there staring at him curiously but garrisonschroeder merely smiled as he started the car and nodded a last farewell to the doctor jamieson was still standing there as the car turned out of his drive and onto the country road beyond the gardens vicki said garrisonschroeder when they had found a firstclass road and were speeding for home you know of course who i am psychosphere oh yes thomas she answered sighing i know he nodded never taking his eyes from the road very well then know this also i am not here through any ordinary resurgence of psyche in future i will be here more often willy too he shall have his place this is not a late recognition of status more an equality of the same true we all inhabit richards body his mind but not in the way i envisioned it when i was before we are in a way completely separate identities but richards was the strongest identityyes i said wasand he would not relinquish control lightly despite my earlier generosity he quickly grew jealous over his right of tenancy your generosity she broke in when he paused are you talking about the money you left him his right of tenancy but you said it yourself its his body but our mind were all in here vicki we share knowledge even suppressed kept down keonig and i know when richard is well when he is unwell happy unhappy threatened hurt and we know that whenifhe dies then we must die with him riot only us the three of us in here but you too oh vicki vicki child you are resentful of us willy and i but dont you see we are your protection thats a a sideeffect a spinoff vicki protested weakly thomas you were my fathers friend like a kinda very kinduncle to me i appreciated that but now i brian lumley how now nowl garrisonschroeder snapped like it or not we are both of us all of us in the same boat his voice had risen in pitch was harsh as chalk on a board mein qottwas ist los mit dir mil mir nichts she answered her own heat rising but with you is this the immortality you wanted thomas what of our immortality now he was suddenly livid vicki could see that but he made a concentrated effort to retain or regain his composure before answering vicki my dear there are two flies in the ointment of my immortality he rasped you are one the other is richard himself you because you interfere richard because he is the ascendant one he is more often in possession what an irony that of the three of usmyself willy and richardrichard is least wellequipped to protect himself is that why youre here now i mean to protect richard to protect us ail garrison schroeder was calmer you know that the power is draining vicki when it goes you will be the first to suffer dont you see how you will suffer blindness first then death you will decay vicki and very quickly and like me you have already been there once you know what death is like she shuddered please dontand turned to him sharply thomas i he took a hand from the steering wheel qui psychosphere etened her words before she could give them form let me finish he said the loss of power is not all the plane was sabotaged you know that and so you must also know that an unseen unknown agent is at work against us who why oh ive had enemies enough in my time but that thomas schroeder is no more likewise koenig and who would want to murder richard for what reason i i dont know she answered frowningly hes crossed people i suppose but but murder mo i think it goes deeper than a mere feud that is merely its guise we have become aware recently of another power in the psychosphere vicki an incredible hostile power that is the other reason i am here the reason why i may yet have to call up koenig in our defense it is the sort of work willy and i understand far better than richard so you see there are problems enough without your adding to them with merely mundane personal and emotional troubles of your own he looked at her shrewdly as her hand went to her mouth you know her eyes were wide incredulous and they were frightened that you have started to doubt your love for richard yes mow she sobbed openly had difficulty controlling the ache inside her body her soul finally she said ive tried to hide it she dabbed furiously at her tears but i knew that sooner or later you heall three of youmust read it in my mind no i dont love him she had finally said it was terrified of what brian lumley she had said and now clutched at garrison schroeders arm and wept harder yet she buried her head in his breast and as he pulled off the road and stopped the car on the grass verge she said oh thomas thomasi cant help it he ts my life but i dont love him yes youre right i have been there i have been dead oh godand i fear it fear it ear it but how can i love someone who must in the end kill me vicki vicki he patted her shoulder held her close and tight dont dont do you consider yourself a sinner you havent sinned were you disloyal mo merely afraid so you dont love richard is that a crime not in my eyesnot even in richards i am sure what did you think he would do will you out of existence is hewas he everthat sort of man richard did not take lives he saved them he saved mine for what it was worth she looked up dabbed at her tears and for the first time it was as if schroeder were actually here that this was indeed that kind old uncle she used to know so very long ago hell forgive me hell be hurt no doubt garrisonschroeder answered he may not forgive you not immediately but is he a murderer is he a coldblooded killer vicki i thomas schroeder have killed men i will not admit to murder for those killed or caused to die deserved it willy koenig has also killed men but for him i cannot answer still i tell you nothing could bring us to harm you why should we and richardhow psychosphere could he fio on that point you needlessly impale yourself oh thomas if only my child listen to me we both fear death you and i yes for we of all mankindand christ too if you believehave been dead and returned can you believe that while it is in my power to live i will suffer death again you know i will not but someone wants to kill richard and however unwittingly he would kill all of us with richard that is a terrible threat and my first task is to remove it after that he shrugged started the car yes she prompted him as he eased the mercedes onto the road after that i shall turn my attention to a much more difficult problem having removed the threat of immediate death i hope to solve the riddle of eternal life for iweare not immortal vicki not yet we lost that when richard destroyed psychomech but the machine can be rebuilt or a greater power may yet be discovered richard has dreamed is dreaming even now and his dream is a quest he seeks that greater power but what of me she asked am i tied to him forever without love i cant speak for richard vicki garrison schroeder answered he may want to keep you even without your love but i doubt it but whichever way it goes there is one thing i can promise you while i live you live and vicki you may believe that life is still very dear to me brian lumley at the house in sussex qarrisonschroeder wasted no time but took a heaped tray of food with him and locked himself in the study he did not want to be disturbed at midday a constable and police inspector called at the house having driven up from chichester to record statements they had been requested to do so by the metropolitan police garrisonschroeder emerged from the study for twenty minutes to offer them food and drinks and give them the statement they required vicki declined saying that her experience on the plane had been more or less the same as his one thing qarrisonschroeder did ask of the police was the names and addresses of the crew and hostess during the outward flight to rhodes the crew had only used shortened forenames nicknames and of course neither garrison nor vicki had known anything of their personal particulars when the police left qarrisonschroeder went back into the study before he locked the door vicki saw him take down a street map of london a short while later she heard him using the telephone but could make out nothing of what he said he was in there for a further hour finally came out looking pale and tired his tray was empty and he was still hungry while cook prepared him a proper meal he sat and smoked talked to no one he ate his fillnot enjoying his food simply stoking the fire vicki thoughtthen rested in the study sprawled out at his ease in psychosphere a great padded chair at pm he left the house but before going he said to vicki my dear im not sure how long this will take do nothing out of the ordinary merely stay here and live as normally as you may one of us will be back myself richard or willy then he drove away in the big mercedes with suzy sitting beside him vicki waved them goodbye from the drive she would never see either one of them again at qatwick airport johnnie fong used a public telephone to contact qubwa charon i am at qatwick i followed garrison here from the house whats he doing gubwas interest was immediate he appears to be waiting fong sighed he sits in the arrivals lounge with an airport magazine but i do not think that he reads it this is interesting qubwa answered his excitement mounting perhaps we are about to learn something new about our mr garrison he will be waiting for the black brothers a pair of common thugs they are due in at seven oclock how johnnie i want you to watch most carefully what happens and he paused no better still ill watch it for myselfthrough your eyes let me know when the plane lands and position yourself so that you can see everything after thatdo nothing until i tell you understood yes fong whispered but brian lumley yes there is something strange go on it is garrison said fong i know of course that it is garrison and yet he seems a different person yes it is strange charon there was a thoughtful pause before gubwa answered another of mr garrisons more mysterious aspects johnnie you are not the first to note his changeability not by any means i will wait for your call one last thing do not be seen to be interested dont get too close of course not i trust you above all others johnnie your rewards will be great my reward is great charon i love you until later then and the chinaman waited for the metallic click from the other end before he replaced the phone in its cradle good as his word gubwa was watching through fongs eyes when joe and bert black passed through customs and emerged from the arrivals gate they were tanned seemed healthy enough but their minds were patently preoccupied they had tried to carry out a mafiacontracted hit and had failed their presence had been requested at the big guys place tonight and that would be more than sufficient to occupy or preoccupy anyone they spoke to each other in lowered tones found a trolley for their luggage and made for the downpassage to the trains but suddenly psychosphere as they reached the center of the arrivals hall their footsteps were arrested garrison had moved from his seat and was standing with his back to a pillar his magazine held up before his face there was no way the blacks could know it was him no reason why they should suspect him or anyone else to be waiting for thembut they nevertheless turned through ninety degrees until they faced in his direction and went up to him and gubwa saw that their movements had grown automatic zombielike now garrison lowered the magazine gubwa might have expected the brothers to flinch attack almost anythingbut they merely stared their faces strangely blank nothing was said no movement was apparent for thirty seconds maybe even a full minute the oddly frozen tableau held then as if they had not interrupted their exit from the hall the brothers wheeled their trolley away and disappeared round a corner garrison watched them go turned and began to follow the route indicated to the car park he paused leaned for a moment against a tiled wall stood uprightbut shakilyand finally continued walking go after him said gubwa in fongs mind follow wherever he goes report when you can day or night but dont lose him as you wish charon the chinaman whispered to no one walking quickly after garrison but keeping a good distance between himself and the mans back brian lumley and johnnie you may have to protect him i want him to stay alivefor the moment anyway yes charon qubwa withdrew and opened his eyes he was seated at his desk in the castles command center a qatwick area ordnance survey map spread before him he stared at the map thoughtfully frowned folded it carefully and turned in his seat to replace it in its rack his frown grew more severe as he tried to analyze what he had just seen if it was what he suspected then garrisons strength was indeed incredible he could of course check it out could visit the minds of the black brothers and discover what had been done to them but that might be dangerous garrison could be maintaining a mindlink that might account for his momentary weakness as he left the arrivals area it could be the result of his continuing use of esp following the initial surge when he had done to them whatever he had done no gubwa couldnt risk it for one thing he did not wish to overtax his own powers and anyway he had other things to do other minds to monitor phillip stones for instance stones car was parked on the hardstanding of a layby where the road climbed to a low hill half a mile to the west of garrisons house stone sat in the drivers seat a pair of binoculars hanging round his neck he had seen garrison drive away towards london had seen a gray jaguar pick up his tail as he approached the a but beyond psychosphere that he had not been interested he was simply following instructions more than that was quite beyond him oh he could perform his normal functions could talk eat drink smoke and answer the calls of natureanything providing he did not stray from the mental course directed by charon gubwa the awful thing about it was he knew what he was doingor what he was not doing for one thing he was not protecting garrison no he was waiting on gubwas command to snatch the mans wife or mistress whatever she was for what must have been the fiftieth time stone looked at his car telephone all he had to do was pick it up get his chief on the other end put him in the picture or he might try digging a tunnel to australia an impossibility he could think about doing it want desperately to do it but actually do it no way gubwa had seen to that a pretty thorough laundering of stones mind a mindblock and just to polish things off nicely a rather comprehensive list of posthypnotic commands these things were gubwas legacy to stone forming a governor on his mind like the governor on a cars carburetor or accelerator limiting his performance and until gubwas ends were serveduntil the albino had vicki maler to use as he would in the castlestone would simply have to obey quite correct mr stone said a voice in his mind so clear and close that he jerked his brian lumley head round fully expecting to see the hermaphrodite standing there just outside the open door of the car no no said the voice amused you cant see me merely hear meand obey me of course stone swallowed hard took a sip of coffee from the plastic lid of his thermos flask thought what now qubwa just checking when it gets dark i want you to go to the house there you will keep out of sight and await further orders there is a possibility that you might have to protect the occupants there are others who seek to bring garrison down i cant watch everyone and i dont know everything but but it only seems that way stones thoughts were sarcastic you flatter megubwa ignored them but i dont want the maler woman harmed in any way ill be in touch and he withdrew left on his own stone was suddenly cold the sun wasnt down yet the evening was warm and yet he was cold as stone cold it had finally dawned on him that gubwa could do it mad he might or might not be but he could actually do it he could conquer the world he could become emperor of earth he could refashion men in his own image and here was phillip stonehardman with fists of steel secret agent with all the resources of mis and to back him upand helpless as a newborn babe he finished his coffee smoked a cigarette psychosphere waited as night began to fall he locked the doors of his car and started off towards the house the london mafia sat in extraordinary meeting the big guys usual offices were in a city center office block on the tenth and top floor the largest room overlooking a busy london street was the venue there about a table similar to the one at which another group had recently discussed richard garrison was gathered the coven the cosa nostras thirteen foremost londonbased men at the head of the table sat the big guy joseph maestroa bullnecked scarnosed hulking thug whose ugly swarthy features and blocky frame seemed hugely incongruous with the immaculate cut of his suitand from there down to the foot of the table sat his lieutenants in descending order of importance towards the foot sat carlo vicenti quite clearly showing signs of wear and tear one sleeve of his jacket hung loose his arm was bandaged across his chest one hand was swathed in bandages his face showed severe bruising the meeting had been in session for a little over half an hour and it was now just after pm several minor items had already come up for discussion clearing the way for the big one but now it was garrisons turn the big guy had started it off and he was now almost through speaking so it really would seem that this guy has an unbeatable gambling system hey not just brian lumley one system but a system for every game now i dont have to tell you guys what that means but i will cos i know a lot of you cant see past your fucking noses if garrisons methods get looseif he lets this big cat out of the bagin no time at all ten thousand garrisons will be hitting our tables and machines and clubs and a high percentage of our backing comes out of those clubs on the other hand if he tells us how he does it well theres a lot of clubs still belong to other people yeah so thats why were bringing the guy in heyand anybody who doubts how good he is only has to ask mr vicenti down there how he lost his personal share in the ace of clubs and im sure carlo will oblige and not only money carlo lost a lot of face we dont like that none of us what it boils down to is this guy garrisons a menace but when weve finished with him and picked his brains a little hell be a very thirsty menacewhich is fine cos we figure to fix him up with a great big drink heyyou think he can drink the river dry ha when vicenti asked his tone surly when are we bringing him in joe see i have a big interest in this bastard yeah yeah we know stay cool carlo like i said before hes yours when were through with him but being a democratic organizationand technically this being a hit which it will be eventuallywe need a vote aint that why were all here tonight sure so lets see a show of psychosphere hands that we bring in this garrison that we get him to tell us his story and then that we fit him up with concrete boots along with maestros hand eleven others were swiftly raised vicentis more slowly and with a deal more effort they were still in the air when the doors crashed open to admit joe and bert black joe carried a levelled automatic berts arms cradled a foldeddown sterling submachinegun now get the other arms up joes voice was cold up ordered bert the snout of his machinegun moving to cover the entire meeting all eyes were on that weapon and all present knew berts reputation the muzzle of the sterling seemed to flare like some single obscene nostril in the face of a mythical beast before that beast could snarl they raised their other arms all except carlo vicenti he pushed his chair back made to stand you guys nuts he yelled he mistakenly thought that they were here to preempt reprisals you come busting in here like shit you were invitedl so you missed your hit so what it works out right we want garrison alive we have no grudge with you guys while he talked joe and bert had moved to flank him they pushed him down in his chair as he struggled to rise then without another wordeven as vicenti continued to ragejoe black put away his pistol took out a cutthroat razor yanked back the suddenly shrieking mans head and slit his throat ear to ear brian lumley vicenti coughed choked made noises the sounds issued from his gaping wound not his gaping mouth and a moment later along with the sounds blood in a crimson gush bert and joe stepped back from him he floundered in his chair rose sat sprayed blood clawed at his throat he was drenched scarlet he flopped facedown on the table arms flailing he slid off the table leaving a spreading pool of blood while vicenti died the black brothers moved to the large casement windows now every living bulging eye in the room turned from vicentis body to them the big guy and his colleagues were on their feet arms raised high maestro tried to speak but choked on the words compliments of richard garrison said joe and for the first time the remaining occupants of the room noticed how vacant the faces of the assassins seemed and a warning in case anyone else wants to try it on this is to show you what he can do and the brothers turned on their heels and hurled themselves headlong through the closed windows taking weapons shattered glass and their spent lives with them for a moment no one moved then there was a concerted rush for the door hold it maestro found his voice as cries of horror began to float up from the street below hold it right there this place will be thick with filth in less time than it takes us to get out and why should we run eh were innocent bystanders aint we if the blacks want to cool carlo and then jump thats their business as for us we all tell the same story okay psychosphere they all began to babble at once but maestro held up his arms quick thinking was his forte listen for fucks sake we aint carrying heaters are we the only prints on those guns down there are theirs the blacks all we do is leave garrisons name out the rest of it we tell like we saw it shit how should we know what was going down between carlo and the brothers eh the rest of them looked at each other nodded began to relax okay maestro continued so get your minds tidied up hell weve seen worse than this as they began to gather into small groups and mull over what they had seen the big guy called over ramon de medici and quickly took him to one side ramon he kept his voice low what you told me earlierabout carlo being sure it was garrison beat him upthat was straightup stuff sure joeexcept it dont look so silly now eh maestros face twitched this garrison i dont want him brought in anymore i dont want to know anything about him i just want him dead i think hes safer that way de medici nodded this we can do we bugged his car while he was out of the country a big silver mercedes our technical boys can tell us where it is whenever we want to know and garrison is usually where the car is okay as soon as they cut us loose from this mess get somebody on it somebody reliable youve got it brian lumley in fact you better get the hell out of here now go out the back way and over the roof dont let anyone see you ill tell the guys to forget you were here right right medici nodded taking his departure outside the mechanical whoop whoop whoop of police sirens was beginning to fill the air fists were already knocking on the external doors of the executive office suite and authoritative voices demanded entrance a spidersplash of shadow ramon de medici hurried over the dark roofs chapter garrisomschroeder came off the ml at leicester and found a good hotel he would have driven on but it was past pm and he was weary to death it was late for eating but he bribed reception to fix a meal for him and while he was on about it he ordered an extra steak raw for suzy he took her supper out to the car and she gratefully wolfed it down then leaving one of the mercs windows open a fraction he told suzy to go to sleep and returned to the hotel the bar was still open for residents halfway through his fourth whisky the weaselfaced receptionist sidled up to him and asked if he would mind eating in his room there were others here who had been refused food at this late hour garrisonschroeder didnt mind gulped down the rest of his drink made his way to his room and ate his fill then having made brian lumley himself a coffee he stretched out on his bed and opened up a magazine hed picked up at gatwick airport that magazinean airline throwaway full of advertising dutyfree offers and such plus a couple of articles to occupy the passenger during his flightwas the principal reason he was here he had picked it up off a table at the airport used it for a shield to hide his face while he waited for joe and bert black but before then as he had idly skipped through its pages garrisonschroeders knowledge of the paranormalnot his experience of it which was another thing entirelywas second to none as thomas schroeder he had always been interested in parapsychology especially in the nebulous region of prophetic dreaming how such dreams worked he did not know but he did know that he was here today as garrisonschroeder because they worked it had been just such a prophetic dream which had helped convince richard garrison to accept his offer his pact and finally to become the host body and mind to his mind yes his very reincarnation could be traced back to just such a dream and now now there was this this simple photograph in a magazine monochrome not especially interesting even dull dull too the textboastful product of the british energy commissionbut when garrisonschroeders eyes had first glimpsed the fullpage spread then the paper had seemed illumined with some magical inner light psychosphere the picture showed a valley a dam and in the background a range of great gaunt hills the legend below said that this would be the biggest boost to the grid since the opening of the atomic power station at dounreay it also said that the dam close to glen odunkillie was due to go into production on wednesday the day after tomorrow and that the minister for energy would be there for the opening ceremony but garrisonschroeder had already determined to be there sooner by tomorrow at the latest his reason was simple this was that same valley and dam the selfsame wild hills that garrison had seen in his dream the schroederfacet had engineered that dream had been awake while the garrisonfacet slept and had promoted the sleeping facet to probe the futurehad even loaned his own natural not inconsiderable esptalent to facilitate that probeand of course he had shared the dream he too had seen that part of their joint future elements of that dream flickered once more like scenes from an old silent movie through the inner recesses of garrisonschroeders mind he saw the storm and the lightning the six sprouting ares of shining steaming water and felt the dampness in the air and spray in his faceand all superimposed over the photograph on the printed page and down in the bottom righthand corner of the picture the bleak gables of an old house in the pines where once where once had reared a golden dome brian lumley in xanadu did garrison a stately pleasuredome decree a pleasuredome unlikely unless pleasure represented the fulfillment of the ultimate dream not really garrisons this time but schroeders own his lifelong dream of immortality and hadnt that been the very purpose of garrisons dreamquest to seek out and seduce the goddess of immortality well then the quest might soon be at an end garrison schroeder could sleep this night knowing that in the morning no matter which facet took ascendence upon awakeningbe it himself garrisonkoenig or just garrison his journey would be completed and that somewhere ahead in a valley close by glen odunkillie destiny waited for now he could simply sleep and dream his own dreams except that he somehow knew they would no longer be filled with terrors or rather the one great terror richard garrisons death by natural causes or design which must of course signal his own willy koenigs vicki malers yes and suzys death too vicki poor child he thought of contacting her before sleeping of finding and touching her mind just to see if all was well but the battery was leaking its energy into the great boundless psychosphere energy which could not for now be replaced another good reason to sleep garrisonschroeder undressed put out the light and got into bed psychosphere garrisons quest meanwhile continued he too sought the valley of the dome but subconsciously in a world which was grown more real to him now than any waking world since that terrifying episode in the cave of the otherthe interrogation of the girlwraith and her escape aided by the one who wore the cloak of secrecygarrison had come far he had skirted great green oceans millpond calm because he dared not cross them not with the machine to weigh him down the weariness was on him continually and every furlong of the way seemed a mile even suzy was wearysuzy of the boundless energyand spent a great deal of her time curled behind him adding her weight to the general burden but he would leave neither dog nor machine behind he must go on and they must go with him as for the machine itself psychomechs back was raw rust now chaftng at garrisons thighs through tattered trousers cables trailed behind their plastic sheaths eaten away exposing dulled wire cores cracks gaped in the plastic body and flanks and spots of corrosion marred even the gleam of chrome a junkyard garrison found strength for a feeble curse and still i carry you with me another folly of a fool upon a fools quest but still he went on and where once he would have soared over the highest mountains now he sought passes through them making the way longer and his temper shorter forests of giant twisted trees he would not enter for fear of what might lurk brian lumley within but had to skirt them and remembering the circle of wizards and how they had gloated over their shewstone while he burned in the sand he steered clear of all deserts yes and the memory of those wizards haunted him he especially remembered the yellow slanteyed one indeed he could hardly forget him for now it seemed that the oriental mage followed him upon his quest that wherever he turned his head the small yellow man would be there distantly glimpsed merging with trees or rocks or skylines the moment he was spotted aye and possibly there were others on garrisons trail vague furtive ghosts who disappeared at once if ever he tried to focus his eyes upon them too keenly of sleep garrison had had none for he wished no more dreams within dreams but it seemed to him his weariness was such that it transcended mere sleep so that he could not even if he would and in this condition finally he crested a range of low hills and saw spread beneath him the valley of the mists now whether he actually saw it or not he could not say but certainly there was something very strange and ethereal about the entire valley its expanse lay parallel to and between the hills now behind him and an even lower range of foothills to the fore and to the right and left the valley or low ground between these ranges stretched away and out of sight and along its entire length the mists curled and eddied like vapor over a lake or psychosphere moat of milk and the silence there might be that silence which will come one day at the end of time this time garrison did not hesitate this was an obstacle beyond avoidance which must be crossed there were at least three good reasons for one it might go on forever this misty valley and not have a way round at all two time pressed and garrison grew weaker three a storm seemed to be gathering a doomful oppression of atmosphere manifesting in dark clouds that boiled in the sky all around and momently closed with the as yet clear patch of sky directly overhead also the temptation to cross the valley was great it did not seem wide the foothills beyond seemed to beckon garrison on and so as these thoughts passed through his dully aching mind he rode the maimed machine down and into the sea of mist and uncaring of the terrors it might conceal passed forward until the milky stuff closed above him and the external world was shut out beyond eerily drifting walls of white lulled by the silence and veritable creep ofpsychomech through the mist and by suzys slow panting where she sat close behind him garrisons initial alertness gradually dissipated and he closed eyes already heavy from lack of rest and from peering ahead in this milky submarine realmand at that very moment the storm broke thunder smote like titan hammers and lightnings flickered down their transient trails hissing through the mist and stabbing the sodden ground to steaming lighting up the way in glow brian lumley ing blueburning phantoms of rocky outcrops and shaly piles and at any single moment one such bolt might have struck garrison or the metal of the machine but no they were spared then in the afterglow of a particularly vicious blast garrison saw or thought he saw but no in the booming confusion of thunder the kaleidoscopic flicker of lesser lightnings and the blinding glare of that greater bolt his eyes had deceived himmust surely have deceived him he moved forward again his flesh tingling and not alone from the static electricity that plucked at his hair and the tatters of his clothing and there it was again but closer now and no longer limned by lightning it was could only be a machine like psychomech but no such psychomech as garrison might ever have imagined huge gigantic the thing towered until its uppermost parts were lost in the ceiling mist vast and squat it sat there pipes and panels and bulkheads sprawling away until on both sides their outlines became dim and mistwreathed it would take fifty perhaps a hundred no a thousand psychomechs such as garrisons machine to fill the same volume and deep within lights flashed and power surged but silently without the faintest hum of sound and where the machine should have had hard edges they were instead blurred and indistinct so that garrison knew that in fact this was a vision but of what strange place or event he could not say a vision yesa mirage such as men see in the desertthe mirror image of some distant thing or occurrence except that garrison knew that the psychosphere truth of this mirage was not distant in space but in time it had been sent or he had willed it as a sign that he pursued the right path had not strayed from the course which might yet carry him to quests end he moved closer still but carefully unwilling even to disturb the air or milky mist lest the vision dissolve away but a moment later he stopped again this time with a gasp the incredible machine had a platforma raised central dais or bed beneath a pair of huge copper rods with knobbed ends like vast electrodesbut it was the thing the creature lying upon the bed which caused garrison to gasp he knew instinctively what the creature was even found a word for it squirming its way up to the surface of his mind a word from another place another world frankenstein the thing on the dais was a monster composite of corpses an unnatural creature created by a crazed science and as the lightning crashed again garrison moved closer still for there was something here that he must discover must see for himself something to do with this manufactured composite creature he got down from his machine approached the machime until he stood in the shadow of its awesomely ethereal bulk lifted himself up on tiptoe to gaze amazed at the monster spreadeagled upon the dais it was in the shape of a man yes but a massive powerful man garrison gazed along its length between huge naked calloushardened feet beyond which the trunk formed a horizon of flesh he took a pace to one side let brian lumley his gaze follow the creatures thigh up above the knee to where a great fist lay loosely clenched relaxed that fist certainlyin sleep or death garrison could not saybut there was that about it which mutely spoke of deadly dexterity the hand of a killer garrison wondered at the sheer size and apparent hardness of the creatures limbs which were huge even compared to its body upright and awake with arms and legs fists and feet like these the monster would be walking death to any ordinary opponent and yet there was also a slyness about it the suggestion of wily intelligence like that of a fox where this idea sprang from in garrisons mind was a mystery but it persisted this composite creature was made up of a brilliantly clever if morally suspect or even unscrupulous man and of a simpler but definitely more brutal manand of one other the thunder and lightning seemed to have moved on a little lulling garrison into believing that the storm had passed but in the next moment he knew that he was mistaken with a roar and a multiple crashing that nearstunned him four great bolts falling almost simultaneously shredded the milky mist to tatters to strike at the machine like hammers of thor in that one moment the entire machipie was bathed in flickering blue energiesgarrison too with his own nimbus of eerie fireand in the next the lights burned brighter in the great engines guts and a mighty pulse of power rocked its towering structure psychosphere thenseveral thingsculminating in a sheet of flame and a rending explosion that hurled garrison head over heels skidding and tumbling until his back and shoulders came up against the rusty bulk of his machine and there he lay with reeling head and aching bones but before that tremendous blast he would never be sure his senses seemed no longer reliable were dulled from exhaustion and dazed from a succession of shocks he had thought that the great copper rods with their huge electrodes had suddenly swelled up as from an unbearable power gathering in them and he had thought to see a lashing streaming incandescence of energy unleashed between those terminals to cojoin and strike down at the naked monster then finally before the ultimate blast he had thought that the entire body of the creature shuddered and jerked and that he had smelled the reek of roasting flesh and then with a shriek of absolute agony the thing had bent upright from the waist glaring at him with mad golden eyes in a face which he had at once recognized as his own later garrison emerged from delirium to find himself on all fours clawing uselessly at the rustscabbed base of the machine psychomech suzy was beside him nuzzling his neck with a nose that was mainly dry urging him back to his senses with little barks and whinings of the machine no trace remained neither of brian lumley machine nor of monster no traceexcept in garrisons mind he remembered the monsters face his face and knew there must be a meaning doubtless he would discover that meaning at quests end quests end hahthat was a laugh for all garrison cared it could end right here and now and yet he set his jaw stubbornly suzu up qirl his voice was cracked throat dry youre not so heavy she scampered aboard the machine then he straightened his shoulders took hold of a dangling cable willed the machine to float free of the ground it did one inch two but that was sufficient walking ahead he led the machine out of the valley like a man leading some strange lame prehistoric beast the stars of night were bright above the gentle slopes of the foothills rose dark ahead johnnie fong sat in his gray jaguar in the hotel car park and watched until the light blinked out in garrisons firstfloor bedroom the man up there was in fact garrisonschroeder but fong didnt know that to the chinaman he was simply garrison fong waited a few minutes left his car and found a public telephone moments later charon gubwa answered his private telephone in the castle and was brought up to date it was late but gubwa had already slept precognition had told him that the upcoming hours would be busy ones having quickly absorbed all of fongs infor psychosphere mation now the albino sent his mind out to phillip stone where he kept an eye on the garrison residence mr stone go back and get your car then bring vicki maler to me stone a cigarette dangling from his lips shielded by his hand in the darkness where he stood beneath trees not far from the house jerked to attention or rather his mind did he ground out the cigarette with his heel and looked around carefully in the empty darkness you still find difficulty in believing mr stone perhaps you are not so clever after all how am i to get her to come with me stone asked in a whisper finding it too much of an effort to simply think his question and where to it was as if he heard a chuckle you already know those things you will remember them as you go improvise as required simply obey like shit stone spat out the wordsbut already he was making his way back towards the spot where his yellow granada was parked at the house it was easy stone found his mind whirling as his mouth ran on of its own accord or of gubwas accordas the simple fact of what he was doing triggered a stream of posthypnotic commands which could not be denied he was phillip stone from mi he told the maler woman richard garrison was now in the care of the secret service it was believed that a second attempt on his life was in the offing garrison had asked that vicki maler be picked up and brian lumley brought to him for her safety while stones mind might be in utter chaos his words and actions were under a firmer discipline than ever he himself had mastered and of course he carried proof of his identity the woman had no choice but to trust him she had been preparing for bed but now she dressed quickly packed a small case gave the servants one or two cursory instructions and allowed stone to take her to his car through all of this he wanted nothing more than to tell her to run make herself scarce phone the police anything but go with him instead he smiled concernedly told her not to worry held the door for her while she got into his car after dumping her case in the boot and in a very short time they were on their way to london meanwhile gubwa dared do nothing word had already reached him of vicentis murder and the doublesuicide of the blacks and he knew who was responsible if not quite how but obviously garrison was still a force to be reckoned with a terrifying force qubwa had taken a nailbiting chance when he had stone pick up the girl with powers such as garrison commanded things still could have gone wrong they still could for which reason gubwa would not rest easy until she was here in the castle shielded by the mental blackout of his mindguards as for them there were eight of them on duty now gubwa could take no more chances psychosphere but with garrison asleep and at a distance gubwa had not been able to resist the opportunity to strike success was now well within his reach the girl would know the source or secret of garrisons power and she would also know his weaknesses meanwhile in a dark car park not too far away stone would have parked his granada he would then have wound down his window and at his signal one of gubwas lieutenants would have stepped forward broken the top off a tiny phia and splashed its contents into the car a knockout gas instantaneous would then have put stone and the girl to sleep by now they were on their way to the castle and no power in the world could possibly follow their trail here hopefully that last because gubwa knew or strongly suspected that garrisons power was not of this world but of the psychosphere but at least every human precaution had been taken and for now it was simply a matter of waiting ramon de medicis call roused joseph maestro from an uneasy sleep the big guy grumbled switched on his bedside light snatched the telephone handset from its cradle and checked the callers identity ramon okay wait maestro turned to the girl in his bed and shook her awake you he said out what she drowsily blinked sleep from her eyes wrapped toowilling arms around him he brian lumley grunted and shrugged her off she was very young and very beautifulworthless to joseph maestro wake up dummy he snapped go clean your teeth but joe she mumblingly protested i already cleaned my then take a shower just get the hell out of here i have to speak to somebody ill call you when im through qrumblingly she got out of bed moved in the direction of the bathroom yeah said maestro into the phone what is it you found garrison right came the answer his car anyway hes not at home so we figure hes with his car where in leicester maestro frowned leicester what the hell is he doing in leicester where in leicester we dont know have to go up there to get a positive fix so get on it tonight right now maestro snapped heywe owe this guy and not just for vicenti you aint telling me you enjoyed last night are you three solid hours in the beautiful company of the filthand then spat out like so much stale gum mow get on it i want garrison dead okay joe you got it his cars not moving so we figure hes staying over somewhere ill go personally take carlos boys with me theyll enjoy it psychosphere yeah right said maestro thats good the filth dont know you were there when the blacks snuffed carlo and jumped if they do somehow figure out that garrison was involved with that they still wont be able to tie you in with it youre in the clear okay the jobs yours right dont screw it up i wont youre a good guy ramon thanks joe maestro put down the phone the glass door of the bathroom was steamed up now and he could hear the hiss of the shower it was hot tonight he threw back the sheets stretched and yawned hey baby okay you can come back to bed she came out of the bathroom towelling herself down he silently admired her breasts the firm globes of her buttocks when youre dry he told her you can do us both a favor and get your mouth round that she came over to the bed wrinkled her nose looked pointedly down on him round what she asked without malice maestro grinned so work on it he said heyi should keep a dog and bark myself chapter whatever forces or currents they are which circulate in or permeate the psychosphere may never be known but that tuesday morning at dawn they roused neither richard garrison nor garrisonschroeder from sleep but garrisonkoenig and it was this third facet of garrisons multimind which drove the big mercedes back onto the ml heading north as fortune good or bad had it de medici and his boys arrived seconds too late just in time to see the silver car making away into the distance then it was a case of turning about and driving back to the ml and of waiting there until their detector indicated that the mercedes was heading north once more as for johnnie fong he stayed fairly close behind garrisonkoenig until he was certain of the route then fell back to a respectful distance and psychosphere settled down to driving at the motorways maximum of seventy miles per hour which was the speed garrisonkoenig was doing in the mercedes a man who held the law in some respect garrisonkoenigwhen it suited him but having followed so close on his quarrys heels from hotel to motorway fong had given himself away richard garrison would never have noticed him and neither would thomas schroeder but willy koenig had beenstill was even as a facet of garrisona different kettle of fish entirely as his beloved colonel schroeder had often used to say of him willy had an infinite capacity for thinking bad thoughts before others thought them whatever the circumstances he invariably suspected the worst and prepared for it and where trouble was concerned he was the most capable of men moreover he was loyal to a fault these were qualities which had earned him schroeders undying trust and friendship yes and richard garrisons too through them he had succeeded to a place in garrisons gestalt psyche and right now they were qualities which made him by far the most worthy garrisonfacet to be at the wheel of the big silver mercedes for upon spotting fongs jaguar in his rearview mirror even though he had never seen him before it was garrisonkoenigs nature to dislike and distrust his motives also to begin to consider what steps might have to be taken to dislodge the chinamanperhaps permanently from his tail to this end he pulled in at a layby brian lumley and went to the boot of the car in there where he had secreted them away some time ago while ascendant were certain weapons now he placed these strategically about his person and closed the boot as he did so the gray jaguar sped by its driver staring straight ahead perhaps garrison koenig was worrying needlessly but fifteen minutes later the big mercedes passed a cluster of lorries in another layby and shortly after that the chinaman was back once more on garrisonkoenigs tail he must have been waiting behind the lorries waiting for garrisonkoenig to pass very well it was decided the chinaman in the gray jaguar was a tail an enemy how garrisonkoenig could put it out of his minduntil later but he had no doubt that there would be a later what neither garrisonkoenig nor johnnie fong had noticed as yet was the powerful black saloon almost a hearse in its design sitting well back behind both of them but gradually drawing closer they would notice it soon enough am and charon gubwa was tired he had earlier taken a couple of uppers and was now prepared to take more today would be crucial and he knew it there were vibrations in the fsychosphere which were boiling towards a climax that he himself would be involved he could not doubt and certainly garrison would be part of it garrison or garrisons passing psychosphere for certainly the man must die if there had ever been any question of that it existed no longer he must die and that was a thought which thrilled gubwa as he had not been thrilled for a long time and which at one and the same moment frightened him mightily for he knew now that garrison was not one but three men and he further knew that he charon gubwa would never be safe until garrisons multimind was utterly erased as for phillip stone and the maler woman they still lived gubwa had enough on his hands at the moment and they were neither a physical nor a mental threat vicki malers mere presence here was something of a threat of course but the mindguards were in place two to a cell and the castle had never been more mentally inaccessible from outside interference between gubwas mind and the outside world lay a great mental moat a vacuum in the psychosphere impenetrable to any but the most powerful mind not a twoedged sword by any means for knowing the nature of his mindguards gubwa could direct his own probes outwards as easily as if the guards did not exist at all but let garrison discover qubwalet him find a thread to lead him here the smallest suspicious echo in the psychosphereand the huge albino had little doubt but that he could send his mind crashing in on the castle and that then all would be lost this made him reluctant even to contact johnnie fong and fearful of pongs contacting him as he sat alone in his command center and considered his course of action gubwa knew now about psychomech almost all brian lumley there was to know that it had been a machine dreamed up by hitler or his scientific aides to create fearless supermen built in england thirtyodd years later by the nazi lunatic otto krippner and used by richard garrison to rid his mind of elemental fears and boost his esptalents to an incredible degree an experiment which had almost ruptured the psychosphere itself qubwa knew too all about schroeder and koenig how the sheer ego of the former had bent causality forces in the psychosphere how the defensive and destructive abilities of the latter had guided and protected garrison through to that time when all three minds could meld into one but the machine psychomech that wonderful machine so garrison had destroyed the thing well of course he hadso that no man might follow him into the awesome flux of the psychosphere he had been jealous of his power for in those early days he had been to the esp ether what a black hole is to space and time a complete disruption of psychic law and order an insatiable feeder a dark star of infinite gravity and what then what had brought about the reversal the decline the powerfailure gubwa had considered this and had come to the same conclusion as garrison himself a man is after all only a man he has his span in which to do those things fate decrees even a supermans powers are finite if only because as long as there is time he can never have enough of it to do all he is capable of doing one cannot outlast time itself not even an immortal can do that psychosphere and what if three menthree facets three brightly burning wicksare feeding on the same fat how much more rapid the waning of the candle then garrison yes and schroeder and koenig too were simply burning themselves out garrisons mistake had been in the destruction of psychomech by which he might have revitalized himself but charon gubwa would not make that mistake if hewhen hehad psychomech he would make of the machine a god it would stand in his innermost temple and gubwa would be high priest yes and when he hungered his god would feed him and the psychosphere would be his to command and all would be possible and he would live in power and glory forever and it seemed incredible beyond belief that this future gubwa envisionedthis dream of infinite eternal powershould lie in the hands and minds of one small perfectly normalineveryway human being but it did not in garrison no nor in schroeder or koenig or vicki maler in a man whose name was jimmy craigjames christopher craigthe microelectronic engineer whose skills had prepared psychomech for garrisons use at present j c craig was on the board of one of garrisons companies but soon he would work for gubwa and he would not have power of refusal under the twin pressuresirresistible pressuresof gubwas hypnotelepathic and narcotic controls craig would soon become little more than a puppet dancing to the albinos tune oh it would seem quite impossible that any brian lumley man even the worlds greatest electronic genius could remember all of the titan bulk of technical information required for psychomechs reconstruction it would seem so but falsely under the spell of charon qubwas hypnosis he would remember everything would recall the most minute details and soon psychomech ii would be a reality but this timeah this timeit would not be any mere man whose mind the machine expanded it would be a man whose powers were already developed to an extraordinary degree charon qubwa would lay his obese and unnatural body down upon psychomechs couch but it would be god himself who stood up and this thought also frightened gubwa the thought that his dream so very close to becoming reality could be obliterated at a stroke what if j c craig should die at a stroke an end to gubwas dream what if he were already dead well he was not for gubwa had checked up on him as soon as he had his name no craig was alive and well he worked for garrison as a director of mme miller microelectronics to which position garrison had elevated him following psychomechs success moreover gubwa had already issued those orders necessary to bring craig directly under his control within the space of a day two at most the man would be on his way here kidnapped and drugged to wake up in the castle and commence work at psychosphere once upon psychomech ii and the soldiers gubwa had assigned to this task were of his best and knew only too well the price of failure nor were these the only arrangements gubwa had made he had twice visited craig and on both occasions brief though the visits had been had inserted certain posthypnotic seeds in the mans mind and he had found craigs mind very open to subversion a talented mind yes but one lacking in personal conviction which could be directed or redirected by the very smallest of pressures as to what gubwa had actually donewhat seeds he had planted which would now blossomthat was simple he had generated within craig the need to question garrisons authority in the matter of psychomech just what was this machine which had made garrison so powerful why should garrison alone benefit from psychomech when craig himself had been so essential in the matter of the machines reconstruction indeed why should there not be an improved model over which godalmightygarrison would have no say or sway whatsoever these were the questions craig would now begin to ask himselfor which he would believe he was asking and so slowly but surely his conversion to gubwas cause already had commenced but of course craig was only one problem there were others of far greater importance garrison for example what of him how might his death be engineered without a direct connecting link to charon gubwa as if the thought itself had causality gubwas brian lumley telephone purred and on the other end of the line johnnie fong was waiting with what might be the answer to his albino masters problem charon garrison is in danger from others who how many they have the looks of killersmafia i think three of them in a black saloon have they seen you qubwas pink eyes opened wide as his heart picked up speed no charon they are only interested in garrison gubwa sighed relaxed a little said stay well out of it johnnie follow watch but do not interfere where are you now still heading north about an hour from mewcastle garrison has stopped to eat i can see him from here through the glass of the kiosk he eats in the open air at a wooden table in the sunshine there are many people around him he seems very tired hungry he did not breakfast in leicester and charon yes he has changed again this is garrison but it is not the same garrison this one knows no fear there is an arrogance about him the strength and sureness of a great cat even weary he looks dangerous i am a master of the martial arts as you well know charon but even i would be wary with this garrison now and rightly so said gubwa oh this is garrison johnnie but it is also a man called willy koenig when all is done i will explainperhaps but for now you may wish those cosa fiostra dogs the very best of luck they pursue a stag psychosphere whose antlers are steeped in purest poison where are the mafia now they stand near the exit from this place which is a petrol station and restaurant they are in shirtsleeves leaning on their car they drink beer does garrison know they are onto him he appears preoccupied he does not seem aware of anything and yet he makes you wary yes yes you are right charon there is a tension about him he is tired but he cannot relax he even eats quickly he desires to be on his way but to what gubwa asked himself where does garrison think he is going what is he doing follow he repeated where they go you go i will not contact you contact me when you can he put down the telephone phillip stone had not been present at vicki malers telepathic and hypnotic interrogation when he had awakened without a headache on this occasion he had found himself alone in a room with two single beds a chairand a locked steel door the place was much like a padded cell with solid walls beneath the padding the door had a small barred window for observation he had banged on those bars until they brought him his breakfast and shortly after that while he was still eating the door had been opened again and vicki maier thrust inside with him food had been left for her too then stone had explained all and after initial doubts she accepted him and his assurance that brian lumley from now on in he would do whatever was in his power to protect her though that might not be a great dea finally exhausted both mentally and physically she had gone to sleep on the bed stone had not used and he had seated himself close to the door and calculated the odds against him reckoning his chances and building up his anger when angry stone had the reputation of being a very dangerous man since then the hours had passed very slowly at noon vicki had awakened a little fresher for her sleep had asked the guard outside the door for water to wash with and had received it they had been given more food left to their own limited devices and with time on their hands slowly but surely each had come to know the others story almost as intimately as a wellread book and with a future bleak as theirs appeared to be literally no future at all they did not hold back but talked with a frankness amazing to both of them in any other circumstance long into the afternoon they had talked stone told her something of his life loves and adventures she in return advised him of her own far different background she removed her contact lenses to show him the golden glow of her eyes subdued now and seeming to have that varying brightness seen in a light bulb before the filament exhausts itself and looking at herher beautiful elfin features and perfect figure which even her simple clothes could not completely concealstone felt moved as never before you know he said on impulse this might seem sort of ungallanti mean may feel this psychosphere way because you might be the very last woman i ever get the change to talk tobut yes oh hell it doesnt matter he shrugged angrily yes it does matter damn it all i got you into this i mean i his words tapered off what are you trying to say phillip he sighed just that it hardly seems fair thats all what doesnt seem fair your life mine yours because its been again he shrugged rough on you mine because yes she again prompted him because i had to wait until the end of it to meet you she managed a wan smile that is not ungallant at all i think it very sweet of you and i know what you mean i too feel quite quite small i feel that everything is much too big for me and that i am being swept aside in the rush of things stones angerat himselfflooded over he slammed his fist into the padding of the steel door i feel so bloody useless so weakl you weak she shook her head no theres a great strength in you its being powerless that makes you feel weak im the weak one and growing weaker would you do me a favor is it within my power oh yes simply sit here beside me and put your arms around me after all we have only each other but this is a lot in itself for such a long time now i have had nothing at all brian lumley by midday garrisonkoenig was in edinburgh which was where his entourage lost him that was deliberately contrived and no man better equipped for the task than former feldwebel wilhelm klinke all one needs do is jump a couple of red lights turn a few corners with ones foot down and tear headlong into a multistory car park garrisonkoenig did these things parked the car ready for a rapid takeoff walked to the openair concrete balcony and looked down on the city traffic was heavy no sign of the gray jag and black saloon in a way it would be easier if there were that way it would be overone way or the otherthat much sooner he had spotted the saloon along the last couple of miles of al and had known why it was there revenge for vicenti it hadnt excited him the koenig facet was of an unflappable breed he waited until the middleaged tubby attendant came puffing up the spiralling ramp redfaced and angry an what the bleddy hell dye think yere on jimmy he asked when ah lift the barrier ye pull up tae man window an paynot come tearin straight up here like a cock up a cunt im a stranger here said garrisonkoenig letting his german accent come through as strongly as possible my apologies please accept this for your inconvenience he handed over a crisp tenner oh ah see well noo indeed thats most kind please dont mention it listen i wonder if psychosphere you could do me another favor he crackled a second tenner between thumb and forefinger oh aye certainly what is it sir the tubby scots face was now wreathed in affable smiles first you could send someone for a few sandwichesham i thinkand perhaps a thermos full of coffee oh yesand some raw meat a steak perhaps for the dog im going to sit up here for an hour or two maybe take a nap in the car also i would appreciate it if you could keep your eyes open for a gray jaguar and a big black saloon the jags driver is a chinese gentleman the saloon has three men in it i think probably italians or some such mediterraneans anyway oh aye sirah kin do they things certainly er friends o yours these gentlemen mo garrisonkoenig smiled shaking his head no not friends i would expect you to tell me before you let them in here i would very much appreciate that it would be well worth your trouble consider it done sir the attendant cried yell no be bothered ahll see tae that dance schon smiled qarrisonkoenig im sure youll do your best under the mercs dashboard the mafia bug continued to send out its silent signals and less than a mile away the black saloon nosed slowly through the citys streets returning along its own tracks covering the distance between charon sir harrys voice was sharper than the albino had ever heard it whats going on brian lumley going on qubwa cursed to himself wishing the man had chosen a more opportune time to call him he himself did not know quite what was going on not right now why what do you mean sir harry you know damn well what i mean garrisons gone missing the maler woman too his servants got in touch with their local police i found out from upstairs he wants an answer mow what do i tell him gubwa relaxed a little this was something he could handle tell him nothing he said or if you must tell him that garrison is as good as dead explain the mafia are after him oh revenge for vicenti among other things vicenti that was garrison he engineered it yes silence for a moment then and stone what of him he took the maler woman and disappeared yes and they will stay disappearedalways gubwa waited smiled at the suddenly silent telephone in his hand he could tell from sir harrys inability to frame another question that the man was stumped you wanted mi tied in with this didnt you yes but well now you have it obviously stone was on the cosa ptostra payroll thats what will be thought he took the woman as mafia bait for garrison all part of a feud between garrison and psychosphere the mafia for proof we have the blacks and their bombing of garrisons plane and vicenti of courseand then the suicide of the blacks which will now plainly be seen as the work of the mafia covering up the garrison connection yes yes i see most of that but stone working for the mafiathats a bit strong isnt it do you think for a moment that mi is any clearer than your own outfit gubwa laughed well maybe they arebut they too have their dirty washing i assure you listen how does this sound stones body will be found in the river weighted down and there will be sufficient evidence hidden on it to clean the mafia right out once and for all because youll have advance knowledge your branch will shine you will make yourself directly responsible for any investigations the very foundations of mi will be shaken apart mow how does that sound again the silence them that sounds fine and when does all of this happen it is happening now but you said six weeks i said a maximum of six weeks i underestimated myself thats all it has worked itself out soonerand without complications by tonight garrison should be dead and by first light tomorrow youll know where to start looking for stones body jesus sir harrys voice was a hiss that means i have things to do and time is short then lets stop wasting time said gubwa im quite busy too you know very well but lets get one thing straight its brian lumley important that i know the very minute garrisons dead i cant be seen to act before the fact but i will need to move pretty fast do you see any problems none at all and you shall know garrison is dead one minute after i myself know it is that satisfactory yes good man but charon yes id give my right arm to know how youve managed all this oh im sure you would gubwa laughed again but thats a secret replacing the telephone gubwa found himself tempted to read sir harrys mind he decided against it right now the mans thoughts must be in utter chaos hed make little of them it was just that he felt a sort of niggling suspicion in the back of his own mind like a bad taste at the back of ones throat sir harry was had always been a man to watch but gubwa was tired and there was still much to do better to save his talents for now hold them in reserve against a time in the very near future when their use might prove allimportant that was charon gubwas third error and probably his biggest his first had been when he became interested in garrison in the first place his second had been to interfere in any degree with vicki maler but this one this failure to follow up his own instinctive hunch in respect of sir harrys immediate intentions this was the beginning of the end for at the other end of the now dead line sir psychosphere harrys thoughts were anything but chaotic they were crystal clear as theyd rarely been in many a year gubwa had offered him two pots of gold at the end of the rainbow but he was aiming at three garrison was one because he had already been given that contract the londonbased mafia came next because crushing them would fuel his rocket to fame and a position of even greater power and charon gubwa himself he was the third pot partly because he was a loaded pistol at sir harrys headbut mainly for the fun of it chapter johmmie fong relocated the black saloon at about the same time that ramon de medici fatso facello and toni murelli came to the conclusion that indeed garrison was parked up and hiding in the multistory their detector had indicated that he was stationary and close at hand and the car park seemed the only likely place the chinaman parked in a side street close by got out of his car and watched what was going on from a safe distance he kept himself out of sight however as qubwa had ordered which made the actual mechanics of the affair a little vague to him what actually happened was this de medici had driven up and stopped on the road opposite the entrance to the car park but without actually entering the drivein lane in effect he had blocked off both the drivein and psychosphere out lanes then murelli and facello had got out of the car ducked under the barrier and gone to the booth de medici had watched from the driving seat of the car words had passed between facello and the tubby attendant where he sat in his booth for a little while the latter seemed a bit garrulous waving his arms and reddening up a little but hed quietened down when facello had gone into the booth with him murelli had then turned and given de medici the thumbsup had disappeared up the ramp with his gun out and ready garrison had done them a favor they couldnt have picked a better place for a hit if theyd chosen it themselves garrisonkoenig was parked four floors up almost directly above the entrance he had finished his coffee and sandwiches the best part of an hour ago it was time to move on except there was something not quite right too quiet and suzy strangely nervous where she sat in the back of the car traffic sounds from below but subdued somehow seagulls wheeling round edinburgh castle their plaintive cries carrying on a breeze off the sea a beautiful daybut the koenigfacet was thinking his bad thoughts and suzys restlessness must have a meaning up on the castle ramparts they fired the one oclock gun garrisonkoenigs head jerked round eyes staring his mind awash in psychic awareness there was a flicker of movement in the mercs rearview mirror toni murelli had appeared up the entrance ramp was crouching there waving brian lumley a gun in front of him peering in the car parks dusty haze strong sunlight outside and gloom within murellis eyes werent quite accustomed yet he saw the merc its front doors were wide open sticking out like comic ears creeping closer mureili saw the thermos flask still steaming where it stood on the front passenger seat empty sandwich wrappers lay opened out beside it mureili grinned thats right garrison baby he thought take it easy have a break mureili was half behind the car creeping up on its left now he could see that the drivers seat leaned back in the halfrecline position his grin grew wider he straightened up a little covered the last three paces quickly gripped the wrist of his gunhand and thrust both hands into the car his finger began to tighten on the triggerbut in the next second his grin slipped right off his face garrisonroenig stepped out from behind a massive square concrete support column and kicked the door of the car shut on mureilis wrists at the same time suzy snarled and darted her head forward from the back of the car snapping at the gunmans hands her deadly fangs ground together where they met through the bones of his right wrist murellis scream and the dull plop of his silenced weapon came simultaneously garrisonkoenig leaned his weight on the door kicked mureili in the groin where he flopped against the car the gunman blew the rest of his air out in one great gasp his gun fell from psychosphere nerveless ravaged fingers inside the car suzy had severed two of his fingers and was working on the rest garrisonkoenig let the door fly open grabbed mureili and waltzed him away halfsupporting halfpropelling him he waltzed him towards the concrete balcony mureili in agony and scared witless saw it coming and made one last desperate effort he whirled a bloody torn fist at garrisonkoenigs head coldeyed garrisonkoenig ducked grabbed the others knees lifted and pushed for a moment murelli seemed suspended in air beyond the balcony his white face puffed in and out like that of some strange fish slowly sinking from view in bright water and he was gone without ever mustering the soughtfor scream his body smashed down in front of the black saloon like one hundred and seventyfive pounds of lead for long seconds de medici simply sat at the wheel of his car paralyzed staring his window was down and he had heard the sickening crunch as murelli hit finally he gunned the engine began to back away from murellis body and at the same time heard the roar of the mercs powerful motor as garrisonkoenigs car came careening like some great silver beast down the outramp sparks flew where its metal sides jostled the ramps low concrete wall garrisonkoenig saw the bonnet of the saloon pulling back he saw too fatso facello where he stood ashenfaced in the booth there was no sign of the tubby scot but that probably would not have made a deal of difference a grenade brian lumley dangled by its ring from garrisonkoenigs grinning teeth its weight roiling a little on his chin the metallic chink was lost as he armed the grenade and tossed it into the booth then the mercs nose crashed into the front couple of inches of the saloon and slammed it out of the way at the same time garrisonkoenig wrenched the wheel over so that the combined action had the effect of throwing the merc round the bend and into the street its wheels skidding in toni mureilis blood then tires screaming and throwing out smoke the big car rocked on its springs as it hurtled away up the street in his rearview garrisonkoenig saw facello leap from the booth the fat mans arms and legs an impossible blur of movement then the booth disappeared in a lick of white fire and smoke and deafening detonation facello was picked up all eighteen stone of him and tossed over the roof of the saloon the blast blew in the saloons nearside windows that was as much as garrisonkoenig saw for in the next moment he was round a corner and applying his brakes slowing down as he moved into a stream of traffic and picked up signs that aimed him towards the forth bridge he had killed one of them possibly two and with any luck the saloon would be out of commission he must hope so that would only leave the little yellow man to worry about and garrisonkoenig wasnt really the worrying type he did wonder momentarily what had become of the tubby car park attendant he couldnt know that he had already been dead knifed psychosphere through the heart in the bottom of the booth when the grenade exploded and that a ten pound note was now flapping in the updraft on the concrete base of the car parks firstfloor level stuck there with blood and a little gristle it was only later on the wide approach road to the bridge when garrisonkoenig stopped to examine the surprisingly small amount of damage to the mercedes that he thought of those powers he had neglected to use in his confrontation with the mafia he had known he had them certainly but their use had barely crossed his mind why take a machinegun to swat a fly and of course the power was not limitless the well was rapidly running dry perhaps he had simply been saving what little was left what the hell it wouldnt have been the same anyway at a little before pm johnnie fong reported by telephone to charon gubwa telling him all that had happened since his last report especially detailing the incident at the car park he phoned in from a garage high on a winding road overlooking a grampian hamlet down there at a second garage on the far side of the village garrisons mercedes was undergoing a cursory inspection on the nearside of the patchwork of lanes fields church and houses the mafia saloon sat at the side of the road with no movement visible all of this fong had seen through his binoculars i do not know charon he said how they got back on to his trail but they did and i of brian lumley course simply followed them now however i am obliged to stay well back for even if garrison does not know i am here it is very likely that they do then stay back qubwa ordered at once until after they have dealt with him he must be weakening rapidly johnnie for knowing they are there he should by now have disposed of them he has powers this qarrison but they are leaking out of him like rats deserting a sinking ship still i prefer not to take any chances as to how the mafia picked up his trail again his car is bugged and they are carrying a tracking device but tell me what reason do you think he has for running north i think he is a fool charon brave but a fool the country grows wilder the day wears on his car has long been losing power perhaps the blast and collision caused it i dont know but i think that with the fall of night they must surely close in and kill him if i had a rifle i myself could kill all of them without ever being seen no qubwa snapped through you he might yet find a way to strike at me you must simply observe all that occurs observe and report as you will charon but for now think i might get ahead of them they are off the main road i can go straight through the village and on into the mountains perhaps i can find a high place watch and wait for them do it qubwa agreed will give you one hour do not let yourself be seen in one hour exactly i shall come to you to your mind in this shall be at risk you realize that psychosphere you will be safe charon i swear it good you are a faithful servant johnnie love only you charon when three of qubwas soldiers came for vicki and stone both of them felt that this must be the end of the line stone could be of little use to the albino now and under hypnotism vicki had already surrendered all she had to offer by way of information stone might have made a fight of it but he wasnt given the ghost of a chance the three men dressed in the castles uniform were armed and very efficient they quickly tied the captives into wheelchairs and while two of them pushed the third followed up the rear a machinegun cradled in his arms they were taken to the command center where gubwa had his own reasons for wanting them present during the coming hours and in keeping with his nature gubwas reasons were anything but pleasant the huge albino wore only a dressing gown and slippers marking comfort as essential to any use of his powers as might become necessary his face was lined but not yet haggard despite lack of sleep and his captives saw that there was a sort of wildness about him now that eager barely controlled air of anticipation the hysteria of mind and spirit which invariably marks the egomaniac or otherwise manic personality under pressure or in time of crisis my dear miss maler he opened having sent brian lumley his soldiers away and mr stone of course he nodded an exaggerated welcome and doubtless youre both wondering just why ive had you brought here mot really said stone drily since were the only human beings in the place naturally youd want to talk to somebody it must get hellish lonely amongst the freaks you call your servants and the zombies you use for guards qubwa smiled indulgently not at all mr stone on the contrary too am a freak remember and as for my zombies no general ever knew the obedience my word commands havent you experienced that for yourself he let that sink in but i didnt bring you here for the sake of mere banter however amusing so lets not banter mr qubwa said vicki finding a little iron to stiffen her voice just why are we here he stared at her and the false geniality slipped slowly from his graymottled face his eyes became pink pinpoints fire in your glance miss maler fire in your heart admirable emotion enjoy its heat for youll soon be cold as these steel walls we expected nothing more qubwa stone snarled we just wondered if it would be sooner or later thats all for the young lady sooner the albino answered if what she has already told me and what she believes is true richard vicki at once gasped yes your man garrison qubwa nodded psychosphere gravely you told me that when he dies you die it struck me not long ago that this would be an admirable test to have you here in sight at the moment he dies he will die you see in the very near future i have seen to that vicki hung her head sobbed youre a bastard qubwa you know that stone grated the words out his face twisted with hatred a gray sluglike murderous slimy freak bastard but tomorrow i shall be alive qubwa cried his eyes suddenly blazing and very soon i shall be a god you stone sneered his derision a god a freak god of a nuclear wasteland what qubwa was raving now strutting to and fro dont you ever learn anything man what nuclear wasteland hasnt the girl told you by now all she told me i dont follow you at all qubwa stone spat disgustedly what the hell are you getting at vicki maler was less slow she had seen more understood more than stone possibly could from his short acquaintance with matters paranormal psychomech she gasped aha the girl knows qubwa cried explain to him if you please miss maler tell him my meaning she shook her head not knowing where to begin qubwa read her whirling mind begin with garrison he laughed before psychomech he was just a man she sobbed oh he was strangehe saw things knew things others brian lumley couldnt see or knowbut he was a man in a way he was little more than a boy and a blind boy at that then then the machine she paused yes yes qubwa cried go on miss maler youre doing so well his powers were increased a thousandfold almost infinitely at first he was like like a god for a year or more then then his powers began to fail him and no way to replenish them gubwa cut in he had destroyed fsychomech and the fool didnt know what was wrong only now too late has he recognized the truth flow as his esptalents ebb and he himself fails he flees from enemies he would once destroy with a glance with a thought he will dieall three of you will die and garrisons alterfacets too tonightbut psychomech shall live on i have made arrangements the man who built the machine for garrison will be here tomorrow and jimmy craig vicki blurted you have him too gubwa smiled delightedly indeed mr james christopher craig himself i have him yesor will have him already i have visited him in his dreams and made certain suggestions ahand how susceptible our mr craig but jimmy wasnt the builder vicki said desperately psychometh was built by a man dead now or disappeared jimmy only improved on what was already there he stripped away outmoded parts and replaced them he i know all of that miss maler gubwa cut her psychosphere off you told me remember well perhaps you dont he shrugged anyway i have been in craigs mind i told him he has a mission a great mission which is to build psychomech again a mightier more powerful psychomechand this time to build it for me i told him that with the completion of this marvel this oracle he himself will become a wondrous power in the world i told him that he had erred in working for garrison and that garrison was a great sinner but i also said that i would strike garrison down and then that craigthrough his work for mewould be redeemed and i told him that through psychomech one day he would communicate with the one true god himself yes and i shall be that god gubwa chuckled and folds of fat heaved do you see miss maler do you see yes she bowed her head yes i see what psychomech did for richard it will do a hundred times over for you there gubwa turned triumphantly to stone and now do you understand youre mad stone struggled with his bonds and you are a fool gubwa snapped or utterly stupid man youve seen what i can do without psychomech just think what shall do with it neutron bombs holocaust no more mr stone genetic engineering unnecessary with psychomechs aid i shall simply command the things i desireand they shall be gubwas eyes gave him away he was quite mad now really mad homo sapiens oh yes indeed mr stonebut in a months time or brian lumley maybe less when psychomech has made me godhermaphro sapiens every man woman and child in the twinkling of an eye at my command in my own image and i shall simply will it emperor of earth of this one miserable planet no no no longer mr stone miss maler my new plan is mightier than that why rule a mere world when the entire universe can be will be mine my titles shall tell you my titles god of earth and all the stars master of the universe and lord of the psychosphere these shall be my titles as qubwa grew more and more animated striding about the command center like some nightmarish leprous windmill gesticulating and gabbling stone turned his head to vicki and whispered hes right over the edge just look at him you are wrong phillip she shook her head and followed up quickly with oh hes insane in himselfbut his reasoning is sound enough stones jaw dropped sound reasoning he thinks this machine this psychomech can make him into a god the god said vicki simply yes it can vicki im no believer but thats a real blasphemy oh yesyes it is she nodded out qubwa suddenly shouted out out insane blasphemy we shall see we shall see he pressed a button on his intercom guards in here now the doors hissed open and a pair of gubwas soldiers entered take them out let them wait in the corridor i have something i psychosphere must do now i shall call when i want them back quickly quickly i have much to do vicki and stone were wheeled out into the corridor and the doors hissed shut behind them johnnie fong had driven through the town and up into the grampians the road was narrower here and uneven and the way not so easy for driving there were steep slopes on the one hand and gorges on the other with dark streams rushing below at the end of the year when the snows came these would be among the first roads to go villages like this one would be shut off from the outside world for weeks at a time that was the kind of country it was wild and beautiful and dangerous fong knew that this was perfect ambush country the chinaman had parked off the road up a narrow track where he could hide the car in thicklygrown pines then hed climbed to a saddle between bald hills and seated himself upon a flat stone from this vantage point he could once more train his binoculars on the village and see all that transpired his timing was perfect no sooner had he found the garage and the silver mercedes than he saw a matchstick garrison get into the car and turn its nose towards the mountains soon the car would be lost to his sight as it climbed into the pass and then he would have to wait until it came round the contour of the mountain and onto the road directly below him close to where hed parked his gray jaguar brian lutnley charon qubwas timing was also perfect he had said one hour and the hour was up johnnie the voice was the merest whisper in fongs head is it safe oh yes charon the chinaman never failed to be awed by his masters telepathy good now be quiet let your mind dwell on whatever has occurred since we last spoke let me see it excellent and now let me see what is happening at this very momentright nowthrough your eyes fong put his binoculars to his eyes and found the mercedes where already it had climbed up along the winding road and into the foothills then he followed the road back where it ribboned along behind garrisons car finally focussing on the black saloon about a mile to the rear speed was dangerous down there fong could testify to that but the saloon was leaving a trail of dust billowing in the summer air the mercedes was moving much more slowly and it would not be long before the saloon caught up in a few more minutes the silver car passed out of sight shortly after that the saloon too where do they come back into view here charon fong trained his binoculars on the spot good i fancy this race is almost run we shall wait and see the road was steep round the mountain and through the pass very few cars were visible with empty miles between them it was almost twentyfive minutes before the mercedes came into view by which time the saloon should have psychosphere been hard up behind it but it was not it was all of five more minutes before the shinyblack hearselike car put in its appearance and by then garrisonkoenig had had all the time he needed where the road made a sharp bend round a jagged outcrop of rock hidden by the slategray mass and facing the road there the silver mercedes waited its motor running and garrisonkoenig at the wheel coming out of the pass and onto the straight the occupants of the saloon couldnt possibly see the merc until it was upon them but fong and gubwa saw it all fools the albinos mind cried out at the last moment they dont know what theyre dealing with the silver mercedes hit the saloon from the side sending it skidding clean off the narrow road and into the shallow gorge the black car fell bounced hit bottom and burst into flames in moments the car was a blazing inferno garrisonkoenig got out of the mercedes and stepped to the edge of the gorge he looked down then what gubwas mental cry was one of astonishment garrisonkoenig threw up his arms and staggered forward propelled by some invisible force he went flailing over the edge and out of sight and in that same instant the sharp crack of a rifle echoed up to an astounded johnnie fong brian lumley where he stood in the saddle between rounded peaks the chinaman traversed his binoculars right scanning the road found what he was looking for it was ramon de medici emerging from behind a cluster of boulders walking forward he carried a rifle for the first time in the koenigfacets life he had come up against someone whose capacity for bad thoughts was equal to his own as fong and qubwa watched de medici broke into a run a moment later he stood looking down over the edge of the gorge down there the fire still blazed medici was satisfied he turned away qubwa too had seen enough his mental voice rang in fongs head full of elation johnnie it is over stay here when that one leaves go down and take a quick lookbut touch nothing contact me later if you can and if theres anything you think i should know wait said fong look but gubwa was already looking de medici had left the edge and was now examining the mercedes after a moment he seemed satisfied opened the door and reached inside with something of an effort he dragged out the jimp black mass of garrisons dog said gubwa dead but of course she would be she too only lived by courtesy of garrison he was reminded of vicki maler now i must go you are a good and faithful man johnnie fong and you shall be the priest of the temple psychosphere thank you charon said fong aware of the others swift departure then carefully so as not to attract the attention of the man below he began to make his way down the steep side of the hill gubwa jerked alert where he sat before the suspended globe sir an urgent voice was repeating sir sir gubwa stood up drew breath swelled huge the guards voice now worried came once more over the intercom sir sir gubwa strode to the desk said bring them in the doors hissed open and stone and vicki were wheeled in stone was in tears sobbing uncontrollably the reason was vicki the faces of the guards were white drawn something had seemed to age them it was that same something which had aged vicki maler but in her case the effect would be far more permanent she sat in her wheelchair like a wrinkled old mummy her hair white and the yellow flesh loose on her bones senile she mumbled and coughed even as gubwa watched she pushed out her tongue and a blackened tooth fell out of her mouth on a thread of yellow spittle as stone continued to sob she lifted an ancient hand from straps which were too loose now to contain the withered flesh and clawed at her face contact lenses fell to the floor the eyes behind were fishwhite totally blind she mewled like a kitten beginning to drool the smell of age and infirmity wafted from her brian lumley to see is to believe mr stone said qubwa unmoved garrison is dead and she too is dyingbut it will get worse before the end soon she will begin to rot since you got on so well you two i would not deprive you of her company in these her final moments he looked at the guards take them back to their cell when they were gone he picked up his telephone and dialled sir harrys number chapter johmnie fohg got down the hillside without being seen as he had climbed down so ramon de medici had jacked up the front of the mercedes and had been at work with a crowbar forcing the frontright fender and wing back from the wheel mow he had the job finished and was climbing into the drivers seat a moment later the big engine roared into life fong stood in the pines peering out through their branches as de medici backed the big car away from the edge of the gorge and aimed it back along the road south a wheel went over the body of the dog fong saw blood gush from her jaws but as the car pulled away he saw more than that an arm came clawing up over the rim of the shallow gorge fong gasped his amazement jerked his bin brian lumley oculars to his eyes the distance was not great but he had to be sure the arm stretched itself through dust and pebbles its hand and fingers bloody and scrabbling the hand found a hold and drew up a shoulder a head and a face garrisons face pale as a sheet the red burn of a bullet scarring his temple into vivid contrast fong blinked his eyes quickly rubbed at the eyepieces of his binoculars and looked through them again the top half of garrisons body was now visible facedown and even as fong watched the man somehow managed to drag his trunk and lower limbs up from the gorge but it was garrisons face which chiefly interested fong that white face with its red blaze and its eyes something about those eyes mow garrison lifted hfs head and looked along the road at the cloud of dust which halfobscured the receding mercedes and again fong saw that phenomenon which had caused him to doubt his own eyesight that flickering golden glow like a stirring of strange energies flowing out from garrisons eyes garrison lifted an arm pointed after the car his lips formed silent words and for a single instant of time the golden glow suffused his whole face then a brighter glow intruded a white brilliance originating in the incandescent fireball which had been the mercedes even at this distance the flash burned fongs face he dropped his binoculars gasped his utter disbelief he had been with charon gubwa many years but never psychosphere in all those years had he seen anything like this then the blast hit him as a redblooming mushroom formed over the spot where the car had been the chinaman was snatched from his feet in a great fist of wind and tossed into the branches of suddenly whipping pines for long moments the hot wind blew like the breath of some fireelemental then died away as quickly as it had come echoes of the blast came rumbling down from the hills gradually receding and finally fong fell to the earth in a hail of pine needles and tangled broken branches beneath him where he lay halfstunned slowly the ground stopped trembling fong climbed shakily to his feet his jaguar lay on its back several pines had been snapped off close to the ground and lay pointing away from the scene of the blast the mushroom rose higher white and writhing like the cloud that forms above a nuclear explosion the cliff face was coming down in great slabs of rock filling the massive crater in the road automatically all of his senses numb fong found his binoculars and looped their strap round his neck but for the pines he might well have been whirled away and killed and now he understood something of his albino masters unusual caution where richard garrison was concerned the mans powers were fong shook his head gubwa was awesome but richard garrison was awful when garrisonkoenig had fallen after being shot at his unconscious body had thudded brian lumley down onto a stony ledge some nine or ten feet below the level of the road a small avalanche of dust and pebbles falling on him had hidden him from view from above and the ledge had protected him from the heat of the car blazing below he had only been out for a minute or two following which consciousness had slowly achingly returned another man might have taken hours to recovermight not have recovered at allbut there was that in garrison which drove him on it was that same drive which had brought him through all the trials of his dreamquest even the final trial of the burning desert for such had been his dreamof the furnace wastes of dragging psychomech inch by agonized inch behind him and of a desiccated dying suzywhen there had come that titan blast that stunning physical agony of a searing scarring bullet which had ripped koenigs mind from its ascendency into unconscious oblivion and roused garrisons mind up from nightmare and it was garrison who had come awake and clawed his way back to the road above the gorge not his alterfacets but richard garrison himself it was garrison now picking himself up to stumble raggedly over to where suzys crushed body lay sliding his hand under her faithful head life flickered in those black eyes of hers even now but its light was quickly dimming garrison cried cried burning tears from eyes already dim and robbed of most of their golden glow his anger had robbed himthat anger ex psychosphere pended in rending the psychosphere in that great blast of vengeanceand power must pay for the waste useless now to attempt suzys resurrection once it would have been the very simplest business but no longer what psychic power remained in him would not run to that not now even in the psyehosphere it was far easier to destroy than to create but he must do something garrison smiled through his tears as an idea dawned he and suzy were close closer than any other animal and master gone before them she was almost a part of him why not make her a part of him he prayed he still had the power the ability gently he entered her mind found a great love there and a great pain her tongue flopped loosely between bloodied jaws licking his hand suzy he said stop hurting good mow girl come into me come into me suzy her eyes looked at him and went dim her head lolled lifelessly back garrison struggled wearily to his feet the tears drying on his pale cheeks he had many miles to go and the day was growing older which way now he knew the answer instinctively with the instinct of a dog along the road for a mile or two then over the hill and and that way over there he smiled however wanly and began to plod slowly along the road and in the back of his mind something bounded and barked joyfully and he was not alone behind him the spot where the great black bitch brian lumley had lain was vacant now bright motes of dust spiralled and shone in the yellow sunlight fong followed at a safe distance keeping garrison in sight but barely so along the road and over the hills and for miles and miles across country rougher than any the chinaman had ever known before the man in front was weak and his pace had grown gradually slower but still he pressed forward and never once looked back fong found himself trailing footprints in boggy peat climbing steep inclines where shale slipped and slithered underfoot digging his heels in down almost precipitous slopes and trudging weary miles through valleys of drear boggy sedge but while garrison occasionally faltered always he recovered and went on he had to for he knew now that he approached quests end somewhere to the west lay the picturesque glen o dunkillie but not far ahead was the reality of his dream within a dream me had started his quest in the strange world of the subconscious but he would finish it hereor it would finish him for a moment panic struck at garrison night was coming on true but still it seemed darker to him or gloomier than the hour demanded he knew the answer but dared not even dwell upon it dared not admit of its existence and yet hed always known it his eyes would be the first to go garrison would dearly have loved to lie down and go to sleep a mental rather than a physical psychosphere weariness he suspected despite the miles behind him and the ravaged state of his body but the very thought was out of the question he was not tired could not allow himself to be tired too muchtoo manydepended upon him but cresting a shaly rise onto a fiat tableland suddenly he knew that he would have to face up to the worst not even the clouds of a gathering summer storm would explain the darkness creeping gradually across his vision the battery had almost run dry at that very moment fifty yards to his rear johnnie fong made up his mind to act independently of charon gubwa the albino wanted garrison dead fong knew that and he also knew that garrison could die almost had died very well this could not go on the man ahead was almost finished he staggered a silhouette against the gray troubled sky a perfect target fong lifted his pistol took careful aim and squeezed the trigger garrison must have tripped at that very moment his silhouette jerked out of sight simultaneously with the pistols report fong believed he had hit him but he held his breath waited halfexpected destruction in a whitehot fireball that would be all right nothing left of him to connect him with his beloved charon but nothing happened an unseasonal chill was in the air and the clouds were turning in the sky but that was all the chinaman began to breathe again waited two more minutes before climbing to the crest there was blood on the rocks where they brian lumley leaned out of shallow soil heather and lichen fresh wet blood as for garrison a shadow moved ahead stumbling over the tableland arms pumping incredibly he was running it was pm by stones reckoning when vicki suffered her relapse for an hour or two he had dared hope that but in stones scheme of things hope had rarely been seen to spring eternal he was a realist for himself he would take whatever chances came his way he certainly didnt intend to go out without a fight but vicki she was a woman with one hell of a handicap her lifeline had just snapped richard garrison was dead and vicki maler must soon follow him stone didnt know her not really but he felt he had known her better than most she had turned her heart out to him and he had listened and he had held her in his armsjust that nothing morebut they had shared now the thing lying on her bed wasnt vicki maler it had been her once more for an hour or two but wasnt it of old renown that people brighten before they die the flaringup of the candles flame before it flickers out well vickis flame had flared up the golden glow had not quite returned to her eyes but some color had come back into her face and her flesh had seemed to firm out a little she had even spoken a few words telling stone not to cry for her perceptive yes but he had also cried for himself cried his frustration his hatred how very badly he psychosphere wanted gubwa and how massive the odds against getting him talk of the devilor in gubwas case think of himfor at that moment the albinos face appeared at the barred window in the door ah mr stoneand so distressed you surprise me i had thought you harder his pink eyes went from stone seated in his chair to the bed where vicki malers bundle of living bones lay wrapped in her now voluminous clothing her chest rose and fell with a slow jerky shallow movement gubwa nodded smiled at stone she is fading you may see the end you may not it depends how quickly she dies you see you only have forty minutes when the nightshift comes on duty phillip stone goes off dutyfor good ive promised sir harry that your body will be in the thames in the morning and it will be stone stood up moved to the barred window his hands were huge white knots at his sides some god gubwa when youre obliged to keep your promises to scum like that bastard i shall do whatever is necessary mr stone to maintain a balance he shrugged until psychomech is mine after that do you really think i have enjoyed my relationship with sir harry of course not he shall be among the first to go stone forced a laugh a god with a hitlist he sneered you get funnier by the minute gubwa maintained his equanamity but you would agree he said slowly that gods do have the power of life and death mr stone why are brian lumley they given such power do you suppose if not to use it in your case stone answered i would say for the same reason a dog is given rabies and funny isnt itbut god reversed is dog how far is a rabid dog removed from christ gubwa well thats you in my eyesthe antichrist gubwa scowled he was tired of stone now but he could not leave without a parting shot i do not merely mouth words when i speak of life and death mr stone though i will admit that my meaning is occasionally obscureddeliberately but you see what garrison did i shall have the power to do one hundred times over and there is one particular thing that he did which quite intrigues me his smile was monstrous miss maler was quite beautiful the albino went on garrison chose her for his mate and i consider his taste impeccable so console yourself with this thought i shall be merciful with her she dies now but when next she wakes she shall sit upon the right hand of god flermaphro sapiens yesand she shall be the mother of the race the mother of my children what a goddess she shall make dont you agree mr stone why even jesus rose up only once you mad mad bastard stone hissed through clenched teeth but qubwa was already striding away down the corridor his booming laughter came echoing back garrison ran for an endless time he ran and ran he had lost a lot of blood was losing more even now but no longer cared psychosphere or gave it thought all sense of feeling was absent from his right shoulder where johnnie fongs bullet had passed through it and his eyesight was threequarters gone along with his physical strength but still he ran it was a race against time and he must run it to its end even knowing that only willpower kept him going and that even that was failing and somewhere back there a killer and garrison powerless to strike back he ran until the earth fell away beneath him and he crashed headlong down a steep slope the wall of the valley went down in dips and it was one of these in which he found himself when his head stopped spinning wearily he sat himself upright in sliding scree grit and coarse grass distant lightning flickered firing his sight in its splitsecond duration garrison gasped sucked on air prayed in answer the far lightning flickered again dim as his sight was he could not mistake the vast bulk of the dam rising on his right the dark mass of the solitary house where it squatted below and now he knew this was it the valley of his dream within a dream only one thing was missing and for a moment it stumped him then he remembered the dam was quiet its waters pent the merest trickle bubbling from six great vents in its face it would remain so until the official opening tomorrow but everything else was here and behind him up there the shadowy looming spires of marching pylons oh yes this was it and with that knowledge as the first stirring brian lumley of hope tightened his guts and heightened his awareness garrison also became aware of his pain his weakness blind instinct had driven him before the will to live to survive there had been no time no room for pain or exhaustion and there must be none now not when he was so close not with a killer on his trail somehow he struggled on and somehow after endless ages of pain and weariness he found himself at the foot of the path leading to the door of the lone house deserted the place looked gloomy as its surroundings as doomful as the great dam rising high above its roof had partly caved in most of the windows were broken and the chimney stack was crumbling these things garrison could still see but even seeing them his vision was blurring the silhouette of the house merging with the dark valley and the darker horizon of valleywall beyond fear drove him forward in a surge he had not believed he could muster he reached the door and found it locked sight was almost gone but he could not tell how much of that was due to the night the gathering storm he sobbed threw up his arms against the stout timbers of the door he leaned against it and felt the contours of metal letters pressed against his forehead the place had a name he traced the letters with his left hand the hand with feeling xana xanadu mo one was late gubwa hadnt programmed his soldiers to be late there were sixteen of them psychosphere double the normal requirement top ranker was gardner and he was in charge of the shift sixteen was the maximum the lift could take else gardner was sure there would have been even more of them something big was happening and the castles master was taking no chances the sixteen had arrived more or less individually but at the hour appointed they had come together as a body in the underground car park at the access door to the lift on their way here on foot or in the citys transport they had been articulate at their ease completely normal citizens but now they were a crowd of zombies that was in their program for now out of sight of the crowds surging in the streets above they rapidly reverted to the human machines gubwa had caused them to be and that was a condition which left them particularly vulnerable to sir harrys attack he had arrived all of an hour earlier him and six highlytrained operatives from the branchs special assignments group killers all they were utterly loyal to him he had enough on each of them to guarantee their loyalty now as gardner counted heads nodded and stepped up to the door keys jangling sir harry gave the agreed signal this was simply his voice yelling now and the beam of his torch swathing the unsuspecting sixteen where they bunched in gloomy concretecast shadows at the door his agents did the rest qubwas soldiers didnt know what hit them they were trained and conditioned for possible action in the castle not outside of it they went brian lumley down like thistles under a scythe as the branch men stepped out from cover and caught them in a withering short burst of intense fire for no more than five seconds the machineguns yammered their insane chattering drowning the echoes of sir harrys yell and bringing down rivulets of accumulated dust from the concrete ceiling then it was over and in the stunned silence sir harry stepped forward and took gardners keys from fingers that were still twitching moments later he was through the door his men dragging the bodies of the sixteen in after them somebody outside threw down sand on the blood and someone else swept it away into darkness then they were all through the door and sir harry locked it behind them he stepped forward and pressed the button for the lift far down below the empty cage jerked and began its slow climb upwards all unaware the men of the shift coming off duty were beginning to convene moving towards the foot of the shaft two of them had been assigned a special dutyone which concerned phillip stone garrison got in through a broken window in doing so he cut himself badly but he was far beyond caring about pain or loss of blood now indeed his neardelirium sprang from these sources so that even he did not know how close he was to death but still he hung on the darkness was his biggest immediate problem inside the house he felt literally buried in darkness his nearblindness adding to his confusion he found an open fireplace with crum psychosphere pled newspapers already lying in the grate brought out his cigarette lighter and struck flame the paper mercifully dry and crisp blazed up garrison fuelled the fire with pieces ripped from an old broken wicker chairand sobbed his relief that he could still see however dimly the leaping flames the fire warmed his chill flesh bringing comfort on the one hand and on the other a sure recognition of his condition the fact that the lifeforce within him was ebbing and yet there was something hereright here in xanadu which could yet save the day else all had been pointless but what was it stumbling about the room one of three rooms on the ground floor garrison flopped into a chair and allowed himself to sprawl for a moment across a heavy wooden table his hand came into contact with a table lamp naked wires dangling from its flex when the occupants whoever they had been left the house they had taken the plugs with them a pity he could have used a little extra light why not the thought spurred him on the odds were all against there being any electricity but he could at least try he halffell from the chair with the rotten flex in his hand found a socket in the skirtingboard shoved the naked wires in with fingers that shook so badly they seemed to vibrate then they did vibrate he was holding the bare cores even as the fact got through to his brain garrison was hurled across the roombut in that brian lumley same instant of contact things had happened marvellous things for one thing his sight had returned fully restored however briefly for another strength had seemed to flow however fieetingly in veins and muscles and bones hollow as empty vessels and finally finally garrison had remembered a dream that dream in which a monsterthe garrisonschroederkoenig monsterhad been galvanized into life on the bed of the ethereal machine like the frankenstein monster of youthful horror films the garrisoncreature had been brought alive by natures own raw energies by lightning by electricity now blind again he crawled back across the floor the moment of contact had been too brief had lasted for a single instant of time before his body reacted to the shock this time it must be longer it must be as long as it took weaker than ever he clawed his way across the floor blood still flowed freely from his fingers lacerated hand scalp perforated shoulder he used the cracked nails of his hands to strip the agebrittled plastic from copper wires wound them round his wrists held them in his hands found the socket and plugged the wires in first one and then the other and where he had jammed himself between the heavy table and the wall his body jerked and shook and flutteredall of his limbs writhing his hair standing out from his head his eyes bulgingas his fingers smoked and blackened and the wires glowed red in his hands psychosphere for five ten fifteen seconds he sucked energy from the socket he would have gone on continuing until something fused but that wasnt to be the vibration of his body increased in violence until driving the huge wooden table before him he flew once more across the room and the wires snapped ahbut now the battery was charged again not fully no not yet but quests end finally lay in sight and garrison knew what he must do he lifted his head from the naked floorboards and the entire room burned gold in the light from his eyes a light which would suffer no barriers a light which engulfed the entire house a light which once in a dream garrison had taken for the shining hemisphere of a stately pleasuredomeor the temple of the goddess of immortality at the foot of the garden path johnnie fong stopped dead in his tracks drew back finally fled as the wall of that golden dome seemed to advance upon him chapter the two soldiers detailed by gtlbwa to take care of stone arrived at his cell and opened the door inside the metal room vicki maleror the thing she was nowlay sleeping or dead completely hidden under a blanket stone had thrown over her the two men werent interested in her however but in him youngish men they were no longer dressed in their castle uniforms but in normal street clothes stone took them in at a glance smart and reasonably wellgroomed they would not look out of place as young executives in any of the citys firms or businesses it seemed somehow unreasonable that they should be trained killers working for a creature like charon qubwa it also seemed unreasonable that he would have to kill themwhich he would quite cheerfully if the opportunity presented itself psychosphere they ordered him out of the cell at gunpoint and into a wheelchair then as one of them held a pistol to his tempte the other prepared to strap him into the chair hurry it up said the one with the gun his tone urgent the cage will be down theyll be waiting for us the other looked up as if to answerbut at the precise moment there came the loud rattle of automatic gunfire and whine of ricocheting bullets interspersed with shouting and screams it was exactly the chance stone had been looking for what was going on he couldnt say but whatever it was he wanted to be part of it his two guards were momentarily startled stone didnt give them the least opportunity to recover his arms shot up like pistons and he got a twohanded grip on the wrist of the one with the gun deflecting it at the same time he came to his feet like a coiled spring his head smashing into the face of the man crouching over him to complete the job on that one and without releasing his grip on the gunhand of the other he lashed out with a kick that pulverized the mans groin the one with the gun had meanwhile started yelling and driving his free fist repeatedly into the side of stones head stone ignored the sticky pulpy feel of a torn ear and brought his knee up and the soldiers wrist down in one sharp movement the wrist snapped across his knee the man screamed the gun flew across the corridor and bounced off the wall before it could clatter to the floor stone brian lumley had whirled his agonized victim in a halfcircle crashing him headlong into the steel wall in the next moment the pistol was in stones hand and he fell into a crouch as a pair of combatsuited woollenhelmeted men armed to the teeth came round a far corner they could have been from mis or could be more of gubwas soldiers he had no way of knowinguntil they began to sprint towards him their weapons spitting fire after that it didnt matter who they were stone snapped off a shot and saw one man stopped in his tracks spinning like a top as he fell the other slowed down a little then came on at a charge stone took cover behind the wheelchair took careful aim fired as the chair was torn from his grasp by a spray of bullets so stone saw the muzzle of the machinegun floating towards his face floating yes in a sort of slow motion but the gun was in freefall its owner already sailing past with a neat red and black hole between his staring dead eyes then things speeded up stone snatched the machinegun from midair pocketed the pistol stepped to the dead mans body and glanced at him hed seen him before he was sure sir harrys branch just like that treacherous lousy wonderful bastard stone snatched a magazine of ammunition from the mans belt a couple of grenades turned to the door of what had been his cell and shot the lock off he went to snatch vicki maler from her bed and was surprised at her weight throwing back the blanket he saw her and his jaw dropped she psychosphere had firmed out again she wasnt quite the youthful beautiful girl he had briefly known but she wasnt a hag either he thought to try and waken her changed his mind and simply wrapped her in the blanket then she went over his shoulder in a firemans lift and a moment later he was back out in the corridor things were still chaotic in the castle but in the main sir harrys crowd had taken qubwa by surprise grenades detonated somewhere as the invaders commenced a methodical destruction of the place and there were still occasional bursts of fire and screams of agony and death having no idea yet where he was going stone simply ran with vicki bouncing on his shoulder somewhere someone was shouting i want qubwa the big fat albino i want him dead i want all of these freaks dead wreck the place as you go but make sure you get every last one of them stone recognized sir harrys voice a long time since that pig had seen active service qubwa must have angered him mightily he reached a righthand bend in the corridor at the same time as a member of qubwas harem came staggering round it the transsexuals face was covered with blood which dripped from his chin his heavy womans breasts were scarlet with it he carried no weapon dont shoot he cried in a falsetto voice dont shoot but he was already crumpling to his knees collapsing facedown on the floors rubber coating more gunfire and screams from close at hand brian lumley stone took a deep breath threw himself round the corner with his machinegun spurting lead a combatsuited man took off in midair along the corridor as stones bullets chewed into him he had been standing guard over a lift cage bodies littered the area all of them dressed for the street qubwas men about to go off duty stone felt nothing for them he yanked the cages latticed doors open stepped through themand as he did so heard the hiss of a door opening behind him he whirled and across the corridor stood qubwa the albino saw stone saw his gun and he skidded to a halt in the middle of the corridor his hair was wild his pink eyes wide in stone snapped now before change my mind yes yes im coming please dont shoot mr stone shoot kill you you have to be joking if i shoot you wholl explain all this and believe me youve got some explaining to do and while youre doing it im going to sit there and grin and im going to be able to tell them the right questions to ask the cage was a big one qubwa got as far away as he could from the muzzle of stones machinegun his arms were in the air trembling uncontrollably his entire frame wobbled like jelly the button mr stone he babbled please press it we have to get out of herenow stone became suspiciously aware of the others urgency it was understandable of course but he hovered his finger over the lifts button his psychosphere shoulder supporting vicki what have you done qubwa press it for gods sake the hermaphrodite gibbered his hands fluttering the castle is mined ive set the detonation sequence in motion for gods sake eh said stone mockinglybut he pressed the button as the cage jerked and started upward a tremendous explosion blew the debris of bodies along the corridor beyond the latticed doors then they were out of it but beneath their feet they could still feel the concussions of further explosions as the thunders receded so gubwa began to relax his hands starting to fall towards his sides keep em up fat thing stone snarled he took two paces forward stuck his gun in gubwas belly shoving hard through the towelling of the albinos robe also you can close your eyesclose em and keep em closed and let me tell you now i only have to feel the tiniest tickle of an alien thought in my head just one and a second later youre going to weigh at least a pound heavier and ill love it through all of this a speaker in the ceiling had been droning gubwas recorded hypnotic orders accompaniment to the pulsing of a blue strobe light stone however had not been conditioned to receive such orders his lips twisted into a mirthless grin as he stepped back from the albino lifted up the snout of his gun and fired off a burst at the speaker and strobe there he said as qubwas recorded voice squawked into silence and the light went out brian lumley leaving them in neardarkness once more he prodded qubwas belly with the smoking muzzle of the machinegun that writes finis on that shit and that only leaves you mister it only leaves you and if youve any sense at all youll just stand perfectly still and do absolutely nothing garrison had lain quite still for some minutes but while his ravaged body had rested his mind had been intensely active first he had stilled the incredible pain in his limbs trunk and head which had required the merest effort of will a simple command that the pain would stop then he had soaked up the essence of the house the valley outside the dam and surrounding countryside over which a freakish summer storm was about to break in unprecedented fury in doing soin this systematic mental examination of his whereaboutshe had once more triggered memories of his prophetic dreams stripping them of their mysticism until all that remained of them was the fact that they had been prophetic through them he had seen the future a future inalienable and unchangeable as the past the past was gone but the future as any future began here and now and however obscurely the way into that future had been delineated garrison was powerful now but not nearly powerful enough to go that way not yet but how close the analogy had been when he had likened himself to a battery leaking its power and how easy and how terrible the solu psychosphere tion he had dreamed of a great machine and knew now that this valley this place was that machine as for its power sourcegarrison reached out his mind to the dam and explored its mechanisms johnnie fong sat onethird of the way up the wall of the valley and stared at the golden glow of the dome it had stopped growing stood taller than the pines enclosed what had been the entire garden of the house fong didnt know if it had substance and he wasnt ready to find out but it was must be a manifestation of garrison about that the chinaman had no doubt if only charon would contact him now perhaps the albino would be able to tell him how to deal with things always his beloved charon had the answers to such fong jerked to his feet the first warm raindrops were beginning to fall and the clouds were boiling madly overhead but even the moaning of the wind could not drown out the new sound the sudden rapidly increasing roar of power unleashed fongs eyes went to the face of the dam took in the spectacles of the six silvery trickles that ran down its concrete face erupting into gigantic spouts and his ears heard the thunder of waters in chaos he backed away turned and scrambled higher not looking back until he no longer dared ignore what was happening behind and below him full fifteen minutes that climb and fongs limbs trembling with his exertion when finally he did stop and turn but now he knew brian lumley why he had fled that it had been instinct which drove him up from the house and away from the dam instinct and fear mot fear of the rushing waters no for already his elevation had been such that they could not possibly reach him fear of the power which had caused those waters to rush the gigantic unstoppable power whose heart throbbed at the center of the golden dome throbbed yes for the dome was unstable now it pulsed with an irregular expansion and contraction like some vast alien beacon it struggled with itself or within itself like molten lava in a volcanos cone tossed by the turmoil below and finallyit broke a figureupright manlike golden glowing like some sort of anthropomorphic fragment of the dome itselfcame through its wall and stood for a moment on the night wind then rose up the slope of the valley directly towards the chinaman where he trembled and gasped ho part of that figure of golden fire touched the slope itself utterly suspended on air it levitated itself a full two feet above the whipping grass and stunted shrubs and as it passed close by fong the truth of its nature which of course he had known made itself apparent namely that this was richard garrison but shrunken dried out almost desiccated it was garrison but devoid of life or life as fong understood it garrison and yet less than garrison and yet greater far greater he lifted his pistol as the figure passed fired off shot after shot and knew that he struck the psychosphere target each time but the figure made no pause showed no interest paid no heed at all and when fongs weapon was empty then it fell from his nerveless fingers and still the mummied figure of garrison sailed on its eyes blazing its skin a mass of golden wrinkles its arms blackened stumps whose frayed threads hung in sticky tatters just below the elbows and behind it down in the valley the agonized fluctuations of the psychic plasma about the deserted house came to an abrupt end the glow blinked out and in the next moment the house went down in dust and ruin and the frenzied spume of the flood that rushed and roared down the old bed of the river then like an automaton almost without knowing that his hands and feet bore him up johnnie fong clawed his way to the crest of the valley wall following the floating figure of garrison as a moth follows a bright light he had to know had to seeeven if it blasted him but even before reaching the crest fong could hear the humming of the heavyduty cables where they draped their loops between the pylons they were drawing off power from the dam power which garrison required and as fong crawled exhaustedly up those last few yards of slope and emerged above the valley so he became witness to the most awesome scene of all it was garrison a living cross of golden fire the blackened stumps of his arms outstretched floating in air between and beneath two of the pylons and it was garrison who a moment later received the tribute of the pylonsa brian lumley massive crackling bolt that smashed down was sucked down from blazing cables enveloping him and hurling him down to the ground nor did it stop there the smell of ozone filled the air and of burning flesh as that lashing living weirdly snarling and snapping pulse of raw energy spent itself in garrison who now impossibly stood up and held himself erect welcoming the very fires that consumed him and as if the storm itself knew garrisons bizarre thirst it added its own energies to that awesome fearsome funeral pyre sending down bolt after bolt from the madly wheeling clouds each bolt absorbed at once into the crumbling skeleton thing which was garrison witless tingling himself glowing with the excess energies that filled the air and plucked at the hair of his face and head johnnie fong kneeled with jaws agape and rain streaming from his chin the very elements seemed crazed now and the undersides of the clouds were awash with st elmos fire as the bolts continued to rain down and all of his raw power focussing upon garrison or what had been garrisonand his megamind thirsting for more still more stillmore energy to power the ultimate questmore physical fuel for the psychic fire the megamind reached out sought discovered more than one hundred miles away at dounreay the pile went crazy rods of uranium which would have lighted entire cities for weeks were consumed in seconds and nothing to show for it throughout the length and breadth of psychosphere scotland lights dimmed as the power was drawn off a magnificent aurora filled the skies a shaft of fire split the heavens and lanced down down down to garrison removing every last physical vestige of him from the world of men removing too johnnie fong but while the physical garrison was dead the mental garrison was newborn and borne up to penetrate to become one with the psychosphere as the lift slowed to an almost imperceptible halt charon gubwa tensed himself in fact stone had done him a great favor by ordering him to keep his hypnotic eyes closed despite the apparent failure of so many of his plans still there was the chance that he might yet achieve a final victory with the castle destroyedwhich by now it surely was beyond recovery by plastic explosives and flre bombs which would have turned the entire interior to a raging inferno gubwa also would be thought to have perished if or when the matter was looked into but there were other places ready and waiting to receive him and a car in the underground car park to take him to one of them there would always be men he could buy or bend to his will and psychomech would still become a reality moreover gubwa knew something that stone didnt know namely that one last bomb remained located at the bottom of the liftshaft and that its detonation would be triggered when the cages doors were opened up here which brian lumley was why the albino had ignored stones warning not to mindread an idle threat at best for qubwa was a master of covert telepathy another telepath might have sensed him but he had been in stones mind for all of five minutes without the slightest fear of detection and he was still there when the lift cage slowed to a halt and stone yanked the doors open with his great arms held rigidly over his head and with stones gun in his back qubwa was the first out of the lifta split second before the bomb went off down below and its blast channelled up the shaft shook the cage like a terrier shakes a rat with his mind taking off at a tangent and vicki maler in her blanket still balanced on his shoulder stone stumbled and went to one knee before he could recover qubwas right arm came down at lightning speed and his great gray hand clamped like a vice on the stock of the machinegun wrenching it from stones grasp demented but triumphant in his madness the albino laughed as he turned the gun on stone and ordered him out of the cage it would appear mr stone he said that even a god can err i said you were intelligent but even an idiot would have killed me when he had the chance he made a motion with the gun put her down he ordered indicating an empty space amongst the stiffening bodies of his former soldiers put her there with the rest of these corpses then we shall play a little game you and shall close my eyes and stand quite still and you shall prepare yourself then when you are ready you shall attempt to take psychosphere the gun back from meor perhaps to take that pistol from your pocket and shoot me qubwa you blackhearted bastard i of course you cant win qubwa cut him off because i shall know your move even as you make it but surely its worth a try and to make the game more interesting well limit its duration to fifteen seconds after which i really must be on my way in a hurry eh qubwa stone ground the words out oh yes indeed the psychosphere is astir mr stone it prepares to welcome a new messiah i feel its excitement its psychic concentration it beckons and i must go he very deliberately closed his eyes and began to count one two three four in the matterless flux of the psychosphere three entities conversed well said garrison and are you satisfied im not sure thomas schroeder answered it is i suppose equality of sorts not quite what i had in mind you could hardly be my equal while you were part of me said garrison and so i have expelled you yes and willy too how about you willy are you satisfied koenigs answer contained a shrug i think he said therefore i ami think and he laughed ill get used to it but what does one do schroeder asked when one is unbodied allpowerful and immortal brian lumley you do what you want to do garrison answered do you want to go back to that blob of mud that spawned us so go make yourself a bodymake yourself mortal you can do it you can do almost anything you can imagine youre right of course said schroeder so why dont we we garrison chuckled you maybe but not me can always do that later if i get bored but i doubt it bored koenig queried let me show you something garrison answered he showed them the allor rather he showed them something of it to show them all of the all would take forever you see he said unbodied allpowerful and immortal you may well be but never omniscient how can you ever know all of space which goes inwards and outwards forever or all of time which goes infinitely back and inexorably forward look again and they saw a sight whose beauty would be unbearable blinding blasting to mortal men a sight which in a dream only garrison had ever seen before them that cosmic mote earth he laughed oh no if theres a place i would be its out there who would drink the waters of earth when he can drink the wine of the universe the ultimate quest my friendsand the ultimate destiny make up your minds for suzy and i cant wait your battery ran dry once schroeder cautioned remember psychosphere again garrison laughed a ripple in the psychosphere and who could thirst for energy in a great sea of suns for a millimoment schroeder was silent very well he finally conceded let the ayes have it and aye they all three cried in unison then soberly one moment said garrison first there are several wrongs to right he let the psychosphere wash over and through him making small adjustments in its matterless structure and there he finally said eleven twelve thirteen said qubwa his eyes tightly shut his smile a nightmare stone was reaching for his pistol and the albino knew it oh vicki moaned where she lay throwing back her blanket as she came awake fourteen cried qubwa his eyes popping open as he turned to stare at her then bugging in his leprousgray face his jaw fell open as the girl sat up young beautiful greeneyedfully alive qubwas face screwed up in an agony of terror someone else was inside his head with him a terrible someone garrison he screamed the machinegun turned white hot in his hands melting even as he dropped it from blistering fingers foaming at the mouth his pink eyes seeming to stand out almost from his head the albino floated free of the floor he flew forward towards the steel doors which opened before him he passed through them out of sight his last scream echoing back to stone and vicki brian lumley where they hugged each other in that subterranean room of the dead qarrison and up the spiralling concrete ramps went charon qubwa doors crashing open at his approach and barriers lifting up and out into the night up and over the city up up and ever up his rate of ascent accelerating his dressing gown leaping into flames along with his haironly to be extinguished a moment later in airless space where his frictioncindered shellpopped open like a fried grape and then because garrison had named him for an abhorrence the psychosphere simply erased all trace of him several things were erased changed rebuilt for garrison had been both right and wrong about time time is infinite yesbut nothing is impossible in infinity joseph maestro and his gangsters were no more had never been likewise the less savory members of a certain branch of the secret service they had never existed oh and several other things several millions of things and when they were done the earth became a better place to live phillip and vicki stone certainly thought so though they could not remember it ever having been different she looked out of the window of their sussex home into the starry night sky and found a name psychosphere on her lips richard she sighedwhich was strange because she did not know had never known a richard what her wealthy loving husband looked up from his book did you say something darling but already she had forgotten i thought i saw a shooting star she answered feeling foolish then make a wish he smiled she stepped to his chair leaned over and kissed him i believe i already have she said epilogue one month later james christopher craig tossed and turned in his sleep the weird dream was back bothering his subconscious mind as always the dream about a man he had never knowna man called richard garrisonand about an impossible insane machine a dream overshadowed by a commanding voice the voice of a man dead now thirty days whose every vestige had been erased with the sole exception of this one psychic echo a voice like the voice of some strange sinister god demanding that craig rememberand that he build the machine of his dream craigs agitation increased the dream was not frightening in itself the source of his torment lay deep deep down in forgotten recesses of his psyche it lay in the darkest vaults of his psychosphere subconscious mind which should remain forever lockedvaults which now at the posthypnotic insistence of a dead man were slowly but surely reopening their doors to him and at last craig stood before the final door the sanctum sanctorum the room of innermost secrets and even as he stood there so the massive doors swung silently open within craig saw a machine the machine he saw itand he knew its name jimmy his wife marion shook him awake are you all right what is it are you dreaming again craig sat up in bed brushed cold sweat from his brow trembled as he stared about the shadowy room the luminous hand of his watch told him it was am the night was a cool silent blanket all about the house and the dream receding fading crawling back down and disappearing in deepest caverns of mind you were shouting something marion told him drawing him back down into the bed beside her one word over and over again was i he sleepily mumbled his mouth furry and tasting foul what was it do you remember she told him what it had sounded like then snuggled close and hugged him he lay in the darkness of their room thinking about it he thought about it a long time before he finally went back to sleep a strange word that and yet it seemed to ring certain bells and drifting back into sleep jimmy craig shuddered ominous cracked discordant bells brian lumley were ringing in the back of his mind they tolled a knell of horror and madness a strange strange word a word to haunt him forever a word to haunt the whole wide world psychomech
