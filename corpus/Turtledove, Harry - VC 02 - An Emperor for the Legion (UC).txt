what has gone before a scouting column of three cohorts of roman legionaries led by military tribune marcus aemilius scaurus and senior centurion gaius philippus was returning to julius caesars main army when they were ambushed by gauls to prevent mass slaughter the gallic commander viridovix offered single combat and marcus accepted both men bore druids swords that of marcus being battle spoil when the blades crossed a dome of light sprang up around them suddenly the romans and viridovix were in an unfamiliar world with strange stars they soon discovered they were in the wartorn empire of videssos a land where priests of the god phos could work real magic they were hired as a mercenary unit by the empire and spent the winter in the provincial town of imbros learning the language and customs when spring came they marched to videssos the city cap ital of the empire there marcus met the soldieremperor ma vrikios gavras his brother thorisin and the prime minister vardanes sphrantzes a bureaucrat whose enmity marcus in curred at a banquet in the romans honor marcus met mav rikios daughter alypia and accidentally spilled wine on the wizard avshar envoy of yezd videssos western enemy av shar demanded a duel when the wizard tried to cheat with sorcery marcus druid sword neutralized the spell and marcus won avshar tried for revenge with an enchanted dagger in the hands of a nomad under his spell the videssian priest nepos was horrified at the use of evil magic avshar forfeited the protection granted envoys marcus was sent to arrest avshar accompanied by hemond and a squad of namdaleni mercenaries from the island nation of namdalen but avshar had fled leaving a sorcerous trap that killed hemond marcus was given hemonds sword to take to his widow helvis avshars offenses served as justification for videssos to declare war on yezd which had been raiding deep into the western part of the empire troops native and mercenary flooded into the capital as videssos prepared for war tension rose between videssians and the growing number of namdaleni because of differences in their worship of phos to the reli giously liberal romans the differences were minor but each side considered the other heretics the videssian patriarch bal samon preached a sermon of toleration which eased the tension for the moment but fanatic videssian monks stirred up trouble again riot ing broke out and marcus was sent with a force of romans to help quell it going into a dark courtyard to break up a rape he discovered that the intended victim was helvis caught up in the moment they made love and after the riots subsided she and her son joined him in the romans barracks other romans had already found partners at last the unwieldy army moved west against yezd ac companiedby women and dependents marcus was pleased to learn helvis was pregnant but shocked to discover ortaias sphrantzes commanded the armys left wing he was only slightly mollified on finding the young man was a figurehead hostage for vardanes sphrantzes good behavior more troops joined the army in the westlands including those of baanes onomagoulos and gagik bagratouni a noble driven from his home in mountainous vaspurakan by yezda two other vaspurakaners senpat sviodo and his wife nevrat were acting as guides for the romans all vaspurakaners were hated as heretics by a local priest zemarkhos zemarkhos cursed bagratouni who threw him and his dog into a sack then beat the sack fearing a pogrom marcus interceded for him the yezda began hitandrun raids against the imperial army as it moved closer to yezd then an advance force of ono magoulos troops was pinned down near the town ofmaragha leaving the armys dependents behind at khiiat the emperor moved forward to rescue them in a great battle avshar commanded the yezda by sorcery he slew the officer who truly commanded the imperial armys left wing ortaias sphrantzes suddenly thrust into real com mand panicked and fled the whole wing collapsed the battle till then nearly a draw turned to disaster mavrikios fell fighting and thori desperate counterattack from the right failed though h manage to escape with a fair part of the army roman discipline let the legionaries hold their ranks withdrew in good order and encamped for the night to midnight avshar taunted them by throwing mavrikios into their camp as gaius philippus commented the wi should have pursued the forces of thorisin instead the game was not over yet the romans trek east from the disastrous battle field where the emperor of videssos lost his life was a jour ney full of torment the season was late summer the land through which they marched sere and burning hot mirages shimmered ahead treacherously promising lakes where a mud puddle would have been a prodigy bands of yezda invaders dogged the fugitives tracks skirmishing occasionally and always alert to pick off stragglers scaurus still carried mavrikios gavras severed head the only sure proof the emperor was dead foreseeing chaos in videssos after mavrikios fall he thought it wise to forestall pretenders who might claim the imperial name to aid their climbs to power it would not be the first time videssos had known such things sorry i am i wasna there when that black spalpeen avshar flung you himselfs noddle viridovix said to the tribune his latin musically flavored by his native celtic speech i had a fine yezda one to throw back at him true to the fierce cus tom of his folk the gaul had taken a slain enemys head for a trophy at any other time marcus would have found that revolting in defeats bitter aftermath he nodded and said i wish youd been there too aye it would have given the whoreson something to think on gaius philippus chimed in the senior centurion usually enjoyed quarreling with viridovix but their hatred for the wizardprince of yezd brought them together now marcus rubbed his chin felt rough whiskers scratch under an emperor for the legion his fingers like most of the romans he had stayed clean faced in a bearded land but lately there had been little time for shaving he plucked a whisker it shone golden in the sunlight coming as he did from mediolanum in northern italy he had a large proportion of northern blood in his veins in caesars army in gaul he had been teased about looking like a celt himself the videssians often took him for a ha loga many of those warriors forsook their chilly home for mercenary service in the empire gorgidas worked ceaselessly with the wounded changing dressings splinting broken bones and dispensing the few ointments and medicines left in his depleted store although hurt himself the slim dark greek doctor disregarded his pain to bring others relief covered by a screening force of light cavalry from vi dessos eastern neighbor khatrish the legionaries tramped east toward the town of khiiat as fast as their many injuries would allow had he led a force in the lands rome ruled scaurus would have moved northwest instead to join thorisin gavras and the right wing of the shattered imperial army hard military sense lay there for the emperors brother no the emperor now marcus supposed had brought his troops away in good order the fight against the yezda would center on him but here marcus was not simply a legionary officer with a legionary officers worries he was also a mercenary captain he had to deal with the fact that the legionaries women the families they had made or joined since coming to videssos were left behind in the vaspurakaner city that had been the base for mavrikios illfated campaign the romans would disobey any order to turn away from khiiat so even more would the hundreds of stragglers who had attached themselves to his troop like drowning men clinging to a spar for that matter he never thought of giving such an order his own partner helvis carrying his child had stayed in khiiat along with her young son from an earlier attachment that was to say he hoped she had stayed in khiiat uncer tainty tormented the legionaries as badly as the yezda did for all scaurus knew the invaders might have stormed khiiat and slain or carried into slavery everyone there even if they had not fugitives would already be arriving with word of the ca tastrophe that had overtaken the videssian army harry turtledove in the wake of such news noncombatants might be fleeing eastward now that was more dangerous than staying behind khiiats walls marcus ran through the gloomy possibilities time after time helvis dead helvis captured by the yezda helvis struggling east with a threeyearold through hostile country and she was pregnant too at last with a distinct effort of will he banished the qualms to the back of his mind not for the first time he was grateful for his training in the stoic school which taught him to cast aside useless imaginings he would know soon enough and that would be the time to act about a day and a half out of khiiat a scout came riding back to the roman tribune a horseman coming out of the east sir he reported his staccato khatrisher accent made him hard for scaurus to understand the tribunes own vi dessian was far from perfect interest flared in him when he realized what the scout was saying from the east a lone rider the khatrisher spread his hands as far as we could tell he was nervous and took cover as soon as he spotted us from what little we saw he had the seeming of a vaspurakaner no wonder he was leery of you then you look too much like yezda the invading nomads had ravaged vaspurakan over the course of years until the natives hated the sight of them the khatrishers were descended from nomads as well and despite taking many videssian ways still had the look of the plains about them bring him in and unhurt marcus decided anyone fool enough to travel west in the face of everything rolling the other way must have a strong reason maybe he bears word from khiiat the tribune added suddenly hopeful in spite of himself the scout gave a cheery wave the khatrishers were most of them free spirits and kicked his pony into motion scaurus did not expect him back for some time for someone in the furs and leather of a plainsman convincing a vaspura kaner of his harmlessness would not be easy the tribune was surprised when the khatrisher quickly reappeared along with another rider plainly not of his people the scouts companion looked familiar even at a distance before the tribune was able to say more than that senpat an emperor for the legion sviodo cried out in joy and spurred his horse forward to meet the newcomer nevrat the vaspurakaner yelled are you out of your mind to journey alone through this wolves land his wife parted company from her escort to embrace him the khatrisher stared slackjawed in her loose traveling clothes her curly black hair bound up under a threepeaked vaspurakaner hat of leather and with the grime of travel on her only her beardless cheeks hinted at her sex she was surely armed like a man a horsemans saber hung at her belt and she carried a bow with an arrow nocked and ready she and senpat were chattering in their throaty native tongue as they slowly rode back to the marching legionaries the khatrisher followed still shaking his head your outrider has a head on his shoulders she said switching to videssian as she neared scaurus i took him and his comrades for yezda for all their shouts of friends coun trymen but when he said romans i knew he was no western jackal im glad you chose to trust him marcus answered he was fond of the intense swarthy girl so were many other romans scattered cheers rang out as the men realized who she was she smiled her pleasure teeth flashing white senpat sviodo proud of her exploit and glad beyond measure she had joined him safely was grinning too the question senpat had shouted moments before was still burning in the tribunes mind in the name of your god phos nevrat why did you leave khiiat a horrid thought forced its way forward has it fallen it still stood yesterday morning when i set out she an swered the romans close enough to hear her cheered again this time with the same relief scaurus felt she tempered their delight by continuing theres worse madness inside those walls though than any ive seen out here gaius philippus nodded as if hearing what he expected they panicked did they when news came wed been beaten the veteran sounded resigned he had seen enough victories and defeats that the aftermaths of both were second nature to him the romans crowded round nevrat calling out the names of their women and asking if they were all right she told them as i said i left early yesterday when last i saw them ham turtledove they were well most of you have sensible girls too i think theyll have wit enough to keep from joining the flight theres flight then scaurus asked with a sinking feel ing nevrat understood his fears and was quick to lay them to rest helvis knows war marcus she told me to tell you shed stay in khiiat till the first yezda came over the wall the tribune nodded his thanks not trusting himself to speak he felt suddenly taller as if a burden had been lifted from his shoulders helvis he knew had no such reassurance that he lived there were messages from khiiat for some of the other romans as well is quintus glabrio here the junior centu rion was almost at nevrats side but as usual quiet nearly to the point of invisibility he took a step forward nevrat laughed in surprise im sorry your lady damaris also told me she would wait for you in the city and much else besides im sure he said with a smile the romans who knew damaris laughed at that the hottem pered videssian girl was able to talk for herself and glabrio both minucius nevrat continued in her businesslike way erene says you should know shes stopped throwing up shes beginning to bulge a bit too ah thats fine to hear the burly legionary replied after less than a week without a razor his beard was coming in thick and black nevrat turned back to marcus for a moment amusement in her brown eyes helvis has no such message for you my friend im afraid shes green as a leek much of the time is she well he asked anxiously yes shes fine theres nothing at all to worry about you men are such babies about these things she was so full of comforting reassuring words from khiiat that someone finally called out if alls so well back there why are they fleeing the city alls not well she said flatly remember the messages i bring are from the folk with the wit to stay and the heart to think id find you and theyd see you again all too many are of the other sort theyve been scurrying like rabbits ever since ortaias sphrantzes came galloping into the city with word all was lost an emperor for the legion curses and angry shouts greeted the young nobles name command of the videssian armys left wing had been his and his terrorstriken flight turned an orderly retreat into rout nevrat nodded at the romans outburst she might not have seen ortaias flee the battlefield but she had been in khiiat she said contemptuously he stayed just long enough to change horses the one hed ridden died next day of misuse poor thing and then he was flying east again good rid dance if anyone cares what i think and right you are lass gaius philippus nodded a pro fessional soldier to the roots of his irongray hair he asked on your way hither what did you see of the yezda aye and of our fellows in the bargain too many yezda theyre thicker further east but theres no order to them at all theyre like frogs after flies striking at anything that moves the only thing that brought them to gether was the imperial army now theyve crushed it and theyre breaking up again looking for new land to push into and all videssos this side of the cattlecrossing lies open to them marcus thought of videssos western lands laid waste by the nomads the rich peaceful fields put to the torch cities so long at peace they had no walls now the playthings of invad ing barbarians smoking altars heaped high with butchered victims for yezds dark god skotos searching for any straw to contradict that horrid picture he repeated the second half of gaius philippus question what of the empires troops most are as badly beaten as ortaias i watched three yezda chasing a whole squad of horsemen laughing them selves sick as they rode one broke off to follow me but i lost him in rocky ground nevrat dismissed two hours of tenor in a sentence she went on i did see whats left of the namdalener regi ment still in good order most of a days ride ahead of you the nomads were giving them a wide berth that would be the way of it viridovix agreed tough as nails they are the romans concurred in that judgment the warriors from the island duchy of namdalen were here tics in videssos eyes and as ambitious for themselves as any other mercenary soldiers but they fought so well the empire was glad to hire them harry turtledove did you see anything of thorisin gavras scaurus asked again he thought of linking with thorisins forces the sevastokrator no nor heard anything either is it true the emperors dead ortaias claimed he was its true marcus did not elaborate and did not mention his grisly proof of mavrikios passing gorgidas caught something the tribune missed the physi cian said how could sphrantzes know he was long fled when the emperor fell the romans growled as they took in the implications of that perhaps he wished it true so badly he never thought to doubt it quintus glabrio suggested men often believe what they most want it was like glabrio to put as charitable a light as possible on the young nobles action marcus who had been active in politics in his native mediolanum found another more omi nous interpretation ortaias sphrantzes was of a house which had held the imperium itself his uncle the sevastos or prime minister vardanes sphrantzes was mavrikios chief rival gaius philippus broke into scaurus chain of thought he demanded have we chattered long enough the sooner were to khiiat the sooner we can do something more than beating our gums over all this give a body a bit of a blow will you now viridovix said wiping his sweaty sunburned forehead with the back of his hand youre after forgetting not everyones like that sleepless bronze giant i once heard a greek tell of he looked questioningly at gorgidas who gave him the name talos thats it the celt agreed happily he was excitable en ergetic in short bursts of strength wellnigh unmatchable but the senior centurion indeed many romans surpassed him in endurance despite viridovix groans marcus decided gaius phi lippus was right progress was too slow to suit him anyway there were many walking wounded and others who had to be carried in litters if khiiat still stood the romans had to get there as fast as they could before the yezda mounted an as sault to overwhelm its feeble and no doubt demoralized garri son that thought led to another one last question before we an emperor for the legion march he said to nevrat is there any word of avshar for he was sure the wizardprince was trying to organize the un ruly nomads he led to deliver just that attack but she shook her head none at all no more than of thorisin curious is it not she herself had seen war and skirmished against the yezda when they first conquered vas purakan she had no trouble following the tribunes logic by nightfall the romans and their various comrades were less than a day from khiiat granted a respite by the yezda the legionaries erected their usual fortified camp the protec tion had served them well more times than marcus could re call men bustled about the campsite intent on creating ditch breastwork and palisade eightman leather tents went up in neat rows inside the romans showed the videssians and others who had joined them what needed to be done and stood over them to make sure they did it at gaius philippus profane urging order was beginning to emerge again in the legionary ranks now the newcomers instead of marching where they would filled the holes fallen romans had left in the maniples scaurus approved the first step in making legionaries of them just what i thought gaius philippus nodded some will run away but give us time to work on the rest and theyll amount to something being with good troops rubs off senpat sviodo came up to marcus an ironic glint in his eye i trust you will not object if my wife spends the evening inside our works he bowed low as if in supplication scaurus flushed when the videssian army was intact he had followed roman practice in excluding women from his soldiers quarters as a result senpat and nevrat preferring each others company to legionary discipline always pitched their tent just outside the roman camp now though of course the tribune said after we reach khiiat shell have plenty of company he refused to say or even to think if we reach khiiat good senpat said he studied the tribune you can loosen up a bit after all then id wondered i suppose i can marcus sighed and the regret in his voice was so plain he and sviodo both had to laugh so its to be our women with us wherever we go is it the tribune thought one more step along the way from legionary officer harry turtledove to head of a mercenary company he laughed at himself again this time silently in the empire of videssos captain of mer cenaries was all hed ever be and high time he got used to the notion the yezda were thick as fleas round khiiat the last days march to the city was a running fight but khiiat itself to scaurus surprise was not under siege nor was any real effort made to keep the romans from entering it as nevrat had remarked in victory the nomads forgot the leaders who had won it for them that was fortunate for khiiat could not have repelled a serious attack marcus had expected its walls to be bristling with spears but only a handful of men were on them to his shock the gates were open why not gaius philippus said scornfully theres so many running the yezda would be trampled if they tried to get in a graybrown dust cloud lay over everything eastward the telltale banner of an army of fugitives inside panic still boiled plump sutlers calculating men who could smell a copper through a wall of dung threw their goods at anyone who would take them so they could flee unencumbered singly and in small groups soldiers wandered through the citys twisting streets and alleyways calling the names of friends and lovers and hoping against hope they would be answered more pitiful yet were the women who crowded close by khiiats western gate some kept a vigil doomed to heart break awaiting warriors who would come to them no more others had already despaired of that and stood bejeweled and gowned offering themselves to any man who might get them safely away the khatrishers were first into khiiat most of them were without women here as they had taken service with videssos for the one campaign alone and thus left wives and sweet hearts behind in their forested homeland the tribune passed through the squat gray arch of stone and under the ironspiked portcullis which warded the citys west ern gate he looked up through the murderholes and shook his head where were the archers to spit death at any invader who tried to force an entrance where the tubs of bubbling oil and molten lead to warm the foes reception likely he an emperor for the legion thought bitterly the officer in charge of such things fled and no one has thought of them since then any concern over matters military was swept from him for helvis was holding him tightly heedless of the pinch of his armor laughing and crying at the same time marcus oh marcus she said covering his bristly face with kisses for her too the agony of suspense was over other women were crying out with joy and rushing forward to embrace their men three comely lasses all made for viri dovix then halted in dismay and dawning hostility as they realized their common goal id sooner face the yezda than a mess like that gaius philippus declared but viridovix met the challenge without flinching with fine impartiality the big gaul had kisses hugs and fair words for all the blithe charm that had won each girl separately now rewon them all together its bloody uncanny the senior centurion muttered en viously his own luck with women was poor for the most part because he took no interest in them beyond serving his lusts the romans the romans starting at the western gate the cry spread through khiiat almost before the last legionary was in the city their dependents flocked to them and many were the joyful meetings but many too were the women who learned some gently from comrades others by the sim ple brutal fact of a loved ones absence that for mem there would be no reunions there were romans as well who looked in vain for loved faces in the excited crowd and hung their heads sorrow sharpened by their companions delight wheres makic marcus asked helvis he had to shout to make himself understood with erene i watched her two girls yesterday while she kept vigil here at the gates i should go to her to let her know youve come he would not let her out of their embrace the whole city must know that by now he said bide a moment with me he was startled to realize how much for granted he had come to take her beauty in the short time they had been together seeing her afresh after separation and danger was almost like looking at her for the first time hers were not the sculptured aquiline good looks to which videssian women aspired helvis was a daughter of namda len snubnosed and rather widefeatured but her eyes were harry turtledove deepest blue her smiling mouth ample and generous her fig ure a shout of gladness it was too soon for pregnancy to mark her body but me promise of new life glowed from her face the tribune kissed her slowly and thoroughly then he turned to gaius philippus with orders keep the single men here while those of us with partners find them the gods willing and bring them back give us hmm he gauged the westering sun two hours then tell off a hundred or so good reliable men and rout out anyone fool enough to think hed sooner go it alone aye sir the grim promise on the centurions face was enough to make any wouldbe deserter think twice gaius philippus suggested we could do worse than using some khatrishers in our patrols too theres a thought marcus nodded pakhymer he called and the commander of the horsemen from khatrish guided his small shaggy horse into earshot scaurus ex plained with he wanted he phrased it as request the kha trishers were equals voluntary companions in misfortune not troops formally subject to his will laon pakhymer absently scratched his cheek as he consid ered like all his countrymen he was bearded he wore his own whiskers full and bushy the better to cover pockmarks at last he said ill do it if all patrols are joint ones if one of your troopers gets rowdy and we have to crack him over the head i want some of your men around to see it was needful its easier never to have a feud than to stop one once started not for the first time scaurus admired pakhymers cool good sense in shabby leather trousers and sweatstained fox skin cap he looked the simple nomad a role many kha trishers affected but the folk of that land had learned considerable subtlety since their khamorth ancestors swept down off the plains of pardraya to wrest the province from videssos eight hundred years ago they were like fine wine in cheap jugs with quality easy to overlook at a hasty drinking the tribune ordered the buccinators to trumpet attention the legionaries stiffened into immobility marcus gave them his commands adding at the end some of you may think you can steal away and never be caught well belike youre right but remember whats outside and reckon up how long youre likely to enjoy your escape a thoughtful silence ensued gaius philippus broke it with an emperor for the legion a bellowed dismissed partnered men scattered through the city their bachelor comrades stood at ease to await their return some moved toward the women clustered at the gates intent on changing their status permanently or for a little while gaius philippus cocked an interrogative eyebrow at scaurus the tribune shrugged let his troops find what solace they could minucius he said come on with helvis and me erene is looking after malric it seems the legionary grinned ill do that sir with three little ones running around im sure of my welcome seeing mes bound to be a relief marcus chuckled then translated for helvis among them selves he and his men mostly spoke latin and she had only a few words of it she rolled her eyes you dont know how right you are she said to minucius oh but i do my lady he answered switching to vides sian for her the little farm i grew up on i was the oldest of eight not counting two who died young and i still dont know when my mother slept even in the most troubled times some things in khiiat did not change as helvis marcus and minucius walked through the towns marketplace they had to kick their way through the pigeons blackbirds and sparrows that congregated in cheep ing chirping hordes round the grain merchants stalls the birds were confident of their handouts and just as sure no one meant them any harm theyll learn soon enough minucius said sidestepping to avoid a pigeon which refused to make way for him come a siege therell be a lot of bird pies the first day or two after that theyll know their welcomes gone and you wont get within fifty feet of one on the ground beggars still lined the edge of the market place though it seemed most of the ablebodied vagabonds had vanished for safer climes in an expansive mood minucius dug into his pouch for some money to toss to a thin whitebearded old man with only one leg who lounged in front of an open tavern door youd give him gold marcus asked in surprise seeing the trooper produce a small coin instead of one of the broad bronze pieces videssos minted thats what theyd like you to think anyway its that harry turtledove penpusher strobilos money and its not worth a bloody thing ortaias sphrantzes greatuncle strobilos had been av tokrator until mavrikios gavras ousted him four years before his coinage was cheapened even beyond the lows set by pre vious bureaucratic emperors the goldpiece on which his pudgy features were stamped was more than half copper minucius flipped the coin to the beggar who plucked it out of the air debased or no it was a finer gift than he usually got he dipped his head and thanked the roman in halting vaspurakanerflavored videssian that completed he popped the coin into his mouth and dragged himself into the grog shop i hope the old boy has himself one fine spree minucius said he doesnt look like theres many left in him scaurus gave the legionary an odd look minucius had always struck him as sharing gaius philippus singleminded devotion to the army without the senior centurions years of experience to give a sense of proportion such a thoughtful remark was not like him if youre as eager to see erene as she is to see you helvis said to minucius with a smile it will be a happy meeting indeed she hardly talks about anything but you minucius thickbearded italian peasants face lit up in a grin that lightened his hard features really he said sounding shy and amazed as a fifteenyearold these past few months ive thought myself the luckiest man alive and he was off praising erene the rest of the way to the small house she and helvis shared listening to him as they walked along marcus had no trouble deciding where his unexpected streak of compassion came from here was a man unabashedly in love in a way the tribune was a trifle jealous helvis was a splendid bed mate a fine companion and no ones fool but he could not find the flood of emotion in him that minucius was releasing he was happy aye but not heartfull well he told himself youll never see thirty again and its not likely minucius has twentytwo winters in him but am i older he asked himself or merely colder he was honest enough to admit he did not know helvis wore the key to her lodging on a string round her neck she drew it up from between her breasts inserted it into its socket and drew out the boltpin the door opened inward an emperor for the legion malric shot out crying mama mama and reaching up to seize his mother round the waist hello papa he added as she lifted him and tossed him up in the air hello lad marcus said taking him from helvis did you bring me a yezdas head papa malric said remembering what hed asked of scaurus before the imperial army left khiiat youll have to ask viridovix about that the tribune told him minucius barked laughter theres a warrior in the mak ing he said his voice brought a delighted cry of recognition from in side the house erene a stocky little videssian girl who barely reached his shoulder came running through the door and al most bowled him over with her welcoming embrace easy darling easy he said holding her out at arms length if i squeeze you as tight as i want id pop the baby out right now he stroked her cheek with a swordcallused hand are you all right erene asked anxiously you werent hurt no hardly even a scratch you see what happened was marcus gave a dry cough im afraid all this will have to wait erene round up your girls and pack whatever you can carry without being slowed i want to be out of this town p before sunset minucius looked at him reproachfully but was too much a soldier to argue he expected a protest from erene but all she said was ive been ready to leave for two days this one she squeezed minucius arm knows how to travel light and ive done my best to learn from him and i helvis said when scaurus turned his head toward her ive been with you long enough to know your craze for lugging everything around on your mens backs what you have against supply wagons and packhorses ill never under stand her own folks warriors fought mounted and were far more at home with horses than the unchivalric romans the more independent an army is of anything outside it self the better it does the yezda show that only too well now though we really could use extra beasts and cars what harry turtledove with all the noncombatants well have along will khiiat sup ply any do you think erene shook her head helvis explained further yesterday it would have but last night utprand brought his regiment through and emptied the horsepens of what animals were left he headed south at dawn this morning likely marcus thought the namdalener captain was lead ing his troops to phanaskert to join his fellow easterners who were serving as a garrison in that city from his own point of view that was a logical move best to link all the men of the duchy together utprand probably did not care or even no tice that his march out of the path of the oncoming yezda helped open videssos to invasion mercenaries tended to think of themselves before their paymasters as do i the tribune realized as do i his musing made him miss helvis next sentence im sorry i said that i suppose well be going in the same direction what no of course not the words were out of his mouth before he remembered her brother soteric was part of the garrison at phanaskert helvis full lips thinned her eyes narrowed dangerously why from all ive heard utprands men and yours fought the yezda to a standstill even after others fled the normal contempt mercenary kin felt foi the folk they were hired to defend was only made worse because videssians and namda leni saw each other as heretics helvis went on phanaskert is a stout city stronger than khiiat surely behind its walls you could laugh at the scrawny nomads capering by the tribune swallowed a sigh of relief he wanted no part of going to phanaskert and helvis unwittingly provided him with a perfect military justification for not doing so he also did not want to quarrel with her she was strongwilled her temper once aroused was fierce and in any case he had no time to argue he said city walls are less protection against nomads than you think they bum the fields outside kill the peasants who work them and starve the town into yielding think he urged her youve seen its true in the empire and here in vaspurakan may they rot for it the yezda are no better bar gain in a siege than in the open field she bit her lip wanting to disagree further but seeing an emperor for the legion scaurus mind was made up very well she said at last her smile was wry i wont argue with you over soldierly matters whether im right or not it would do me no good marcus was content to let it go at that while what he had said was true he knew it was far from the whole truth great events would be brewing in videssos in the aftermath of mavrikios defeat and death he did not intend to be stranded in a provincial town on the edge of nowhere while they took place without him in his own way he was as ambitious as all the other mercenary captains reckoning their chances of riding chaos wind to glory but with only his few precious legion aries behind him his hopes unlike theirs had to center on the imperial government none of that calculation showed on his face he mused how much easier it would have been to remain one of caesars junior officers with clearly defined duties and with someone else to do his thinking for him he shrugged inside his mail shirt the stoic doctrine hed studied in italy taught a man to make the best of what he had and not wish for the impossible a good creed for a quiet man if youre ready he said to helvis and erene wed best head back sure and im baked to a wee black cinder viridovix said as he tramped along in fact he was not black but red as any halfcooked meat his fair celtic skin burned under the fero cious vaspurakaner sun but refused to tan gorgidas smeared various smelly ointments on him they sloughed away with each new layer of peeling hide the gaul swore as a drop of sweat drew a stinging track down his face i have a riddle for the lot of you he called why is even the silly seagull wiser than i i could think of a dozen reasons without trying gaius philippus said not about to let such an opening slip by tell us yours viridovix glared but gave the answer he had prepared because it has the sense never to visit vaspurakan the romans draggled and sunbaked themselves chuck led in agreement senpat sviodo though took offense to hear his native land maligned he said loftily ill have you know this is the first land phos shaped when he made the world and the home of our ancestor vaspur the first man harry turtledove some of the videssians who had joined the romans hooted the vaspurakaners might call themselves phos princes but no people outside the princes land took their theology seriously viridovix cared nothing for theology of any sort his ob jections were more immediate tilting his head back so he could look down his long nose at the mounted senpat he said about your being kin to the first man ill not speak one way or tother of that sort of thing i ken nought but i do believe this land your phos first creation for one look about would tell anybody the puir fool needed more practice the legionaries whooped to see sviodo speechless the im perials and khatrishers too laughed louder yet at virido vix delicious blasphemy youve only yourself to blame for the egg on your face gaius philippus told the young vaspur akaner not unkindly anyone with a tongue fast enough to keep three lovelies and keep them all happy with him is more than a match for a puppy like you i suppose so senpat murmured but who would have thought he could talk with it too sunburned as he was viridovix could go no redder but his strangled snort said the vaspurakaner had a measure of revenge the romans and their comrades pushed east from khiiat in an order reminiscent of any threatened herd as always the khatrishers served as scouts and outriders screening the main body and warning of trouble ahead or to either side at their center marched a hollow square of legionaries old bulls pro tecting the women children and wounded within the forces good order and obvious readiness to stand and fight kept it from danger a company of about three hundred yezda paralleled the romans course for more than a day like so many wolves waiting to pick off the stragglers from a herd of wisent at last they concluded there was no hope of catch ing their quarry unaware and rode away in search of easier prey at nightfall now marcus could hardly protest women in side his camp helvis shared his tent and he was glad of it nonetheless the principle of the thing still galled him when senpat sviodo began teasing him once more the only answer he got was a stare cold enough to end any further raillery before it could start acquiescent scaurus might be but not enthusiastic an emperor for the legion late in the fourth morning out from khiiat a khatrisher scout came riding up from the south flipping marcus the usual offhand salute he reported theres something funny going on up in the hills sounds pretty much like fighting but not quite i didnt take a close look its better country for foot than horse the grade is steep and theres all kinds of loose rocks show me the tribune said he followed the khatrishers pointing finger sure enough he saw a small dust cloud and below it occasional sparks of light as the sun flashed off a blade even allowing that the action was a couple of miles away it did not seem very big still if it was videssian stragglers or vaspurakaners meet ing the vanguard of a major yezda force that was something the romans had to know scaurus turned to gaius philippus detail me eight men with a good sensible underofficer to find out what the skirmish means eight men it is sir the centurion nodded quickly choosing a tentful of legionaries and for the partys leader he said id suggest on impulse marcus cut him off never mind ill take them myself gaius philippus face froze except for one unruly eyebrow that climbed toward his hairline in mute expression of the scandalized feelings he was too well drilled to speak out loud but scaurus ears were sharper than most as he turned to take the reconnaissance squad away he heard the senior centu rion grumbling to himself fool amateurs always think they have to lead from the front leadership as it happened had played almost no re in the tribunes sudden decision curiosity was a much bigger part of it a curiosity piqued by the khatrishers odd descrip tion of what he had heard pretty much like fighting but not quite that deserved a closer look double march he told his men and hurried south his long legs chewing up the distance though the legionaries were shorter and stockier they kept pace at double march almost a trot really there was scant breath for chatter the two miles vanished in a silence broken only by hard breathing the slap of sandals on dirt and the occasional clank of scab bards slapping off ironstudded military kilts the land began sloping up from the valley floor loose harry turtledove rocks and gravel made the going hard marcus stumbled and had to put his hands out to save a fall to the rear one of his men cursed as the same thing happened to him he realized the khatrisher had been right in his reluctance to take his mount up the slope pour legs might be quicker than two but in this terrain two were far more agile he was close enough now to hear the noise the scout had reported though a jumble of boulders ahead still hid its source the khatrisher had been right at first it sounded like any bit of sharp fighting heard from outside but as the romans drew nearer they began cocking their heads and look ing at one another in puzzlement steel on steel did not sound quite like this nor did the shouts the combatants raised where was the noise of booted feet stamping and leaping and what was me source of the high almost inaudible keening that took its place marcus drew his gallic longsword its weight was com forting in his palm behind him he heard his mens stubby gladii rasp free of their brass scabbards the romans pushed past the last obstructions and up onto a stretch of ground flat ter than that through which they had been struggling on the little plain a dozen and a half yezda urged on by a hardfaced man in robes the color of dried blood hewed and chopped at a double handful of videssians clustered protec tively around a plump shavepated fellow whose dusty gar ment might once have been sky blue nepos scaurus shouted recognizing the rotund little priest of phos nepos head whipped round at the cry the struggle going no better than most at odds of nearly two to one promptly grew more desperate yet the circle round the priest tighter neither the videssian soldiers nor their foes appeared to notice the romans arrival at them marcus shouted if the yezda chose to be fools it was none of his concern the redrobe who led them smiled thinly as the legionaries charged his men did not divert a minim of their attention from the enemy at hand not even when the romans were upon them and the legionaries shouted in amazement and dread for their swords drove through the yezda as if through smoke and their bodies met no resistance from the solidseeming foe the videssian soldiers for all their bellowed war cries for an emperor for the legion harp turtledove all the ringing of their blades against those of the yezda were as insubstantial as the wraiths they fought marcus brain stopped its brief terrorized yammering nepos was mage as well as priest and the tribune knew yezda sorcerers wore redbrown by choice his men had stumbled across a wizards duel and nepos opponent was no weakling not if he could force the fat priest to the defensive then scaurus sword lashed across one of the phantom yezda warriors the marks set into the blade flared golden as it sheared through the sorcery like a doused candle flame the soldiers seeming ceased to be another vanished to a second stroke then another and another the yezda wizards smile disappeared with them as their foes blew out nepos projections swung to the attack and it was his enemys turn to draw his powers around himself for defense but marcus blade enchanted by van ished gauls druids had shown itself proof against the spells of avshar himself an underlings magic was no match for it the tribune pushed forward remorselessly striking the yezdas wraithly warriors out of existence even when the last of them was gone the redrobe proved neither coward nor weakling his spells were still potent enough to hold off nepos assault no phantom videssian sword reached him though they missed now by hairbreadths growling an oath in his own harsh tongue he snatched out a dagger and leaped forward to grapple with scaurus that was a contest with but one possible ending despite the yezdas courage the roman turned the wizards stab with his shield thrust out and up with the killing stroke of the legionaries his blade bit flesh not the filmy figments that had so far stood against him blood ran from the yezdas mouth to drown his dying curse halfuttered nepos seemings vanished when their creators foe fell the little videssian priest staggered himself a man in the last throes of exhaustion sweat was pouring from his shaven crown drops sparkled in his beard he came up to clasp the tribunes arm praise phos who sends the light for sending you to me in my desperate need the priests voice was a ragged croaking caricature of his usual firm tenor he looked down at the crumpled form of the dead yezda wizard murmuring he would have killed me i think had you not come when you did how did you get into a sorcerers duel marcus asked we were dodging each other through these rocks i saw he had a knife and wanted to frighten him off with phantoms but he fought back and he was strong nepos shook his head and yet he seemed but a shaman like a thousand others while i i am a mage of the videssian academy can it be true then is his dark skotos a mightier god than mine is my lifes work one long futility scaurus thumped his shoulder nepos was normally a jolly soul but liable to fits of gloom when things went bad the tribune said buck up he and all his kind are riding the hem of avshars robe one win and they think they bestride the world he studied the draggled priest and you my friend are not at your best thats so nepos admitted he scrubbed at the sweat streaked dirt on his face with a grimy sleeve and shook his head in dismay it was as if he was looking at himself for the first time in days he managed a feeble smile im not in fine fettle am i hardly marcus said i cant promise you any elegant accommodations with my men but they do beat straggling home alone nepos smile grew broader i should certainly hope so he sighed then turned to the legionaries i suppose that means ill have to tramp back with you longshanked gentle men the romans grinned at him they were all taller and leaner than the tubby little priest he did his valiant best to keep pace with them his short legs churning over the ground not bad one of the soldiers commended him as they approached the roman column the troopers smile turned sly theres plenty of videssians with us already maybe well find you a coat of mail and a pack and make a real legionary out of you phos forfend nepos panted rolling his eyes or we could just lay you down and roll you along an other roman suggested the look the priest sent marcus was so full of indignant appeal that the tribune coughed and put an end to his troopers fun gaius philippus had been pulling out a full maniple of sol diers to come to scaurus rescue he waved when he saw the squad coming back down into the valley as soon as they were in earshot he bellowed everything all right an emperor for the legion marcus answered with the upraised thumb of the gladiato rial arena the senior centurion gave back the signal and re turned the maniple to the ranks despite gaius philippus mutterings over amateurs and personal leadership scaurus saw no signs that anyone but the centurion was going to take that maniple forward a spare figure in chlamys and sandals loped out from the roman column toward the returning squad gorgidas ignored marcus as for the legionaries they might as well not have been there the greek doctors attention was solely on nepos do you know your peoples healing art he demanded he leaned forward as if willing an aye out of the priest why yes a bit but gorgidas allowed no protest he and nepos had had many soulsearching talks but the intense greek would not spare time for them now he clutched the priests shoulder and dragged him toward the litters of the seriously wounded say ing the gods know ive been praying for days to run across a bluerobe with his wits about him ive had to watch men die beyond the power of my medicine to cure but you lads now he stopped short and shook his head a rational man compelled to acknowledge the power of forces past reason curious romans marcus among them followed the oddly matched pair he had seen a healerpriest save sextus minu cius and another legionary just after the romans came to vi dessos but miracles he thought did not go stale with repetition nepos was still protesting his unworthiness as gorgidas tugged him onward his expostulations faded when he came face to face with the horrid facts of injury the worsthurt soldiers were already dead either of their wounds or from the sketchy care and jolting they had received during the romans grinding retreat many who still clung to life would not for long shock infection and fever coupled with scant water and constant baking sun made death almost an hourly visitor the stench of septic wounds turned the stomach even through the aro matic ointments gorgidas had applied men witless from fever shivered in the noonday heat or babbled anguished gibberish here was wars aftermath at its grimmest in the face of such misery nepos underwent a transforma tion nearly as great as the one gorgidas hoped he would work harry turtledove on the wounded the rotund priests fatigue fell from him when he drew himself upright he seemed inches taller show me the worst of them he said to gorgidas and sud denly it was his voice not the greek doctors that was filled with authority if gorgidas noticed the reversal it did not faze him he was content to play a secondary role should that be required to save his patients the worst he said rubbing his chin with a slimfingered hand that would be publius flaccus i think over this way if you will publius flaccus was beyond thrashing and delirium only the low rapid rise and fall of his chest showed he was still alive he lay unmoving on his litter the coarse stubble of his beard stark and black against tightdrawn waxen skin a yezda saber had laid his left thigh open from groin to knee somehow gorgidas managed to stanch the flow of blood but the wound grew inflamed almost at once and from mere in flammation quickly passed to mortifications horror greenishyellow pus crusted the bandages wrapping the gashed limb drawn by the smell of corruption flies made a darting cloud around flaccus they scattered buzzing as nepos stooped to examine the wounded roman the priests face was grave as he said to gorgidas i will do what i can unbandage him for me please there must be contact between his flesh and mine gorgidas knelt beside nepos deftly undoing the dressings he had applied the day before battlehardened soldiers gagged and drew back as the huge gash was bared its stench was more than most men could stand but neither priest nor physician flinched from it now i understand the philoktetes gorgidas said to him self nepos looked at him without comprehension for the doctor had fallen back into greek unaware that he had spo ken at all gorgidas did not explain marcus also realized the truth in sophokles play no mat ter how vital a man was with this foul a wound his presence could become intolerable enough to force his comrades to abandon him the thought flickered and blew out for nepos was leaning forward to take publius haccus thigh in his hands the priests eyes were closed he gripped the mangled leg so tightly his knuckles whitened had flaccus been conscious an emperor for the legion he would have shrieked in agony as it was he did not stir fresh pus welled up over the swollen lips of the wound to foul i nepos hands the priest ignored it his spirit and will focused on the injury alone back at imbros a year before gorgidas had spoken of a flow of healing from priest to patient the words were vague but scaurus had found none better then nor did he now the short hairs on the nape of his neck tried to rise for he could feel the current passing between nepos and flaccus though not with any sense he could name to aid his concentration nepos whispered an endless series of prayers the videssian dialect he used was so archaic scaurus only caught a word now and again even the name of the priests god shifted the divine patron of good was phos in the modem tongue but sounded more like phaos in nepos elder idiom at first marcus wondered if it was his hopeful imagination but soon he had no doubt the evilsmelling pus was disap pearing from the filthy gash its swollen inflamed lips visibly shrinking will you look there a roman muttered awe in his voice other legionaries called on gods they had known longer than phos nepos paid no attention everything around him might have vanished in a clap of thunder and he would have crouched oblivious before the still form of publius flaccus the wounded legionary moaned and stirred his eyes flut tering open for the first time in two days they were sunk deep in their sockets but had reason in them gorgidas slipped a steadying arm behind flaccus shoulder and offered him a canteen the roman drank thirstily thank you he whispered when nothing else had his words penetrated nepos shell of concentration the priest relaxed his clenched grip on flaccus thigh like the legionary he too seemed to become aware of his surroundings once more he reached out to take one of flaccus hands in his own phos be praised he said for allowing me to act as his instrument in saving this man marcus and the rest of the romans looked with marvel at the wonder nepos had wrought the rotting stinking wound which had been about to kill publius flaccus was suddenly clean free of corruption and showing every sign of being able to heal normally and flaccus himself the killing fever harry turtledove banished from his system was trying to sit and trading gibes with the soldiers crowding near him only the flyswarming pile of pussoaked bandages gave any evidence of what had just happened his face alight gorgidas came around flaccus to help nepos up you must teach me your art he said anything i have is yours the priest was wobbly on his feet fatigue was flooding back into him nonetheless he smiled wanly saying speak not of payment i will show you if i can if the talent lies within you phos servants ask nothing but that it be wisely used thank you gorgidas said softly as grateful for the boon nepos offered as flaccus had been for the simpler gift of water then the physician grew brisk once more but for now there is only the one of you and many more men who need your help cotilius rufus i think is next worst off his utter is over here he tugged nepos through the crowd round flaccus the priest took three or four steps before his eyes rolled up in his head and he slid gently to the ground gorgidas stared in consternation then bent over his prostrate form he peeled back an eyelid felt for nepos pulse hes asleep the phy sician said indignantly marcus laid a hand on his shoulder weve seen that this healing of theirs takes as much from the healer as it puts into the sufferer and nepos had been drawing heavily on his powers before you grabbed him let the poor fellow rest oh very well gorgidas conceded with poor grace he is a man after all not a scalpel or a stick of collyrium to grind up for eyewash i suppose it wouldnt do to kill off my chief healing tool from overwork but hed better wake up soon and the physician settled himself beside the softly snoring nepos to wait soli when the romans and their companions reached it a few days later had already had a visit from the yezda the ruins of the wallless new town by the bank of the rhamnos river had been sacked yet again probably for the dozenth time in the twoscore or so years since yezds nomads began pushing into videssos little gray eddies of smoke still spi an emperor for the legion raled into the air though scaums was hardpressed to under stand what the invaders had found to bum on the bluff overlooking the river the partially rebuilt old soli had survived behind its walls cries of alarm and trumpet blasts came echoing from those walls when lookouts spied the approaching force marcus had trouble convincing the watch men his troops were friendly the more so as the yezda had driven videssian prisoners ahead of them to masquerade as an imperial army when the towns stout gates swung open at last its hypas teos or city governor came out through them to greet the romans he was a tall thin maa of about forty with stooped shoulders and a permanently dyspeptic expression the tri bune had not seen him on the armys westward march but remembered he was called evghenios kananos kananos studied the newcomers with wary curiosity as if still unsure they were not yezda in disguise youre the first decentsized bunch of our troops ive seen was starting to think there werent none left he said to marcus he had an upcountry twang that matched his dour mien some regiments did get free the tribune answered we kananos kept right on as if scaurus had not spoken ayuh he said i dont believe ive seen hardly a one but for the miserable little band that rode in with the emperor yesterday on his way to pityos he was and then by sea to the capital i suppose marcus stared at the hypasteos his mouth falling open everyone close enough to hear stood similarly frozen in his tracks the emperor it was zeprin the red who asked the question elbowing his way up through the roman ranks the burly haloga had been one of the commanders of mavrikios imperial guard and his failure to save his overlord had plunged the onceebullient northerner so deep into depression that he marched along day after day with hardly a word sud denly his face and voice were alive again the emperor he repeated eagerly thats what i said kananos agreed he used his words sparingly it seemed to pain him to have to go back over ground once covered to the point as always gaius philippus demanded how could thorisin gavras have come through here without us harry turtledove getting word he was close and id hardly call the troops he had with him a miserable little band he got clear in orettv fair order thorisin gavras evghenios kananos stared at the centu rion in surprise and a little suspicion didnt say a word about thonsm gavras i was talking about the emperor the emperor ortaias par as i know there aint no other your honor youre a rare stubborn man viridovtx told scaurus the day after kananos shattering news but you can march the legs off the lot of us and well still never catch up to that omadhaun of a sphrantzes weary and frustrated the tribune halted his outrage over ortaias gall in assuming the imperial title had made him fling his small army north to drag the usurper to earth but virido vix was right when looked at rationally and not through the red haze of anger the romans had no chance to overtake him sphrantzes was mounted had no women and wounded to en cumber him and had a days lead moreover the further north scaurus led his men the more yezda they met and the more hostile the nomads were the legionaries clearly saw the futility of pursuit roman discipline kept them pushing toward pityos but their hearts were not in it they were harder to get moving after every halt and slower on the march and only the fear that leaving would be worse kept the men they had added since maragha with them everyone despised ortaias sphrantzes but they all knew they could not catch him laon pakhymer sensed this stop was different from the ones before he rode back to marcus asking finally had enough his voice held sympathy he had no more use than the romans for sphrantzes but also a certain hardness warning that he too was running out of patience with this useless hunt marcus looked from him to the gaul then as a last hope to gaius philippus whose contempt for the wouldbe emperor harry turtledove knew no bounds are you asking what i think the senior centurion said marcus nodded all right then theres not a prayer of catching up with the worthless son of a sow in your heart you must know that as well as i do i suppose so the tribune sighed but if thats what you think why didnt you say so when we set out roman disci pline or no scaurus rarely had doubts about gaius philippus opinion simple enough whether or not we nailed sphrantzes i thought pityos a good place to head for if ortaias could sail back to videssos the city so could we and save ourselves having to fight across the westlands but from the look of things there are too bloody many yezda between us and the port to let us get there unmangled i fear youre right i wish we knew how thorisin stands so do i or if he stands too many yezda westward though to swing back and find out i know marcus clenched his fist now more than ever he wished for any word of the slain emperors brother but the choice he was forced to only made getting that word more unlikely we have to turn east away from them they had spoken latin when the tribune saw pakhymers blank look he quickly translated his decision into videssian sensible the khatrisher said he cocked his head at the romans in a gesture his people often used do any of you know where youre headed east covers a lot of ground and youre not from these parts you know in spite of his gloom marcus had to smile at me understatement gaius philippus said the yezda cant have run everyone off the land theres bound to be a soul or two willing to show us the way if for no better reason than to keep us out ofhis own valley laon pakhymer chuckled and spread his hands in defeat there you have me wouldnt want this ragtag mob of ruf fians camped near me any longer than i could help it the senior centurion grunted he might have been pleased at gaining the khatrishers agreement but hardly by his un flattering description of the legionaries an emperor for the legion the shrill sound of a squabble woke marcus before dawn the next morning he cursed wearily as he sat up in his bed roll still worn from the previous days march through broken country beside him helvis sighed and turned over fighting to stay asleep malric who never seemed to sleep when the tri bune and helvis wanted him to did not stir now scaurus stuck his head through his tent flap he was just in time to see quintus glabrios companion damaris stamp from the junior centurions tent she was still shouting abuse as she angrily stode away the most useless man i can imagine what i saw in you ill never know she disappeared out of the tribunes line of vision in fact scaurus was more inclined to wonder what had attracted the roman to her true she was striking enough in the strongfeatured videssian way with snapping brown eyes but she was skinny as a boy and had all the temper those eyes foretold she was the tribune realized as hotheaded as thori sins lady komitta rhangawe and that was saying a great deal nor did glabrio have thorisins quick answering con tentiousness it was a puzzler glabrio rather in the way of a man who pokes his head out the door to see if a thunderstorm is past looked out to see which way damaris had gone he caught sight of marcus shrugged ruefully and withdrew into his tent once more em barrassed at witnessing his discomfiture the tribune did the same damaris last outburst had succeeded in rousing helvis though malric slept on brushing sleepsnarled brown hair back from her face she yawned sat up and said im glad we dont fight like that hemond she stopped in confu sion marcus grunted his lip quirking in a lopsided smile he knew he should not be bothered when helvis absently called him by her dead husbands name but he could not help the twinge that ran through him every time she slipped you might as well wake the boy he said the whole camp will be stirring now the effort to keep annoyance from his voice took all emotion with it leaving his words flat and hard as a marble slab the unsuccessful try at hiding anger was worse than none at all helvis did as he asked her but her face was a mask that harry turtledove did as little to hide her hurt as had his coldly dispassionate tone looks like a fine morning already just a fine one the tribune thought as he laced on his armor he threw himself into his duties to take his mind off the almostquarrel his supervision of breaking camp was so mi nute one might have supposed his troops were doing it for the first time rather then the threehundredth or for some the threethousandth he heard quintus glabrio swearing at the men in his maniple something rare from that quiet officer and knew he was not the only one with nerves still jangling the matter of guides went as gaius philippus had guessed the romans were passing through a hardscrabble country with scores of rocky little valleys running higgledypiggledy one into the next the coming of any strangers into such a backwater would have produced a reaction the coming of an army even a small defeated army came close to raising panic farmers and herders so isolated they rarely saw a tax col lector isolation indeed in videssos wanted nothing more than to get the romans away from their own home villages before pillage and rape broke loose every hamlet had a young man or two willing nay eager to send them on their way often marcus noted toward rivals who lived one valley fur ther east sometimes the tribunes men got a friendlier reception bands of yezda with their nomadic hardiness and mobility had penetrated even this inhospitable territory when a timely arrival let the romans appear as rescuers nothing their rustic hosts owned was too fine to lavish on them now this is the life for me and no mistake viridovix said after one such small victory the celt sprawled in front of a campfire a mug of beer was in his right hand a little mountain of wellgnawed pork ribs at his feet he took a long pull at the mug belched and went on you know we could do a sight worse than kinging it here for the rest of our days whod be caring enough to say us nay i for one gaius philippus answered promptly this place is yokeldoms motherland even the whores are clumsy theres more to life than your prick you know the celt said his righteous tone drew howls from everyone who heard an emperor for the legion harry turtledove am gaius philippus mutely held out a hand with three iipraised fingers with the ruddy firelight and his permanently sunburned skin it was impossible to tell if viridovix blushed but he did tug at his sweeping mustaches in chagrin but still he persisted doesnt all this he reached out a foot and toppled the pile of bones make munching marching rations a thought worth puking on dusty porridge stale bread smoked meat with the taste of a herd of butchered shoes a day of that would gag a buzzard and we eat it week after week gorgidas said you know my gallic friend there are times youre naive as a child how often do you think this miserable valley can supply feasts like this he waved out into the dark reminding his listeners of the poor small rocky fields theyd come through fields that sometimes seemed to go straight up a mountainside i grew up in country like this the doctor went on the folk here will eat poorer this winter for feasting us tonight if they did it two weeks running some would starve before spring and so would some of us should we stay viridovix stared at him without comprehension he was used to the lush fertility of his northern gallic homeland with its cool summers mild winters and long gentle rains cut firewood sprouted green shoots there here in the videssian uplands rooted trees withered in the ground there are more reasons than gorgidas for going on marcus said disturbed that the idea viridovix put forward half jokingly was getting serious attention however much wed like to forget the world i fear it wont forget us either the yezda will flatten the empire which looks all too likely right now or videssos will somehow drive them back whoever wins will stretch their rule all through this land do you think we could stand against them theyd have to find us first senpat sviodo gave virido vix unexpected support to judge from the run of guides weve had even the locals dont know the land three valleys over there were rumbles of agreement to that from around the campfire gaius philippus muttered to judge from the run of guides weve had the locals dont know enough to squat when they crap no one could dispute that either glad to see the argument diverted scaurus said this last one is better and the centu rion had to nod the romans latest guide was a solidly built middleaged man with a soldiers scars his name was lexos blemmydes he carried himself like a veteran too and his videssian had lost some of its original hillcountry accent marcus had a nagging feeling hed seen blemmydes before but the guides face did not seem familiar to any of his men the tribune wondered if blemmydes was one of the refu gees from videssos shattered army the man had attached himself to the romans a few days before coming up to their camp one evening and asking if they needed a guide whoever he was he certainly knew his way through this rocky maze his descriptions of upcoming terrain villages and even vil lage leaders ahead were unfailingly accurate he was in fact so much superior to earlier escorts that scauros looked from one campfire to the next until he spotted blemmydes shooting dice with a couple of khatrishers lexos he called and then repeated more loudly when the videssian did not look up the guides head whipped around marcus waved him over he picked himself up from the game though he still had his stiff gamblers face on when he came to the tribunes side what can i do for you sir he asked his voice had the resigned patience of any common soldiers before an officer but the dice muttered restlessly to themselves in his closed right fist not much really marcus said its only that you know so much more of this country than other guides weve had and were wondering how you learned it so well blemmydes could not have been said to change expression but his eyes grew wary he answered slowly ive made it my business to know the best ways through the land i travel i wouldnt want to be caught napping suddenly intent scaurus leaned forward almost he re membered where this frozenfaced soldier had crossed his path before but gaius philippus was chuckling at blem mydes reply your business and no one elses hey well fair enough go on get back to your game blemmydes nod ded still unsmiling and strode off marcus half memory stayed stubbornly dark the senior centurion was still amused hes probably some sort of smuggler or a plain horse thief more power to an emperor for the legion harry turtledove him says i anyone with the imagination to get himself a fifteenhundrcdman armed guard to cover his tracks deserves to do well i suppose so scaurus sighed and shelved the matter that night the weather finally broke a reminder summer would not after all last forever the wind shifted instead of the seemingly endless westerly from the baking plains of yezd it blew clean and cool off the videssian sea to the north there was fog in the early morning and the low gray clouds did not bum away until almost noon well hurrah viridovix exclaimed when he emerged from his tent and saw the murky daylight my puir roasted hide wont fry today no more slathering myself with gor gidas stinking goo either hurrah he said again aye hurrah gaius philippus echoed with a morose look at the sky another week of this and itll start raining and it wont let up till it snows i dont know about you but im not much for slogging my way through mud well be stuck in the boondocks till spring marcus heard that with disquiet still loath to be isolated while uncertainty and ortaias sphrantzes reigned in vi dessos but quintus glabrio remarked if we cant move oddson no one else can either the manifest truth there cheered the tribune who had been thinking of his men as an entity unto themselves and forgetting that nature laid its hand on all alike roman videssian namdalener or yezda as requested lexos blemmydes led scaurus band south east toward amorion the tribune wanted to reach the town on the ithome river before the fall rains made travel hopeless amorion controlled much of the west central plateau and would give him a base for the trouble he expected come spring if thorisin gavras still lived to brew it gorgidas all but held nepos prisoner the priest used his healing art on the legionaries and did his best to teach it to the greek but his efforts there were fruitless which drove gor gidas to distraction in my heart i dont believe i can do it he moaned and so i cant scaurus came to rely on blemmydes more and more the guide had an uncanny knowledge of which ways were open not only was he intimately familiar with the ground himself but he also questioned everyone whose path he crossed the few traders still abroad village headmen farmers and herders sometimes the route he chose was roundabout but it was always safe at evening a couple of days later the romans reached a place where what had been a single valley split into two the rivers that carved them were dry now but marcus knew the fall downpour would soon make torrents of them blemmydes cocked his head down each gap as if listen ing he paused a long time longer than any similar decision had taken him before scaurus gave him a curious glance waiting for his choice the northern one he said at last gaius philippus also noticed the delay and looked a ques tion at the tribune hes been right so far marcus said the senior centurion shrugged and sent the romans down the path blemmydes had chosen scaurus thought at first the guide had betrayed them the valley was full of lowing cattle and their herdsmen yezda or so they seemed dogs followed their masters shouted commands nipping at the cows heels and driving them up the rocky mountainsides as the herdsmen saw the column of armed men coming toward them but the romans alarm proved unfounded the herdsmen were videssians who had taken marcus soldiers for invaders once they learned their mistake they fraternized with the newcomers though warily imperial armies could plunder as ruthlessly as any nomads but when scaurus actually paid for some of their beasts the herders came close to geniality this isnt the sort of thing you want to do too often senpat sviodo remarked watching money change hands hmm why not the tribune was puzzled the less we take by force the better we should get along with the locals true but some may die from the shock of not being robbed marcus laughed but nepos did not approve the priest had finally managed to get away from gorgidas for a few minutes and was wandering about watching the romans run up their camp he said to senpat its never good to mock a generous heart our outland friend shows here the same kindness he used in giving a disgraced man a chance to redeem himself the vaspurakaner not usually as cynical as his words sug gested looked contrite but the last part of what nepos had said made no sense to scaurus what are you talking about he demanded of the priest an emperor for the legion nepos scratched his head in confusion he had not had any more chance than the roman to shave and the top of his skull was starting to get bristly he said no need for modesty surely only a greatsouled man would restore to trust and self respect the soldier he himself ousted from the imperial guards what in the world do you marcus began and then stopped cold remembering the pair of guardsmen he had had cashiered for sleeping at their posts in front of mavrikios private chambers sure as sure this was the elder of the two scaurus even recalled hearing his name now that nepos had made the association for him he also remembered the sullen insolence blemmydes had shown when called to account and the way the snoozing guardsmen were ignominiously banished from the capital when their effort to shift the blame to him fell through it was hard to imagine blemmydes having any good will toward the romans after that which meant the tribune shouted for a sentry find the guide and bring him to me he needs to answer some questions the legionary gave the closedfist roman salute and hurried away nepos and senpat sviodo were both staring at scaurus the priest said you werent taking lexos on faith then pretending not to hear his disappointment marcus an swered on faith hardly the truth is with everything thats happened in the months since i saw him that once i forgot the whoreson existed why didnt you speak up a week ago nepos spread his hands regretfully i assumed you knew who he was and thought the better of you for it splendid muttered the tribune he wondered if his lapse would cost the romans a worry that abruptly became a cer tainty when he saw the sentry returning alone well he barked unable to keep from lashing out to hold his own alarm at bay im sorry sir he doesnt seem to be anywhere about the legionary reported cautiously unlike gaius philippus the tribune usually did not take out his feelings on his men that tears it marcus said smacking fist into palm in disgust only a greatsouled idiot would take in a man like that and if blemmydes was gone he must have thought he had his vengeance harry turtledove marcus failure to follow up on his half recognition of the guide filled him with selfcontempt he could look at others mistakes with the easy tolerance his stoic background gave him they were after all only men and perfection could not be expected from them his own shortcomings on the other hand brought a black anger fiercer in some ways than the one he turned against battlefield foes with difficulty he pulled himself free from that useless rage and began thinking what he had to do to set things right first plainly he had to find out what the situation was pa khymer he called the khatrisher appeared at his elbow ive gotten to know that tone of voice he said with a lopsided smile whats gone wrong now the tribunes answering grin was equally strained maybe nothing at all he said not believing it for a minute maybe quite a lot he quickly sketched what had happened pakhymer heard him out without comment whistling tune lessly between his teeth you think hes buggered us then he said at last im afraid so anyway pakhymer nodded which is why you called me i really should charge for this you know but there was no malice in his words only the amused mockery with which the kha trishers so often faced life he went on all right ill send some of the lads out to see whats ahead aye and another bunch to track down your dear friend blemmydes if they can seeing scaurus wince he added no one can think of everything not even phos if he did skotos wouldnt be here that thought consoled the tribune but dismayed nepos the khatrishers had a theology as free and easy as themselves pakhymer left before nepos could put his protest into words the priest was a good man more tolerant than many of his colleagues but there were limits his tolerance could not over step marcus wondered how balsamon would have reacted to the khatrishers remark likely he thought the patriarch of videssos would have laughed his head off there was nothing to do but wait for the scouts return the party sent out in pursuit of blemmydes came back first emptyhanded marcus was not surprised the terrain was an emperor for the legion harry turtledove broken enough to give the disgruntled videssian a hundred hiding places in plain sight of the camp the unusual comings and goings set tongues wagging as scaurus had known they would for once rumor might be an ally if the men suspected trouble they would be quicker to meet it and if what the tribune was beginning to fear came true speed would count soon he saw the khatrishers come riding back out of the east slide off their horses and jog over to pakhymer with their news whatever it was they said not a word to the soldiers who huried questions at them the horsemen might not have the romans stiff discipline but they were all right the tri bune decided for the hundredth time their commanders scarred face had no trace of his usual mirth as he came up to the tribune as bad as that marcus asked reading the trouble in his eyes as bad as that pakhymer agreed somberly the next valley east is crawling with yezda from what my boys say they must have two or three times as many men as we do the damned cullions it figures scaurus nodded bitterly blemmydes has his revenge all right he must have been looking for yezda all along and run off when he found a band big enough to sink us pakhymer tried to keep him from falling into despair the counts not very fine you understand just a short peek over that ridge ahead to reckon up their tents and fires fires aye marcus said fires to eat the romans up but something else about fire teased at the back of his mind the sensation was maddening and horribly familiar he had felt it when he tried without success to remember where hed seen lexos blemmydes now he stood stockstill not forcing whatever it was but letting it come if it would pakhymer started to say something seeing scaurus ab stracted he was sensitive enough to keep silent a little longer the tribune drove his fist into his palm for the second time in less than an hour but now in decision the gods be praised i learned to read greek he exclaimed it had no meaning for laon pakhymer but he saw the roman was him self again he started to leave but scaurus stopped him saying ill need your men again and soon theyre better herders and drovers than the legionaries ever will be and if they are the khatrisher was mystified marcus started to explain but gaius philippus strode up demanding by mars left hairy nut whats going on the whole camp is seething like a boiledover pot but nobody knows why the tribune spelled it out in a few sentences his second incommand swore foully never mind all that scaurus said now that his wits were working again haste drove him hard get a couple of maniples out there with pakhymers men i want every cow in the valley down here at this end inside an hours time khatrisher and centurion stared at him sure hed lost his mind after all then gaius philippus doubled over with laugh ter what a wonderful scheme he got out between wheezes and we wont be on the receiving end this time either youve read polybius too scaurus said indignant and amazed at the same time the senior centurion found written latin slow going and marcus had not thought he could read greek at all who oh one of your pet historians is he no not a chance for once gaius philippus smile had none of the wolf in it theres more ways to remember things than books sir every veterans known that trick since hannibal used it and known his head would answer if he fell for it will the two of you talk sense pakhymer asked irritably but the romans enjoying their common joke would not en lighten him they did explain the scheme to viridovix marcus had thought of a special role he could play if he would the celt whooped when hed heard them out sure and id kill the man you tried to put in my place he said the herdsmen who had praised scaurus to the skies while the sun still shone cursed his name in the darkness as without mercy or explanation their cattle were taken away they car ried spears and knives to protect themselves against taxcol lectors and other predators but were helpless in the face of the legionaries swords and mail shirts and the khatrishers horses and bows lowing resentfully at the change in their routine the cattle shambled down the valley prodded along by their confisca an emperor for the legion harry turtledove tors some of the herd dogs unreasoningly gallant leaped to their defense but reversed spearshafts drove them yelping back at the camp marcus found gains philippus had been right when he ordered the legionaries still there to chop the stakes of the palisade into armlong lengths they grinned knowingly and fell to like so many small boys involved in a mammoth practical joke their women and new nonroman comrades watched with the same caution one gave any group of men suddenly struck mad the tribune did not need to give them the next set of orders as fast as cattle arrived from the west the romans tied the newly made sticks to their horns marcus if this is meddling i crave your pardon but what on earth is going on helvis asked once your brother soteric said my men had an advantage fighting in this world because we had a bundle of tricks no one here knows scaurus answered elliptically its time to see if he was right he probably would have given her the full explanation in another minute or two but a khatrisher scout brought him bad news whatever youre playing at it had better work soon a couple of yezda just stuck their heads into the valley to see what all the ruckus is about here i took a shot at them but in the dark i missed scaurus gave his preparations a last look not so many cattle as he would have liked were festooned with sticks but a good two thousand head were ready this is all fascinating pakhymer said ironically do you suppose the yezda will run from a stampeding forest i doubt it but they just might from a forest fire the tribune took a burning piece of wood from a campfires edge and walked toward the cattle pakhymers eyes got round strike them now i say rest easy vahush theyll be there in the morning the speaker a stocky middleaged yezda pulled a spit from the campfire and offered the sizzling meat on it to his nephew vahush rejected it with an angry gesture hawknosed as any videssian he had a zealots narrow face and moved with the barely controlled grace of a beast of prey when you find your foe prypet smite him he snapped so says avshar and he speaks truly and so we will prypet said placatingly it will be easy if the scouts tell no lies the imperials are running about like so many madmen in any case we outnumber them two to one at least he waved out into the darkness where felt tents dotted the valley like toadstools the flocks would grow fat in this wide new land prypet thought he pulled at a wine jug another of the spoils of war true he mused avshar had won the battle that gave the nomads room to grow but who had seen him since in any case he prypet led the clan not this wizard whose face no one knew and not his own wifes sisters son either still the lad showed promise and should not be squelched weve had hard riding these past weeks well fight better for the nights rest sit yourself down and relax have some bread he lifted the chewy unleavened sheet from the light griddle that served the nomads in place of an oven you listen too much to your belly uncle vahush said his confidence in his own lightness driving soft words from him and wrecking any hope of making the older man listen prypet got deliberately to his feet the mildness gone from his face nephew or not vahush could go too far if you like boy you can find a fight closer than the next valley he said quietly vahush leaned forward any time you he blinked avshars black bow whats that beginning in the valley to the west the low rumble could be felt through the soles of the feet as well as heard bass bellows of pain and terror accompanied it prypet snorted his contempt get dry behind your ears whelp dont you know cows when you hear them vahush flushed of course skotos im edgy tonight his uncle relaxed seeing the fighting moment was past dont worry about it farmers never could handle kine look at them letting a batch run loose like that it might not be a bad idea for a few men to saddle up at that you know and round up the stragglers as they come through ill do that the younger man said itll let me work off my nerves he turned toward his horse then stopped dead horror on his face prypet looked west too and felt ice leap up his back the an emperor for the legion thunder was louder now pounding its way into the valley where the yezda took their ease cattle it was not it could not be cattle but the great reverberation of a rolling chopping sea of flame washing toward them at the speed of a fast mans run and at the edge of the wave ramped a devil his banshee wail loud through the roar the shirting fire struck scarlet sparks from the sword he waved above the tide the clan leader was a warrior seasoned in countless fights but this was magic beyond his courage to face flee for your lives he screamed yezda tumbled from their tents glanced west and leaped for their mounts in panic demons demons they shrieked and set spur to their horses without another backward glance like an upset mug the valley emptied of nomads the fiery sea rolled over their tents as if they had never been vahush would have fled with his uncle and his clanmates but for long minutes his terror far worse than prypets held him motionless you wanted to attack them fool his mind gibbered when theyve found a wizard who could blow av shar out like a candle nearer and nearer came the roaring ocean of flame the young nomad stared into the shattered darkness waiting numb ly for it to sweep him away and then at last it was close enough for him to see the grinning riders driving the cattle on see the bare burning branches lashed hastily to horns smell their smoke and the reek of singed hair and flesh rage exploded in him freeing spirit and body from panics grip he sprang onto his tethered horse with a single slash of his saber he cut the rope that held it now his spurs bit he darted not away from the tortured herd but toward it blade bright in his handsback come back youve been tricked he cried to his escaping comrades but in the din and distance they did not hear closer by though someone did arent you the noisy one now an oddly accented voice said too late vahush remembered the devilcries from the head of the stampede there was a man on a pony in front of those frenzied cattle a long straight blade leaped at the nomads neck his last thought as he slid from his horse in death was that the imperials did not fight fair had the yezda stopped their panicstruck flight and re turned to investigate they likely would have routed the harry turtledove romans from the valley they had vacated in the relief their deliverance brought them marcus troops and pakhymers danced with their women in whooping circles round the campfires clapping stamping snapping their fingers and shouting with glee for all the world to hear pakhymer took no part in the celebration wandering through the camp like a man in a daze when he found scaurus reveling with the rest of his men he pulled the tri bune out of his circle earning him a glare from helvis as the dance whirled her away the tribune was ready to be angry too until he saw the lost look in the khatrishers eyes cattle pakhymer said blankly plainsmen who spend their lives with cattle heathens who kill for the sport of it running like frightened children from a harmless herd of cows he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand as if trying to drive belief into it marcus who had taken on a good deal of wine had no better answer for him than a shrug and a wide foolish grin but gorgidas was close enough to hear pakhymers comment and sober enough to try to deal with it he had kept the greek habit of watering his wine and moreover found the pursuit of understanding a sweeter fruit than any that grew on a vine we may have driven cattle against the yezda he said to the khatrisher but do you think it was cattle the nomads saw charging out of the night aflame would you in this magic steeped land if you expect to find sorcery you will whether its there or not his mouth quirked upward in something that was not a smile belief is all you know when i studied medicine i was trained to hate magic and everything it stood for now ive found a magic that truly heals and it will not serve me perhaps you should serve it instead pakhymer said slowly does everyone here talk like a priest gorgidas snarled but his eyes were thoughtful sure and they dont viridovix caught only what was said not its overtones he looked most unpriestly with each arm encircling a girls waist marcus could not for the life of him remember which two of his three they were for one thing the tall celt mostly called them dear or darling a part of his speech pattern an emperor for the legion that served him well lessening the chance of an embarrassing slip for another while all three were of dainty flowerlike beauty none had enough character to leave much other im pression on the mind viridovix suddenly noticed scaurus standing with the greek doctor and laon pakhymer he loosed his hold on the girls to fold the tribune into a bear hug marcus smelled the wine fumes clinging to him even through his own drunken ness the gaul held him at arms length for a moment studying him with owlish intensity then he turned to gorgidas declar ing will you look at him now standing there so quiet and all after the greatest joke any of us ever saw the which saved all our necks besides and here i am a hero for sitting on some smelly horses back and scaring those poor omadhauns all to bits and wheres the glory for the fellow who thought to put me there in the first place you deserve it marcus protested what if the yezda had decided to ride toward you instead of away one did you know och that puir fool viridovix gave a snort of scorn a week and a half it seemed he gawped at me its probably only when he pissed himself that he woke up who would have thought id make a horseman cowman might be better thinking of the herd laon pakhymer said with a sidelong glance hmm thats hardly a name for a man but the gauls eyes were twinkling if youd called me bullman now you might be closer to the truth isnt that right loves he said leading the girls back toward the tent they shared their bodies swayed toward his in mute agreement with the boast pakhymer gave viridovix back a frankly jealous look what does he do with them all he wondered aloud ask him gorgidas suggested hell tell you whatever else he may be our celtic friend is not shy pakhymer watched three bodies briefly silhouetted by lan temlight as viridovix pulled back his tent flap no he sighed i dont suppose he is next morning marcus thought for a bleary moment the noise of raindrops buttering on the sides of his tent was his pulse hammering in his ears pain throbbed dully through his harry turtledove head the taste of sewers was in his mouth when he sat up too quickly his stomach yelped and his surroundings gave a queasy lurch his motion woke helvis who yawned stretched lithely and smiled up at him from the sleeping mat good morning love she said reaching out to touch his arm how are you even her smooth contralto grated bloody awful the tri bune croaked holding his head in his hands does nepos know how to heal a hangover do you think he belched uncomfortably if there were a cure for nausea i promise you pregnant women would know it we can be sick together she said mischief in her voice but then seeing scaurus real misery she added ill do my best to keep malric quiet the boy was stirring under his blanket thanks marcus said and meant it a rambunctious threeyearold he decided could be the death of him at the moment the downpour meant no cooking fires the romans break fasted on cold porridge cold beef and soggy bread the tri bune ignored his soldiers grumbles the thought of food any food did not appeal he heard gaius philippus squelching his way from one group of men to the next instructing them dont forget grease your armor leather and metal both easier that than grinding out the rust and patching over the rotted hide just because you were too lazy to do what needed doing and oil your weapons too though the gods help you if you need me to tell you that with lexos blemmydes vanished there were no guides to show scaurus force the way to amorion save for the romans the valley the invaders had held was empty of hu manity the angry herders whose cattle had served to rout the yezda hid in the hills unwilling to help the men who from their viewpoint first befriended and then betrayed them much later than was pleasing to marcus senior centurion the army finally began slogging southeast the sky remained a sullen leaden gray hour after hour the rain kept falling now in little spatters of drizzle now in nearly opaque sheets driven by a wind with the early bite of winter in it there was no way to steer a steady course in those dreadful an emperor for the legion harry turtledove conditions drenched and miserable the legionaries and their companions struggled through a series of crisscrossing little canyons more bewildering than minos labyrinth they trudged glumly on trusting in dead reckoning the storm blew itself out toward evening through tattered clouds the sun gave an apologetic peep at the world and when it did some soldiers fearfully exclaimed it was setting in the east for it shone straight into their faces listening to the men quintus glabrio shook his head in resignation isnt that the way of the world theyd sooner turn the heavens topsyturvy than face up to our own blunder ing you spend too cursed much time hanging round gor gidas gaius philippus said youre starting to sound like him scaurus had the same impression though thinking back on it he did not remember seeing the junior centurion and the physician together very often worse things have happened glabrio chuckled gaius philippus was content to let it rest if there were things he did not understand in the younger officer he approved of enough to tolerate the rest marcus was glad the chaffing went no further than it did his hangover was gone at last but he had not eaten all day and felt lightheaded a real quarrel would have been more than he was up to dealing with only bits of scudding gray showed the storms passage when dawn came again those and the redbrown clinging mud that tried to suck sandals from feet it was marcus thought with disquiet almost the color of yezds banners he was strangely pleased to see tiny green shoots thrusting up through it fooled into thinking it was spring gaius philippus barked harsh laughter when he said that aloud theyll find out soon enough how wrong they are he sniffed at the brisk northern breeze weatherwise from a lifetime lived in the open snows coming before long quite by accident for they were still guideless they came upon a town early that afternoon aptos it was called and held perhaps five thousand souls peaceful unwalled un known to the yezda it nearly brought tears to the tribune to him towns like this were videssos greatest achievement places where generation on generation lived in peace never fearing that the next day might bring invaders to rape away in hours the fruit of years of labor such bypassed tranquil is lands were already rare in the westlands soon too soon none would be left monks pulling weeds from the rainsoftened soil of their vegetable gardens looked up in amazement as the battered mercenary company tramped past true to the disciplined kindness of their vocation they hurried into the monastery storehouses returning with freshbaked bread and pitchers of wine they stood by the side of the road offering the refresh ments to any who caredto stop for a moment scaurus had mixed feelings about the videssian clergy when humane as these monks seemed to be they were among the best of men he thought of nepos and the patriarch balsamon but their zeal could make them frighteningly vio lently xenophobic the tribune remembered the antinamda lener riots in videssos the city and the pogrom the priest zemarkhos had wanted to incite against the vaspurakaners of amorion his mouth tightened at that zemarkhos was still there the gilded sunglobes atop the monasterys spires disap peared behind the romans as they marched through aptos itself a shouting horde of small boys surrounded them danc ing with excitement and firing questions like arrows was it true the yezda were nine feet tall were the streets in videssos paved with pearls wasnt a soldiers life the most glorious one in the world the boy who asked that last question was a beautiful child of about twelve flushed with the first dreams of manhood he looked ready nay eager to run off with the army dont you believe it for a minute son gaius philippus said speaking with an eamestness marcus had rarely heard him use sol dierings a trade like any other a bit dirtier than most maybe go at it for the glory and youll die too damned young the boy stared in disbelief as if hearing one of the monks curse phos his face crumpled tears come hard at twelve and scald when they fall why are you after doing that to the lad viridovix de manded sure and theres no harm in feeding his dreams a mite isnt there the centurions voice was like a slamming door my younger brother thought that way hes thirty years an emperor for the legion harry turtledove dead now he looked stonily at the celt daring him to take it further viridovix reddened and kept still despite the peregrinations of the day before scaurus learned amorion was only about four days march southeast aptos adults pointed the way though no one seemed eager to lead the romans there still as one plump fellow declared with the optimism of rustics everywhere you cant miss it maybe not but watch us try gaius philippus muttered to himself marcus was inclined to agree with him all too often a landmark was a landmark because a local saw it every day of his life to a stranger it was just another tree or hill or barn worse the rain returned at dawn the next day not with the vicious onslaught it had shown before but a steady downpour riding the seawind south the road to amorion in bad shape already soon became next to impossible wagons and travel ing cars bogged down axledeep in greasy mud straining to push forward nonetheless two horses in quick succession snapped legbones and had to be destroyed the soldiers worked with their beasts to move the wains on but progress was minute the four days journey promised in aptos seemed a cruel mockery i feel like a drowned cat gorgidas complained dapper by choice the greek was sadly disheveled now his hair its curl killed by hours of rain splashed down onto his forehead and kept wandering into his eyes his soaked mantle clung to him more like a parasite than a garment he was spattered with muck in short he looked no different from any of his compan ions in wretchedness viridovix said so loudly and profanely perhaps hoping to jar him out of his misery and into a good soulstirring fight there was more subtlety to the gaul than met the eye scaurus recalled his using that ploy before and succeeding but today the doctor would not rise to the bait he squelched away in glum silence a person from a sunny land hardpressed to deal with foul weather viridovix to whom rain was an everyday likelihood was better prepared to cope with it the storm closed down visibility and pattered insistently off every horizontal surface thus the romans intent on their own concerns were not aware of the newcomers until they loomed out of the watery curtain ahead marcus sword was in his hand before he consciously wished it there his men bristled like angry dogs leaping back from their labors and likewise reaching for weapons gaius philippus chest swelled as he gulped the air hed need to shout mem into battle formation before the centurion could give the order senpat sviodo cried out in his own language and splashed forward to clasp the hand of the leading horseman ahead bagratouni he exclaimed with the naming of that name the fear fell from scaurus eyes and he saw the newly come riders as they were not a yezda horde bursting out of the mist but a battered squadron of vaspurakaners as much refugees as the romans gagik bagratouni almost jerked his hand from sviodos in startlement like marcus the nakharar had seen what he thought he would see and was about to cry his men forward in a last doomed desperate charge eyes wide he too recon sidered it is the romans our friends he shouted to his forlorn command weary beaten faces answered with uncer tain smiles as if remembering a word long unused as the tribune moved up to greet bagratouni he was shocked to see how the nakharar had shrunken in on himself since the battle before maragha his skin was looser over the strong bones of his face dark circles puffed below his eyes his nose seemed an old mans beak not the symbol of strength it had been worst of all the almost tangible power and presence once his had slipped from his shoulders leaving him more naked than a mere loss of clothes ever could have he dismounted stiffly his secondincommand mesrop anhoghin was there to steady him from the look of mute misery the lanky thickbearded aide wore scaurus grew sure his imagination was not tricking him greetings anhoghin said thereby marcus knew exhausting most of his vides sian greetings the roman nodded senpat came to his side ready to interpret for him but scaurus spoke directly to gagik bagratouni who used me imperial tongue fluently albeit with heavy accent he asked are the yezda between here and amorion too thick to stop us pushing on amorion the nakharar repeated dully how do you know we to amorion have been an emperor for the legion harp turtledove for one thing by the direction you came from for an other well scaurus waved at the ragged group before him most of gagik bagratounis men were vaspurakaners driven from their native land by the yezda who settled in or near amorion with their women they had left those women be hind when they took the emperors service but some were here now looking as worn and beaten as the men they rode with some were here now but where was bagratounis wife the fat easygoing lady marcus had met in the nakharars for tresslike home gagik he asked alarm leaping in him is zabel he stopped not knowing how he should continue zabel it might have been a strangers name the way bagratouni said it zabel is dead he said slowly and then began to weep his shoulders shaking helplessly his tears washed away by the uncaring rain the sight of the stalwart noble broken and despairing was somehow more terrible than most of the concrete setbacks the romans had encountered take care of him cant you scaurus whispered to gorgidas the compassion in the doctors eyes was replaced by a spark of exasperation you always want me to work miracles not medicine but he was already moving toward bagra touni murmuring come with me sir ill give you some thing that will let you sleep in greek he told scaurus ill give him something to knock him out for two days straight that may help a little the nakharar let himself be led away indifferent to what fate held for him marcus who could not afford indifference began questioning the rest of the vaspurakaners through sen pat sviodo to learn what had happened to them to bring their leader to such a state the answer was the one hed feared he knew bagratounis men had got free of the fatal field before maragha their fu rious despair at videssos failure to free their homeland helped them beat back the yezda time and again the younger men and bachelors scattered to vaspurakans mountains to carry on the fight the rest bypassed khiiat and marched straight for their families in amorion after the rigors of the battlefield and a forced march through western videssos ravaged countryside what they found there was the crudest irony of all videssians had fought at their side against the nomads but in amorion other videssians using the vaspurakaners heterodoxy as their pre text turned on them more viciously than ever the yezda had with sickening certainty the tribune knew what was com ing next zemarkhos had headed the pogrom marcus remem bered the lean clerics burning fanatical gaze his automatic hatred of anyone who did not conform precisely to his con ception of how his god should be revered and he remem bered how he himself had stopped gagik bagratouni just short of doing away with zemarkhos when the priest taunted the vaspurakaners by naming his dog for vaspur the prince they claimed as their first ancestor and the result of his magna nimity a cry of death to the heretics and revenge exacted from the absent warriors defenseless kin the mobs fury blazed so high it even dared stand against bagratounis men on their return in street fighting ferocity carried almost as much weight as discipline and the vaspura kaners were already worn down to shadows of themselves it was all they could do to rescue their surviving loved ones for most that rescue came far too late mesrop anhoghin his face expressionless gave the story out flatly pausing every few seconds to let senpat translate finally that impassivity was more than scaurus could bear he was drowning in shame and guilt how can you stand to look at me much less speak this way he said covering his face with his hands were it not for me none of this might have happened his cry was in videssian but anhoghin could understand the anguish in his voice without an interpreter he stumped forward to look the tribune in the face tall for a vaspurakaner his eyes were almost level with scaurus we are phos first born he said through senpat sviodo it is only just that he test us more harshly than ordinary men that is no answer the tribune moaned without strong religious beliefs of his own he could not comprehend the strength they lent others anhoghin seemed to sense that he said perhaps it is not for you think of this then when you asked my lord to spare zemarkhos it was not from love but to keep him from being a martyr and a rallying cry for zealots you did not you could not force him to spare the swine that he did himself for reasons he found good no matter where they came from an emperor for the legion and who knows things might have been worse the other way it was not forgiveness anhoghin offered it was better for he said none was needed scaurus stood silent for a long grateful moment ankledeep in doughy mud suddenly not minding the raindrops splashing against his face thank you he whispered at last fury blazed in him that the vaspurakaners sober decent folk who asked no more from the world than that it leave them at peace could find it neither in their conquered homeland nor in the refugeplace round amorion about the first he could do nothing that had proved beyond all the empires power as for the other the wolfish eagerness in his own voice surprised him as he asked anhoghin shall we avenge you the heat of the moment swept away weeks of careful calcula tion senpat sviodo instantly shouted aye the headstrong young vaspurakaner could be counted on to press for any plan that called for action but when he translated for mesrop anhoghin bagratounis aide shook his head what purpose would it serve those of us who could escape have and the dead care not for ven geance this land has war enough without stirring up more the yezda would laugh to see us fight among ourselves scaurus opened his mouth to protest slowly closed it again were the occasion different he might have laughed to hear arguments he had so long upheld come back at him from another but anhoghin standing there in the muck with rain dripping through his matted beard and only exhaustion and defeat in his eyes was not an object of mirth the tribunes shoulders slumped inside his mail shirt damn you for being right he said tiredly and saw disap pointment flower on sviodos mobile features if the way forward is closed wed best go back to aptos turning to give the necessary orders he felt old for the first time in his life the hill town northwest of amorion was not a bad choice for winter quarters scaurus soon saw the truth of that where the romans would have had to storm amorion aptos welcomed them not a yezda had been seen in its secluded valley but the cold wind of rumor said they were about a friendly garrison was suddenly desirable more than rumor told the townsfolk of the disaster the em pire had met the local noble a minor magnate named skyros phorkos had levied a platoon of farmers to fight the yezda with mavrikios none had yet returned only now were friends and kin beginning to realize none ever would phorkos son and heir was a boy of eleven the nobles widow nerse had picked up the authority he left behind a woman of stem beauty she viewed the world with coldly real istic eyes when the romans and their comrades struggled back into aptos she received them like a ruling princess to the edification of the few townsmen who braved the rain to watch the dinner to which she invited scaurus and his officers was equally formal if the romans noticed the large number of guards protecting phorkos estate they made no mention of it no more than did nerse at the double squad of legion aries escorting the tribunes party thither perhaps as a result of those shared silences the dinner a roast goat cooked with onions and cloves boiled beans and cabbage freshbaked bread with wild honey and candied fruits went smoothly enough wine flowed freely though an emperor for the legion marcus noticing his hostess moderation and recalling too well the morning after his last carouse did not drink deep when her servants had taken the last scrapladen platter from the dining hall nerse grew businesslike we are glad you are here she said abruptly we will be gladder yet when we see you intend to treat us as a flock to be protected not as victims to be despoiled keep us supplied with bread and with fodder for our beasts and well pay for whatever else we take marcus re turned my troops are no plunderers nerse considered less than i hoped for more than i ex pected fair enough can you live up to it what would my promises mean the only test will be how we behave youll have to judge that marcus liked the way she put aptos case without pleading he liked too the straightforward way she dealt with him she did not try to use her femininity as a tool but treated the roman as an equal and plainly expected the same from him he waited for the tiny threat that was the sole pressure she could bring to bear that aptos inhabitants would only coop erate with his men to the extent they were well treated in stead she turned the conversation to less important things before long she rose nodded graciously and escorted her guests to the door gaius philippus had been almost silent during the dinner his presence like that of scaurus other companions was more ceremonial than it was necessary once outside though he paused only to draw his cloak round himself against the rain before declaring there is a woman he spoke so enthusiastically marcus raised a quizzical eye brow he had trouble imagining the senior centurion as any thing but a misogynist cold as a netted carp shed be between the sheets from the look of her viridovix guessed automatically ready to disagree with the veteran not if properly thawed laon pakhymer demurred as soldiers will they argued it all the way back to the soggy roman camp the tribune was inside it before he realized that nerses threat had in fact been made it was merely that she had not crudely put it into words but let him make it himself in his own mind he wondered if she knew the videssian board marry turtledove game that unlike its roman counterparts depended only on a players skill if so he decided he did not want to play against her wintering at aptos marcus thought was like crawling into a hole and then pulling it in after himself he and his men had been at the center of events since spring he had hob nobbed with videssos imperial family sparred with the chief minister of the empire made a personal foe of the wizard prince who led its foes fought in a great battle that would change videssos course for years to come and here he was in a country town wondering if its store of barley meal would hold out until spring it was deflating but gave him back a sense of proportion he had been in danger of losing aptos was lonely enough at the best of times news of the disaster before maragha had reached it aye the distant king doms of thatagush and agder would know of that by now but the romans brought word of ortaias sphrantzes assump tion of the throne and aptos had been equally ignorant of the persecution of the vaspurakaners not five days march away the tribune was unwilling to leave some news to chance he talked with laon pakhymer outside his tent one morning not long after rain turned to snow id like to send a couple of your riders west he said west eh the katrisher raised an eyebrow want to find out whats become of the younger gavras do you yes if all we have is a choice between yezd and ortaias well suddenly the life of a robber chief looks better than it had i know what you mean ill get the lads for you pa khymer clicked his tongue between his teeth hate to send them out with so little hope of making it back but what can you do making it back from where senpat sviodos breath puffed out in a steaming cloud as he asked the question he was just done with practice at swords and still breathing hard when marcus explained the handsome young vaspura kaner threw his hands in the air this is foolishness would you throw birds in a river when you have fish handy who better to go to vaspurakan than a pair of princes nevrat and i will leave within the hour the khatrishers will be able to get in and out faster than an emperor for the legion harry turtledove you could they have the nomad way of traveling light marcus said beside him pakhymer nodded reluctantly but senpat laughed theyll be able to get killed faster you mean likely mistaken for yezda nevrat and i are of the country and will be welcome wherever our people live weve gone in before and come back whole we can again he sounded so certain that scaurus looked a question at pakhymer the khatrisher said let him go if he wants to so badly but he should leave nevrat behind the woman is too well favored to waste so youre right senpat said which surprised the tribune until he went on i tell her so myself but she will not have us separated and who am i to complain of that he turned serious she can care for herself you know after her long journey west from khiiat marcus could not argue that go then he said giving up make the best time you can that we will senpat promised of course we may do a little hunting along the way hunting yezda marcus knew he meant he wanted to forbid it but knew better than to give an order he could not enforce the vaspurakaners owed yezd even more than videssos did the tribune had his own troubles settling into semiperma nent quarters campaign and crisis had let him pay helvis and malric only as much attention as he wanted something sud denly no longer true and under settled conditions helvis did not always prove easy to live with marcus a lifelong bachelor before this at tachment was used to keeping his thoughts to himself until the time came to act on them helvis past on the other hand made her expect confidences from him and she was hurt whenever he did something that affected them both without consulting her first he realized her complaints held justice and did his best to reform but his habits were no easier to break than hers the irritations did not run in one direction alone as her pregnancy progressed helvis grew even more prayerful every day it seemed a new icon of phos or some saint ap peared on the walls of the cabin she and scaurus shared by itself that would have been only a minor nuisance to the trib une not religious himself he was willing to tolerate that is to ignore as much as possible others practices in this theologymad land that was not enough like the rest of the namdaleni helvis added a phrase to the creed videssos followed for the sake of half a dozen words the two lands folk reckoned each other heretics as the lone supporter of her version of the true faith for many miles she naturally sought marcus support but to give it took more hypocrisy than was in him i have no quarrel with what you believe he said but i would be lying if i said i shared it does phos need worship pers so badly he would not resent a false one she had to answer no there the matter rested scaurus hoped it was settled not merely dormant if he and helvis had difficulties they managed to keep them below the level of conflagration others were not so lucky one grayishyellow morning when the fall rain had turned to sleet but not yet to snow the tribune was rudely awakened by the crash of a pot against a wall followed at once by a shrill volley of curses he pulled the thick wool blankets over his ears to muffle the fighting but when a second pot followed the first to smith ereens he knew it was in vain he rolled over onto one side and saw without surprise that helvis was awake too theyre at it again he said unnecessarily and added this is the first time ive ever resented having my officers quarters close to mine shh helvis said i want to listen asking him for quiet was hardly needful either when pro voked damans voice had a carry to it that any professional herald would have envied turn on your stomach she was shouting turn on your stomach ive rolled over for the last time for you i can tell you that find yourself a boy or a cow or whatever suits your fancy but youll not use me that way again the door to quintus glabrios cabin slammed with tooth rattling fury scaurus heard damans splash away still scream ing imprecations even when i got you to put me on my back you were no damned good she cried from some dis tance then mercifully the winds voice at last covered hers oh dear the tribune said his ears feeling redhot unexpectedly helvis broke into giggles whats funny an emperor for the legion marcus demanded wondering how glabrio was going to be able to hold his head up in front of his men again the harshness in his voice reached her im sorry she said its just one of those silly things you think of you dont understand womens gossip marcus weve done nothing but wonder why damaris never got pregnant now i guess we know that had never occurred to scaurus he felt a chuckle of his own rising unbidden sternly suppressed it but even as he did he wondered again how many romans were sniggering at the junior centurion at breakfast glabrio moved in the center of a circle of silence no one was quite able to pretend he had not heard damaris but no one had the nerve to mention her to him he drilled his maniple with grim intensity usually he was patient with the videssians struggling to leam roman ways of fighting but not today and he pushed himself even harder than his legionaries not wanting to give them any opening to mock him but every group of men has its wit a fellow who takes pleasure in amusing many at the expense of one marcus was not far away when one of glabrios soldiers in response to an order the tribune did not hear stuck out his backside with deliberate impertinence already tightlipped the junior centurion went dead pale scaurus hurried forward to deal with the insolent roman but there was no need quintus glabrio his face empty of all expression broke his vinestave a centurions staff of office over the soldiers head the man dropped without a sound into the mud glabrio waited until he moaned and shakily tried to sit the young officer tossed the two pieces of his staff into the legionarys lap fetch me a whole one lucilius he snapped and waited over him until he staggered to his feet and did as ordered seeing marcus approach the junior centurion stiffened to attention im more than capable of handling these things myself sir no need to involve yourself so i see scaurus nodded he dropped his voice until glabrio alone could hear it does no harm for me to remind the men youre an officer not a figure of fun what happened to you could as easily have befallen one of them harry turtledove could it i wonder glabrio murmured as much to him self as to the tribune his manner grew brisk once more well in any case i dont think ill have any more trouble from the ranks now if youll forgive me he turned back to his troops i hope you enjoyed the rest you got for youll need it and one there was no further trouble from the maniple nonethe less scaurus was not happy quietly but unmistakably gla brio had made any further conversation unwelcome ah well the tribune thought that one usually has more on his mind than he shows he stood watching for another couple of min utes but the junior centurion had everything well in hand the tribune shrugged shivered in the cold wind and found some thing else to do that afternoon gorgidas sought him out the greek was diffident something so far out of character that marcus sus pected he was about to announce a major calamity but what he had to say was simple enough the cabin glabrio and da maris had been sharing was in the junior centurions opinion too big for one man by himself and he had invited gorgidas to share it with him scaurus understood the doctors hesitation everyone with more sensitivity than crude lucilius had trouble speaking straight out about glabrios misfortune still no reason to come at me as if you thought i was going to bite he said i think thats all to the good better for him to have someone to talk to than sit by himself and brood from the way you went about it i thought you were going to tell me the plague had broken out i only wanted to make sure there would be no problems none i can think of why should there be the tribune decided gorgidas continuing failure with nepos healing magic was making him imagine difficulties everywhere it might do you both good he said i nepos announced need a stoup of wine he and marcus were walking down aptos main street snow crunched under their boots good idea hot mulled wine by choice the tribune said he rubbed the tip of his nose which was starting to freeze like his men he wore videssianstyle baggy woolen trousers an emperor for the legion and was glad to have them winter in the westlands was not weather for the toga of aptos half a dozen taverns the dancing wolf was the best its proprietor tatikios tomikes enjoyed his work im mensely he was stout enough to make nepos seem underfed beside him good day to you gentlemen he called with a smile when priest and roman entered and to you tatikios marcus replied wiping his feet on the rushes strewn inside the doorway tomikes beamed at him the tavemer was a stickler for cleanliness scaurus liked the dancing wolf and its owner so did most of his men the only complaint hed heard came from virido vix may his upper lip go bald the celt had reason for envy going against usual vides sian fashion tatikios shaved his chin but his mustachios more than made up for it coalblack as his hair they swept out and up the tavemer waxed them into spiked perfection every day the tribune and nepos glad of the roaring fire tatikios had going sat down at a table next to it a serving girl moved out from behind the bar to ask what they cared for staring into the flames marcus hardly noticed her come up his head jerked around as he recognized her voice some one had told him damans was working at the dancing wolf he realized but this was the first time hed seen her here he frowned a little for his money quintus glabrio was well rid of the hellcat today though he felt too good to be petty mulled wine nice and hot he said nepos echoed him his nose twitched at the spicy scent the handleless yellow cup stung his hands as he picked it up the dancing wolf did things right ahhh he said savoring the hot cinnamon bite on his tongue the wine slid down his throat smooth as honey that calls for another he said when the cup was empty and nepos nodded now that they were warmed inside and out they could savor the second round at leisure he waved for damans while she heated the wine tatikios wandered over to their table whats the news he asked like every tavemer he liked to be on top of things unlike some he did not try to hide it harry turtledove precious little and i wish i had more the tribune an swered tomikes laughed i wish i did too things get slow once winter sets in he went back behind the bar ran a rag over its already gleaming surface i wasnt joking you know marcus said to nepos i wish senpat and nevrat would get back with word of thorisin gavras whether good or ill not knowing where we stand is hard to bear oh indeed indeed but friend tatikios was perhaps righter than he knew everything moves slowly in the snow the vaspurakaners no less than other men less than the nomads scaurus retorted he shook his head smiled wryly i worry too much i know likely the two of them are holed up in some distant cousins keep mak ing love in front of a fire just like this one a pleasant enough way to pass the time nepos chuck led like all videssian priests he was celibate but he did not begrudge others the pleasures of the flesh its not what i sent them out for marcus said a little stiffly carrying an enameled tray in one hand damans took two steaming cups from it and set them down why should you fuss over a man lying with a woman she said to scaurus youre used to worse than that the tribune paused with the hot cup halfway to his mouth his right eyebrow arched toward his hairline what might that mean surely you dont need me to draw you pretty pictures she said the undertone in her voice sent a chill through him crackling flames and warm wine notwithstanding malice leaped into her eyes as she saw his confusion a man who uses a woman as he would a boy would sooner have a boy or be one wine slopped in marcus cup as he grasped her meaning she drove the knife home i hear my sweet quintus has taken no new lover these past weeks or has he her laugh was vicious the tribune looked damaris in the eye the vindictive smile froze on her face how long have you been putting this filth about he asked his voice might have been one of the winter winds gusting outside filth this is true it is as it had so often in arguments an emperor for the legion with quintus glabrio her voice began to rise heads all round the tavern turned toward her but scaurus was not glabrio he cut in if the slime you wallow in spreads widely it will be the worse for you do you understand the quiet evenly spaced words reached her when a shouted threat might have been ignored she nodded a quick frightened movement good enough the tribune said he finished his wine at leisure and held up his end of the conversation with nepos when they were both done he pulled coppers from his belt pouch tossed them on the table and strode out nepos at his side that was well done the priest said as they walked back toward the roman camp no rancor matches a former lovers too true marcus agreed a sudden biting breeze blew snow into his face damn its cold he said and pulled his cape up over his mouth and nose he was not sorry for the excuse to keep still once inside the ramparts of the camp he separated from nepos to attend to some business or other he did not re member what it was five minutes later he had other things on his mind he feared damaris was not simply letting her spite run free but had truth behind her slurs frightening her into si lence was easier than quieting his own mind afterward the charge she hissed out fit only too well with too much else he had noticed without thinking about the whole camp knew thanks to damaris and that shrill screech of hers more about glabrios choice of pleasures than was anyones business in itself that might mean anything or nothing but the junior centurion was sharing quarters with gorgidas now and the physician as far as scaurus knew had no use for women recalling how nervous gorgidas had seemed when he said he and glabrio were joining forces marcus suddenly saw a new reason for the doctors hesitancy the tribunes hands curled into fists of all his men why these two two of the ablest and sharpest and two of his closest friends as well he thought of the fustuariwn the roman armys punishment for those who in their full man hood bedded other men he had seen a fustuarium once in gaul on that occasion harry turtledove for an inveterate thief the culprit was dragged into the center of camp and tapped with an officers staff after that he was fair game his comrades fell on him with clubs stones and fists if lucky condemned men died at once marcus visualized gorgidas and quintus glabrio suffering such afate and flinched away in horror from his vision easi est of course would be to forget what he had heard from damaris and trust her fear of him to keep her quiet or so he thought until he tried to dismiss her words the more he tried to shove them away the louder they echoed distracting him putting a raw edge to everything around him he barked at gaius philippus for nothing swatted malric when he would not stop singing the same song over and over the tears which followed did nothing to sweeten scaurus disposition while helvis comforted her son and looked angrily at the tribune he snatched up a heavy cloak and went out into the night muttering there are some things i have to deal with he closed the door on her beginning protest stars snapped in the blueblack winter sky marcus still found their patterns alien and still attached to the groupings the names his legionaries had given them more than a year ago there was the locust there the ballista and there low in the west now the pederasts scaurus shook his head and walked on sandals soundless on snow and soft ground like most cabins the one glabrio and gorgidas shared was shut tight against the nights chill wooden shutters covered its windows the spaces between their slats chinked tight with cloth to ward off the freezing wind only firefly gleams of lamplight peeped through to hint that the thatchroofed hut was occupied the tribune stood in front of the door his hand upraised to knock he bethought himself of the sacred band of thebes of the hundred fifty pairs of lovers who had fought to their deaths at chaeronea against macedons philip and alexander his hand did not fall these were not thebans he led but he hesitated still unable to bring his fist forward through the thin walls of the cabin he heard the junior centu rion and the physician talking though their words were muf fled they sounded altogether at ease with each other gorgidas said something short and sharp and glabrio laughed at him as marcus stood in indecision the image of gaius phi an emperor for the legion harry turtledove lippus rose unbidden to his mind the senior centurion was talking to him just after he brought helvis back to the bar racks no one will care if you bed a woman a boy or a purple sheep so long as you think with your head and not with your crotch where dead greek heroes had not stayed his hand a romans homely advice did if ever two men lived up to gaius philippus standard they were the two inside scaurus slowly walked back to his own hut at peace with himself at last he heard a door open behind him heard quintus glabrio call softly is someone there by then the tribune was around the comer the door closed again on his return scaurus took the scolding he got as one who deserves it which only seemed to irk helvis more sometimes acceptance of blame is the last thing anger wants but if ab sentminded the tribunes apologies were genuine and after a while helvis subsided malric took his undeserved punishment in stride marcus was thankful to see he played with his adopted son until the boy grew drowsy the tribune was almost asleep himself when he happened to recall something he was sure he had forgotten the name of the founder of thebes sacred band it was gorgidas during the winter aptos sheltered valley learned but slowly what passed in the world outside news of amorion came of all things from a fugitive band of yezda the nomads after a quick rcconaissance had decided the town was a tempting target it had no wall was empty of imperial troops and should make easy meat the yezda suffered a rude awakening zemarkhos irregu lars blooded in the vaspurakaner pogrom sent the invaders reeling off in defeat and what they did to the men they caught made it hard to choose between their savagery and the yezdas after listening to the tale spun by the handful of halffro zen nomads gagik bagratouni rumbled low in his throat here is something in my life new to tenderness feel toward yezda i would much give to see amorion bum and ze markhos in it his great scarred hands gripped empty air the brooding glow in his eyes gave him the aspect of a lion denied its prey scaurus understood his vengefulness and took it as a good sign time was beginning to heal the vaspurakaner lord yet the tribune did not altogether agree with bagratouni in this winter of imperial weakness any obstacle against the yezda was worth something zemarkhos and his fanatics were a nasty boil on the body of videssos but the invaders were the plague near midwinter day an armed party of merchants made its way northwest from amorion to aptos braving weather and the risk of attack in hope of reaping higher profits in a town where their kind seldom came so it proved their stocks of spices perfumes fine brocades and elaborately chased brass work vessels from the capital sold at prices better than they could have realized in a city on a more traveled route their leader a muscular craggyfaced fellow who looked more soldier than trader contented himself with remarking aye weve done worse even with his double handful of guardsmen close by he would not say more too many merce nary companies made a sport of robbing merchants he and his comrades were more forthcoming on other mat ters sharing with anyone who cared to listen the news they had picked up on their travels to his surprise marcus learned baanes onomagoulos still lived the videssian general had been badly wounded just before maragha till now scaurus had assumed hed perished either of his wounds or in the pursuit after the battle but if rumor was to be trusted onomagoulos had escaped some sort of army under his command beat back a yezda raid on the southern town of kybistra near the headwaters of the arandos river good for him if its true was gaius philippus com ment but the yarn came a long way before it ever got to us likely as not hes ravens meat himself or else was a hundred miles away bedded down with something lively to keep the cold away good for him if thats true too he sounded wistful as odd from him as diffidence from gor gidas like towns all through the empire aptos celebrated the days after the winter solstice when the sun at last turned north again bonfires burned in front of homes and shops people an emperor for the legion jumped over them for luck men danced in the streets in womens clothing and women dressed as men the local abbot brought his monks down through the marketplace wooden swords in hand to burlesque soldiers tatikios tor cikes turned the tables by leading a dozen shopkeepers in a wicked parody of fat drunken monks aptos celebration was rowdier than the one the romans had seen the year before in imbros the latter was a real city and tried to ape the sophisticated ways of videssos the capital aptos simply celebrated and cared not a fig for the figure it cut the town had no theater or professional mime troupe the locals put on skits in the streets making up with exuberance what they lacked in polish like the ones at imbros their sketches were topical and irreverent tatikios did a quick change with one of the monks and came out dressed as a soldier the rusty old mail shirt he had squeezed into was so tight it threatened to burst every time he moved marcus took a while to recognize his headgear it might have been intended for a roman helmet but the crest ran from ear to ear instead of front to back beside him viridovix chortled gaius philippus jaw was tightly clenched oh oh marcus muttered the senior cen turion wore a transversely crested helm to show his rank tatikios had eyes only for a tall fuzzybearded man who wore a fancy gown much like one nerse phorkaina was fond of every time the mocknoblewoman looked his way though he pulled his cloak over his eyes shivering with fright ill kill that whoreson gaius philippus ground out his hand was on the hilt of his gladius he did not sound as though he was joking nay fool tis all in fun viridovix said last year at imbros they were after scoffing at me for a tavern fight the bards in gaul do the same to a man theres twice the disgrace in showing the taunting hurts is there gaius philippus said after a while to marcus relief he let go of the sword he stood watching till the play let was done but the tribune had seen his face less grim in battle the next skit luckily brought back his good humor it showed what aptos thought of videssos selfproclaimed em peror posturing foolishly a gorgeously dressed young man harp turtledove plainly meant to be ortaias led a squad of monksoldiers down aptos main street suddenly a sixyearold in nomads furs leaped out from between two houses the mockemperor shrieked and clutched at the seat of his robes throwing scepter one way and crown the other he turned and fled trampling half his men in the process thats the way of it faster faster you spalpeen virido vix shouted after him doubled over with laughter aye and give em a goldpiece each as you go gaius philippus echoed no dont or theyll be after you them selves instead of leaving you for the yezda that crack drew cries of agreement from the townsfolk around him as soon as he reached videssos the city ortaias had set the mints churning out a flood of new coins to an nounce and he hoped popularize his reign but his copper and silver pieces were thin and illshaped his gold even more adulterated than his greatuncle strobilos had been none of his tax collectors had yet been seen so far west but rumor said even they would not accept his money demanding instead older purer coins marcus found that the differing real values of coins nomin ally at par made gambling devilishly difficult after more than a year in videssos though he was used to the problem and evening saw him in front of a table in the dancing bear watching the little bone cubes roll ha the suns exclaimed the leader of the merchant company and scooped up the stake the tribune gave the twin ones a sour look not only had they cost him three goldpieces one of them a fine pure coin minted by the emperor rha sios akindynos a hundred twenty years ago to his mind they were by rights a losing throw when the romans played at dice they used three and reckoned the best roll a triple six but to the videssians sixes lost they called a double six the demons it cost a gambler his bet and the dice both one of the other merchants was sitting at scaurus right hes hot tonight the trader crowed three crowns says he makes it again he shoved the bright coins forward they were not videssian issue but minted by some of the petty lords of minerich vaspurakan in the empires westlands they circulated widely the more so because they were of purer gold than recent imperial money marcus covered him with two more from his dwindling an emperor for the legion store of old videssian coins he would have needed six or seven of ortaias wretched issue to match the stake the mer chant captain threw the dice three and live that meant nothing nor did double fours one and marcus had an anx ious second until the other die stopped spinning it was a two whew he said more meaningless rolls followed and still more side bets multiplied at last the trader threw twelve and had to surren der the dice to the man at his left scaurus gathered in the other merchants vaspurakaner gold along with the other bets hed put down as was true of the princes other arts the portraits on their money were executed in a strong blocky style some coins bore square vaspurakaner letters others the more sinuous videssian script behind the tribune a copper basin set on the tavern floor rang like a bell from a welltossed dollop of wine he heard cries of admiration and the clink of money changing hands without looking he was sure gorgidas was winning the ap plause when the greek had found the videssians played kot tabos his joy was undiluted no one in the capital could match him and surely no one in this country town if the locals did not know it yet they soon would the dice traveled slowly round the table when they got to marcus he held them to his mouth to breathe life into them the rational part of his mind insisted such superstitious fool ishness would do no good but it could not hurt so he did it anyway his first several throws were meaningless the videssian game could be slow someone pulled the door of the dancing wolf open shut that will you scaurus grunted without turning around as frigid air knifed into the taverns warmth so we will and wine for everyone to make amends the tribune was on his feet even before a cheer rang through the dancing wolf snow melting on his jacket and in his beard senpat sviodo grinned at him nevrat was right behind her husband marcus rushed over to them hugged them both and pounded their backs what news he demanded you might say hello first nevrat said her dark eyes sparkling with mischief your pardon hello now what news they all laughed but the tribune was not really joking he had been waiting for harry turtledove the vaspurakaners return and worrying over the word they would bring too long for that are you going to throw or not an annoyed gambler called from the table where he had been sitting give us the dice back if you arent marcus flushed realizing he was still holding them nevrat pressed a coin into his hand her fingers were still cold here she said bet this he looked at the goidpiece it was good money not pale with silver or darkened by coppers blush likely from a va spurakaner mint he thought but the inscription on the reverse was in videssian letters by this right above the v ords stood a soldier brandishing a sword scaurus had not seen a coin like it before he turned it over curious to learn what lord had issued it the diemaker was skillful the face on the obverse was no stylized portrait but the picture of a living breathing man he was shaggy of hair and beard with a proud nose and a mouth bracketed by forceful lines the tribune almost felt he knew him scaurus stiffened he did know this man had seen his mouth wide with laughter and straight as a sword blade in wrath the roman looked up at the ceiling and whistled soft and low he noticed the inscription under the portrait bust for the first time avtokrator it said and then a name but he needed no inscription to name thorisin gavras for him when the tribune got back to camp with his news helvis took it like any mercenarys woman this has to mean an other round of civil war she said he nodded she went on both sides will be wild for troops you can sell our swords at a good price civil war be damned said marcus who remembered romes latest one from his childhood the only fight that counts is the one against avshar and yezd any others are distractions the worse they get the weaker the empire be comes for the real test with thorisin as emperor videssos may even have a prayer of winning with ortaias i wouldnt give us six months us helvis looked at him strangely are you a vides sian do you think either emperor would call you one they an emperor for the legion harry turtledove hire swords you have them thats all you can hope to be to them a tool to be used and put aside when no longer needed if ortaias pays you more youre a fool not to take his money the tribune had the uneasy feeling there was a good deal of truth in what she said he thought of his men and goals as different from those of other troops videssos hired but did its overlords probably not but the idea of serving a poltroon like young sphrantzes was too much to stomach if ortaias melted down the golden globe atop the high temple in videssos and gave it all to me i would not fight for him he declared for that matter i dont think my men would take his side either they know him for the coward he is aye courage speaks helvis admitted but she added so does gold and do you think ortaias runs affairs in the city today my guess is he has to ask his uncles leave before he goes to the privy thats worse somehow scaurus muttered ortaias sphrantzes was a fool and a craven his uncle vardanes marcus was sure was neither but try as he might to hide it the elder sphrantzes had a coldly ruthless streak his nephew lacked the roman would have trusted him further if he did not make such an effort to hide his true nature with an affable front it was like perfume on a corpse and made marcus hackles rise he made a clumsy botch of explaining and knew it but the feeling was still in his belly and he did not think any weight of gold could make it leave he also knew he was far from convincing helvis the only principle the namdaleni who fought for videssos knew was expedience the higher the pay and fewer the risks the better she walked over to the small altar shed lately installed on the cabins eastern wall lit a pinch of incense however you decide she said phos deserves to be thanked the sweet fumes quickly filled the small stuffy space when the tribune remained silent she swung round to face him really angry now you should be doing this not me phos alone knows why he gives you such chances when you repay him nothing here she said holding out the little ala baster jar of incense to him that peremptory outthrust hand drove away the mild an swer that might have kept peace between them the tribune growled probably because hes asleep or more likely not there at all her horrified stare made him wish hed held his tongue but he had said too much to back away if your precious phos lets his people be smashed to bloody bits by a pack of devilloving savages what good is he if you must have a god pick one who earns his keep a skilled theologian could have come up with a number of answers to his blunt gibe that phos evil counterpart skotos was the power behind the success of the yezda or that from a namdalener point of view the videssians were misbelievers and therefore not entitled to their gods protection but helvis was challenged on a far more fundamental level sacrilege she whispered and slapped him in the face an instant later she burst into tears malric woke up and started to cry himself go back to sleep scaurus snapped but the tone that would have chilled a legionarys heart only frightened the threeyearold he cried louder looking daggers at the tribune helvis stooped to comfort her son marcus paced up and down too upset to hold still but his anger slowly cooled as malrics wails shrank to whimpers and then to the raspy breathing of sleep helvis looked up at him her eyes wary im sorry i hit you she said tonelessly he rubbed his cheek forget it i was out of turn myself they looked at each other like strangers in too many ways they were despite the child helvis carried what was i think ing scaurus asked himself when i wanted her to share my life from the halfwondering halfmeasuring way she studied him he knew the same thought was in her mind he helped her to her feet the warm contact of the flesh of her hand against his reminded him of one reason at least why the two of them were together though her pregnancy was nearly halfway through it had yet to make much of a mark on her largeboned frame there was a beginning bulge high on her belly and her breasts were growing heavier but someone who did not know her might have failed to notice her bigness but when marcus tried to embrace her she twisted free of his arms what good will that do she asked her back to him it doesnt settle things it doesnt change things it just puts them off and when were angry its no good anyway an emperor for the legion the tribune bit down an angry retort more times than one troubles had dissolved in loves lazy aftermath but her desire had grown fitful since pregnancy began understanding that such things happened scaurus accepted it as best he could tonight though he wanted her and hoped it would help heal the rift between them he moved forward put the palms of his hands on her shoulders she wheeled but not in desire you dont care about me or what i feel at all she blazed all you can think of is your own pleasure ha it was anything but a laugh were that so id have looked elsewhere long before this having swallowed his anger once marcus hit too hard when he finally loosed it helvis began to cry again not with the noisy sobs she had used before but quietly hopelessly making no effort to wipe the tears from her face they were running down her cheeks when she blew out the lamp and as the wicks orange glow died slid beneath the covers of the sleeping mat scaurus stood in darkness some endless while listening to the careful sobs that let out grief without disturbing the sleep ing boy at last he bent down to stroke her through the thick wool not in want but to give what belated comfort he might she flinched away as if from a blow careful not to touch her further the tribune got under the blankets himself the scent of incense was still in his nostrils sweet as death he stared up at the low ceiling though there was nothing to see in the darkness eventually he slept when he woke the roman felt wrung out and used up as after a day in battle helvis face was puffed and blotchy from crying they spoke to each other moved around each other with cautious courtesy neither wanting to reopen last nights wound but scaurus knew it would be a long time healing if it ever did he was glad of the excuse of seeing to his men to leave quickly and helvis seemed relieved to see him go the sol diers of course were oblivious to their commanders private woes they buzzed with excitement over the goldpiece he had come across the tribune managed a wry smile at that he had almost forgotten the coin and its meaning he soon found he had accurately gauged their mood to a harry turtledove man they felt contempt for ortaias sphrantzes the mimes had the right of it minucius said with thorisin gavras alive therell hardly be a fight the other run till he falls off the edge of the world aye the gavras is much better suited for kinging it viridovix agreed a fine talker he is a rare goodlooking wight to boot and the stomach of him can hold a powerful lot of wine gorgidas gave the celt an exasperated look what does any of that have to do with kingship he demanded by your reckoning thorisin gavras would make an excellent sophist a pretty girl marcus blinked at his choice of that figure but had to admit its aptness or a splendid sponge but a king scarcely what the state needs from a king is justice well be damned to you you and your sponges the gaul said forbye be your wouldbe king never so just if he talk like a sausage seller and look like a mouse turd not a soul will pay him any mind at all if youre a leader ye maun fit the part he preened ever so slightly reminding his listeners he had been a noble with a large following himself theres something to that gaius philippus said reluc tant as he was to go along with viridovix on anything he had led enough men to know how much of the art of leadership was style gorgidas dipped his head in reluctant agreement i know there is but its too easy to look the part without having whats really needed to play it take alkibiades for instance the name flew past centurion and celt alike gorgidas sighed and tried another tack asking viridovix what good does it do a king to be able to outdrink his subjects och man the veriest fool should be able to see that after standing the yapping of nitpickers all the day viri dovix stared at gorgidas until the doctor reddening urged him on with a rude gesture what better way to ease the sorrows than with sweet wine he smacked his lips i must be going senile gorgidas muttered in greek to be outargued by a redmustached celt he let the sentence trail off as he walked away marcus left the discussion too walking out to the frozen fields to watch his soldiers exercise laon pakhymers kha trishers darted here and there on horseback wheeling twist ing suddenly stopping short others practiced mounted an emperor for the legion archery sending shafts slamming through heapedup mounds of straw for all their camaraderie with the romans they were still very much a separate command the foot soldiers now were something else again the hundreds of stragglers who had joined the romans after ma ragha as well as gagik bagratounis refugees were beginning to blend into the legionaries ranks their beards and the sleeves on their mail shirts still gave videssians and vaspura kaners an exotic look but constant practice was making them as adept with pilwn and stabbing gladius as any son of italy phostis apokavkos gave the tribune a wave and a leathery grin scaurus smiled back he still felt good about taking the farmersoldier out of the capitals slums and making a legion ary of him but then apokavkos had adopted the romans as much as they him shaving his face and picking up latin to become as much like his new comrades as he could his tall lean frame almost hid doukitzes beside him they were fast friends scaurus sometimes wondered why dou kitzes was the sort of man phostis had refused to become during his hungry time in videssos the city a smalltime thief the tribune had saved doukitzes from losing his hand to mavrikios angry judgment not long before maragha perhaps in gratitude he had not plied his trade or at least had not been caught since joining the romans after the battle he waved too a little more hesitantly than apokavkos marcus watched their maniple let fly with a volley of practicepi a he had a good little army he thought with somber pride that was as well it would need to be good soon enough out of the comer of his eye he caught a motion decidedly not military arms round one anothers waists intent only on each other senpat sviodo and nevrat were making their slow happy way to their cabin the sudden stab of envy was like a knife twisting in scaurus guts the feelings intensity was frightening the more so because only weeks before he had been half of such a pair the world of the legions was simpler he decided private life would not run by the brute simplicity of orders he sighed shook his head and turned back to make what peace he could with helvis iv the swarthy khamorth scout wearing graybrown foxskins and mounted on a duncolored shaggy pony was like a lump of winter mud against the bright green of spring studying the plainsman closely marcus asked him how do i know youre from thorisin gavras weve seen snares be fore the nomad gave back a contemptuous stare he had no more use than his distant yezda cousins for towns plowed fields or the folk who cherished them but he had sworn loyalty to gavras on his sword and his clanchief and the imperial contestant had drunk wine mixed with their two bloods therefore he answered in his bad videssian he bid me ask you what he say about excitable women that morning in his tent that theyre great fun but they wear the tribune an swered instantly satisfied he remembered the morning in question only too well having been afraid thorisin was about to arrest him for treason he was surprised gavras also re called it the thensevastokrator had been very drunk you right the khamorth nodded he grinned a male grin that cut across all differences in way of life he right too theres something to it marcus agreed and smiled back by thorisins standards though helvis hardly counted as excitable the truce between her and scaurus brittle at first had firmed as winter passed if there were things they no an emperor for the legion harry turtledove longer spoke of the tribune thought surely that was a small enough price to pay for peace any peace with a price on it part of his mind said for the hundredth time is too dearly bought for the hundredth time the rest of him shouted that part down the plainsman had said something while he was in his reverie im sorry the disdain was back on the nomads face what good was this fellow if he would not even listen scaurus felt himself flush speaking as if to an idiot child the khamorth repeated you be ready to break camp three days time thorisin his men so far behind me i ride west meet them bring here to you to join you be ready excitement boiled in the tribune three days time and he would be cut off from the world no longer three days time to break a camp that had housed his men for a season if the romans could not do it they did not deserve their name well be ready he said the plainsmen swept a skeptical eye over ditch palisade and the townlet that had grown up inside them to him and his getting ready to leave a place was a matter of minutes not hours or days three days time he said once more he made it sound like a warning without waiting for an answer he wheeled his little horse and trotted away from his attitude he had already wasted enough of this fine riding day on fanner folk a khatrisher posted at the eastern end of aptos valley waved his fur cap over his head close by marcus laon pa khymer waved back to show the signal was understood thor isin gavras outriders were in sight the picket came gallop ing back form up the tribune yelled the buccinators trumpets and comets echoed his command his foot soldiers romans and newcomers together quickmarched to their positions be hind the nine manipular standards the signa even after a year and a half without it scaurus still missed the legionary eagle his detachment had not rated beside the infantry assembled the khatrisher horsemen pakhymer did not try to form them into neat ranks they looked like what they were irregulars longer on toughness than order most of aptos population lined the road into town fa thers carried small boys and girls pickaback so they could see over the crowd phos alone knew when next an emperor even one with so uncertain a right to that title would come this way from the talk hed heard since the khamorth scout ap peared marcus knew half the rustics were wondering whether the hooves of thorisins horse would touch the ground those who knew better like phorkos widow nerse were there too ahhh said the townsmen still small in the distance the first pair of thorisin gavras cavalry came into view they carried parasols and scaurus knew them for the videssian equivalent of romes lictors with axes and bundles of fasces the symbols that power resided here another pair followed and another until a dozen bright silk flowers bloomed ahead of gavras men the full imperial number right enough straining his eyes the tribune saw thorisin himself close behind them mounted on a fine bay horse only his scarlet boots made any personal claim to rank the rest of his gear was good but no more than that not even assuming the imperium could make him fond of its trappings his army rumbled down the road behind him almost all cavalry as was the videssian way of all the nations the em pire knew only the halogai preferred to fight afoot roman infantry tactics had been an eyeopener here gavras troops were about evenly divided between videssians and vaspura kaners no wonder he had coined money to the princes standard of weight goodlooking men gaius philippus remarked and scaurus nodded the unconscious arrogance with which they rode said volumes about the confidence thorisin had drilled into them after the disaster in front of maragha that was no mean feat marcus spirits rose he tried to gauge how many warriors accompanied gavras as they came toward him maybe a thousand in the valley so far now two three thousand no probably not that many for they had a goodsized baggage train in their midst say twentyfive hundred a good solid first division the tribune thought in a mo ment the rest of the army would show itself and then he would have a better idea of its real capabilities thorisin spot an emperor for the legion harry turtledove ted him in front of his assembled troops and gave him quite an unimperial wave wanned inside he waved back it was certainly taking enough time for the next units van to appear marcus reached up to scratch his head felt foolish as fingers rasped on the iron of his helmet hercules gaius philippus muttered under his breath i think thats all of them marcus wanted to laugh or cry or better both at once this was thorisin gavras allconquering horde with which he would reclaim videssos from the usurper and drive the yezda out of the empire counting pakhymers few hundred he had almost this many men himself yet as gavras parasol bearers rode past the assembled in habitants of aptos they bowed low to give honor to the em peror and as thorisin brought his forces up to the troops marcus had drawn up in review laon pakhymer went to his knees and then to his belly in a full proskynesis giving him formal reverence as sovereign so did gagik bagratouni and zeprin the red who stood near scaurus the roman true to his homelands republican ways had never prostrated himself for mavrikios he did not do so now contenting himself with a deep bow he remembered how fu rious the younger gavras had been the first time he failed to bend the knee to the emperor now thorisin reined in his horse in front of the tribune and said with a dry chuckle still stubborn as ever arent you directly addressed marcus lifted his head to study the em peror at close range thorisin still sat his stallion with the same jauntiness that had endeared him to videssos citizenry when he was but mavrikios brother still kept the ironic gleam in his eye that made one ever uncertain how seriously to take him but there was a harder somehow more finished look to him than the roman remembered it was very much like mavrikios come again your majesty would you recognize me any other way scaurus asked thorisin smiled for a moment his gaze traveled up and down the silent roman ranks estimating their numbers just as the tribune had reckoned his you give yourself too little credit he said id know you by the wizardry that let you bring your troop out so near intact you were there at the worst of it werent you scaurus shrugged the worst of it had been where mavri kios haloga bodyguard had fought for the emperor to the last man and perished with him at the end he said nothing of that but thorisin read it in his eyes his smile slipped there will be a reckoning he said quietly more than one in fact the matteroffact promise in his voice almost made it pos sible to forget that mavrikios had failed against the yezda with an army of over fifty thousand men his brother was undertak ing that task along with simultaneous civil war and his forces even adding in the romans and their comrades were less than a tenth as great if youve a mind to thorisin said to marcus you can dismiss your troopers a little ceremonial takes me a long way gather your officers together round up some wine and well talk so the pipsqueak really did start the rout thorisin mused id heard it before but it galled me to believe it even of ortaias he shook his head one more reason for dealing with him as if i needed another bareheaded a mug in his hand his redbooted feet propped on a table he looked like any longtime soldier tak ing his ease after travel his commanders videssians and vaspurakaners both were as nonchalant mavrikios had used the elaborate imperial ceremonies to enhance his own dignity though he thought them foolisn thorisin simply could not be bothered he listened closely as scaurus told of the romans wan derings slapped his thigh with his left hand when the roman explained how he had used hannibals trick to free himself from the yezda turning flocks back on the nomads eh a fine ploy and only just he said the tribune did not mention avshars parting gift to him as soon as the khamorth scout let him know thorisin was nearby he had buried mavrikios head with a real gavras very much present the risk of a false one seemed smaller enough of this chatter about us viridovix said to the roman he turned to thorisin asking him where was it you disappeared to man for months not a one of us knew if you were alive or dead or off in fairyland to come back a hundred years from now the which would be no use at all to anybody thorisin took no offense which was as well viridovix an emperor for the legion curbed his tongue for no one his tale was about what the tribune had expected his mauled right wing of the great vi dessian army had been pushed back into vaspurakans moun tain fastnesses terrain even more rugged than that which the romans had crossed there much of the army had melted away beaten soldiers slipping off singly or in small groups to try to make their way eastward gaius philippus nodded commenting its what i would have guessed looking at the men you have with you the peasant levies and fainthearts are long gone dead or fled thats the way of it thorisin agreed in one important respect the younger gavras troops had had a harder time of it than the romans the yezda made a real pursuit after them and it took two or three bitter rear guard actions to shake free it was that cursed whiterobed devil one of the videssian officers said he stuck tighter than a leech aye and sucked more blood too marcus and his entire party leaned forward suddenly alert so avshar was trailing you then the tribune said no wonder there was no sign of him in these parts we had no idea what was keeping him out of videssos i still dont gavras admitted he disappeared a couple of weeks after the battle and i have no idea where he is as much as anything his going saved us without him the yezda are fierce enough but a rabble with him thorisin fell silent from his expression the words stuck in his mouth were not to his taste the officer who had mentioned avshar indakos sky litzes his name was asked marcus has amorion gone mad we sent a man there to proclaim thorisin and they horsewhipped him out of town for a day we thought he might not live phos little suns even in civil war heralds have some rights as a videssian baron skylitzes knew whereof he spoke its zemarkhos city now and his word is law there marcus said he paused as a new thought struck him was your envoy a vaspurakaner by any chance skylitzes looked uncertain but thorisin nodded haik amazasp i should say so what has that to do with oh his scowl deepened as he remembered how amorions fanatic priest had wanted to start his persecution of the heretics with r harry turtledove imperial backing ortaias is welcome to his support not that hell get much use from him youll avenge us senpat sviodo exclaimed eagerly you wont regret it amorion is a perfect place to push east you know that as well as i the young vaspurakaner came halfway out of his seat in enthusiasm gagik bagratouni began to rise too more slowly but with a frightening sense of pur pose thorisin though waved them down once more no were after videssos the city nothing else with it the whole em pire falls to us without it none of the rest is truly ours seeing their outraged disappointment he went on if you dont mind your revenge at second hand i think youll get it the namdaleni are moving east out of phanaskert and i ex pect amorion will be in their line of march theyll bring the town down around zemarkhos ears if he squawks of heresy at them and he will hes bigot enough gavras contemplated the meeting with equanimity even grim amusement so after a moment did the vaspurakaners scaurus was ready to agree any trap that closed on the namdaleni would be kicked open from the inside by six or seven thousand heavyarmed cavalry so the men of the duchy were on the move too were they he thought armies were flowing like driblets from melting icicles after the winter freeze something else occurred to him the namdaleni had a good many more soldiers hereabouts than thorisin did he asked what sort of understanding do you have with the easterners mutual mistrust as always gavras answered if they see their way clear theyll go for our throats i dont intend to give them the chance maybe onomagoulos men can come up from the south to help keep an eye on them marcus suggested it was the emperors turn to be startled what baanes is alive if traders tales can be trusted gaius philippus said still doubting the merchants rumor he set it forth for thorisin who did not seem to find anything improbable in it well well good for the old fox theres tricks left in him after all gavras murmured but he did not sound overjoyed to scaurus an emperor for the legion when aptos disappeared behind a bend in the road gaius philippus heaved a long sigh first time in full many a year im sorry to be on the move once more he said by the gods why marcus asked surprised marching under a spring sky was one of the pleasures of a soldiers life the last rains had given the foothills a carpet of new grass and were recent enough to keep videssos dirt roads from turning into choking ribbons of dust the air was fine and mild al most tasty and sweetly clamorous with the calls of returning birds even the butterflies looked fresh their bright wings not yet tattered and tarnished by time canna you tell viridovix said to scaurus the puir lads heart is all broken in flinders or would be if he re membered where he mislaid it oh be damned to you gaius philippus said the mea sure of his upset shown by his falling into the celts idiom for a moment marcus honestly had no idea of what viri dovix was talking about or why the senior centurion took the gibe seriously when he stopped to think though an answer did occur to him nerse he asked phorkos widow what if it is gaius philippus muttered plainly sorry hed said anything at all well why didnt you court her then the tribune burst out but gaius philippus was doing no more talking the vet eran set his jaw and stared straight ahead as he marched en during viridovix teasing without snapping back after a while the celt grew bored of his unrewarding fun and went off to talk about swordplay with minucius studying gaius philippus grim expression marcus came to his own conclusions strange that a man who was utterly fearless in battle and who took fornication and rape as part of the warriors trade should be scared witless of paying suit to a woman for whom he felt something more than lust thorisin gavras army hurried northeast toward the shore of the videssian sea gavras hoped to commandeer shipping and swoop down on ortaias in the capital before the usurper could make ready to meet him but at each port his troops approached shipmasters hurried their vessels out to sea and sent them fleeing to bring young sphrantzes word of his com ing harry turtledove the third time that happened at a fishing village called tavas thorisins short temper neared the snapping point for two coppers id sack the place he snarled pacing up and down like a caged tiger watching a bulky merchantmans brightly dyed sails recede into sea mist as it drove north out of the bay of rhyax before turning east for the long run to vi dessos he spat in disgust bah whats left here half a dozen fishing boats phos willing i could put a good dozen men in each you ought to pillage these faithless traders and peasants teach them to fear you komitta rhangavve said walking beside him the fierce expression on her lean aristocratic features made her resemble a hunting hawk beautiful but deadly alarmed at the bloodthirsty advice gavras lady gave scaurus said hastily perhaps its as well the merchant got away ortaias must be forewarned by now in any case if the fleet in the city stands with him hed smash anything you could scrape together here komitta rhangavve glared at even this indirect disagree ment but thorisin sighed a heavy frustrated sound youre probably right if i could have brought it off at prakana though four days ago he sighed again what was that thing poor khoumnos used to say if ifs and buts were can died nuts then everyone would be fat nephon khoumnos though was half a year dead struck down by avshars sorcery at the battle before maragha neither gavras nor marcus found that a pleasant thought to dwell on returning rather more directly to rebutting komitta the tribune said at least the people hereabouts are for you whatever the shipmasters do the emperors smile was still sour of course they are weve come far enough east that folk have had a good taste of ortaias taxmen aye and of his money too though theyd break teeth if they tried to bite it sphrantzes wretched coin age was a standing joke in his opponents army as for his revenue agents scaurus had yet to see one they ran from thorisin even faster than the navarchs did five days later came an envoy of ortaias who did not flee accompanied by a guard force of ten horsemen he rode delib an emperor for the legion erately up to thorisins camp at evening one of the troopers bore a whitepainted shield on a spearstaff a sign of truce what can the henhearted wretch have to say to me thorisin snapped but let the emissarys party approach the soldiers with sphrantzes agents were nonentities the hard shell of a nut good only for protecting the kernel within the envoy himself was something else again marcus recognized him as one of vardanes sphrantzes henchmen but could not recall his name thorisin had no such difficulty ah pikridios how good to see you he said but there was venom in his voice pikridios goudeles affected not to notice the bureaucrat dismounted with a sigh of relief hed sat his horse badly from the look of his hands the reins would have hurt them they were soft and white their only callus on the right middle finger a penpusher right enough scaurus thought feeling the aptness of the videssian soldierys contemptuous term for the empires civil servants yet for all his unwarlike look the small dapper goudeles was a man to be reckoned with his dark eyes gleamed with ironic intelligence and the quality of his nerve was adequately attested by his very presence in the rival emperors camp your majesty he said to thorisin and went to one knee his head bowed not a proskynesis but the next thing to it some of gavras soldiers cheered to see their lord so ac claimed by his foes ambassador others growled because the acclamation was incomplete thorisin himself seemed taken aback get up get up he said impatiently goudeles rose brushing dust from the knee of his elegant riding breeches he made no move to speak further the silence stretched at last conceding the point to him thorisin broke it well what now are you here to turn your worthless coat what price do you want for it beneath the thin fringe of mustache so like vardanes scaurus noticed perhaps irrelevantly perhaps not gou deles lip gave a delicate curl as if to say he had noticed the insult but did not quite care to acknowledge it my lord se vastokrator i am merely here to help resolve the unfortunate misunderstanding between yourself and his imperial majesty the avtokrator ortaias sphrantzes every trooper who heard that shouted in outrage hands tightened on sword hilts reached for spears and bows string harry turtledove the little bastard up someone yelled maybe after hes hung a while hell know who the real emperor is three or four men sprang forward goudeles selfcontrol wavered he shot an appealing glance at thorisin gavras thorisin waved his soldiers back they withdrew slowly stiffly like dogs whistled off a kill they think theirs by right whats going on gaius philippus whispered to marcus if this rogue wont own gavras as emperor by rights hes fair game your guess is as good as mine the tribune answered with gavras hot temper scaurus had expected him to deal roughly with goudeles ambassador or no in civil war such niceties of usage were easy enough to cast aside it was lucky komitta was not in earshot of all this he thought she would already be heating pincers yet thorisins manner remained mild though a warrior by choice he had known his share of intrigue as well and his years at his brothers right hand in the capital made him alert to subtleties less experienced men could miss voice still calm he asked goudeles so you do not reckon me rightful avtokrator eh regrettably i do not my lord goudeles said half bowing nor does my principal his glance at thorisin was wary they were fencing as surely as if they had sabers to hand just a damned rebel am i goudeles spread his soft hands gave a fastidious shrug then by skotos dungsplattered beard thorisin pounced why does your bloody principal he made the word an oath still style me sevastokrator is that his bribe to me keeping a title hell make sure is empty tell your precious sphrantzes i am not so cheaply bought the envoy from the capital looked artfully pained at gavras crudity you fail to understand my lord why should you not remain sevastokrator the title was yours during your deeply mourned brothers reign and you are still close kin to the imperial house thorisin stared at him as if he had started speaking some obscure foreign tongue are you witstruck man the sphrantzai are no kin of mine i share no blood with jackals once again the insult failed to make an impression on an emperor for the legion goudeles he said then your majesty has not yet heard the joyous news how slowly it travels in these outlying dis tricts what are you yapping of gavras demanded but his voice was suddenly tense his quarry vulnerable at last goudeles thrust home with suave precision surely the avtokrator will pay you all re spect due a fatherinlaw putting you in the late emperors place why it must be more man a month now since his daughter alypia and my lord ortaias were united in wedlock thorisin went white voice thick with rage he choked out flee now while you still have breath in you and goudeles and his guardsmen with no ceremony whatever leaped on their horses and rode for their lives gaius philippus took a characteristically pungent view of the marriage itll do ortaias less good than he thinks he said if hes the same kind of lover as he is a general hell have to take a book to bed to know what to do with her remembering the military tome constantly under sphrantzes arm scaurus had to smile but alone in his tent with helvis and the sleeping malric later that evening he burst out it was a filthy thing to do as good as rape joining alypia to the house her father hated why so offended helvis asked she was very bulky now uncomfortable and often irritable with a womans bit ter realism she went on are we ever anything but pawns in the game of power beyond the politics of it why should you care the politics are bad enough the marriage forced or not could only rob thorisin gavras of support and gain it for ortaias and his uncle helvis was right though marcus anger was more personal than for his cause from the little i knew of her i rather liked her he confessed what has that to do with the price of fish helvis de manded since the day you came to videssos youve known the contest you were in aye and played it well ill not deny but its not one with much room for things as small as likes scaurus winced at that harsh picture of his career in his adopted homeland in videssos scheming was natural as drawing breath no one who hoped to advance could escape it altogether harry turtledove but alypia gavra he thought should not fall victim to it merely by accident of birth behind the schooled reserve with which she met the world the tribune had felt a gentleness this unconsented marriage would mar forever the image of her brought miserable and defenseless to ortaias bed made cold fury flash behind his eyes and how he asked himself am i going to say that to helvis without lighting a suspicion in her better left unkin died not seeing any way he kept his mouth shut sentries shouts woke scaurus at earliest dawn stumbling to his feet he threw on a heavy wool mantle and hurried out to see what the trouble was gaius philippus was at the ram part before him sword in hand wearing only helmet and san dals marcus followed the veterans pointing finger there was motion at the edge of sight in the east visible at all only because silhouetted against the paling sky i give you two guesses the senior centurion said you can have the first one back i know an army when i see it shows how sincere goudeles talk of thorisin being an honored fatherinlaw was doesnt it as if we needed showing well lets be at it the vet erans bellow made up for the comets and trumpets of the stillsleeping buccinators up you weedy worthless good fornothings up theres work to do today romans tumbled from their tents pulling on corselets and tightening straps as they rushed to their places campfires banked during the night were fed to new life to light the run ning soldiers paths marcus and gaius philippus looked at each other and in looking realized they were hardly clad for battle gaius phi lippus cursed they dashed for their tents when the tribune emerged a couple of minutes later he led his troops out to deploy in front of their fortified camp pa khymers light cavalry screened their lines the khatrishers winterlong association with the romans made them as quick to be ready as the legionaries the rest of thorisin gavras forces were slower in emerging there was no time to plan elaborate strategies thorisin rode up on his highbred bay grunted approval at the romans an emperor for the legion quiet steadiness youll be on the right he said stay firm and well smash them against you good enough marcus nodded less mobile than the mounted contingents of standard videssian warfare his in fantry usually got a holding role as gavras cavalry came into line the tribune swung pakhymer over to his own right to guard against outflanking moves from the foe a rare lovely day it is for a shindy isnt it now virido vix said his mail shirt was painted in squares of black and gold imitating the checkered pattern of a gallic tunic a sevenspoked wheel crested his bronze helm his sword a twin to scaurus was still in its scabbard his hand held no thing more menacing than a chunk of hard dry bread he took a healthy bite the tribune envied him his calm the thought of food re pelled him before combat though afterwards he was always ravenous it was a beautiful morning still a bit crisp with nights chill squinting into the bright sunrise scaurus said their general knows his business whoever he is an early morning fight puts the sun in our faces aye so it does doesnt it what a rare sneaky thing to think of the celt said admiringly ortaias army was less than half a mile away now coming on at a purposeful trot it looked no larger than the one back ing thorisin marcus saw with relief he wondered what part of the total force of the sphrantzai it contained it was cavalry as the tribune had known it would be he felt the hoofbeats like approaching thunder quintus glabrio gave his maniple some last instructions when you use your pila throw at their horses not the men theyre bigger targets less well armored and if a horse goes down he takes his rider with him as always the junior centurions tone was measured and under firm control there was no time for more speechmaking than that the enemy was very close in the daybreak glare it was still hard to see just what manner of men they were some had the scrubby look of nomads khamorth or even yezda while others lanceheads gleamed briefly crimson as they swung down in a disciplined flurry namdaleni marcus thought grimly the sphrantzai hired the best drax drax the great count drax shouted the men of the duchy using their commanders name as war cry harp turtledove at them thorisin gavras yelled and his own horsemen galloped forward to meet the charge bowstrings snapped a namdalener tumbled from his saddle unluckily hit below the eye at long range the enemys light horse darted in front of the namdaleni to volley back at thorisins men but the field was now too tight for their hitandrun tactics to be used to full effect more sturdily mounted and more heavily armed the videssians and vaspurakaners who followed gavras hewed their way through the nomads toward the men of the duchy who were the op posing armys core the count drax was newcome from the duchy the only foot worth its pay hed seen was that of the halogai of romans he knew nothing he took them for peasant levies thorisin had scraped up from phos knew where crush them quickly he decided and then deal with gavras outnumbered cavalry at leisure with a wave of his shield to give his men direction he spurred his mount at the legionaries drymouthed scaurus waited to receive the charge the pounding hooves the rhythmic shouting of the big men rush ing toward him like armored boulders the long lances that all seemed aimed at his chest he could feel his calves tensing with the involuntary urge to flee longsword in hand his right arm swung up drax frowned in sudden doubt if these were drafted farmers why were they not running for their paltry lives loose the tribune shouted a volley of pila flew for ward and another and another horses screamed swerved and fell as they were hit pitching riders headlong to the ground other beasts stumbled over the first ones down namdaleni who caught roman javelins on their shields cursed and threw them away the soft iron shanks of the pila bent with ease fouling the shields beyond use still the legionaries sagged before the slowed charges momentum trumpets blared calling squads from the flank to hold the embattled center the mounted surge staggered stalled turned to melee the knight who came at scaurus was about forty with a an emperor for the legion cast in his right eye and a twisted little finger near immobile in the press he jabbed at the tribune with his lance marcus parried ducking under the thrust his strong blade bit through the wood below the lancehead which flew spinning eyes wide with fear the namdalener swung the ruined lance as he might a club scaurus ducked again stepped up and thrust felt his point pierce chain and flesh sphrantzes mercenary gave a shriek that ended in a bubbling moan scarlet foam on his lips he slid to the ground close by zeprin the red raised his longhafted haloga war axe high above his helmet to bring it crashing down on a horses head brains flew pinkgray the horse foundered like a ship striking a jagged rock pinned under it its namdalener rider screamed with a broken ankle but not for long a sec ond stroke of the great axe silenced him for good an unhorsed mercenary slashed at scaurus who took the blow on his shield his scutum was bigger and heavier than the horsemans lighter shield marcus shoved out with it the man of the duchy stumbled backwards tripped on a corpses upthrust foot a legionary drove a stabbingsword into his throat though the namdalener charge was checked they still fought with the skill and fierceness marcus had come to know foulmouthed lucilius stood staring at his broken sword the hard steel snapped across by a cunning lance stroke well fetch me a whole one he shouted but before anybody could a man of the duchy rode him down by all the gods why arent these bastards on our side theyre too bloody much work to fight gaius philippus panted there was a great dent in the right side of his helmet and blood flowed down his face from a cut over one eye the tide of battle swept them apart before scaurus could answer a namdalener stabbed down at someone writhing on the ground before him he missed swore and brought his blade back for another stroke so intent was he on his kill that he never noticed marcus until the tribunes gallic longsword drank his life marcus pulled the wouldbe victim up then stared in dis belief grace said nevrat sviodo and kissed him full on the mouth the shock was as great as if hed taken a wound slim saber in hand she slipped back into battle leaving him gaping after her hairy turtledove watch your left sir someone cried the tribune jerked up his shield in reflex response a lancehead glanced off it the namdalener swept by without time for another blow marcus shook himself surprise had almost cost him his neck with a banshee whoop viridovix leaped up behind a mounted mercenary and dragged him from his horse he jerked up the luckless mans chin drew sword across his throat like a bow over a viols strings blood fountained the gaul shouted in triumph sawed through windpipe and back bone he lifted the dripping head and hurled it into the close packed ranks of the namdaleni who cried out in horror as they recoiled from the grisly trophy the count drax was not altogether sorry to see retreat begin these foot soldiers of thorisins whoever they were fought like no foot he had met they bent but would not break rushing men from quiet spots along the line to meet threats so cleverly that no new points of weakness appeared quite professional he thought with reluctant admiration from his left wing the khatrishers were spraying his boggeddown men with arrows and then darting away just as he had hoped his hireling nomads would to thorisin gavras heavy horse but his clans of plainsmen were squeezed be tween his own men and the oncoming enemy soon they would break and run to stand against this kind of punish ment was not in them with a wry smile drax of namdalen realized it was not in him either when gavras cavalry broke through the nomads and stormed into his stalled knights the result would be un pleasant and in the end a mercenary captains loyalty was to himself not to his paymaster without men he would have nothing to sell he reined in tried to wheel his horse among his tight packed countrymen break off he shouted and back to our camp keep your order by the wager marcus heard the counts shout to his men but was not sure he understood it among themselves the namdaleni used a broad patois quite different from the videssian spoken in the empire yet he soon realized what drax must have ordered for pressure eased all along the line as the men of the duchy r an emperor for the legion ham turtledove broke off combat it was skillfully done the namdaleni knew their business and left the legionaries few openings for mis chief the tribune did not pursue them far in part he was ruled by the same concern that governed drax not to spend his men unwisely moreover the notion of infantry chasing horsemen did not appeal if the namdaleni spun round and counterat tacked they could cut off and destroy big chunks of his small force in loose order the romans would be horribly vulnerable to the tough mounted lancers gavras cavalry and the khatrishers followed sphrantzes men for a mile or two harassing their retreat trying to turn it to rout but when the romans were not added in the namda leni and their nomad outriders probably outnumbered the forces opposed to them they withdrew in good order scaurus looked up in the sky amazed the sun which had but moments before or so it seemed blazed straight into his face as it rose was well west of south marcus realized he was tired hungry dry as the videssian plateau in summer and in desperate need of easing himself a slash on his sword hand he did not remember getting began to throb the more so when sweat ran down his arm into it he flexed his fingers they all moved no tendon was cut legionaries were plundering the corpses of their fallen op ponents others cut the throats of wounded horses and of those namdaleni so badly hurt as to be beyond hope of recov ery foes with lesser injuries got the same rough medical treatment the romans did they could be ransomed later and hence were more valuable alive than dead seriously wounded romans were carried back into camp on litters for such healing as gorgidas and nepos could give marcus found the fat priest directing a double handful of women as they cleaned and bandaged wounds of gorgidas there was no sign surprised at that scaurus asked where the greek doctor was dont you know one of nepos helpers exclaimed and began to giggle the tribune worn out as he was could make no sense of that he stared foolishly nepos said gently youll find him at your own tent scaurus what why is he oh marcus said he began to run though a moment before simply standing on his feet had been almost beyond him in fact gorgidas was not in the tribunes tent but coming back the way scaurus was going dodging the tribune he said greetings how went your stupid battle we won marcus answered automatically but but he sputtered and ran out of words for once there were more urgent things than warfare rest easy my friend you have a son his spare features alight gorgidas took the tribunes arm is helvis all right marcus demanded though the smile on the physicians face told him nothing could be seriously amiss as well as could be expected better id say one of the easier births ive seen less than half a day shes a bighipped girl and it was not her first yes shes fine thank you scaurus said and would have hurried on but gorgidas kept the grip on his arm the tribune turned round once more gorgidas was still smiling but his eyes were pensive and far away i envy you he said slowly it must be a marvelous feeling it is marcus said startled at the depth of sadness in the doctors voice he wondered if gorgidas had meant to lay himself so bare yet at the same time was touched by the physicians trust thank you he said again their eyes met in a moment of complete understanding it passed and gorgidas was his astringent self once more go on with you he said lightly pushing the tribune for ward i have enough to do trying to patch the fools whod sooner take life than give it shaking his head he made his way down to the injured men not far away minucius companion erene was with helvis her own daughter scarcely two months old asleep in the crook of her arm the inside of the tribunes tent smelled of blood the hot rusty scent as thick as scaurus had ever known it on the field truly he thought women fought battles of their own perhaps expecting to see gorgidas again erene started when marcus still sweating in his armor pulled open the tentflap she knew at once why he had come but had her own concerns as well is minucius safe she asked anxiously yes hes fine marcus answered unconsciously echoing an emperor for the legion gorgidas a few minutes before hardly a scratch hes a clever fighter his voice woke helvis who had been dozing scaurus stooped beside her kissed her gently erene her fears at rest slipped unnoticed from the tent the smile helvis gave the tribune was a tired one her soft brown hair was all awry and still matted with sweat purple circles were smudged under her eyes but there was a triumph in them as she lifted the small blanket of soft lambswool and offered it to scaurus yes let me see him marcus said carefully taking the light burden from her him youve already seen gorgidas helvis accused but marcus was not listening he looked down at the face of his newbom son he looks like you helvis said softly what nonsense the baby was red wrinkled flat nosed and almost bald he looked scarcely human let alone like anyone in particular his wide grayblue eyes passed across the tribunes face then returned and seemed to settle for a moment the baby wiggled scaurus unaccustomed to such things nearly dropped him an arm came free of the swaddling blan ket a tiny fist waved in the air marcus cautiously extended a finger the groping hand touched it closed in a grasp of sur prising strength the tribune marveled at its miniature perfec tion palm and wrist pinknailed fingers and thumb all compressed into a space no longer than the first two joints of his middle finger helvis misunderstood his examination hes complete she said ten fingers ten toes all where they should be they laughed together the noise startled the baby who began to cry give him to me helvis said and snuggled him against her in her more knowing hold the baby soon quieted do we name him as we planned she asked i suppose so the tribune sighed not altogether happy with a bargain theyd made months before he would have preferred a purely roman name with some good latin prae nomen ahead of the aemilii scauris longestablished nomen and cognomen helvis had argued though and with justice that such a name slighted her side of their sons ancestry thus they decided the childs usename would be dosti after her harry turtledove father when heavier style was needed he had a sonorous patronymic dosti the son of aemilius scaurus marcus said rolling it off his tongue he suddenly chuckled looking at his tiny son helvis glanced up curiously for now he explained the little fellows name is longer than he is youre out of your mind she said but she was smiling still the early summer sun stood tall in the sky the city videssos capital and heart of the empire that bore its name gleamed under the bright gaze white stucco and marble tawny sandstone brick the color of blood the myriad golden globes on phos temples all seemed close enough to reach out and touch even when seen from the western shore of the strait the videssians called the cattlecrossing but between the army on that western shore and the object of its desire swung an endlessly patrolling line of bronze beaked warships ortaias sphrantzes might have lost the transmarine suburbs of the capital but when his forces pulled out they left behind few vessels larger than a fishing smack not even thorisin gavras impetuosity made him eager to risk a crossing in the face of the enemy fleet balked from advancing further his frustration grew with his army he summoned an officers council to what had been the local governors residence until that bureaucrat fled to or taias an eastfacing window of clear glass gave a splendid view of the cattlecrossing and videssos the city beyond marcus suspected gavras had chosen the meeting place as a goad to his generals baanes onomagoulos said thorisin without ships of our own well stay here till we die of old age and thats how it is we could have ten times the men we do and they wouldnt be worth a counterfeit copper to us we have to get control of the sea he thumped his stick on the table his wound had left his right leg shrunken and lame harry turtledove thorisin glared at him not so much for what he said but for the patronizing way he said it short lean and bald ono magoulos had a hard bignosed face he had been mavrikios gavras comrade since they were boys but had never quite got the idea that the dead emperors little brother was now a man in his own right i cant wish ships here thorisin snapped the sphrant zai pay their captains well if no one else they know theyre all thats keeping their heads from going up on the milestone privately marcus thought that an exaggeration along with videssos proud buildings and elegant gardens its fortifica tions the mightiest the roman had ever seen were visible from this seaside house even with the cattlecrossing some how overleaped an assault on that double line of frowning dun walls was enough to daunt any soldier one problem at a time he thought onomagoulos is right i tink witout ships you fail why not get dem from the duchy utprand dagobers son entered the debate for the first time his island accent almost thick enough to pass for that of the namdalenis haloga cousins his men were newcome to the seacoast having marched and fought their way from phanaskert clear across the videssian westlands now theres a notion thorisin said dryly plainly he did not much like it but utprands forces had swelled his own by a third it behooved him to walk soft the namdalener smiled a wintry smile winter seemed at home in his eyes the chill blue of the ice his northern ances tors left behind when they took namdalen from the empire two hundred years before matching gavras irony for irony he asked you cannot misdoubt our good fait surely not thorisin replied and there were chuckles up and down the table the duchy of namdalen had been a mom in videssos flesh since its stormy birth its haloga con querors did not stay rude pirates long but learned much from their more civilized subjects that learning made their mixed blooded descendants dangerous subtle warriors they fought for the empire aye but they and their paymasters both knew they would seize it if they could well what would you soteric dostis son demanded of gavras helvis brother sat at utprands left hand the young namdalener had risen fast since the tribune last saw him he an emperor for the legion went on would you sooner win this war with our help or lose without scaurus flinched soteric always presented choices so as to make yea unpalatable as nay save for a proud nose that be spoke partly videssian ancestry his features were much like his sisters but his wide mouth habitually drew up in a thin hard line thorisin looked from him to the tribune and back again marcus own lips compressed he knew the emperor still car ried misgivings over the ties of friendship and blood between romans and namdaleni but gavras answer was mild enough there still may be other alternatives than those his gaze swung back to scaurus what say you he asked not much so far the tribune was glad of a question he could deal with dis passionately that ships are needed no one can doubt as to how to get them others here know better than i we romans always took more naturally to fighting on land than on the sea put me on the other side of the cattlecrossing and youll hear advice from me in plenty never fear thorisin smiled mirthlessly i believe that the day you dont speak your mind is the day i begin to suspect you and i grant you silence is better than breaking wind by mouth when youve nothing useful to say but having just disclaimed knowledge of naval warfare marcus thought back to his lost homelands past my people fought wars with a country called carthage which at first had a strong fleet where we had none we used a beached ship of theirs as a model for our own and soon we were challenging them on the sea could we not build our own here the idea had not occurred to gavras whose thinking had dealt solely with ships already in existence he rubbed his bearded chin as he thought marcus thought the white streaks on either side of his jaw were wider than they had been a year ago finally the emperor asked how long did it take your folk to get their navy built sixty days for the first ship its said too long too long thorisin muttered as much to him self as to his marshals i begrudge every day that passes phos alone knows what the yezda are doing behind us not phos alone soteric said but so low gavras could not hear few of the tales that the namdaleni brought from harry turtledove their journey across videssos were gladsome though they had no love for thorisin gavras they agreed that the sooner he won his civil war if he could the better his hope of reclaiming the westlands for videssos the emperor refilled his wine cup from a shapely carafe of gilded silver like the house in which the council sat a pos session of the recently departed governor gavras spat on the dark slate floor in rejection of skotos and all his works then raised his eyes and hands on high as he prayed to phos the same ritual over wine scaurus had seen his first day in the empire he realized with some surprise though that now he un derstood the prayer what gorgidas had said so long ago was true little by little videssos was setting its mark on him half an hours ride south of the suburb the videssians sim ply called across citrus orchards came down to the sea leaving only a thin strand of white beach to mark the coast line scaurus tethered his borrowed horse to the smooth gray branch of a lemon tree then cursed softly when in the dark ness he scraped his arm on one of the trees protecting spines it was nearly midnight on a moonless night the men dis mounting near the roman were but blacker shadows under videssos strange stars the light from the great city on the eastern shore of the strait was of more use than their cold gleam or would have been had not a war galleys cruel sil houette blocked most of it from sight gaius philippus nearly tripped as he dismounted a pox on these stirrups he muttered in latin i knew id forget the bloody things quiet there thorisin gavras said walking out onto the beach the rest of his party followed it was so dark the members were hard to recognize what little light there was glistened off nepos smoothshaved head and showed his short tubby frame baanes onomagoulos painful rolling gait was also unmistakable most of the officers were simply tall shapes one interchangeable with the next gavras unhooded a tiny lantern once twice three times a cricket chirped in such perfect imitation of the signal that men jumped laughing quick nervous almost silent laughs but the insect call was not the response thorisin awaited theres too many of us here onomagoulos said ner an emperor for the legion vously a few seconds later he added your precious fellow out there will get the wind up hush gavras said making a gesture all but invisible in the dark from the bow of the silent warship came one flash then a second thorisin gave a soft grunt of satisfaction sent back a single answering flash all was dark and silent for a few moments then marcus heard the soft slap of waves on wood as a boat was lowered from that lean menacing shape ahead the tribunes right hand curled round his sword hilt other alternatives he recalled gavras words of a week before only too well this parley struck him as suicidally fool ish if the admiral aboard that bireme drungarios of the fleet was his proper title marcus remembered chose treachery and landed marines the rebellion against the sphrantzai would be shortlived indeed thorisin had only laughed at him when he put his fears into words you never met taron leimmokheir or you wouldnt speak such nonsense if he promises a safe meeting a safe meeting there will be its not in him to lie the boat was beyond its parent vessels shadow now and scaurus saw gavras had been right there were but three men in it a pair of rowers and a still figure at the stem who had to be the drungarios the rowers feathered their oars so skillfully that they passed silently over the sea only the greenblue phosphorescence that foamed up at each stroke told of then passage the little rowboat beached its keel scraping softly against sand the rowers leaped out to pull it past waves reach when it was secured leimmokheir came striding toward the knot of men waiting for him by the trees either he was a lucky man or his night sight was very keen for he unerringly picked out thorisin gavras from among his followers hello gavras he said clasping thorisins hand this skulking around by night is a dark business more ways than one and i dont care for it a bit his voice was deep and hoarse roughened by years of shouting over wind and wave even at first hearing marcus understood why thorisin gavras trusted this man it was not possible to imagine him deceitful a dark business aye gavras agreed but one which can lead toward the light help us pass the cattlecrossing and oust ortaias the fool and his uncle the spider phos man harry turtledove youve had half a year now to see how the two of them run things they arent fit to clean the red boots let alone to wear em taron leimmokheir drew in a slow thoughtful breath i gave my oath to ortaias sphrantzes when it was not known if you were alive or dead would you forswear me skotos ice is the final home for oathbreakers would you see the empire dragged down to ruin by your scruples thorisin shot back there were times when he sounded all too much like soteric and scaurus instinctively knew he was taking the wrong tack with this man why not work with them not against leimmokheir re turned they freely offer you the title you bore under your brother may good phos shine upon his countenance and de clare their willingness to bind themselves by any oaths you name were it possible id say i valued the oaths of the sphrantzai less even than their coins that got home leimmokheir let out a bark of laughter before he could check himself but he would not change his mind youve grown bitter and distrustful he said if noth ing else the fact that you and they are now related by mar riage will hold them to their pledges doubly damned are those who dare against kinsmen you are an honest pious man taron thorisin said re gretfully because you have no evil in you you will not see it in others the drungarios half bowed that may be but i too must try to do right as i see it when next we meet i will fight you seize him soteric said urgently at the edge of hearing leimmokheirs two sailors snapped to alertness but gavras was shaking his head would you make a sphrantzes of me namdalener close by utprand rumbled agreement thorisin ignored him turning back to taron leimmokheir go on get out he said marcus had never heard such bitter weariness in his voice the drungarios bowed once more this time from the waist he walked slowly down to his boat turned as if to say some thing whatever it was it did not pass his lips he sat down at the boats stem his men pushed it out until they were waist deep in the sea then scrambled aboard themselves oars rose an emperor for the legion and fell the rowboat turned in a tight circle then moved steadily back to the galley marcus heard a rope ladder creak as it took weight the sound faint but clear across the water taron leimmokheirs raspy bass rumbled a command the biremes quiet oars awoke sending it gliding south like some monster centipede it disappeared behind an outjutting point of land thorisin watched it go disappointment plain in every line of his body he said softly to himself honest and pious yes but too trusting by half one day it will cost him if it doesnt cost us first indakos skylitzes exclaimed look there from the north a longboat was darting toward the lonely stretch of beach no little ships gig this but a twentyfooter packed to the gunwales with armed men sold gavras said disbelief in his voice he stood frozen for a moment as the longboat came ashore phos curse that basebom treacher for all eternity belike he landed marines south of us too just as soon as he was out of sight to make it a good thorough trap his sword rang free of scabbard it glittered coldly in un caring starlight well as friend baanes said theres more of us here than he reckoned on we can give mis lot a fight videssos he yelled and charged the longboat where sol diers were still climbing out onto the beach scaurus among them his officers pounded after him sand spraying up as they ran only nepos and onomagoulos hung back the one was no warrior while the other could scarcely walk it was four to three against gavras party or something close to that there must have been twenty men in the grounded boat but instead of using their numbers to any ad vantage they stood surprised waiting to receive their foes onset ha villains thorisin cried not the easy assassination you were promised is it he cut at one of the men from the boat who parried and slashed back lithe as a serpent thori sin twisted cut again the man groaned dropped his blade to clutch at the spurting gash below his left shoulder a last stroke this one twohanded ripped into his belly he slumped to the sand unmoving marcus never wanted to know another fight like this battle in the darkness to tell friend from foe was all but impossible harry turtledove and it was not easy even to strike a blow the beach sand was as treacherous as the combat sliding and shifting so a man could hardly keep his feet planted under him an attacker slashed at scaurus his saber hissed past the tribunes ear he stumbled back wishing for a cuirass or shield to hold the man off he lunged out in a stopthrust and his opponent intent on finishing an enemy he thought at his mercy rushed forward to skewer himself on the blade he never saw he grunted coughed wetly and died if none of gavras companions wore armor the same seemed true of their assailants few men who traveled by sea would risk its perilous weight and thorisins followers were masters of war soldiers who had come to their high ranks through years of honing their fighting skills when coupled with their fury at this betrayalcaused battle that balanced the advantage their enemies numbers gave them soon the wouldbe assassins sought escape but they found no more than they would have granted three tried to launch the longboat once more but they were cut down from behind long legs churning through the sand soteric raced down the beach after the last of the fleeing bravoes finding flight useless the warrior whirled to defend himself steel rang on steel it was too black for marcus to see much of that fight but the namdalener beat down his foes guard with hammer strokes of his sword and stretched him bleeding and lifeless on the soft white strand scaurus eyes jumped everywhere looking for more ene mies but there were none a worse task began seeing who among thorisins men had fallen indakos skylitzes was down as were two vaspurakaner officers the tribune did not know well and a namdalener who had accompanied utprand and soteric the tribune wondered who would receive the dead mans sword and what lives would suddenly be wrenched askew gavras was jubilant well fought well fought he yelled his glee filling the beach thus always to murderers they here stop that what in phos holy name are you doing baanes onomagoulos had been stumping up and down methodically slitting the throats of those attackers who still moved his hands gleamed wet black and slick in the stars pale light what do you think onomagoulos retorted that ac an emperor for the legion harry turtledove cursed leimmokheirs marines will be here any time should i leave these whoresons to tell em where weve gone no thorisin admitted but you should have saved one for questioning too late now onomagoulos spread his bloody hands nepos he called make a light id wager well have the answer to any questions soon enough the priest came up to onomagoulos side his breathing grew deep and steady gavras officers muttered in awe as a pale golden radiance sprang into being round his hands marcus was less wonderstruck than some this was a miracle he had seen before from apsimar the prelate of imbros for all the amazement baanes onomagoulos showed nepos might have lit a torch the halfcrippled noble pain fully bent by one of the fallen attackers his knife snicked out to slit a beltpouch goldpieces a surprising number of goldpieces spilled onto the sand onomagoulos scooped them up held them close to nepos glowing palms thorisins marshals crowded close to look ort the st sphr avt of vid onomagoulos read from a coin not bothering to stretch the abbreviation full length heres ort the first again again he turned a goldpiece over and again nothing but phoscurse ort the first in fact aye ahnd ahll freshminted too that flatvoweled ac cent had to belong to utprand dagobers son what else would leimmokheir use to pay his hired killers onomagoulos asked rhetorically how could the sphrantzai have infected him with their treachery thorisin wondered vardanes must be leagued with skotos to have suborned taron leimmokheir no one answered him the crackle of brush pushed aside loud in the midnight stillness came from the south swords flew up instinctively nepos light vanished as he took his concentration from it the son of a manurebag did land ma rines onomagoulos growled i dont think so gaius philippus said woodswise he went on i think the noise was closer to us made by some thing smaller than a man a fox maybe or a badger you are right i think utprand said not even the centurion of the namdalener though seemed eager to wait and test their guess with their comrades they hurried back to their mounts soteric scaurus and nepos quickly lashed the bodies of gavras slain commanders to their horses moments later they were trotting north through the orchard branches slapped at the tribune before he knew they were there if leimmokheirs marines were behind the officers they never caught them up when thorisin and his followers emerged from the fragrant rows of trees the emperor galloped his horse a quarter of a mile in sheer exuberance at being alive he waited impatiently for his men to join him when they reached him at last he had the air of a man who had come to a decision very well then he declared if we cannot cross with leimmokheirs let we shall in his despite in his despite gorgidas echoed the next morning a ringing phrase no doubt the roman camp was full of ex citement as word of the nights adventure raced through gavras army viridovix as was his way when left out of a fight was wildly jealous and sulked for hours until scaurus managed to jolly him from his sour mood the tribunes men bombarded him and gaius philippus with questions most were satisfied after one or two but gor gidas kept on trying to pull from the romans every detail of what had gone on his crossquestioning was sharp as a jur ists and he soon succeeded in annoying gaius philippus a more typical roman than the thoughtful scaurus the senior centurion had little patience for anything without obvi ous practical use you dont want us he complained to the doctor you want one of the buggers onomagoulos let the air out of to go at him with pincers and hot iron the greek took no notice of his griping but said ono magoulos eh thank you that reminds me of something else i wanted to ask how did he know hed find ortaias monies in the dead mens pouches great gods that should be plain enough even to you gaius philippus threw his hands in the air if their drungarios hired murderers hed have to pay in his masters coins the centurion gave a short hard laugh its not likely hed have any of thorisins and dont think you can ignore me and have me go away he went on you still havent said the first thing about why youre flinging all these questions at us the usually voluble greek stood mute he arched one eye an emperor for the legion brow and tried to stare gaius philippus down but marcus came in on the senior centurions side anyone would think you were writing a history he told the physician a slow flush climbed gorgidas face scaurus saw that what he had meant for a joke was in grim earnest to the greek your pardon he said and meant it i did not know how long have you been working on it eh since i learned enough videssian to ask for pen and parchment you know as well as i theres no papyrus here what language is it in the tribune asked hellenisti ma dial in greek by zeus what other tongue is there for serious thought gorgidas slipped back into his native speech to answer gaius philippus stared at him in amazement his own greek consisted of a couple of dozen words most of them foul but he knew the name of the language when he heard it in greek you say of all the bootless things ive heard that throws the triple six greek in videssos thats never heard the word let alone the tongue why man you could be homer or whatshisname the first history writer i heard it once but im damned if i recall it he looked to scaurus for help herodotos the tribune supplied thanks thats the name as i say gorgidas you could be either of those old bastards or even both of em together and whod ever know it here greek he repeated halfcontemptuous wonder in his voice the doctors color deepened yes greek and why not he said tightly one day maybe ill be easy enough in vi dessian to write it or i might have one of their scholars help translate what i write manetho the egyptian and berosos of babylon wrote in greek to teach us hellenes of their nations past glories it wouldnt be the worst deed to make sure we are remembered in videssos after the last of us has died he spoke with the same determination he might have shown when facing a difficult case but marcus saw he had not impressed gaius philippus what happened after his own end was of no concern to the senior centurion he sensed however that he had chaffed gorgidas about as much as he could in his rough way he was fond of the doctor so he shrugged and gave up the argument saying all this gabbing harry turtledove is a waste of time id best go drill the men theyre fat and lazy enough as is he strode off still shaking his head the videssians will be interested in your work i think marcus said to gorgidas they have historians of their own i remember alypia gavra saying she read them and i think though im hot sure she might have been taking notes for a book of her own why else would she have been at mavri kios council of war something else occurred to the tribune she might be able to help you get yours translated he saw gratitude flicker in the doctors eyes but gorgidas was prickly as always aye so she might were she not on the far side of the cattlecrossing married to the wrong em peror but who are we to boggle at such trivia all right all right your points made i tell you this though if alypia were on the far side of the moon id still want to see that history of yours thats right you read some greek dont you id forgot ten that gorgidas sighed said ruefully truly scaurus one reason i started the thing in the first place was to keep myself from losing my letters the gods know im no ah whats hisname the physicians chuckle had a hollow ring but i find i can put together understandable sentences id like to see what youve done scaurus said and meant it he had always found history with its dispassionate approach a more reliable guide to the conduct of affairs than the orators highflown rhetoric thucydides or polybios was worth twenty of demosthenes who sold his tongue like a woman her virtue and sometimes composed speeches for pros ecution and defense in the same case gorgidas broke into his musing speaking of alypia and the cattlecrossing he said did gavras say anything of how he planned to pass it by im not asking as a historian now you understand merely as someone with certain objec tions to being killed out of hand i have a few of those myself marcus admitted no i dont know whats in his mind still thinking in classical terms he went on whatever it is it may well work thori sin is like odysseus hes sophron sophron eh gorgidas said well lets hope youre right the greek word meant not so much having superior wits but getting the most distance from those one had gor an emperor for the legion gidas was not so sure it fit gavras but he thought it a fine description for scaurus himself blackcapped terns wheeled and dipped screeching their disapproval at the armed men scrambling down a splintery i ladder into the waist of a fishing boat that had seen better days a pox on you lousebitten sea crows viridovix shouted up at them shaking his fist i like the notion no better than yourselves all along the docks and beaches of videssos western sub urbs troops were boarding by squads and platoons as motley a fleet as marcus had ever imagined three or four grain car riers able to embark a whole company formed the backbone of thorisin gavras makeshift armada there were fishing craft aplenty those the eye could not pick out at once were immediately obvious to the nose there were smugglers boats with great spreads of canvas and lines greyhoundlean there were little spongedivers vessels some hardly more than rowboats with masts no thicker than a spearshaft there were keelless barges taken from the river trade how they would act on the open sea was anyones bet and there were a great many ships whose functions the tribune no more nauti cal than most romans could not hope to guess he helped nepos down onto the fishing boats deck i thank you the priest said nepos sagged against the boats raised cabin timbers creaked under his weight but he made no move to stand free merciful phos but im tired he said his eyes were still merry but there were dark circles under them and his words came slowly as if getting each one out took effort well you might be scaurus answered aided by three other sorcerers the priest had spent the past two and a half weeks weaving spells round the odd assortment of boats thor isin had gathered from up and down the western coastlands most of the work had fallen on nepos shoulders for he held a chair in sorcery at the videssian academy in the capital while his colleagues were local wizards without outstanding talent at its easiest sorcery was as exhausting as hard labor what the priest had accomplished was hardly sorcery at its easiest gorgidas descended graceful as a cat a moment later harry turtledove gaius philippus came down beside him planting himself on the gently rocking deck as if daring it to shake him viridovix it was a soft hail from the next boat down the dock a lateenrigged fishing craft even smaller and grubbier than the one the celt was sharing with the roman officers aye bagratouni viridovix called is your honor glad to be on the ocean now coming from landlocked vaspura kan gagik bagratouni had professed regret that he knew nothing of the sea the nakharars leonine features were distinctly green does always it move about so he asked bad cess to you for reminding me viridovix said gulp ing use the rail not my deck warned the fishing boats cap tain a thin dark middleaged man with hair and beard sun and seableached to the grayishyellow color of his boats planking the gauls misery mystified him how could a man be sick on an all but motionless boat if my stomach decides to come up now ill use what evers underneath me and that without a byyourleave vir idovix said but in latin not videssian what now marcus asked nepos waving out to the pa trolling galleys their broad sails like sharks fins shall we be invisible to them like the yezda for a few moments during the great battle he still sweat cold every time he thought of that though videssian sorcerers had quickly worked counter spells that brought the nomads back into sight no no the priest managed to sound impatient and weary at the same time that spell is all very well against folk with no magic of their own but if any opposing wizard is nearby one might just as well light a bonfire at the bow of the boat the captains head whipped round he wanted no talk of bonfires aboard his ship nepos continued besides the invisibility spell is easy to overcome and if it were broken with us on the sea the slaughter would be terrible we are using a subtler measure one crafted in the academy last year we will in fact be in full sight of the galleys all the way to the eastern shore of the cattlecrossing wheres the magic in that gaius philippus demanded i could swim out there and accomplish as much though id have little joy of it an emperor for the legion patience i pray you nepos said let me finish though well be in plain sight of the foe he will not see us that is the artistry his eye will slide over us look past us but never light on us i see the senior centurion said approvingly itll be like when im hunting partridges and walk past one without ever noticing it because its colors blend into the brush and woods where its hiding something like that nepos nodded though theres rather more to it we dont blend into the ocean you know the eye yes and the ear as well have to be tricked away from us by magic not simple camouflage but its a gentler magic than the invisibility spell and nearly impossible to de tect unless a wizard already knows its there theres the signal now the fishing captain said thorisin gavras flagship a rakish smugglers vessel almost big enough to challenge one of ortaias warcraft was flying the skyblue videssian imperial pennant the steady northwes terly breeze whipped it out straight showing phos sun bright in its center a sailor undid the mooring lines that held the fishing boat to the dock at stern and bow tossed them aboard and leaped nimbly down into the boat at the captains quick orders his fourman crew unreefed the single squarerigged sail the sailcloth was old sagging and much patched but it held the wind pitching slightly in the light chop the boat slid out into the cattlecrossing scaurus led his companions to the bow both to be out of the sailors way and to see what lay ahead the western part of the channel was as full of boats as an unwashed dog with fleas but not one of the biremes ahead paid them the slightest heed so far at least nepos magic held what will you do if your spell should fail in midcrossing marcus asked the priest pray nepos said shortly for we are undone but see ing it was a question seriously meant and not asked only to vex him he added there would be little else i could do its a complex magic and not one easily laid on as always viridovix was lost in a private anguish from the moment the little fishing boat began to move knuckles white beneath freckles from the desperation of his grip he clutched the boats rail leaning over it as far as he could gaius phi harry turtledove lippus who did not suffer from seasickness said to nepos tell me priest is your conjuring proof against the sound of puking on firm ground such sarcasm would have sparked a quarrel with the celt but he only moaned and held on tighter then he suddenly straightened amazement ousting distress what was that now he exclaimed pointing down into the water the others followed his finger but there was nothing to see but the cyanblue ocean with its tracing of lacy white foam theres another viridovix said not far from the boat a smooth silverscaled shape flicked itself into the air to glide for fifty yards before dropping back into the sea what man ner of fairy might it be and whats the meaning of it is the seeing of it a good omen or foul you mean the flying fish gorgidas asked in surprise children of the warm mediterranean he and the romans took the little creatures for granted but they were unknown in the cool waters of the northern ocean that was the only sea the gaul knew and because they were so far removed from anything he had imagined viridovix would not believe his friends insis tence that these were but another kind of fish not even when nepos joined his assurances to theirs the lot of you are thinking to befool me he said and rare cruel yare too with me so sick and all his bodily woes only served to make him ugly his voice was petulant and full of hostility oh for the gaius philippus said in exasperation bloody fool of a celt flying fish were skipping all around the boat now perhaps fleeing some maruading albacore or tuna one more intrepid but less lucky than its fellows landed on the deck almost at the centurions feet as it flopped on the planks he took his dagger still sheathed from his belt and reversing the weapon struck the fish smartly behind the head with the pommel he picked up the footlong brokenbacked fish and handed it to the gaul the broad gliding fins hung limply already the golden eyes were dimming the oceanblue back and silver belly losing their living sheen and fading toward deaths gray you killed it viridovix said in dismay and threw it back into the sea more foolishness the centurion said theyre fine eat ing butterflied and fried but viridovix still distressed an emperor for the legion shook his head he had seen a dream die not a fish and to think of it as food was beyond him you should be grateful gorgidas observed with your interest in the flying fish youve forgotten your seasickness why indeed and i have the celt said surprised his quickrising spirits brought a grin to his face just then a wave a trifle bigger than most slapped against the fishing boats bow the light craft rolled gently and viridovix eyes bulging and cheeks pale with nausea had to seek the rail once more be damned to you for making me remember he choked out between heaves some of thorisins boats were by the patrolling galleys now and still no sign they had been seen as it sailed toward the agreedupon landing point a couple of miles south of the capital the vessel marcus rode passed within a hundred yards of a warship of the sphrantzai spellprotected or not it was a nervous moment the tri bune could clearly read the name painted in gold on the ships bow corsair breaker her sharp bronze beak greened by the sea came in and out in and out of view there were white patches of barnacles on it and on those timbers usually below the waterline a dartthrowing engine was on her foredeck loaded and ready to shoot the missiles steel head blurred in bright reflection corsair breakers two banks of long oars rose and fell in smooth unison even a lubber like scaurus could tell her rowers were a fine crew indifferent to the wind they drove her steadily north over the creak of oars in their locks and the slap of them in the sea came the bass roar of song they used to keep their rhythm little bird with a yellow bill sat outside my windowsill the videssian army sang that song too and the romans with them as soon as theyd learned the words there were it was said fiftytwo verses to it some witty some brutal some obscene and most a mix of all three the hoarse ballad faded as corsair breakers superior speed swept the bireme away on her patrolling path under officers stood at the twin steering oars at her stem a lookout was atop her mast to cry danger at anything untoward marcus harry turtledove swallowed a smile ifnepos magic suddenly disappeared the poor fellow likely would have heart failure the tribunes smile returned and not swallowed either as he watched his emperors mismatched excuse for a fleet sneak ita way over the cattlecrossing under the nose of the imperial navy some of the faster boats were almost to the shore even the slow awkward barges were past the galleys loyal to ortaias with fortune videssos the city should be too much stunned at the sight of gavras army appeared from nowhere under its walls to put much thought to resistance aye a splendid job he said expansively to nepos puts the whole war in hailing distance of being won like all of phos priests nepos was pledged to humility he flushed under scaurus praise thank you he said shyly he was academic as much as priest and so went on this success will take an important new charm out of the realm of theory and into the practical sphere the research of course was the work of many its mere chance that makes me the one to execute it it the priest lurched and turned purple no blush of modesty this but a darkening as if stranglers hands were round his neck marcus and gorgidas darted toward him both afraid the fat little mans labor had brought on a fit of apoplexy but nepos was suffering no fit though tears rolled down his cheek to lose themselves in his thicket of beard his hands moved in desperate passes he whispered cantrips fast as his lips could shape them whats toward gaius philippus barked doubly out of his reckoning on the sea and treating with magic he nonethe less knew trouble when he saw it his hand snaked to his sword hilt but the familiar gesture brought him no comfort counterspell nepos got out between his quickly re peated charms he was shaking like a man with an ague a vicious one aimed at me as much as my spell and strong phos who at the academy can it be ive never felt such strength almost struck me down where i stood he had been incanting between sentences sometimes between words and returned wholly to his sorcery once the gasped explana tion was through the priests skill was enough to save himself but could not keep his spell intact still at his miserable perch over the rail an emperor for the legion viridovix cried out och were for it now the cats after kenning theres mice in the cupboard including corsair breaker there were seven galleys in mar is sight he could hardly imagine how sphrantzes ship captains and sailors must have felt with the ocean full of their enemys ships their reaction though was nothing like the palpitations the tribune had jokingly wished on them a few minutes before they went charging against the small craft all around them like so many bulls rampaging through a herd of sheep scaurus heart leaped into his mouth to see one of the cruelbeaked ships bearing down on the rearmost barge a craft that was to his horror filled with legionaries but the biremes captain at least was unnerved enough by his foes apparition to make a fatal error of judgment instead of trust ing to his vessels ram his port oars swept up and out of the way as he came gracefully alongside and demanded the barges surrender in his pride though he forgot there was more to the bar gain than his sleek ship against the slowmoving clumsy river scow there were men as well ropes snaked up to catch on belaying pins and the steering oar binding ship to ship tight as a lovers embrace and up those ropes and over the galleys low gunwales swarmed the romans whooping with wolfish glee they pitched the handful of marines on board over the side those splashes marked their end for not true sailors they wore cuirasses which now were fatal not protecting seeing his ship taken from under him the captain fled to the high stern he too wore armor gilded in token of his rank it flashed brilliantly for a moment as he leaped into the sea to drown too proud to outlive his folly that mattered little as far as the outcome went the romans no sailors themselves laid hold of the biremes pilot and put a sword against his throat thus encouraged he bawled orders to the crew oars came raggedly to life the sail spread and billowed like a race horse among carters nags the galley sprinted for the beach elsewhere things went not so well warned by their comrades blunder ortaias warships made no further unwise moves a fishing boat kissed by their sharp bronze simply ceased to be save as sodden canvas splintered timbers and men struggling in the warm blue waters of the strait worse harry turtledove still alarm bells were ringing in the city and through the boom of surf off sea walls marcus could hear officers shouting their men aboard fresh galleys but all that needed time and the sphrantzai had little time to spend already gavras boats were beginning to beach soldiers jumping from them as fast as they could scramble and each attack run stole precious minutes from the warships for their targets jinked and dodged with all the desperate skill their crews could summon even after a ram bit home there was more delay as the triumphant bireme backed oars to pull itself free of its prey unspining was a delicate task lest the warships like bees were to leave stings behind in their wounds and with results as damaging to themselves marcus shouted himself hoarse to see what seemed a surely fatal stroke go wide he was so intent on the sprawling sea fight that he almost did not hear the helmsmans frightened cry phos have mercy one o the buggers is on our tail come a point north the captain ordered instantly gaug ing wind coast and pursuer in one comprehensive glance twill lose us some of our wind the helmsman pro tested aye but its a shorter run to the beach steer so damn you pale beneath his sunswarthied skin the helmsman obeyed scaurus bit his lip not so much from fright but frustration his fate was being decided here and not a thing he could do but impotently wait if that seableached fishing captain knew his business the boat might come safe through it if not surely not but either way there was nothing the tribune could do to help or hurt his skills were worthless here his opinions of no value the shore seemed nailed in place before him while from behind the galley came rushing up sharksure and swift too fast too fast he thought achilles would surely catch this tortoise gaius philippus was making the same grim calculation hell be up our arse before we ground he said if we shed our mail shirts now we have hope to swim it abandoning armor was an admission of defeat but that was not what set marcus against it there were archers on that cursed bireme already a couple of shafts had whistled past more swift and slender than any flying fish to be shot swim ming defenselessly in the sea was not an end he relished an emperor for the legion if the bireme was in arrow range the end of the chase could not be far away with sick fascination the tribune watched the imperial pennant stiff in the breeze at the warships bow below it was another this one crimson with five bronze bars the drungarios emblem so marcus thought it was taron leimmokheir himself whod sink him he would willingly have forgone the honor but another ship was racing up alongside the imperial ves sel not so big but packed to the gunwales with armed men and also flying the imperial banner go on leimmokheir go on you sneaking filthy knife in the night thorisin gavras roared across the narrowing space of water his furious bellow like song in scaurus ears ram and then you face me you havent the stones in your bag for it no taunt no insult could have moved the videssian admi ral from his chosen course but hard reality did if he sank the fishing boat ahead gavras would surely come alongside and board and with so many soldiers crammed into his ship that fight could have but one outcome hard to port leimmok heir cried and his ship heeled on its side as it twisted free from danger thorisin and his men yelled derision after him coward traitor no traitor i that was leimmokheirs rough bass i said i would fight you if i met you again you thought that would be never you and your hired mur derers wind and quickly growing distance swept away the admi rals reply thorisin shook his fist at the retreating galley and sent after it a volley of curses that leimmokheir never heard marcus waved his thanks to the emperor so it was you i rescued was it gavras shouted see i must trust you after all or maybe i didnt know who was in your boat the tribune wished thorisin had not added that gibing postscript all too likely it held a touch of truth shoaling we are one of the sailors warned and grabbed the fishing boats rail gorgidas and nepos both had the wis dom to do the same a moment later timbers groaned as the boat ran hard aground marcus and gaius philippus fell in a swearing heap viridovix still leaning over the side almost went overboard this salt waterll play merry hell with my armor gaius harry turtledove philippus said mournfully as he splashed ashore marcus fol lowed carrying his sword above his head to keep it safe from rust a wave knocked viridovix off his feet he emerged from the sea looking like a drowned cat his mustaches and long red locks plastered wetly across his face but a grin flashed be hind that hair its one man jolly well out of a boat i am he cried as soon as he got above the tideline he carefully dried his blade in the white sand he was careless in some things but never with his weapons the whole fringe of beach was full of small units from thorisin gavras army all trying to form up into larger ones a full maniple of romans came marching toward the tribune from the captured videssian bireme a quarter of a mile down the beach quintus glabrio was their head i thought you were done for when that whoreson came up on you marcus said returning the junior centurions salute well done doesnt say enough as usual glabrio shrugged the praise aside if he hadnt made a mistake it wouldnt have turned out so well gavras ship went aground next to the boat that had carried scaurus and his companions hurry there the emperor ex horted his men as they came up onto the land form a perim eter if the sphrantzai have the wit to make a sally against us well wish we were on the other shore again hurry he re peated he coopted glabrios maniple as part of his guard force scaurus gave it to him without demur he had been taking constant nervous glances at videssos frowning walls and great gates wondering if the capitals masters would contest their rivals landing but rather than vomiting forth armed men the citys gates were slamming shut to hold the newcomers out the thunder of their closing was audible where gavras men stood pen pushers sealstampers thorisin said with contempt or taias and his snake of an uncle must think to win their war huddling behind the citys walls hoping ill grow bored and go away or that their next assassination scheme wont mis carry or suchlike foolishness there cant be a real soldier among em no one to tell them walls dont win sieges not by themselves that takes wit and gut both the young sphrantzes has neither phos knows vardanes ill give credit an emperor for the legion for shrewdness aye but the only guts to him are the ones bulging over his belt scaurus nodded at gavras assessment of his imperial foes though he suspected there might be more to vardanes sphrantzes than thorisin thought but even after it was plain there would be no sally from videssos thetribunes eye kept drifting back to that double wall of dour brown stone how much wit he asked himself would it take to keep men out fighting from works like those he must have spoken his thoughts aloud for gaius phi lippus commented soberly close but not quite on the mark the real question is how much wit will it take to get in vi trumpets blared a fanfare then skirled into a march beat twelve parasols the imperial number popped open as one bright flowers of red blue gold and green silk thorisin gavras army formed in a great long column lifted weapons in salute of their overlord a herald a barrelchested stentor of a man roared out forward ho and with the usual videssian love of ostentatious ceremony the column stamped into motion it slowly paraded from south to north just out of missile range from the imperial capitals walls a fierce spec tacle intended to give the citys defenders second thoughts on their choice of masters behold thorisin gavras his imperial majesty rightful avtokrator of the videssians the herald bellowed from his place between thorisin and his parasol bearers the em perors bay stallion his accustomed mount was still on the other side of the cattlecrossing he rode a black its coat curried to dark luster gavras waved to the city doffing his helmet to let sphrantzes troops on the wall see his face for the occasion he wore a golden circlet around the businesslike conical helm his boots were a splash of blood against the horses jetblack hide otherwise he was garbed as a common soldier it was to soldiers he would appeal and in any case he had no pa tience with the jewelencrusted goldstitched vestments that were an avtokrators proper garb there were warriors aplenty to watch his progress before the city they lined the lower outer wall the greatest numbers as was natural defended the gates except for gate an emperor for the legion house forces the massive inner wall fifty feet tall or even a bit more was not so heavily garrisoned why serve penpushers the herald cried to the troops inside videssos theyd sooner see you serfs than soldiers that marcus knew was only the truth bureaucratic em perors had held sway in videssos for most of the past half century and to break the power of their rivals the provincial nobles the penpushers systematically dismantled the native videssian army and replaced it with mercenaries but that process was fargone now and the force defending ortaias sphrantzes and his uncle was itself largely made up of hired troops they hooted and jeered at gavras crying all your people are serfs thats why they need real men to fight for em the regiment of namdaleni started its shout of drax drax the great count drax to drown out gavras heralds words one mercenary a man with strong lungs and a practical turn of mind shouted why should we choose you over the sphrantzai theyll pay us and keep us on and youd send us home poor thorisins lips skinned back from his teeth in a humorless smile his distrust of mercenaries was too well known even though his own army was more than half hired troops forgetting his herald he yelled back why prop up a worthless tumtail rascal for fierce ortaias cost us everything in front of maragha by running away like a frightened mouse him and his talk of being ashamed to suffer not suffering bah on the last few words thorisins voice climbed to a squeaky tenor mockery of his foes he wickedly quoted young sphrantzes speech to his men just before the disastrous battle his own soldiers were mostly survivors of that fight they added their shouts to gavras derision aye give him to us the coward send him to the amphitheater hed ride rings round your jockeys youd best be brave you on the walls if you have to fight after one of his speeches and gaius philippus loud in marcus ear give him over well show him more thans in his book i promise the torrent of scorn that poured from gavras army seemed to have an effect on ortaias soldiers they were men like any others and sensitive to their fellow professionals taunts harry turtledove when the armys abuse died away there was thoughtful si lence up on videssos walls but one of sphrantzes captains a huge warrior who tow ered over his troops roared out harsh contemptuous laughter you ran too gavras he bellowed after your brother lost his head how are you better than the lord we serve thorisin went red and then white he dug spurs into his horse until it screamed and reared attack he shouted kill me that slimetongued whores get a few men took tentative steps toward the wall most never moved from their places in column realistic with the stark good sense of men who risk their lives for pay they knew such an impromptu assault on the citys works could only end in massacre while gavras wrestled his stallion to stillness marcus hur ried forward to try to calm the emperor baanes onomagoulos was already at his side holding the horses bridle and talking softly but urgently to the furious gavras between them they brought his rage under control but it did not abate for turning cold he ground out the scum will pay for that i vow he shook his fist at the captain on the wall who gave back a gesture herdsmen used when they talked of breeding stock the officers cynical challenge gave spirit back to his comrades they whooped at his obscene reply to thorisins fist and sent catcalls after gavras as his military procession moved north as scaurus returned to his place he asked baanes onoma goulos do you know that captain of sphrantzes the bas tard has his wits about him so he does worse luck for us they were wavering up there until he opened his mouth onomagoulos shaded his eyes peered at the wall nay i cant be sure his helm is closed but from the size of him and that cursed wit id guess hes the one calls himself outis rhavas if its him he leads a real crew of cutthroats they say hes a new man and i dont know much about him marcus found that strange by his name outis rhavas was a videssian and the tribune thought baanes a fighting man of thirty years experience should be familiar with the empires leading soldiers still he reminded himself chaos was abroad in videssos these days and perhaps this rhavas was a bandit chief doing his best to prosper in it an emperor for the legion harry turtledove even as you are he told himself and shook his head dis liking the comparison ortaias and his uncle seemed willing to stand siege and thorisin after failing in his appeal at the citys walls saw no choice but to undertake it his men went to work building an earthen rampart to seal off the neck of videssos peninsula some troops were almost useless for the task laon pa khymers khatrishers dug and carried merrily for a couple of days then grew bored and tired of the entire process cant say i blame them pakhymer pointedly told thorisin when the emperor tried to order them back to their labor we came to fight the yezda not in your civil war we can always go home again you know truth is i miss my wife gavras fumed but he could hardly coerce the khatrishers without starting a brand new civil war in his own army not wanting to lose the horsemen he sent them out foraging with his khamorth irregulars he had not even tried to acquaint the nomads with the use of shovel and mattock rather to his surprise marcus found he too missed helvis their storms notwithstanding he was growing used to the idea that those would come from time to time the inevita ble result of attraction between two strong people neither much disposed to change to suit the others ways between them though they had much that was good malric and dosti not least the tribune had come late to fatherhood and found it more satisfying than anything else he had set his hand to in the first days of the siege of videssos he had scant time for loneliness unlike pakhymers troops his romans were men highly skilled in siege warfare spades and picks were part of their regular marching gear and they erected field for tifications every night when they made camp thorisin gavras and baanes onomagoulos rode up to in spect the work the emperor wore a dissatisfied look having just come from the amateurish barricade some of onoma goulos men were slowly throwing up as ever since his wounding onomagoulos face was set and tight though less so now than scaurus had sometimes seen him sitting a horse pained him less than the rocking hobble that was the ruin of his oncequick step gavras expression cleared as he surveyed the broad ditch and staketopped earthwork the legionaries already had nearly done the romans held the southernmost halfmile of thori sins siege line now heres something more like it the emperor said more to onomagoulos than marcus a good deal better than your lads have turned out baanes it looks well yes the older noble said shortly not caring for the criticism what of it outlanders have some few skills the khamorth with the bow the lance to the namdaleni and these fellows with their moles tricks a useful talent now i grant he spoke offhandedly not caring if the tribune heard his unconscious assumption of superiority proof against embar rassment nettled marcus opened his mouth to make some hot reply before the words passed his lips he remembered himself in a roman tent in gaul listening tp one of caesars legates saying now gentlemen we all know the celts are headstrong and rash if we hold the high ground we can surely lure them into charging uphill his mouth twisted into a brief wry grin so this was how it felt to be reckoned a barbarian helvis was right again it seemed but no not altogether catching the sour nicker on his face thorisin said quickly one day baanes will choke shoving that boot of his down his throat scaurus shrugged thorisins apology felt genuine but at the same time the emperor was using him to score a point off the powerful lord at his side nothing in this land ever wore but one face the tribune thought with a moments touch of despair he brought himself back to the business at hand were properly dug in he said from here to the sea he waved to the walls of videssos the city their shadow in the late after noon sun reaching almost to where he stood next to that though all weve done is no more than a fiveyearold playing at sand castles along the beach true enough gavras said it matters not so much though they may have their castles but they cant eat em by phos as long as they rule the sea they dont have to marcus said letting his chief fret loose they can laugh at us while they ship in supplies ships are the key to cracking the city and we dont have them the key aye thorisin murmured his eyes far away an emperor for the legion scaurus realized after a few seconds that the emperor was not lost in contemplation he was looking southeast into the sailors sea at the island lying on the misty edge of vision from videssos with abrupt quickening of interest the roman recalled the videssian name for that island it was called the key but when he asked gavras what was in his mind the em peror only said my plans are still foggy he smiled as if at some private joke onomagoulos marcussaw had no more idea of what his overlord meant than did the tribune some how that reassured him by coincidence that night was one of the misty ones com mon on the coast even in high summer moon and stars swal lowed up by the thick gray blanket rolling off the sea at sunset videssos towers and crenelated walls disappeared as if they had never been torchcarrying sentries moved in hazy haloes of light the taste of the ocean came with every indrawn breath viridovix prowled along the earthwork torch in his left hand and drawn sword in his right sure and they cant be failing to take a whack at us in this porridge can they he demanded when he ran into scaurus and gaius philippus if that were me all shut up in there id give the tails of the omadhauns outside a yank theyd remember awhile so would i gaius philippus said his ideas of warfare rarely marched with the gauls but this was such a time he took the fog almost as a personal affront it changed war from a game of skill a professionals game into one where any cabbagehead could make himself a genius with an hours luck marcus though saw what the centurion in his nervousness and the aggressive celt missed it was as foggy inside the city as out id bet ortaias marshals are pacing the walls them selves he said waiting to hear scaling ladders shoved against them viridovix blinked then laughed aye belike thats the way of it he said two farmers the each of em staying up of nights to watch his own henhouse for fear the other raid it a sleepless thankless job they both think it too and me along with em it may be so gaius philippus conceded the sphrantzai havent the imagination for anything risky but what of harry turtledove gavras this should be a night to suit him hes a gambler born there you have me scaurus said when the fog came down i expected something lively would happen but it seems i was wrong he recounted the afternoons conversation to the roman and the celt theres deviltry somewhere right enough gaius phi lippus said he yawned whatever it is itll have to get along without me until morning im turning in his torch held waisthigh so he could see the ground ahead he headed for his tent the roman camp itself was set near the sea on the flat stretch of land that had been the videssian armys exercise ground scaurus followed him to bed a few minutes later and to his annoyance had trouble falling asleep the gods knew it was peaceful almost to a fault without dosti waking up several times a night but the tribune missed helvis warm on the sleepingmat beside him it was hardly fair he thought as he turned restlessly not so long ago hed found it hard to sleep with a woman in his bed and now as hard without one at the officers conference the next morning thorisin gavras seemed pleased with himself though marcus had no idea why as far as the roman knew nothing had changed since yesterday he probably found himself a bouncy girl whod say yes and not much more was soterics guess after the meeting broke up compared to poisontongued komitta thatd be pleasure enough i hadnt thought of that marcus laughed you may well be right businesslike but slow the siege proper got under way a few of the military engineers who had accompanied mavrikios gavras army still survived to follow his brother under their direction thorisins men felled trees and knocked down a few houses to get timber for the engines and ladders they would presently need the legionaries proved skilled help for the artisans as they were used to aiding their own engineer pla toons save for the countermarching men visible on the walls videssos did its best to ignore the siege ships moved freely in and out of her harbors bringing in supplies and men scaurus wanted to grind his teeth every time he saw one an emperor for the legion harry turtledove next thing you know the sphrantzai will try to stir up a storm behind us and use it to hammer us on the citys anvil thats the way vardanes thinks and its far from a bad plan the tribune said to gaius philippus the senior centurion though was for once an optimist let them try were getting more troops coming over to us than they are that marcus had to admit was probably true the nobles of videssos eastern dominions were not such great magnates as their counterparts in the westlands but all the grandees great or small hated the bureaucrats who had seized the capi tal they flocked to thorisins banner this one leading sev enty retainers that one forty the next a hundred and fifty of course gaius philippus went on following scaurus unspoken thought how useful such bumpkins will prove in the fighting remains to be seen after four or five clear nights the fog came again if any thing thicker than it had before again the tribune wondered whether the besieged sphrantzai would try to sally under its cover and doubled the sentries facing the capital it must have been near midnight when he heard shouts of alarm coming from the north buccinators he shouted the horns bright music ripped through the murk cursing as they scrambled from their bedrolls legionaries poured out of the tents in camp and still buckling on armor began to form up hoofbeats pounded toward the camp are all our lads up there asleep sure and the spalpeensre behind himselfs ram part and it so much trouble to make and all viridovix said how would you know that gaius philippus said you didnt do a lick of work on it and why should i like some hodtoting serf if you want to work like a kem tis your own affair entirely but youll not see me at it give me a real fight any day i dont think those are ortaias men at all quintus gla brio said suddenly a statement startling enough to quell the brewing quarrel at once theres no sound of fighting and no more challenges from our sentries either the young officer was proved right a few minutes later when a troop of about a hundred of thorisin gavras best videssian cavalry rode south past the roman camp sorry about the start we gave you their captain called to scaurus as he went by we almost trampled one of your men up there in this phoscursed gloom the tribune believed that even with torches held high the horsemen disappeared before they had gone another fifty yards blow stand down marcus ordered his trumpeters the legionaries stood for a moment as if suspecting a trick then shaking their heads in annoyance went back to their still warm blankets wish hed make up his bloody mind grumbled one and another a good nights sleep buggered right and proper with a veterans knack for making the best of things a third said cheerily no matter i had to get up to piss anyway the camp settled back into peace scaurus yawned it was near high tide and the boom of surf on the nearby beach was lulling as smooth wine as soft deep drums in the distance the tribune paused halfstooped a hand on his tentflap why had he thought of drums from the sound of sea meeting sand he jerked upright as he recognized the noise for what it was waves on wood ships offshore and close the fear of treachery flooding through him he shouted for the buccinators once more this time his men came forth growling as at any drill they disliked he did not care his alarm blazed brighter than the mistshrouded torchlight peel me off two maniples quick he said to gaius phi lippus i think the sphrantzai are landing on the beach set the rest of the men to defend here and send a runner to gavras i think were betrayed in fact send zeprin the red thorisins most likely to listen to him ill see to it he does the burly haloga promised under standing marcus reasoning because of his former high rank in mavrikios imperial guards he was wellknown both to the younger gavras and his men throwing a wolfskin cape over his mail shirt he vanished into the mist the senior centurion was barking orders as the legion aries rushed to the places they were assigned he turned back to scaurus betrayed is it you think those dungfaced horseboys are there for a welcoming party what better reason not a one worse luck whats the plan hold them until we get enough reinforcements to fling em back into the sea if we do if we can the tribune wished he knew more of an emperor for the legion what he would face ignorances fog could be more dangerous than the gray clammy stuff billowing around him viridovix hurried up he leaned his shield against his hip to give himself two free hands with which to fasten his helmet strap under his chin youll not get away with another shindy without me he said to scaurus well come along then from the way you talk anyone would think i did it on purpose so they would viridovix agreed darkly but when marcus looked to see if he was as serious as he sounded the celt was grinning at him the legionaries quickmarched south following the vides sian cavalry marcus felt something soft squash under his san dal even in the fog and dark he did not have to ask what it was he heard viridovix swear in gaulish caught the name of the celtic horsegoddess epona the tribune slid and almost fell as his feet went from dirt to shifting sand the videssians were still invisible in the swirl ing mist ahead but he heard their captain call come ashore are you daft landlubber a sailors answer came thinly back my leadsmen near wet their breeches getting this close well send boats battle line the tribune said softly smooth as if on pa rade the legionaries deployed from their marching column yell gavras when we charge scaurus ordered let the traitors know we know what theyre at he feared he was come just too late already he could hear oars splashing toward shore hear the scrape of light boats beaching well no help for it forward he said gavras the shout roared from two hundred throats swords drawn pila ready to fling the romans slogged for ward through the sand down at the waterline there was a sudden chaos most of the videssians were dismounted walking up and down the beach holding torches to guide the boats in faintly through the fog scaurus saw some of those torches drop when his men bellowed out their war cry a horse screamed off to one side some roman had seen movement in the mist and let fly with his javelin full of asperity and command an unseen voice demanded harry turtledove of the videssian cavalry leader what sort of welcome have you prepared for us captain hold up hold up hold up the tribune shouted franti cally and blessed the legionaries good discipline for bringing them to a ragged halt what now gaius philippus snarled so theyve a bitch with them what of it sometimes i think the imperials cant fight without their doxies alongside em the senior centurions harsh voice ripped through the fog marcus thanked the gods whose existence he doubted that his comrade had spoken latin he answered in the same tongue bitch she may well be but thats komitta rhangavve out there or im a celt gaius philippus teeth came together with an audible click thorisins woman oh sweet jupiter wait though shes on the other side of the cattlecrossing with all the other skirts and their brats begging your pardon sir he added hastily marcus waved the apology aside in his confusion he hardly heard the words that made it necessary those ships out there could not be sphrantzes komitta was a hellcat but never a traitor but they could not be thorisins either the boats in his makeshift flotilla had long since gone back to their usual tasks that left nothing except the reality just off shore two torches bobbed toward the romans marcus stepped out ahead of his men to meet them the videssian captain stumped along under one a short stocky redfaced man with upsweeping eyebrows and an irongray beard carrying the other was indeed komitta rhangavve her pale narrow face beautiful and fierce as a falcons the tribune gave them both his best courtiers bow but then to his mortification he heard himself blurting will one of you please tell me what in skotos name is going on the captain frowned he spat on the sand and looked through the fog toward heaven his hands upraised ive wounded his piety scaurus thought well too bad for him komitta looked down her elegant nose at the roman the emperor has decided it is time for his soldiers companions and families to rejoin them she said matteroffactly were you not informed of the move a pity she was the perfect aristocrat asking a servants pardon for some small oversight an emperor for the legion the tribune resisted an urge to take her by her sculpted shoulders and shake information out of her it was the devout captain who came to his rescue the keys ships have de clared for gavras now that hes put the city under siege they sailed up during the last fog his highness ordered them to stay hidden so they could take advantage of the next one to bring our kin across without interference from the sphrantzai worked too the key scaurus breathed now that someone had spelled it out for him in small simple words he mentally kicked himself for his stupidity the fleets of the island of the key were second in importance in videssos only to the capi tals something he had known for a year and more but landoriented foreigner that he was the fact had held no meaning for him even after some broad hints from thorisin gavras viridovix subject to no discipline but his own had been hanging back a couple of paces behind the roman now he came forward to lay an indignant hand on marcus arm is it that theres no fight here after all he said so it would seem the tribune nodded still bemused isnt that the way of it the gaul said loudly the first one his honor gives me a fair chance at and it turns out theres not a fornicating thing for him to be giving at all the videssian captain as much a professional at war as a roman veteran looked at the celt as he would at any other dangerous madman there was a smoldering interest in ko mitta rhangavves eye though that marcus hoped against hope viridovix would not pick up luck rode with him the gauls noisy complaint had caught more ears than the ones close by guided by it two of his lemans came running up the beach to smother him with hugs and squeals of viridovix darling we missed you so much viridovix patted them as best he could with a torch in one hand and his shield in the other to scaurus relief ko mittas higharched nostrils pinched as they might at a bad smell turning back to his men the tribune quickly explained what the real situation was the romans raised a cheer ex cited both by the new strength the keys fleet gave gavras and probably more by the prospect of seeing their loved ones again there was scaurus admitted reluctantly something to harry turtledove this videssian custom of keeping a soldiers family close by him however much it went against the roman way the men stayed in better spirits and seemed to fight harder knowing that their families fate as well as their own depended on their valor we came for the wrong reason he said to the legion aries but now that were here we can be useful take your torches down to the shore and help guide those boats in that was a task they set to with a will some of them even splashing out into the sea so the lights they carried would reach further as the small boats beached the romans kept calling the names of their loved ones a glad cry would ring out every few minutes as couples reunited scaurus saw some of these walk into the mist in search of privacy but pretended not to notice after the tension of a few minutes before that sort of release was inevitable then he heard a familiar contralto calling marcus and forgot about roman discipline himself he folded helvis into an embrace so tight that she squeaked and said careful of the baby and of me too you and your ironworks dosti was sound asleep in the crook of her right arm sorry he lied even through armor the feel of her roused him she laughed understanding him perfectly she leaned against his shoulder tilted her head up for a kiss malric ran his hands over the tribunes mail the excite ment of the trip had kept him wide awake papa he said i was on the ship with the sailors and then on the little boat going through the waves with mama and good marcus said absently ruffling his stepsons hair malrics adventures could wait scaurus other hand was slid ing to tease helvis breast and she smiling up from eyes sud denly heavylidded and sensuous out of the fog came a volley of discordant trumpet blasts the metallic clatter of men running in mail and loud shouts gavras thorisin the emperor ordure muttered the tribune all thoughts of lovemak ing banished he cursed himself for a fool somehow he had managed to forget the warning zeprin the red had taken to thorisin the haloga had done his job only too well it seemed from the sound of them hundreds of men were rush ing the beach to meet the nonexistent invaders gavras he yelled at the top of his lungs and the legion an emperor for the legion aries took up the cry feeling at first hand the predicament in which theyd put the videssian cavalry an hour before an unpleasant prospect being attacked by ones own army the emperors horsemen on the beach shouted as loudly as the romans are you handling the traitors out there scaurus thori sin was quite invisible but the tribune could hear amusement struggling with concern in his voice quite well thank you we might have done better if wed known they were coming gavras had known that my plans are foggy marcus remembered him saying foggy forsooth but he had not seen fit to tell his commanders the jolt he must have got when zeprin the red stormed his tent shouting treachery served him right scaurus decided he must have y wondered if his scheme had turned in his hand to bite him the tribune gave him credit for taking nothing for granted he had come ready to fight at need and quickly too now that they saw there was no danger the troopers he had brought with him came running down to the seaside to help the boats in it grew crowded and confused on the beach but happy komitta rhangavve shrieked when thorisin mounted on his borrowed black scooped her up and set her in front of his saddle like a prize of war gaius philippus clucked in disap proval theres times when i wonder if he takes this war seriously enough to win he said remember caesar marcus said the senior centurions eyes grew sad and fond as at the mention of an old lover that bald whoremonger him and his gallic tarts he said pure affection in his voice aye but youre right he was a lion in the field caesar eh he echoed musingly if the gavras does half so well well get our names in more histories than gorgidas and no mistake along with a copper thatll buy you some wine scoffer the tribune snorted but knew hed made his point afterglow upon him marcus took some of his weight on his elbows helvis sighed an animal sound of content he listened to the ocean rhythm of his pulse more compelling than the surf muttering to itself in the distance why isnt it always like this he said more to some observer who was not there than to helvis or himself harp turtledove he did not think she heard him his fingers curious now in a new way he touched her face trying to bridge the gap between them it was no good of course she remained the stubborn mystery anyone outside the self must always be however closely bodies join he looked down at her in the darkness inside their tent and could not read her eyes so he was startled when she shrugged beneath him her sweatslick skin slipping against his her voice was serious as she answered much good can come from love i think but also much evil each time we begin we make phos wager again and bet on the good this time we won he blinked there in the gloom a thoughtful reply to his question was the last thing he had expected the namdaleni used their wager to justify right conduct in a world where they saw good and evil balanced though they were not sure phos would triumph in the end they staked their souls on acting as if his victory was certain the comparison marcus had to admit was apt and yet it did not bring helvis closer to him but only served to make plain their differences she reached for her god in explanation as automatically as for a towel to dry her hands then his nagging thoughts fell silent for they were moving together again her arms tightening round his back her breath warm in his ear she whispered too many never know the good at all darling be thankful we have it when we do for once he could not disagree his lips came down on hers once he had used the cover of fog to bring his soldiers households over the cattlecrossing thorisin gavras un leashed his newfound navy against the citys fleet he hoped the sailors in the capital would follow those from the key into rebellion against the sphrantzai several captains did abandon the sealstampers cause for gavras bringing ships and crews with them but taron leimmokheir more by his example and known integrity than any overt persuasion held the bulk of the citys fleet to ortaias and his uncle the sea fight quickly grew more bitter than the stagnant siege before videssos raid and coun terraid saw galleys sunk and burned pallid bloated corpses an emperor for the legion would drift ashore days later reminders that the naval war had horrors to match any the land could show the leader of the keys fleets was a surprisingly young man handsome and very much aware of it like most of the videssian nobles scaurus had come to know this elissaios bouraphos was a touchy customer i thought we sailed to help you he growled to thorisin gavras at an early morning officers conference not to do all your bloody fighting for you he ran his hands through hair that was beginning to thin at the temples a habitual gesture marcus wondered if he was checking the days losses well what would you have me do thorisin snapped back storm the walls in a grand assault i could spend five times the men i have on that and well you know it but with your ships aprowl the sealstampers cant bring a pound of olives or a dram of wine into videssos theyll get hungry in there by and by so they will elissaios agreed sardonically but the yezda will be fat for theyll have eaten up the westlands while you sit here on your arse silence fell round the table bouraphos had said aloud what everyone there thought in somber moments in the civil war the sphrantzai and gavras both mustered what men they could round the capital leaving the provinces to fend for them selves time enough to pick up the pieces after the victory was won if any pieces were left by phos hes right baanes onomagoulos said to thori sin as was true of a good many of gavras officers he had wide holdings in the westlands if i hear the wolves are out side garsavra skotos strike me dead if i dont take my lads home to protect it the emperor slowly rose to his feet his eyes blazed but his temper was under the rein of his will each word he spoke might have been cut from steel baanes pull one man out of line without my leave and you will be struck dead but not by skotos ill do it myself i vow you gave me your oath and your proskynesis you cannot take them back at a whim do you hear me baanes onomagoulos locked eyes with him thorisin stared back inflexibly it was the marshals eyes that broke away flicking down the table to measure his support aye i hear you thorisin whatever you say of course harry turtledove good well speak no more about it then gavras an swered evenly and went on with the business of the council hes going to let him get away with that gaius phi lippus whispered incredulously to marcus its just onomagoulos way of talking the tribune whis pered back but he too was troubled baanes still had the habit of treating thorisin gavras as a boy scaurus wondered what it would take to make him lose that image of the em peror in his mind such nebulous concerns were swept away when the romans returned to camp quintus glabrio met them outside the palisade whats gone wrong marcus asked at once reading the junior centurions tightset features i you glabrio started twice without being able to go forward he could not control his voice as he did his face he made a violent gesture of frustration and disgust then spun on his heel and walked off leaving his superiors to follow if they would scaurus and gaius philippus exchanged mystified glances glabrio was as cool as they came neither of them had seen him anything but quietly capable until now he led them south past the camp down along the earth work the legionaries had thrown up to besiege videssos a knot of men had gathered at one of the sentry posts as he came closer scaurus saw they all bore the same expression of mixed horror and rage that well d up through quintus gla brios impassive mask the knot unraveled at the tribunes approach the legion aries seemed glad of any excuse to get away that left two men shielding what lay there gorgidas and phostis apo kavkos are you sure you want to see this scaurus gorgidas asked turning to the tribune his face was pale though as legionary physician he had seen more pain and death than a dozen troopers rolled together stand aside marcus said harshly the greek and apo kavkos moved back to show him doukitzes corpse he moaned he could not stop himself was it for this he thought that i rescued the little sneak thief from mavrikios wrath for this the body there before him mutely answered yes splayed now in death doukitzes was even smaller than an emperor for the legion scaurus remembered he seemed more a doll cast aside by some vicious child than a man but where would any child no matter how vicious have gained the horrendous skill for the deliberate obscene mutilations that stole any semblance of dignity of humanity from the huddled corpse a pace behind him he heard gains philippus suck in a long whistling breath of air he did not notice his own hands clenching to fists until his nails bit into his palms he must have died quickly gorgidas said showing the tribune the neat slash that ran from under the little mans left ear to the center of his throat a couple of purplebellied flies buzzed indignantly away from his pointing finger he couldnt have been alive for the rest of that the whole camp asklepios the whole whole city would have heard him and no one knew a thing until his relief came out and found him a mercy for him aye gaius philippus grunted the only one he got from the look of it the sphrantzai have yezda fighting for them marcus said at last groping for some sort of explanation this could be their work they kill foully to terrify their enemies but even as he spoke he doubted his own words the yezda were barbarians they killed and tortured with savage gusto the surgical precision of this butchery matched anything of theirs for brutality but was far beyond it in cruel cold malice phostis apokavkos said the yezda had nothing to do with it curse em almost wish they had id come nearer understandin then the adopted roman spoke latin with the twang of videssos westlands the accent only emphasized his grief though he shaved his face like his mates among the legionaries he was still a videssian in his heart of hearts he and doukitzes two imperials making their way among the romans had been fast friends since the chaos after maragha you talk as if you know this wasnt sport for the nomads gaius philippus said but at your folks worst i cant imagine any of them doing it for which i give you thanks apokavkos said rubbing his long chin more often than not he insisted on styling him self a roman but this once he accepted the videssian label dont have to imagine it though its true see here he pointed to the dead mans forehead to scaurus the wounds incised there had been just another harry turtledove sample of the hideous virtuosity doukitzes killer had dis played he looked again this time his minds eye stripped away the black dried blood and grasped the pattern the knife had cut it was a word or rather a videssian name rhavas sure and the son of a sows a naturalborn turniphead to be after doing such a thing viridovix said that evening by the roman campfire he must ken well not be forgetting soon he was eating lightly bread and a few grapes his stomach always sensitive save in the heat of battle had heaved itself up at the sight of doukitzes pathetic corpse aye gaius philippus agreed his square hairy hands closing as if round an invisible neck and a fool twice in the bargain for hes cooped up there in the city where getting away wont be so easy one more reason to take it marcus said he held out his apricotglazed wine cup for a refill still shaken by what he had seen he drank deep to dull the memory the worst of it sir is what you said this morning quintus glabrio said to gaius philippus though not quite the way you meant it doukitzes wasnt nomads sport to muti late him so after he was dead theres purpose in it right enough but may the gods spare me from too fine an under standing of such purposes he put the heels of his hands to his eyes as though they had betrayed him by looking on dou kitzes scaurus drank again stuck out his cup for yet another dol lop of the sweet syrupy videssian wine his companions matched him draught for draught but their drinking brought no cheer one by one they sought their beds hoping sleep would prove a better anodyne than wine the tribune thrust the tent flap open came out through it still arranging his mantle about him he let his feet take him where they would one path was good as the next so long as it led away from the tent phos wager or any other could be lost as well as won sentries gave scaurus the clenchedfist roman salute as he walked out the camps north gate and into the darkness he returned it absently wishing no one at all had to see him save for a few men coming and going to the latrines the camp was quiet its fires no more than embers an emperor for the legion every legionary sentry post was doublemanned now both in camp and along thorisins besieging earthwork the tri bune saw torches glowing all the way down to the sea to night he knew no man would sleep at his station the night was clear and cool almost chilly the moon had long since set behind videssos walls leaving the sky to the distant stars glancing up at their stillstrange patterns scaurus wondered if the videssians used them to reckon des tinies it seemed a notion that would fit their beliefs but he could not recall hearing of it in the empire nepos would know the thought was gone almost as soon as it appeared drowned in a fresh wave of resentment the tribune wandered on still going north before long he was past the roman sec tion of line and coming up on the namdalener camp he gave that a wide berth too not much wanting to see any of the islanders right now he heard shouting in the distance ahead a womans voice after a moment he recognized it as komitta rhangavves about now thorisin was probably wishing she was back on the western side of the cattlecrossing scaurus let out a sour chuckle it was a feeling he fully understood his laugh had startled someone nearby he heard a sharp intake of breath then a halfquestion halfchallenge who is it another womans voice lower than komittas and more familiar too with a guttural trace of accent marcus peered into the night nevrat is that you who she said again but then scaurus yes aye the tribune briefly warmed to hear her she and her husband no longer camped with the legionaries having joined several of senpat sviodos cousins among the vaspura kaners who marched with gavras marcus missed them both senpat for his blithe brashness his wife for her clear thinking and courage and the two of them together as a model of what a happy couple could be she walked slowly toward him minding each step in the dark as usual she dressed mannishly in tunic and trousers a swordbelt girded her waist her shining hair blacker than the night fell curling past her shoulders what are you doing out and about scaurus asked why not she retorted i feel like a cat prowling harr turtledove through the darkness looking for who knows what and the night is very beautiful dont you think eh i suppose it is he answered whatever beauties it held were lost on him are you all right she asked suddenly lifting a hand to touch his shoulder he thought about it a moment no not really he said at last can i do anything crisp and direct as ever he thought nevrat was not one to ask such a question unless she meant it to be taken seriously here though there could be only one answer thank you lady no this doesnt have that sort of cure i fear he was afraid she would press him further but she only nodded and said i hope you solve it soon then her grip on his arm tightened for a second then she was gone into the night marcus kept walking still without much goal he was well among gavras videssian contingents now a couple of troopers passed within twenty feet of him unaware of his presence one was saying and when his father asked him why he was crying he said this morning the baker came and ate the baby they both laughed loudly they sounded a little drunk without the rest of the joke the punchline was so much gib berish to scaurus somehow that seemed to march very well with everything else that had happened that day a man on horseback trotted by singing softly to himself caught up in his song he too failed to notice the tribune an awkward footfall ahead a muttered curse as the woman approached marcus reflected there was scant need to ask her why she was walking through the night her slit skirt swung open with every step she took giving glimpses of her white thighs unlike the soldiers she saw the tribune almost as soon as he knew she was there she came boldly up to him she was slim and dark and smelled of stale scent wine and sweat her smile halfseen in the darkness was professionally inviting youre a tall one she said looking marcus up and down her speech held the rhythm of the capital quick and sharp almost staccato do you want to come with me ill make that scowl up and go i promise scaurus had not an emperor for the legion known he was frowning he smoothed his features as best he could the lacing of her blouse was undone he could see her small breasts he felt a tightness in his chest as if he were trying to breathe deep in a tootight cuirass yes ill go with you he said is it far no not very show me your money she said all busi ness now that brought him up short save for the mantle he was naked even his sandals left behind but as he started to spread his hands regretfully a glint of silver on his right index finger made him pause he pulled the ring free held it out to her will this do she hefted it held it close to her face then smiled again and reached for him with knowing fingers as she promised her small tent was close by shrugging off his cloak scaurus wondered if she was what he sought he doubted it but lay down beside her nonetheless vll what resaina fallen to the yezda gaius pffl lippus was saying to viridovix astonishment in his voice where did you hear that one o the sailor lads it was told me last night over knucklebones aye its certain sure he says what with their moving around so much and all those sailors get the news or ever anyone else does yes and its always bad marcus said spooning up a mouthful of his morning porridge kybistra in the far south gone a couple of weeks ago and now this resainas loss was a heavier blow the town was perhaps two days march south of the bay of rhyax well east of amorion if it had truly fallen the yezda were getting past the roadblock the latter city represented in zemarkhos fanatic hands though it was and while the westlands were falling town by town to the invaders the siege of videssos dragged on there were men beginning to slip over the wall at night now and others escap ing in small boats they brought tales of tightened belts inside the city of increasingly harsh and capricious rule whatever the shortcomings of the regime of the sphrant zai though the capitals double walls and tall towers were always manned its defenders ready to fight all thorisins choices are bad the tribune brooded he cant go back over the cattlecrossing to fight the yezda without turning ortaias and vardanes loose behind him but if he doesnt he wont have much of an empire left even if we win here an emperor for the legion gaius philippus said what we need is to win here and quickly but that means storming the walls and i shake in my shoes every time i think of trying och such a pair for the glooms i never have seen viri dovix said we canna go we canna stay and we canna be fighting either wellaway we might as well the lot of us get drunk if nothing betters to be done ive heard ideas i liked less gaius philippus chuckled the celts casual dismissal of logic annoyed marcus giv ing viridovix an ironic dip of his head he asked him what do you see left to us now that youve disposed of all our choices i havent done that at all roman dear the gaul retorted his green eyes twinkling for youve left treachery out of the bargain the which gavrasll never do too honest by half yare hmp scaurus grunted no denying viridovix had a point but he did not much care for the label the celt gave him too credulous it seemed to mean moreover he did not feel he deserved it he had not repeated that angry night with the whore nor wanted to even while she clawed his back he knew she was not the answer to his troubles with helvis if anything those had since grown worse there were times when his guarded silence hung between them like a muffling cloak he was glad to have his unpleasant reverie broken by a tall videssian he recognized as one of gavras messengers he took a last pull of thin sour beer videssian wine was too cloying for him to stomach in the early morning to business then what can i do for you he asked the soldier bowed as he would to any superior but scaurus caught his slightly raised eyebrow his delicately curled lip to aristocratic videssians beer was a peasant drink there will be an officers conclave in his majestys quarters to commence midway through the second hour like the romans videssos split day and night into twelve hours each reckoned from sunrise and sunset the tribune glanced at the sky the sun was hardly yet well risen plenty of time to make ready he said ill be there would your honor care for a wee drop of ale viridovix asked the messenger offering the little keg that held it harry turtledove marcus saw the beginnings of a grin lurking under his flame red mustaches thank you no thorisins man replied his face and voice now altogether expressionless i have others to in form and with another bow he was gone in almost un seemly haste as soon as he was out of sight gaius philippus swatted viridovix on the back thank you no mimicking the videssian centurion and celt broke up together forgetting to snarl at each other and would your honor care for a wee drop viridovix asked him me gods no i hate the stuff id best not waste it then viridovix said and swigged from the cask it was easy to divide the commanders in thorisins tent into two sets those who knew of resainas fall and the rest a current of expectancy ran through the first group though no one was sure what to look for by contrast the ignorant ones mostly wandered in late as to any other meeting where no thing much was going to happen for a time it seemed they were going to be proved right the first order of business was a fuzzbearded videssian lieu tenant hauled in between a pair of burly guards the youngster looked scared and a little sick well what have we here thorisin said impatiently drumming his fingers on the table in front of him he had more urgent things on his mind than whatever trouble this stripling had found for himself your highness the lieutenant quavered but gavras si lenced him with a look turned his eyes questioningly to the senior guardsman sir the prisoner one pastillas monotes last evening did most wickedly and profanely revile your majesty in the hear ing of his troops the soldiers voice was an emotionless memorized drone as he recited the charge against the luckless monotes the videssian officers at the table grew still and thorisin gavras alert to the namdaleni to the khamorth to the romans a free tongue was taken for granted but this was the empire an ancient land steeped in ceremonial regard for the an emperor for the legion imperial person not even an emperor so unconventional as thorisin perhaps could take lesemajeste lightly without for feiting his respect among his own people marcus felt sympa thy for the frightened young man before him but knew he dared not interfere in this matter in what way did this monotes revile me the emperor asked his voice too took on the formal tone of a court sir the guard repeated still from memory the prisoner did state that in failing to do more than blockade the city of videssos you were a spineless cur a eunuchhearted block head and a man with a lions roar but the hindquarters of a titmouse those were the prisoners words sir in mitigation sir he went on and humanity came into his voice at last the prisoner had consumed an excess of liquors thorisin cocked his head quizzically at monotes who seemed to be doing his best to sink through the floor like animals dont you he remarked scaurus hopes rose the emperors comment was hardly one to precede a routine con demnation honest curiosity in his voice gavras asked boy did you really say all those things about me yes your highness the lieutenant whispered miserably his face pale as undyed silk he took a deep breath then blurted i likely wouldve come up with worse sir if id had more wine disgraceful baanes onomagoulos muttered but thori sin was grinning openly and coughing in his efforts not to snicker after a moment he gave up and laughed out loud take him away he said to the guards run the wine fumes out of him and hell do just fine titmouse indeed he snorted wiping his eyes go on get out he said to monotes who was trying to splutter thanks or ill make you wish i was one monotes almost fell as the guards let him go he scurried for the tent flap and was gone gavras brief good humor disappeared with him where is everyone he growled ac tually only a few seats were still unfilled when the last khamorth chieftain sauntered in thorisin glared him into his chair the nomad was unperturbed no farmers anger could reach him not even a kings good of you to join us gavras told him but sarcasm was as wasted as wrath the emperors next words though seized the attention of everyone up and down the long table r harry turtledove still taken with pastillas monotes phrase he said i propose to move my feathered hindquarters against the citys works at sunrise two days hence there was a moments silence then a babble louder than any scaurus had heard from thorisins marshals above it rose soterics cry then you are a blockhead and youve lost whatever wits you had utprand dagobers son echoed him a second later ya what brings on tis madness where soteric sounded furious a cold curiosity rode the older namdaleners words he gave thorisin the same careful attention he would a difficult text in phos scriptures trust the islanders not to know whats going on gaius philippus said to marcus the uproar covering his voice it had faint contempt in it to a professional knowledge was worth lives the namdaleni mercenaries by trade were taken by surprise too often to measure up to the senior centurions high standards scaurus understood his lieutenants disapproval but more sophisticated in the ways of intrigue than the blunt centurion also understood why the men of the duchy were sometimes caught short not only were they heretics in videssian eyes but also subjects of a duke who would fall upon the empire himself if he thought the time right no wonder news reached them slowly thorisin gavras waited till the tumult subsided marcus knew he was at his most dangerous when his anger was tightly checked lost my wits have i the emperor said coldly measuring soteric as an eagle might a wolf cub on the ground below soterics eyes eventually flinched away from that confron tation but the tribune still had to admire his brotherinlaws spirit if not his sense by the wager yes the namdalener replied how many weeks is it of sitting on our behinds to starve the blackguards out now out of the blue its up sword and at cm idiocy i call it watch your tongue islander baanes onomagoulos growled his dislike for namdaleni counting for more than his mixed feelings toward thorisin other videssian officers rumbled agreement had soteric spoken to mavrikios gavras thus in thorisins hearing the younger of the brothers would have exploded an emperor for the legion when thorny speech came his own way though thorisin met it straight on just as his brother had marcus remembered not out of the blue dostis son the emperor said and soteric looked startled to hear his patronymic recalling the elder gavras use of his own full name scaurus knew thori sin was borrowing another of mavrikios tricks listen thorisin went on and in a few crisp sentences laid out his plight he stared into soterics face once more so hero of the age he said at last what would you have me do he sounded very tired and finally out of patience the young namdalener sensitive to the mockery that made up so much of videssian wit bit his lip in anger and embar rassment the words dragged from him storm the city if we can he did not say he did not need to say that no one videssian or foreign foe had taken those walls by as sault everyone at the table knew that utprand said to thorisin aye storm tcity you say that and it sounds so easy but we from tduchy we pay the bill to win your empire for you and pay in blood scaurus could not help nodding a mercenary captain who wasted his troops soon had nothing left to sell to skotos frozen hell with you then gavras snapped his temper lost now take your namdaleni and go home if you wont earn your keep you say you pay in blood i pay double outlander every man jack who falls on either side of this war diminishes me friend and foe alike for i am av tokrator of all videssos and all its people are my subjects go on get out the sight of you sickens me after that tirade marcus looked to see utprand stalk from the tent indeed soteric pushed back his chair and began to rise but a glance from the older namdalener stopped him in thorisins hot words was a truth that had not occurred to him before and he paused to give it the thought it deserved be it so then he said at last two days hence he sketched a salute and was gone sweeping soteric along in his wake the council broke up swiftly officers leaving a few at a time gabbling over what they had heard like so many washer women as marcus turned sideways to ease through the open tent flap his eyes happened to meet those of thorisin who was still plotting strategy with bouraphos the admiral thori sins glance held unmistakable triumph in it scaurus suddenly wondered how angry the emperor had really been and how harry turtledove much he had made the namdaleni talk themselves into doing just what he had planned for them in the first place gavras army readied itself for the attack stone and arrowthrowers moved forward ready to give covering fire for the assault on the walls every archers quiver was filled to the same purpose inside sheds covered with green hides rams swung on their chains very impressive gorgidas murmured watching the bus tle of military preparation and inside i suppose theyre heating up their oil to give us the warm reception we de serve absit omen marcus said but it was only too likely too much of the readying process was visible from the walls to leave videssos defenders in much doubt over what was about to happen despite the armys best efforts at secrecy if there was a commander in there with his wits about him and an ounce more guts than he needs to turn beans into wind hed sally now and set us back a week gaius philippus said he watched soldiers marching four abreast on the capitals battlements insectsmall in the distance scaurus said i dont think its likely the penpushers inside must have their generals under their thumbs or theydve hit us long before this ortaias may play at being a warrior but vardanes way of ruling is by taxes and tricks not steel he distrusts soldiers too much to turn them loose i think i hope youre right the senior centurion said marcus noticed him doubling patrols and sentry postings all the same he did not change the dispositions watchfulness was seldom wasted the romans then were not surprised when at twilight a raiding party came storming from a sally port all but hidden by one of the outer walls towers the marauders carried naming brands as well as swords and bows and flung them at any pieces of materiel they saw flames clung and spread unnaturally bright the videssians were skilled incendiary makers shouts of ortaias and the sphrantzai flew with the raiders missiles so did the sentries cries of alarm their an swering yells of gavras and the first shrieks of the wounded another war cry was in the air too one that made an emperor for the legion scaurus who normally faced battle without delight jam his helmet down over his ears and rush to the fight rhavas the marauders cheered rhavas many of the attackers stopped short at the earthen breast work that sealed the city videssos from videssos the empire these skirmished with the roman pickets there threw their torches and shot fire arrows then fell back when they saw the defense ready for them they fought indeed much like the bandits outis rhavas was said to lead a brave onset but no staying power one determined band though came scrambling over the chesthigh rampart to trade swordstrbkes with the romans beyond and hack at their siege engines with axes crowbars and mauls at their head was a tall strongly built man who had to be rhavas himself with a cry of stand and fight murderer marcus rushed at him to the tribunes disappointment his foe wore a bascinet with its visor down he wanted to see this mans eyes as he killed him whatever else he was rhavas was no coward he loped toward scaurus his longsword held high the two blades met with a ring of steel marcus felt the jolt clear to his shoulder the druids marks on his gallic sword flared golden they were hotter and brighter than he had seen them since his duel with avshar the wizardprince just after he came to the capital his lips tightened so rhavas bore an en chanted blade did he it would do him no good but the fighting separated them after another inconclusive passage before the tribune could come to grips with rhavas once more phostis apokavkos attacked ortaias captain in his fury to avenge doukitzes all the careful swordplay the legionaries had drilled into him was forgotten he slashed and chopped with his gladius a blade far too short for such work rhavas toyed with him like a cat with a baby squirrel all the while laughing cruel and cold at length he tired of his sport and decided to make an end his sword hurtled toward apokavkos helm but the stroke was not quite true phostis reeled away hand clapped to his head but that head still rode his shoulders with a bellow of fury rhavas leaped after him gaius philippus stepped deliberately into his path stand aside little man rhavas hissed or it will be the worse for you behind the senior centurion apokavkos was down on harry turtledove his knees blood running from one ear gaius philippus planted his feet to await the onslaught he spat over the edge of his shield a storm of blows rained down on him furious as the fall cloudbursts in the westland plateaus the roman though was wiser by years of hard fighting than phostis apokavkos and did not try to match rhavas stroke for stroke he stood on the defensive his own sword flicking out in counterattack only when the thrusts brought no danger to himself rhavas feinted tried to spring around him but the senior centurion sidestepped quickly and kept himself between the giant warrior and his prey then marcus was hurrying forward to give him aid a dozen legionaries close behind viridovix as always an army in himself stretched two of the skirmishers in the din and bore in on rhavas from another direction still snarling curses rhavas had to retreat he led the rearguard that held the romans at bay while the rest of his raiders made their way back over the besieging rampart he was the last to vault over it and once on the other side fa vored scaurus with a mocking salute there will be other times he called and the grim certainty in his voice sent a thrill of danger down the tribunes back shall we give him a chase gaius philippus asked the bandit chieftain was standing there in no mans land fairly daring the romans to pursue marcus answered regretfully no i think not all he wants to do is lure us into range of the engines on the walls aye more lives than the whoresons worth gaius phi lippus conceded he flexed his left shoulder winced and said hes strong as a bear curse him a couple of the ones he hit me i thought he broke my arm this scutum will never be the same again either the bronze facing of the shields upper rim was all but hacked away while the thick boards of the frame beneath were chipped and split from the fierceness of rhavas attack water would not douse the fires the raiders had managed to set they had to be smothered with sand half a dozen dart throwers and one big stonethrowing engine were destroyed and several others had been wrecked by rhavas axemen and crowbar swingers scaurus was surprised the damage was not worse luckily the marauders had only had a few minutes to carry out their assault an emperor for the legion casualties were similarly light viridovix had accounted for half the enemy dead in his one brief flurry a feat marcus was sure he would not hear the last of for weeks to come of the romans it seemed no one had been killed which glad dened the tribunes heart every legionary lost was one less link to the world he would never know again one more man who shared his memories gone forever the worsthurt man was apokavkos gorgidas bent over him easing his helmet off and palpating the left side of his head with skilled gentle fingers apokavkos tried to speak but produced only a confused stammering sound scaurus was alarmed at that but the greek doctor grunted in satisfaction recognizing the symptom the blow he took threw his brain into commotion as well it might he told the tribune and so hes lost his voice for a time but i think hell recover his skull is not broken and he has full use of his limbs dont you phostis the videssian moved them all to prove it he tried to talk again failed once more and shook his head in annoyance a motion immediately followed by a wince head hurts he scrawled in the dust so you can write can you how interesting gorgidas said ignoring what was written for a moment he looked at apokavkos more as a specimen than a man but caught him self with an embarrassed chuckle ill give you a draft of wine mixed with poppy juice youll sleep the day around and when you wake the worst of your headache should be gone you ought to have your voice back by then too thanks apokavkos wrote as with his last message he used videssian while he spoke latin he could not write it he climbed painfully to his feet and followed gorgidas to his tent for the promised medicine its a good thing draxs namdaleni and the regular vides sian troops in the city didnt follow rhavas cutthroats out on sally marcus said to gaius philippus later that night they could have set things back as badly as you said and we cant afford it with things in the westlands as they are the centurion carefully gnawed the last meat from a roasted chicken thigh then tossed the bone into the fire why should they follow rhavas he said you know the namda leni aye and the imperials too think they have any more stomach for his gang of roughs than we do probably hoping harry turtledove wed kill the lot of em there wouldnt be many a tear shed in there if we had id bet marcus stopped to consider that and decided gaius phi lippus was probably right the men on the other side were most of them soldiers like any others and no doubt despised bandits the same way all regular troops did it was their leaders who chose such instruments not the rank and file the sphrantzai he said the word sliding slimily off his tongue gaius philippus nodded understanding him perfectly the morning thorisin gavras had chosen for his assault dawned gray and foggy not the porridgethick blinding fog that had masked the arrival of the ships from the key but still a mist that cut visibility to less than a hundred paces well not all my prayers were wasted gaius philippus said draw ing faint smiles from the legionaries who heard him for the most part they went about their business grimfaced knowing what was ahead of them a big part of what we can do out there will depend on your men and the covering fire they can give us marcus was saying to laon pakhymer the khatrisher had brought his archers back from their foraging duties to join in the effort against the capital i know pakhymer said our quivers are full and weve been driving the fletchers crazy with all the shafts weve asked for he looked around eyeing the murky weather with dis taste we cant hit what we cant see though you know of course scaurus said suddenly less glad of the fog than he had been but if you keep the top of the wall well swept it wont matter that your bowmen arent aiming at any one in particular of course pakhymer echoed ironically and the tribune felt himself flush a fine thing him lecturing the khatrisher on the tricks of the archers trade when pakhymer had un doubtedly had a bow in his hand since the age of three he changed the subject in some haste the voice of a trumpet rang out high and thin in the early morning stillness marcus recognized the imperial fanfare the signal for the attack much of his apprehension disappeared no more waiting now the event whatever it held was here the trumpets last note was still in the air when the bucci nators horns blasted into life the romans shouting an emperor for the legion gavras at the top of their lungs rushed for the silver gate and the postern gate through which rhavas sally party had come more legionaries flung hurdles bundles of sticks and spadesful of earth into the ditch that warded videssos trying to widen the front on which they could bring their arms to bear the first protection the capitals gates had was a chesthigh work not much different from the one gavras men had thrown up save that it was faced with stone the few pickets manning it were quickly killed or captured the sphrantzai were not about to throw open the gates to rescue them not with the enemy close behind high over the silver gate stood icons of phos reminders that videssos was his holy city they were being rudely treated now buzzing over the romans heads like a swarm of angry gnats came the arrow barrage the khatrishers were lay ing down along with the more intermittent crack of dartcast ing engines and the thump of the stonethrowers hurling arms smacking into their rests reload there come on wind em tight an artilleryman screamed to his crew the perfect videssian incarnation marcus thought of gaius philippus the senior centurion was crying the legionaries on ordering the rams forward to pound at the silver gates ironbound portals the slopesided sheds covered with hides to foil fire hot oil and sand ponderously advanced looking up at the crenelated battlements over the gates scaurus felt a surge of hope much against his expectations the missiles had briefly managed to drive the defenders from their posts the rams took their positions unhindered the passageway behind the gates echoed their first booms like a great drum gaius philippus wore a wolfish grin the timbers may last forever he said but the hinges can only take so much boomboom boomboom went the rams but the khatrishers could only keep up their murderous fire so long arms tired bowstrings weakened and arrows began to run short soldiers appeared on the walls again one of bagratounis vaspurakaners shrieked as bubbling oil found its way through the joints of his armor to roast the flesh beneath another defender was about to tip his cauldron of sizzling fat down on the romans when a khatrisher shaft caught him in harry turtledove the face he staggered backward spilling the blazing load among his comrades the romans below cheered to hear their cries of pain and fear stones and missiles shot from the towers of the inner wall were now beginning to fall on the legionaries there were not enough khatrishers nor could they shoot far enough to si lence the snipers and catapults atop those towers loud even through the din of fighting the cry of ladders ladders came from the north scaurus stole a glance that way saw men climbing for their lives and knowing they would lose them if the enemy tipped those ladders into space before they reached the top the legionaries carried no scaling ladders too risky by half was the tribunes coldblooded appraisal the rams still pounded away a chain with a hook on the end snaked down to catch at one of the heads as it drove forward but the romans alert for such tricks knocked it aside the huge iron clasps joining gate to wall creaked and groaned at every stroke the thick oak portals began to bend inwards sure and we have em now viridovix cried his eyes blazed with excitement he waved his sword at the videssians on the walls hot to come to grips with them at last this fighting at long range and the duel of ram and catapult were a poor substitute for the handtohand combat he craved marcus was less eager but still felt his confidence rising ortaias men were not putting up a strong defense by rights he thought the romans should never have been able to get their rams near the silver gate let alone be on the point of battering it down he wondered how many men elissaios bouraphos ships were drawing off to ward the sea wall there were times when navies had their uses the fight at the sally port was not going so well for the legionaries a sharp dogleg in the wall protected it from en gines and let the troops inside fire at the attackers flanks as casualties mounted scaurus pulled most of his soldiers back leaving behind a couple of squads to keep the besieged vides sians from using the postern gate against them one last stroke of the rams working in unison now thud ded into the battered timbers of the silver gate they sagged back like tired old men the romans surged past the rams protecting mantlets shouting that the city was taken an emperor for the legion it was not the passage between inner and outer portals was itself walled and roofed and a stout portcullis barred the way from behind it archers poured death into the legionaries at pointblank range brave as always laon pakhymers khatrishers ran up to return their fire in their light armor they suffered for it or taias bowmen on the walls taking a heavy toll watching his men fall pakhymer remained expressionless but his pock marks stood shadowy on a face gone pale he sent his coun trymen forward nonetheless more archers shot down at the romans from the murder holes above the passageway unlike the ones at panicked khiiat the summer before these were manned and deadly testudo gaius philippus shouted and scuta went up over the legionaries heads to turn the hurtling darts but worse than arrows rained down boiling water sputtering oil and redhot sand poured through the deathholes and the inter locked shields could not keep the soldiers beneath them alto gether safe men cursed and screamed as they were burned still more terrible were the flasks of vitriol the defenders cast down on the legionaries the very facings of their shields bubbled and smoked and whenever a drop touched flesh it seared it away to the bone scaurus ground his teeth in an agony of frustration having forced the silver gate his men were caught in a crueler trap than if they had failed at once the rams protected by their mantlets were still inching forward and might yet batter down the portcullis though as he watched a man inside the mantlet fell pierced by an arrow that found its way over his shield but after the portcullis lay the second set of gates stronger even than the ones already fallen could he ask his men to claw their way through that gauntlet and have any hope they could fight ortaias stillfresh troops afterward with unlimited manpower behind him he might have tried it his force though was anything but unlimited and once gone was gone for good however much he wanted to aid thorisin the mercenary captains creed came first protect your men without them you can do nothing to help or hurt pull back he ordered and signaled the buccinators to blow retreat it was a command the legionaries were not sorry to obey they had charged to the attack in high excitement but they recognized an impossibility when they saw one harry turtledove again the khatrishers did yeoman duty in covering the romans especially the withdrawal of the rams and their heavy shielding mantlets of necessity a slow painful busi ness laon pakhymer brushed thanks aside when marcus tried to give them saying only you did more for us one day last year he was silent for a moment then said could we beg use of your fractious doctor of course scaurus said then i thank you that arrowpulling gadget of his is a clever whatsit and his hands are soft for all his sharp tongue gorgidas marcus called and the greek physician came trotting up a length of bandage flapping in his left hand what do you want now scaurus if you must put out a fire by throwing bodies on it at least give me leave to cobble them back together dont waste my time with talk tend to the khatrishers too would you the arrowfires hurt them worse than our men because they wear lighter pano plies and pakhymer here thinks well of your arrowdrawer the spoon of diokles aye its a useful tool he pulled one from his belt the smooth bronze was covered with blood gorgidas held the instrument up to the two officers can either of you tell whose gores been spilled on this roman khatrisher or imperial for that matter he did not wait for an answer but went on well neither can i i havent really stopped to look nor will i im a busy man thanks to you two so kindly let me ply my trade pakhymer stared at his retreating back did that mean yes it meant he has been tending them all along i should have known there are demons on that mans trail pakhymer said slowly his eyes held a certain superstitious awe he intended his words to be taken literally demons everywhere today he murmured pulling the balance down against us in vi dessian eyes the khatrishers were sunk deeper in heresy than even the namdaleni where the men of the duchy spoke of phos wager with at least the hope that phos would at last overcome skotos pakhymers people held the struggle be tween good and evil to be an even one its ultimate winner impossible to know scaurus was too tired and too full of disappointment to an emperor for the legion exercise himself over the fine points of a theology he did not share with some surprise he realized the sky was bright and blue where had the fog gone his shadow was pointing away from videssos works the sun was in his eyes as he looked toward them the assault had lasted most of the day for all it had accomplished it might as well not have been made jeers flew from the wall as the romans retreated loudest among them the booming scornfilled laugh of outis rhavas go back to your mothers little boys the bandit chieftain roared his voice loaded with hateful mirth youve played where you dont belong and got a spanking for your trouble go home and be good and you wont get hurt again marcus swallowed hard he had thought he was beyond feeling worse but found he was wrong defeat was five times more bitter at the hands of rhavas his head hung as he led the weary painful trudge back to camp inside videssos the soldiers of the sphrantzai celebrated their defense far into the night they had reason to rejoice none of thorisins other attacks had come as close to success as the romans and scaurus knew how far from victory the legionaries had been the sound of the revels only made gavras defeated army more sullen as it licked its wounds back behind its rampart the tribune heard angry talk round the roman campfires and did not blame his soldiers for it they had fought as well as men could fight but stone brick and iron were stronger than flesh and blood when the namdalener came up to the roman camp ner vous sentries almost speared him before he could convince them he was friendly he asked for scaurus saying he would speak to no one else the tribunes sword was drawn as he walked to the north gate apart from his own troops he was not prepared to take anyone on trust but the islander proved to be a man he knew a veteran mercenary named fayard who had once been under the com mand of helvis dead husband hemond he stepped forward out of the darkness to take the tribunes hand between his two the usual namdalener clasp soteric asks you to share a cup of wine with him at our camp he said years in the empire had left his videssian almost accentfree harry turtledove this is a message you were bidden to give to me alone scaurus asked in surprise i had my orders fayard shrugged he had the resigned air of a soldier used to carrying them out whether or not he found sense in them of course ill come give me a moment though marcus quickly found gaius philippus told him of soterics request the senior centurions eyes narrowed he stroked his chin in thought he wants something from us was his first comment echoing scaurus guess gaius philippus followed it a moment later with hes not very good at these games is he by now the whole campll know youre off on some secret meeting where if his man had just sung out what he wanted to the gate crew nobody would have thought twice about it maybe i should take you off combat duty marcus said youre getting to be a fine intriguer yourself you know gaius philippus snorted knowing the tribunes threat was empty ha you dont need to be a cow to know where milk comes from scaurus fought temptation and lost youre right that would be udderly ridiculous he walked off whistling some how feeling better than he had since the illfated attack began he and fayard drew three challenges in the tenminute trip to the namdalener camp and another at its palisade guards men who would have ignored a platoon the night before now reached for spear or bow at the smallest movement defeat marcus thought made men jump at shadows yet another sentry stood armed in front of soterics tent a trifle shortsighted he peered closely into the tribunes face before standing aside to let him pass fayard ceremoniously held the tent flap open you arent coming too marcus said me by the wager no the man of the duchy answered soteric pulled me out of a game of dice to fetch you and just when i was starting to win so by your leave he was gone before the sentence was complete come in scaurus or at least let the flap drop soteric called the wind will put out the candles if marcus had had any doubts that soterics invitation was not merely social the company helvis brother kept would have erased them a bandage on his forearm utprand da an emperor for the legion gobers son sat on the sleeping mat by soteric his bearing and his cold eyes wolfish as always next to him were a pair of namdaleni the tribune did not know save by name clozart leatherbreeches and turgot of sotevag whose native town was on the eastern shore of the island duchy the four of them together spoke for most of the islanders who followed gavras they shifted to give scaurus room to sit turgot swore softly as he moved my arse is bandaged he explained to the roman took an arrow right in the cheek i did he doesnt care a moldy grape for your arse clozart rumbled marcus thought he looked foolish in the tight leather trousers he affected he was nearing fifty and his belly bulged over their fastening but his square face was hard and capable the face of a man who acts and lets consequences sort themselves out afterward have some wine turgot said pouring from a squat pitcher we wouldnt want fayard forsworn would we marcus shook his head sipped politely for all their ostenta tious contempt for videssian ways some namdaleni played the game of indirection even more maddeningly than the im perials who had taught it to them soteric though was not one of those tossing his own cup back at a gulp he demanded bluntly well what did you think of todays fiasco about what i thought before the tribune answered with those walls a handful of lame old men could hold off an army so long as they werent too old to remember to keep dropping rocks on its head ha well said tat utprand said baring his teeth in the grimace that served him for a chuckle but question has more behind it gavras sent us forward to be killed against works he had no hope of taking why should we serve such a man as that so youre thinking of going over to the sphrantzai marcus asked carefully if their answer was aye he knew he would have to use all his guile to leave the islanders camp for that was a choice he could never make and if guile failed he shifted his weight bringing his sword to a position where it would be easier to seize but clozart spat in fine contempt i fart in ortaias sphrantzes face he said a pox on the twit soteric nodded the sealstamping harry turtledove fops a worse bargain than gavras ever would be him and his potmetal goldpieces what then scaurus said puzzled what other choice is there home turgot said at once and longing filled his eyes at the word the lads have had a bellyful and so have i let the damned imperials bake in their own oven and may both sides bum give me cool sotevag again and the long waves rolling off the endless gray ocean and if the empires recruiters come my way again ill set the hounds to em like your vaspura kaner friend did to the videssian priest the tribune felt no longing only a jealousy that by now itself was tired in this world he and his had no home nor were they likely to you make it sound simple he said dryly but what do you propose to do march through the empires eastlands until you come to your own country his intended sarcasm fell on deaf ears aye clozart said or rather the sea across from it why not what do the imperials have between here and there to stop us it should be easy utprand agreed tempire stripped garrisons bare to fight the yezda and then again for tis civil war once we get clear of videssos there would be no army dare come near us and torisin has to let us go if he tries to hold us the sphrantzai come out and eat him up the chilly logic was convincing as was utprand himself if the bleak namdalener said a thing could be done it very likely could the only question marcus could find was why tell me now we want you and yours to come with us soteric an swered the tribune stared surprised past speech the namdelener rushed on duke tomond phos love him would be proud to have such fighters take service with him theres room and to spare in the duchy enough to make your troops yeoman farmers each with his own plot and you id guess a count hows the sound of that scaurus scaurus the great count scaurus if ever you chose to go on campaign again soterics tickling at his vanity left marcus unmoved he had more influence as a general in the empire than he would with a fancy title of nobility in namdalen but for the first time since the romans were swept to this world he found himself tempted to cast aside his allegiance to videssos here freely an emperor for the legion offered was the thing he had thought impossible a home a place of their own in which they could belong the offer of land alone would seem like a miracle to his troops civil wars had been fought in rome to get discharged veterans the allotments their generals promised room and to spare aye outlander its a lovely country we have turgot said still sentimental over the motherland he missed sote vag sits on the coast between oak woods and croplands and i spend much of my time there i will say but i have a steading up in the moors as well the high hills all covered with heather and gorse and flocks of sheep on em the skys a different color from what it is here a deeper blue almost makes you think you can see through it and the wind carries music on its breath not the smell of horseshit and dust the roman sat silent all but overwhelmed by his own memories of mediolanum lost forever of the snowmantled alps seen from a safe warm house of tart pungent italian wine of speaking his mind in latin instead of picking through this painfully learned other tongue all four namdaleni were watching him closely clozart saw his struggle for decision but mistrusting everyone not of his island nation mistook its meaning dropping into the thick patois the men of the duchy used among themselves he said to his comrades i told you we never should have started this look at him there figuring whether to sell us out or no he did not think scaurus could follow his speech few vi dessians would have been able to but more than a years time with helvis had given the tribune a grasp of the island dialect his quicksprung optimism faded he and his were as alien to the namdaleni as to the imperials soteric knew him better than the other three and saw he had understood giving clozart a venomous glare he apolo gized as handsomely as he could we know your worth utprand agreed you would not be here else marcus nodded his thanks praise from a soldier like this one was praise to be cherished ill put what youve said to my men he said clozarts hard face reflected only dis belief but the tribune meant it there was no point in keeping the namdalener offer from the legionaries and no way to do so short of shutting them all in camp and killing any islander harry turtledove who came within hailing distance better by far to lead events than be led by them when the tribune emerged from his brotherinlaws tent fayard was nowhere to be seen the dice spoke loudly to namdaleni and he doubtless decided scaurus knew the way back to his own quarters his mind was spinning as he walked back to the roman camp his first feeling at soterics proposal still held true after a roman upbringing and almost two years in the empire of videssos being a count in the duchy seemed rather like being a large wolf in a small pack nor was he eager to aban don the empire the yezda were foes who needed fighting once the civil war was won if it could be won on the other hand when thinking only of the romans best interests namdalen looked attractive indeed he still had a hard time believing there could be land to offer freely to sol diers in rome the senate kept a jealous grip on it in the empire it was in the hands of the nobles with small free holders taxed to the wall land it would draw his men right enough and on another level altogether helvis would surely leave him if he said soteric nay and that he did not want what was between them refused to die batter it about as they would and they had a son was nothing ever simple gaius philippus waited just inside the north gate edgily pacing back and forth his saturnine features lit as he saw scaurus about time he said another hour and id have come after you and brought friends with me no need for that marcus said we have some talking to do though fetch glabrio and gorgidasand meet me back here well take a stroll outside the palisade bring the celt while youre at it this affects him too viridovix is it a talk you want or a brawl gaius phi lippus chuckled but he hurried away to do what the tribune asked marcus saw how the romans followed him with their eyes they knew something was afoot damn soteric and his amateur theatrics he thought it was only a couple of minutes before the men whose judgment he most trusted and respected were gathered round him curiosity on their faces he led them into the night talk ing all the while of little things doing his futile best to make the conference seem ordinary to his men an emperor for the legion out of earshot of the camp though he dropped the facade and gave a bald recounting of what had passed a thoughtful silence followed as his comrades began to work the thing through much as he had on his way back from soterics tent gaius philippus was the first to break it were it up to me id tell em no i havent a thing against the islanders theyre brave men and fine friends to drink with but i dont want to spend the rest of my days living among barbarians the senior centurion had in full measure the sense of superior ity the romans felt for all other peoples save greeks in this world videssos was the standard by which such things were gauged and he identified himself with the imperial folk here forgetting they reckoned him as barbarous as the namdaleni gorgidas understood that perfectly well but his choice was the same he said i left elis for rome years ago because i knew my home was a backwater am i to reverse that course now i think not here i stay theres too much i have yet to learn too much the men of the duchy dont know them selves the other two were slower to answer viridovix said sure and its not an easy choice you set us scaurus dear but i think im for the change belike for all the reasons the last two were against it im easier with the islanders than with these sly haughty imperials where you never know the thought in a mans head until one day theres a hired dagger between your ribs because he misliked the cut of your tunic aye ill go that left only quintus glabrio to judge by the pain on his face his was the hardest choice of all and i he said fi nally gorgidas sharp intake of breath only made him seem more miserable but he went on its the land more than anything else the hope of it was the only reason i took ser vice in the legions it was the chance to be my own man one day not a slave to someone elses wages without land no one really has anything youre a worse slave to land than to any human master gaius philippus retorted i joined the eagles to keep from starving at the miserable little stonebound plot where i was bom you want to walk behind an oxs arse from sunup to sundown boy you must be daft but glabrio only shook his head his dream was proof against the senior centurions harsh memories proof even harry turtledove against his bond with gorgidas the physician looked like a soldier doggedly not showing a wound pained him but he made no complaint against his companions decision what ever his eyes might say marcus admired him the more think ing of his own private fears and wondering how much they would sway his course the centurions were too welldisciplined and gorgidas too polite to ask the obvious question but viridovix put it square ly and what does your honor intend to do scaurus had hoped some consensus might show itself in his comrades answers but they were as divided among them selves as he was in himself he stood silent a long while feeling his inner balance sway now one way now the other at last he said with this attack gone for nothing i dont think gavras has any real chance to take the city and without it hell lose the civil war ill go to namdalen i think under the sphrantzai the empire will fall and in any case i would not serve them the yezda almost are better for they wear no mask of virtue even with the decision made he was far from sure it was right he said in this i will give no man orders let each one do as he will gaius my friend my teacher i know youll do gallantly with the men who feel as you do they embraced scaurus was shocked to see tears on the veterans cheeks a man does what he thinks is right gaius philippus said a long time ago when i was hardly more than a boy i fought on marius side in the civil war while my closest friend chose sulla while the war lasted i would have killed him if i could but years later i happened to meet him in a tavern and we drank the place dry between us may it be so with you and me one day may it be so marcus whispered and his own face was wet viridovix was hugging gaius philippus now saying the crows take me if i wont miss you you hardshell runt and i you you great hulking savage with their long habit of discretion what gorgidas and quintus glabrio thought they kept to themselves theres no point in throwing the camp into an uproar to night marcus said morning muster will be the right time to let the men know their choice keep it to yourselves until then an emperor for the legion harry turtledove there were nods all around they walked slowly back to the palisade not one picking up the pace all thinking this might be the last time they were together the raucous noises from behind the citys walls were an intrusion on their thoughts things sounded as much like a riot as a celebration the tribune thought bitterly he cursed the sphrantzai yet again for forcing him to a decision he did not want to make the sentries drooped like flowers in a drought when their officers passed them by without a hint of what they had dis cussed all through the camp men stared toward them be damned to you viridovix shouted ive not grown a second head nor a crest of purple feathers either so dinna be dragging your eyes over me so the celts short temper was reassuringly normal legionaries turned back to their food their talk or their endless games of chance gorgidas said youll forgive me i hope but i have wounded to attend to crude as my methods are much to his own dismay he still fought hurts with styptics and ointments tourniquets and sutures nepos maintained he had the skill to learn videssian healing arts but his efforts bore no fruit scaurus suspected that was one reason and not the least he had decided to stay in videssos quintus glabrio followed the physician talking in a voice too low for scaurus to hear he saw gorgidas dip his head in a greek affirmative someone hefted a skin of wine viridovix ambled toward it drawn as surely as nails by a lodestone helvis was sleeping when the tribune ducked into their tent he touched her cheek felt her stir she sat up careful not to wake maine or dosti its late she said a sleepy complaint what do you want scaurus told her of her brothers plan speaking as tersely as he had to his officers she said nothing for a full minute when he was through then asked what will you do it was a curiously uninflected question all emotion waiting on the answer he said only ill go reasons did not matter now the essence of the thing was the choice itself even in the darkness he saw her eyes go wide she had been braced for a no and for the explosion that would follow it you will we will she said foolishly then she laughed in absolute delight forgetting her sleeping children she flung her arms around the tribunes neck planted a lopsided kiss on his mouth her joy did not make him any easier over his decision somehow it only brought into sharper focus the doubts he felt caught up in that joy she did not notice his somber mood when will we leave she asked eager and practical at the same time in three or four days id guess marcus answered with reluctance putting a date to the departure made it painfully real malric woke up and crossly stop talking so much he said i want to go back to sleep helvis scooped him up and hugged him were talking so much because were happy were going home soon her words meant nothing to her son who had been born in videssos and known no life save that of the camp how can we go home he asked we are home the tribune had to smile how do you propose to explain that to him hush helvis said rocking the sleepy boy back and forth phos be thanked hell leam what the word really means and thank you my very dear for giving him the chance i love you for it scaurus nodded a short abrupt motion he was still fight ing his internal battle and praise seemed suspect but with his choice made what need was there to load his qualms on her better he thought to hold them to himself he slid under the blanket this day had drained him and in another way the one upcoming would be worse but it was a long time before he slept turmoil outside woke him at first light of day he knuckled his eyes cursed groggily and then sat bolt upright the first cause for the uproar that crossed his mind was his mens somehow learning what was afoot he scrambled into his cloak and dashed out of the tent it would be all too easy for hubbub to turn to riot but there was no sign of riot though the legionaries were not standing to muster in front of their eightman tents in stead they were packed in a shoving shouting mass against the western wall of the camp peering and pointing over the an emperor for the legion palisade in high excitement more kept coming as the camp awakened the tribune pushed through the crowd his men gave way with salutes as they recognized him they were jammed so close together though that he took several minutes to work his way up to the palisade he did not have to be right by it his inches let him see over the last couple of ranks of men someone next to him pounded him on the back minucius the troopers eyes were alight with triumph his strong features stretched in a grin will you look at that sir he exclaimed will you just look at that for a moment marcus still did not know what he meant there ahead was thorisins earthwork and beyond it the cap itals fortifications silently indomitable as always that sentence had no sooner taken shape than it echoed like a gong inside him no wonder the great double walls seemed silent in the dawn not a defender was on them he felt giddy as if he had gulped down a jug of neat wine step aside make room he cried ramming his way to the very front he had to see as much as he could be as close as he could normally he would have been ashamed to use his rank so but in his excitement he did not give it a second thought there were the silver gates straight ahead the works that had beaten back everything his men could throw at them they were wide open now and in them stood three men with torches almost hopping in their eagerness to wave the be siegers into videssos their shouts came thinly across the no mans land between the city and the siegeworks hurrah for thorisin gavras avtokrator of the videssians viii the torchwavers and their friends behind them were as unsavory a lot of ruffians as the tribune had ever seen gaudy in street finery baggy tunics with wide flopping sleeves and tights dyed in an eyesearing rainbow of colors they swarmed around the orderly roman ranks flourishing cudgels and shortswords and shouting at the top of their lungs no matter who they were though their cries were what scaurus most wanted to hear gavras the emperor dig up ortaias bones to the milestone with the sphrantzai the dungmunching skotoslovers as he looked north along the wall the tribune saw thori sins army loping by squads and companies through every wideflung gate the namdaleni were moving up from their stretch of siege line along with all the rest if gavras was a winner after all withdrawal suddenly looked foolish reprieve gaius philippus said and marcus nodded feeling relief like a cool wind in his mind he blessed the mixed emotions that had made him hesitate before announcing the pullout to his men never had he come to a decision more reluctantly and never was he gladder to see events overturn it helvis would be disappointed but victory paid all debts she would get over it he told himself the news grew wilder with every step he took into the city until he had no idea what to believe ortaias had abdicated taken refuge in the high temple fled the city been overthrown been killed been torn into seven hundred pieces so even his ghost would never find rest the rebellion had started because of food riots treachery among ortaias an emperor for the legion backers and anger at the excesses of outis rhavas men of the great count drax or of the khamorth its leader was rhavas mertikes zigabenos whom scaurus vaguely re membered as nephon khoumnos aide the princess em press aiypia balsamon the patriarch or no one they dont know whats happening any more than we do gaius philippus said in disgust as he listened to the ump teenth contradictory tale all of them told with passionate con viction you might as well shut your ears that was not quite true on one thing at least all rumors came together though the rest of videssos had slipped from their hands the sphrantzai still held the palace quarter unlike much of what he heard that made sense to scaurus many buildings in the palace complex were fortresses in their own right perfect refuges for a faction beaten elsewhere it also decided scaurus course of action the silver gate opened onto middle street the capitals main thoroughfare which ran directly to the palaces with but a single dogleg the tribune told the buccinators blow doubletime above the blare of horns he shouted come on boys weve waited long enough for this the legionaries raised a cheer and quickstepped down the slatepaved street at a pace that soon left most of the rowdies gasping far behind them the tribune remembered the romans parade along middle street the day they first came to the capital then it had been slow march with a herald in front of them crying make way for the valiant romans brave defenders of the empire the street had cleared like magic today pedestrians got no more warning than the clatter of ironspiked sandals on the flag stones and if phos was with them a shouted gangway after that it was their own lookout and more than one was flung aside or simply run down and trampled just as they had on that first day the sidewalks filled to watch the troops go by to videssos fickle jaded populace even civil war could become entertainment farmers and tradesmen monks and students whores and thieves fat mer chants and sorecovered beggars all came rushing out to see what the new spectacle might be some cheered some called down curses on the sphrantzai but most just stood and stared delighted the morning had brought them this diversion marcus saw an elderly woman point at the legionaries heard her screech its the gamblers come to sack vi harry turtledove dessos she used city slang for the namdaleni even in the language of insult theology came into play curse the ignorant harridan thought scaurus the crowds had just left off being a mob they could become one again in an instant but the leader of the street toughs a thickshoul dered bear of a man named arsaber was still jogging along beside the legionaries and came to their rescue now shut it you scrawny old bitch he bellowed these here aint gam blers theyre our friends the ronams so dont you give em any trouble hear he turned back to the tribune grinning a rottentoothed grin you ronams youre all right i remember during the riots last summer you put things down without enjoying it too much he spoke of riots and the quelling thereof with the expert knowledge someone else might show on wine thanks to a bungling heralds slip at the imperial reception just after the romans came to videssos much of the city still mispronounced their name marcus did not think the moment ripe for correcting arsaber though well thanks he said the plaza of stavrakios the coppersmiths district al ready full of the sound of hammering the plaza of the ox the redgranite imperial office building that doubled as ar chives and jail and a double handful of phos temples large and small all flashed quickly by as the legionaries stormed toward the palaces then middle street opened out into the plaza of palamas the greatest forum in the city scaurus nicked a glance at the milestone a column of the same red granite as the imperial offices there must have been a score of heads mounted on pikes at its base like so many gruesome fruit nearly all were fresh but terror had not been enough to keep the sphrantzai on the throne the plaza market stalls were open but thorisin gavras blockade had cut deeply into their trade bakers oil sellers butchers and wine merchants had little to sell and that ra tioned and supervised by government inspectors ironically it was commerce in luxuries that flourished under the siege jewels and precious metals rare drugs amulets silks and brocades found customers galore these were the things that could always be exchanged for food so long as there was food the eruption of more than a thousand armed men into the an emperor for the legion plaza of palamas sent the rich merchants flying for their lives stuffing their goods into pockets or pouches and kicking over their stalls in their panic to be gone will you look at the loot getting away viridovix said wistfully shut up gaius philippus growled dont give the lads more ideas than they have already his vinestave staff of office thwacked down on the corseleted shoulder of a legion ary who had started to stray come on paterculus the fights this way besides you bonehead the pickingsll be better yet in the palaces that prediction was plenty to keep the men in line the troopers who heard him fairly purred in anticipation they thundered past the great oval of the amphitheater the southern flank of palamas plaza then they were into the quarter of the palaces its elegant buildings set off from one another by artfully placed gardens and groves and wide stretches of closetrimmed emerald lawn a roman swore and dropped his scutum to clutch at his right shoulder with his left hand high overhead an archer in a cypress tree whooped and nocked another shaft his triumph was shortlived zeprin the reds great twohanded axe was made for hewing heads not timber but the muscular haloga proved no mean woodsman the axe bit jerked free bit again chips flew at every stroke the cypress swayed tot tered fell the snipers scream of terror cut off abruptly as he was crushed beneath the trunk the gardeners will be angry at me zeprin said a long time veteran of the imperial guard he thought of the palace complex as his home and mourned the damage he had done it for the dead enemy he showed no remorse dinna fash yoursel haloga dear viridovix told him dryly theyll be after having other things on their minds he waved ahead a barricade of logs broken benches and leveredup paving flags scarred the smooth expanse of lawn there were helmeted soldiers behind it and bodies in front the highwater mark it seemed of the mobs attack on the palaces the makeshift works might have been strong enough to hold off rioters but scaurus troops were another matter and a second look told him the defenders were not many battle linehe ordered his men shook themselves out into harry turtledove place their hobnailed caligae ripping the smooth turf his eyes caught gaius philippus they nodded together charge the tribune shouted and the romans rolled down on the barricade a few arrows snapped toward them but only a few with cries of gavras and thorisin they hit the waisthigh rampart and started scrambling over some of the warriors on the other side stayed to fight with saber and spear but most seeing themselves hopelessly outnumbered turned to flee dont follow too close let em run gaius philippus roared out in latin so the enemy could not understand theyll show us where their mates are lurking the command tested roman obedience to the utmost for their foes used not only the sphrantzai and ortaias as war cries but also rhavas it was all the senior centurion could do to hold his men in check the battleheat was on them fanned hotter by lust for vengeance but gaius philippus levelheaded order proved its worth the enemy fell back not on the barracks where scaurus had expected them to make their stand but through the ceremonial buildings of the palace complex and past the hall of the nine teen couches to the grand courtroom itself after phos high temple the most splendid edifice in all videssos the hall of the nineteen couches had walls of greenshot marble and gilded bronze double doors that would have done credit to a keep it was useless as a strongpoint though for a dozen low wide windows made it impossible to hold against assault marcus wished the same was true of the grand courtroom it was a small compound in its own right with outsweeping wings of offices making three sides of a square archers stood on the domed roof of the courtroom proper others looking for targets peered through windows in the wings those win dows were few small and high the architect who designed the thickset building of golden sandstone had made sure it could double as a citadel zeprin scaurus shouted and the haloga appeared be fore him axe at port arms the tribune said since youve already turned logger hack me down a couple of tall straight ones for rams rams against the grand gates zeprin the red sounded horrified an emperor for the legion i know theyre treasures marcus said with what patience he could but do you think those whoresonsll come out by themselves after a moment the haloga sighed and shrugged aye there are times when its what must be done not what should be his thick muscles bunched under his mail shirt he at tacked the stately pines with a ferocity that told something of his dismay the romans were at the footandahalf thick trunks as fast as they fell chopping branches away and then tugging the trimmed logs up all right at em gaius philippus said the men at the rams clumsily swung their heavy burdens toward the grand gates shieldmen leaped out on either side of them to cover them from arrowfire the makeshift batterers of course had no mantlets marcus hoped the enemy trapped inside the grand courtroom had not had time to bring anything more lethal than bowmen up to the roof the ram crews lumbered forward warded by their comrades upraised scuta the grand gates groaned at the impact as if in pain the logs jolted from the romans hands men tumbled writhing as they fell to keep from being crushed they scrambled to their feet lifted the rams once more and drew back for another blow more legionaries fanned out to deal with the few dozen men who had fled to the grand courtroom too late to take shelter inside soon only romans stood erect in the courtyard not one of rhavas men had asked for quarter in that at least they perfectly understood the temper of their foes out of the comer of his eye marcus noticed the upper stories of the nearby hall of ambassadors they were crowded with faces watching the fighting the tribune had several friends among the foreign envoys he hoped they were safe this he thought was a closer view of videssos govern ment in action than they were likely to want rhavas archers were hitting back one sharpshooter high on the courtroom dome scored again and again then he crumpled sliding down over the orangered tiles to fall like so many limp rags to the greenery far below the range and upward angle had made him a nearly impos sible mark well shot marcus cried looking round to find out who had picked off the bowman he saw viridovix pounding a skinny swarthy man on the back arigh arghuns harp turtledove son the envoy of the arshaum to videssos court his noma dic people dwelt on the steppe west of the khamorth and he carried a plainsmans short homreinforced bow bitter expe rience against the yezda had taught scaurus how marvelously long and flat those bows shot the dead sharpshooter was but another proof isnt he the finest little fellow now viridovix crowed gleefully thumping arigh again the big ruddy celt and slight flatfaced blackhaired nomad made a strange pair but they had often roistered together when the romans were sta tioned in the city each owned a fierce uncomplicated view of life that appealed to the other the more so in the wordlywise capital the tribunes brief musing was snapped by a scream within the grand courtroom a womans shriek of mortal anguish that sent the hairs on his arms and at the nape of his neck bristling upright hardened though they were the romans and their foes both stood frozen in horror for a moment before returning to their business of murdering one another marcus first thought after his wits began to work again was that alypia gavra might well be in the besieged court room if that scream had been hers harder damn you he shouted to the men at the rams and shoved sword in scabbard so he could take hold of a log the ram crews needed no urging the cry had put fresh spirit in them as well they rushed forward the grand gates tolled like a subbass bell scaurus fell scraping elbows and knees and feeling the wind half knocked from him almost as if he had run fulltilt into the gates himself he leaped to his feet and ran back to the log never notic ing the fistsized stone that smashed into the grass where he had sprawled then it was back and forward again and yet again the rough bark drew blood from even the most cal lused hands twice as tall as a man the burnished gates were leaning drunkenly back against the bar that held them upright quintus glabrios clear voice rang out once more this one pays for all the rams crashed home with the desperate sound a great plank makes on breaking the bar gave way the grand gates flew open as if kicked cheering the romans surged forward a fierce volley met them but scaurus expecting such had an emperor for the legion put shieldmen in front of the ram crews to hold off the arrows then it was savage fighting at the breached gate the small opening kept the romans from bringing their full numbers into play and rhavas bandits fought with the reckless fury of men who knew themselves trapped even so the legionaries were better armed and better trained step by bitter step they pushed their foes back from the entrance and into the court room as he fought his way past the grand gates marcus felt the dismay zeprin the red had known when the tribune ordered rams brought to bear against them the high reliefs on them were exquisite a wordless chronicle of the emperor stavra kios conquest of agder in the far northeast eleven hundred years before here the imperial troops led back prisoners the bowed heads of the captive women agonizing portraits of de spair a little higher engineers carved a road along the side of a cliff so the army could advance a pack mules hoof skittered on the edge of disaster at the join of the gates stavrakios led a counterattack against the halogai and over all stood the miracle of phos when hot sun in midwinter melted a frozen river and trapped the barbarians without retreat the videssian god appeared in brooding majesty above his chosen folk but agder was lost to the empire these last eight long centuries and now the reliefs that showed its overthrow themselves met war the rams had flattened mountains and crushed faces with impartial brutality a tiny twisted bronze ear was trampled in the grass at the tribunes feet nothing can come into being without change he told himself but the maxim did little to console him he shouldered past one of rhavas bravoes thrust home under the arm where his mail shirt was weak the man groaned and twisted away enlarging his own wound as he fell scaurus tore his small round shield from him to replace the scutum left outside the courtroom marcus eyes took a few seconds to adjust to the relative gloom within he had expected to face outis rhavas at the entrance had ortaias sphrantzes foul captain fled no there he was by a seething iron cauldron in the very center of the porphyry floor the rude log fire kindled on that perfect surface was a desecration in itself a knot of men around him jostled one another each trying to dip a surcoat sleeve into whatever mixture bubbled in the kettle harry turtledove by it sprawled a gutted corpse naked female the druids stamps on marcus blade flared into light but he did not need them to warn him of magic the fight was not the wellplanned carefully orchestrated engagement in which gaius philippus could take pride the romans perforce broke ranks to battle through the grand gates inside the courtroom it was a vicious sprawl of fight ing one on one three against two up and down the broad center aisle and around the tall columns of lightdrinking ba salt a hanging of cloth of gold and scarlet silk came tumbling down to enfold a handful of warriors in its precious web marcus fought his way toward rhavas he moved cau tiously his hobnailed caligae would not bite on the glass smooth flooring and he felt as if he were walking on ice when one of rhavas men stumbled against him they both fell heavily they grappled so closely locked together scaurus could smell his enemys fear he could not stab with his sword it was too long he smashed the pommel into the brigands face until the clutching arms around him relaxed their grip the tribune staggered to his feet there were shouts out side more of thorisins men reaching the palace complex at last through videssos maze of streets scaurus had no time for them outis rhavas loomed over him a tower of enameled steel from closed helm to mailed boots most videssians fought by choice from horseback and thus preferred sabers but as he had in the brush at the rampart rhavas swung a heavy longsword his giant frame made it a wickedly effective weapon even the tall scaurus gave away inches of reach a pity you scrape your face bare rhavas hissed his voice full of venom it ruins the pleasure of shaving your corpse the tribune did not answer he knew the taunt was only meant to enrage and distract him their blades rang together as marcus had already found outis rhavas was as skilled as he was strong stroke by stroke he drove the roman back it was all scaurus could do to parry the storm of blows after the protection of his lost scutum the small shield he carried seemed no more useful than a ladys powder puff but for all their fell captains might rhavas band was falling back around him they fought as bandits do furiously an emperor for the legion but without order though the legionaries maniples were in disarray long training had drilled into them the notion that they were parts of a greater whole like a constricting snakes coils they pressed constantly never yielding an advantage once gained thus when rhavas threatened marcus he was alone while viridovix and half a dozen romans leaped to the tribunes defense balked of his prey rhavas cursed horribly but he gave ground falling back until he was one of the last de fenders of the cauldron that still boiled and steamed in the center of the courtroom even through woodsmoke marcus caught its contents sicksweet carrion reek but a score of rhavas soldiers had already wet their sleeves in the liquid and not soldiers alone the sleeve that went into the pot now was purple satin shot through with thread of silver and gold vardanes the tribune shouted and at the cry the elder sphrantzes jerked as if jabbed with a pin scaurus had rarely seen ortaias uncle other than perfectly composed or known that round ruddy face with its fringe of neat black beard to reflect anything but what the sevastos wanted seen but now he wore the furtive guilty look of a man surprised at a per version the battle stiffened some of rhavas bandits it seemed would not fall no matter what blows landed on them marcus heard gaius philippus snarl go down you bastard go down heard the soft meaty sound of a blade driven home but the senior centurions foe only grinned like a snake scaurus saw the yellowish stain on his surcoat sleeve he slashed back at the roman a clumsy stroke gaius philippus turned with his shield but doubt clouded the veterans eyes how was he to beat a man he could not wound that same doubt appeared on more and more roman faces as rhavas anointed gained confidence in their invulnerability to steel they began running risks no warrior would have thought sane taking ten blows to land one they taunted the legionaries as boys will taunt a savage dog when safely be hind a high fence and inevitably they took their share of victims the roman advance stumbled smiling wickedly a tall jackallean videssian engaged viridovix the cutthroat swung his sword twohanded what need had he of shield the big gaul slid to one side light on harry turtledove his feet as a great hunting cat his blade twin to scaurus own sang through the air druids marks flashing gold it bit through flesh and windpipe and bone before the expression of horrified surprise could form on the brigands face his head leaped from his shoulders hitting the ground with a warm splattery thud the spouting corpse collapsed its limbs thrashing for a moment not realizing they were dead viridovixs banshee howl of triumph filled the courtroom he leaped forward another mucksleeved ruffian fell clutch ing at the guts the celts sword laid out into his hands neatas an anatomical demonstration marcus went hunting stained surcoats too realizing that as had always been true in videssos his good gallic blade was proof against sorcery like viridovix he killed his first man with ridiculous ease not knowing the weapon he faced the bandit scarcely bothered to protect himself he gasped as the tribunes sword found his heart then tried to breathe but coughed blood instead liar he whispered slumping to the floor his eyes were on rhavas the harsh captains men wavered in their attack new found confidence faltering as they watched their comrades die so in surprise then arsaber the hulking street ruffian felled yet another of their number his heavy club making a shattered ruin of the left side of his opponents face gaius philippus was no scholar but in battle he missed nothing its only iron wont hurt em he shouted to the legionaries he snatched a pilum from one of the romans grabbing the shank to wield it clubwise he shouted in fierce delight as the blow sent one of rhavas warriors spinning back sword flying from nerveless fingers marcus did not think that man would rise again the senior centurion had ex orcised all his fear of magic in one prodigious swing stand you ballless rabbits rhavas bellowed and var danes sphrantzes welltrained baritone rose in exhortation hold fast hold fast but they were shouting against a gale of fear roaring through their followers sword and spear had not held the romans and now sorcery failed as well one desperate band cut its way clean through the legion aries its handful of survivors dashed through the grand gates intent only on escape marcus heard their cries of despair as an emperor for the legion they ran headlong into more of thorisin gavras troops out side with agility bom of desperation bandits clawed their way up wall hangings to insecure refuges in window niches ten feet above the floor others tried to surrender but not many of scaurus men would let them yield quintus glabrio kept more than one from being killed out of hand but he could not be everywhere outis rhavas cut down a bolting man from behind and then another his own way of encouraging his bandits to stand and fight but even with the hardiest of his irregulars at his side the surging romans at last drove him from his wizards cauldron he fell back toward the imperial throne marcus traded swordstrokes with one of his lieutenants the man was fast as a striking viper he pinked scaurus twice in quick succession and a vicious slash just missed the tri bunes eye but the cutthroats heel slipped in the great pool of blood that had gushed from the serving wench his master had killed before he could recover scaurus blade tore out his throat he fell across the girls outraged corpse as the tribune pushed forward he glanced down into the iron pot rhavas had defended with such ferocity and found himself looking at horror floating in the boiling scumfilled water was a dead baby the soft flesh beginning to fall away from its bones no he corrected himself not even a baby the tiny body was no longer than the distance between the tips of his outstretched thumb and little finger his eyes slipped to the serving wenchs opened belly back in disbelief to the cauldron and he was sick where he stood he spat again and again to clear his mouth of the taste and wished he might somehow wipe his vision clear so easily cold in him was the knowledge that there were after all worse evils than doukitzes tortured death he was tempted to follow the creed of videssos for in outis rhavas surely skotos walked on earth that thought led to another and sudden dreadful certainty gripped him rhavas he shouted the name was putrid as the vomit on his tongue then he solved the others anagram his monstrous joke and cried another name avshar it grew very still within the grand courtroom blows hung in the air unstruck outis rhavas name brought with it rage and hatred but the wizardprince of yezd had struck cold terror into videssos heart for a generation inside the ranks of harry turtledove rhavas men marcus saw vardanes sphrantzes red cheeks go pale as he understood his states greatest foe had been a chief upholder of his rule across the thirty feet that separated them rhavas no avshar dipped his head to the tribune in derisive acknow ledgement of his astuteness very good he chuckled and scaurus wondered how he had not known that fell voice at first hearing you have more wit than these dogs it seems much good will it do you after that moment of stunned dismay the legionaries hurled themselves with redoubled fury at the backers of him who had styled himself outis rhavas the men they faced threw down their swords in scores rhavas the brigand chief was a captain they had followed in hope of blood and plunder but few were the videssians who would willingly serve av shar a bandit leaped at his longtime masters back saber upraised to cut him down but avshar whirled with the speed of a wolf his heavy longsword smashed through helm and skull alike a dog indeed he cried nipping at the heels he followed are there more the men who had been his flinched away in fright all save a black handful who still clove to him who would have hap pily fought for him had they thought him skotos enfleshed the worst of his band but far from the weakest almost all wore surcoats stained with his protective brew no qualm of conscience had kept them from dipping their sleeves in that horrid pot vardanes sphrantzes stood in indecision a spider caught in a greater spiders web he did not think of himself as an evil man merely a practical one and he feared avshar with the sincere fear a far from perfect man can have for one truly wicked but the sevastos was more afraid to yield himself to scaurus and through him to thorisin gavras he knew too well the common fate of losers in videssos civil wars and also knew his actions in raising his nephew to the throne and since were sure to doom him in the victors eyes the wizardprince saw sphrantzes waver he flayed him into motion with the whip of his voice come worm do you think you can do without me now and vardanes who had felt only contempt for soldiers looked once more at the romans crested helms and at their stabbing swords and long an emperor for the legion spears it seemed they were all bearing down on him alone his will failed him and he fled with avshar the way they chose the only way they could have cho sen was a narrow spiral stair that opened out into the grand courtroom just to the right of the imperial thrones gold and sapphire brilliance it had not been part of the throne rooms original design for it brutally abridged a delicate wall mosaic marcus wondered what ancient treason caused some cautious emperor to put safety above beauty once avshars few partisans had gained the stair the le gionaries advance was easy no more those steps had been made so one man could hold back an army and the wizard prince himself was rear guard a cork not to be lightly pulled from the bottle the tribune and viridovix attacked by turns not only were they nearest avshar in size and strength but theirs were blades to stand against his sorcery at every stroke the druids marks incised upon them flashed golden turning aside the banes locked within his brand legionaries crowding close behind their champions jabbed spears over them at avshar warded as he was the thrusts could not hurt him but spoiled his swordstrokes and threatened to trip him up his heavy blade hewed clear through more than one soft iron pilumshsmk nevertheless he was forced back step by slow step lets the both of us fight him at the same time viridovix panted marcus shook his head the stairway was so narrow two men abreast would only foul each other but he would have refused had it been wider the first time his sword had met the gauls they were whirled here were they to touch again only the gods knew what might befall the spiral wound through three complete turns then av shars massive frame was silhouetted against a background lighter than the stairways oppressive gloom the wizard prince drew back away from the topmost step as if inviting his pursuers to come on that marcus did but warily expecting deviltry he re membered avshars escape from videssos the year before the seawall arsenals suddenslammed door the corpse of the wizards servant speaking with his masters voice the swords and spears that flew to the attack with no man wielding them r harry turtledove avshar was never more dangerous than when seeming to give way a blade slammed against his upraised shield but there was a ruffian back of it a redfaced man with a great mat of greasy black beard scaurus parried countered the thrust was clumsy but his reach and long blade made his stocky foe give back a pace he stepped up quickly viridovix only a single stair behind him legionaries jamming the stairway behind the suite above the throne room had to be the emperors disrobing chamber a private retreat from the ceremonial of the grand courtroom there had been marcus saw six or eight wellstuffed chairs and a couch set up in the outer room av shars men had flung them against the seascapepainted walls to gain fighting room the rough treatment had burst one and gray feathers whirled in the air even as he fenced with the blackbearded highbinder scaurus wondered why avshar had yielded the stair so easily there at the end why for the moment he was leaving the battle to his henchmen where was he hardly time to see with this cutthroat hacking away like a berserker the tribune let his foes slash hiss past stepped forward inside the sabers arc and ran himthrough the throat aye there was avshar in front of a closed door with vardanes sphrantzes he bent low to say something to the sevastos who shook his head avshar smashed him in the face with his gauntleted hand vardanes strongwilled in this ruin of all his hopes still would not do the wizards bidding with cold deliberation avshar hit him again marcus saw something crumple inside the proud sevastos all his life the bureaucrat had upheld his faction by circumventing brute force by bringing videssos proud soldiers to heel without violence now at last he had to confront it with no buffers and found he could not he pulled a brass key from his belt worked the lock and slipped into the room beyond marcus forgot him almost as soon as he disappeared fighting back to back the tribune and viridovix cleared enough space to let the legionaries emerge a couple at a time from the stairwell even with reinforcements constantly added the fight was savage save for scaurus sword and the celts roman blades would not wound avshars men they had to be clubbed into submission with spearshafts and other an emperor for the legion makeshift bludgeons or else disarmed by a clever sword stroke and then wrestled to the floor and dispatched with bare hands they made the romans pay dearly for each life the price would have been higher yet but avshar as if conceding all was lost stood aloof from the struggle watch ing his men die one by one only when a legionary drew too near the door he was guarding did his blade flash forth wielded as always with skill and might to daunt a hero there was no shame in seeking easier prey and so in the end the wizardprince stood all alone before that doorway facing a lesser foe the romans would have rolled over him and after vardanes sphrantzes but avshar was like a lion brought to bay the debased majesty in him carried awe min gled with the dread push forward scaurus thought make an end but avshars gaze came baleful through visor slits and the tribune could not move even viridovix a stranger to intimidation stood frozen a strange silence fell broken only by the legionaries panting and the moans of the injured without turning avshar rapped on the door behind him his ironknuckled hand made it jump on its hinges only silence answered him he hit it again saying come out fool lest i stand aside and let them have you there was another pause but as avshar began to slide away from the door vardanes sphrantzes drew it open the sevastos clutched a dagger in his right hand his left cruelly prisoned the wrist of a young girl she wore only a short shift of transparent golden silk that served but to accent her naked ness beneath for all its paint her face was not a palace tarts the knowl edge on it was of a different kind but not until her calm greeting well met marcus aemilius scaurus did the tri bune know her for alypia gavra caught by surprise he took an involuntary step forward sphrantzes dagger leaped for her throat light glinted off the mirrorbright sliver of steel the stiletto was only a nobles jewelencrusted toy but it could let her life river out before any man could stop it alypia stood motionless under its cold caress scaurus also froze two paces away let her go var danes he urged watching sphrantzes closely vardanes plump face was unnaturally pale save for two spots of red harry turtledove that marked the impact of avshars hand a thin trickle of blood ran from his left nostril into his beard his pearlbe decked sevastos coronet sat awry on his head for the dandy sphrantzes was a telling sign of disintegration his eyes were wide and staring trapped eyes let her go marcus repeated softly she wont buy your escape you know that the sevastos shook his head but the dagger fell not much but an inch or two avshar chuckled his mirth more terrible than a shriek of hate aye let her go vardanes he said let her go just as you let videssos go when it was in your hands you took your pleasure from it as from her and then watched with drool dribbling down your chin as it slipped through your fingers of course let her go what better way to end your bungling life even as a puppet you were worthless marcus never knew whether avshars contempt was more than the sevastos could endure or whether in some last calcu lation of his own vardanes decided and perhaps rightly the wizardprinces death might be the one coin to buy his safety from thorisin gavras whatever his reasons he sud denly shoved alypia forward sending her stumbling into the tribunes arms then whirled and drove his dagger into av shars armored breast the thin steel needle was the perfect weapon to pierce a cuirass and sphrantzes desperate stab was backed by all the power his wellfed frame could give scaurus had always thought there was muscle under that fat now he knew it for when vardanes hand came away the stiletto was driven home hiltdeep but avshar did not crumple ah vardanes he said laughing a laugh jagged as broken glass futile to the very end my magics proofed you against cold irons bite did you think they would do less for me their maker see now it should be done this way swift as a serpents strike he seized the sevastos lifted him off his feet and flung him against the wall marcus heard his skull shatter the exact sound he thought of a dropped crock of porridge blood sprayed over the painted waves var danes was dead before he slid to the floor avshar drew the dagger from his chest tucked it into his belt a very good day to you all he said with a last mock ing bow and darted into the farther chamber an emperor for the legion his flight freed the romans from the paralysis with which they had watched the past minutes drama they rushed to the door but though the locks were on the outside they would not open the romans attacked the door with swords and their armored shoulders but the apartment over the throne room was among other things a redoubt and the portal did not yield through the noise of their pounding came avshars voice loudly chanting in some harsh tongue that was not videssian more magic marcus thought with a twist of fear in his guts zeprin he shouted and then cursed the confused pushing and shoving that followed as the haloga bulled his way up the crowded spiral stair he burst puffing out of the stair well the climb had left his normally ruddy features almost purple his head swiveled till he spied scaurus tall horsehair plume the tribune stabbed his thumb at the door avshars on the other side he marcus had been about to warn the haloga that avshar was brewing sorcery but found himself ignored zeprin the red had nursed his hatred and lust for vengeance since mavrikios fell at maragha now they exploded he hurled himself at the doorway roaring where will you run now wizard legionaries scattered as his great axe came down it was as well they did in his berserk fury the haloga paid them no heed timbers split under his hammerstrokes no wood no matter how thick or seasoned could stand up to such an as sault for long scaurus realized his arms were still tight around alypia gavra her skin was warm through the thin negligee your pardon my lady he said here he wrapped her in his scarlet cape of rank thank you she said stepping free of him to draw it around her her green eyes carried gratitude but only as a thin crust over pain ive known worse than the touch of a friend she added quietly before marcus could find a suitable reply zeprin shouted in triumph as the doors boards and bolts gave up the unequal struggle axe held high he shouldered his way past the riven timbers followed close by scaurus and viridovix each with his strong blade at the ready gaius philippus and more romans pushed in after them the tribune had not got much of a glimpse beyond the harry turtledove shattered door when vardanes opened it nor again when av shar took refuge behind it he stared now in amazement it was a chamber straight from an expensive brothel the ceiling mirror of polished bronze the obscene but beautifully exe cuted wall frescoes the scattered bright silks that were donned only to be taken off the soft wide bed with its coverlets pulled down in invitation and he stared for another reason the same which brought zeprins rush to a stumbling confused halt a couple of paces into the room save for the invaders it was empty the ha logas knuckles were white round the haft of his axe primed to kill he found himself without a target his breath came in sobbing gasps as he fought to bring his body back under the control of his will marcus eyes flicked to the windows tall narrow slits through which a cat could not have crawled let alone a man viridovix rammed his sword into its scabbard a gesture elo quent in its disgust the cullions gone and magicked us again he said and swore in gaulish for all the sinking feeling in his stomach the tribune would not yet let himself believe that he ordered the soldiers behind him turn this place inside out for all we know avshars hiding under the bed or lurking in that closet there they stepped past him one suspicious legionary jabbed his gladius into the mattress again and again thinking avshar might somehow have got inside it nay its magic sure enough viridovix said dolorously as the search went on without success shut up marcus said but he was not paying much at tention to the celt he had just noticed the gilded manacles set into the bedposts and reflected that vardanes sphrantzes death perhaps had been too easy theres magic and magic gaius philippus said re member the whole yezda battle line winked out for a second until the videssian wizards matched their spell maybe thats the trick the whoresons using here that had not occurred to the tribune though he had scant hope in it he sent runners through the palace complex and others to phos high temple all seeking nepos the mage he also posted legionaries shoulder to shoulder in the broken doorway saying if avshar can make himself impalpable as well as invisible he deserves to get away an emperor for the legion no he doesnt gaius philippus growled the sound of more fighting pierced the slit windows scaurus went over for a look but their field of view was too narrow to show him anything but a brief glimpse of running men they were videssians but whether thorisins troops advancing or followers of the sphrantzai counterattacking he could not tell worried he decided to go downstairs to make sure the legionaries were in position to defend the grand courtroom at need their discipline should have been enough to make such precautions automatic but better safe what with avshars magic and the fight up the stairs usual patterns could slip he left the doorway full of guards and put others in front of the stairwell their eyes told him they thought their posts ab surd but they did not question him like fayard the namda lener they carried out their orders without complaint alypia gavra accompanied the tribune down the spiral stair so now you have seen my shame she said still out wardly as selfpossessed as ever but marcus saw how tightly she held his cape closed round her neck how she tugged at its hem with her other hand trying to make it cover more of her he knew she meant more than the wisp of yellow silk be neath that cape he spoke slowly choosing his words with care what does not corrupt a mans heart cannot corrupt his life or do him any lasting harm in rome it would have been a stoic commonplace but to the videssians deeds spoke louder than intentions as suited a folk who saw the universe as a war between good and evil thus alypia searched marcus face in the gloom of the stair well suspecting mockery finding none she said at last very low if i can ever come to believe that you will have given me back myself no thanks could be enough she stared straight ahead the rest of the way down the steps scaurus studied the stair wells rough stonework giving her what privacy he could alypia gasped in dismay as they came down into the throne room it no longer had the semblance of the empires solemn ceremonial heart but only of any battlefield after the fighting is done bodies and debris littered the polished floor which was further marred by drying pools of blood wounded men cursed groaned or lay silent according to how badly they harry turtledove were hurt gorgidas went from one to the next giving the aid he could a glance told marcus there would be no trouble at the grand gates unobtrusively effective as always quintus gla brio had a double squad of legionaries ready to hold off an attack but they were standing at ease now their pila grounded and swords sheathed the junior centurion waved to his commander everything under control he said and scaurus nodded avshars accursed kettle still steamed in the center of the hall though the fire under it had gone out the tribune tried to lead alypia by as quickly as he could but she stopped dead at the sight of the pathetic mutilated corpse beside it oh my poor dear kalline she whispered making phos circular sunsign over her breast i feared it was so when i heard your cry so this is your reward for loyalty to your mistress she somehow kept her features impassive but two tears slid down her cheeks then her eyes rolled up in her head and she crumpled to the floor her strong spirit at last over whelmed by the days series of shocks the borrowed cape came open as she fell leaving her almost bare one of vardanes trollops is she a roman asked the tribune leering down at her ive seen prettier faces maybe but by venus cleft thered be a lively time with those long smooth legs wrapped around me shes alypia gavra thorisins niece so shut your filth filled mouth scaurus grated the legionary fell back a pace in fright then darted off to find something anything to do somewhere else marcus watched him go surprised at his own fury the trooper had jumped to a natural enough conclusion at the tribunes call gorgidas hurried over to see to aly pia he put her in as comfortable a position as he could then folded scaurus cape around her again that finished he stood and started to go to the next injured legionary arent you going to do anything more marcus demanded what do you recommend gorgidas said i could prob ably rouse her but it wouldnt be doing her any favor as far as i can see the poor lass has had enough jolts to last any six people a lifetime can you blame her for fainting i say let her if thats what she needs rest is the best medicine the body knows and im damned if ill tamper with it an emperor for the legion well all right scaurus said mildly reminding himself for the hundredth time how touchy the greek was when any one interfered with his medical judgment alypia was stirring and muttering to herself when nepos came bustling in behind one of marcus runners despite a remorseful cluck at the damage the grand gates had taken the fat priest was in high good spirits as he entered the throne room he scattered blessings on everyone around him most romans ignored him but some of the legionaries had come to worship phos they and the videssians who had taken service with them bowed as nepos went past he saw scaurus and bobbed his head in greeting smiling broadly as he approached but he was less than halfway to the tribune when he staggered as at some physical blow phos have mercy he whispered what has been done here he moved forward again but slowly marcus thought of a man pushing his way into a heavy gale he looked into the cauldron with a cry of disgust a deeper loathing even than scaurus own the tribune saw the tortures wanton viciousness but as priest and mage nepos understood the malignance of the sorcery it powered and recoiled in hor ror from his understanding you did right to summon me he said visibly gathering himself that the sphrantzai opposed us is one thing but this this at a loss for words he paused i never imag ined they could fall to these depths ortaias sphrantzes from all i know of him is but a silly young man while var danes is lying dead upstairs scaurus finished for him nepos gaped at the tribune who went on the wizardry we dealt with but the wizard now in a few quick sentences he set out what had passed we may have him besieged up there he finished avshar trapped trapped nepos burst out when he was through why are you wasting my time with talk he may be marcus repeated but nepos was no longer listening the priest turned and ran for the stairway his blue robe flapping about his ankles marcus heard his sandals clat ter on the stairs heard him run into a descending roman get out of my way you rattlebrained slouching gowk nepos shouted his voice squeaking up into high tenor in his agitation there were brief shuffling sounds as he and the harry turtledove trooper jockeyed for position then he was past and dashing upward again when the legionary emerged from the stairwell he was still shaking his head who stuck a pin in himt he asked plain tively but got no answer alypia gavras eyes came open nepos had hardly spared her a second glance avshars foul sorcery and scaurus news that the wizardprince might still be taken drove from his mind such trivia as the emperors niece she sat slowly and carefully marcus was ready to help support her but she waved him away though she was still very pale her mouth twisted in annoyance i thought better of myself than this she said it doesnt matter the tribune answered the important thing is that youre safe and the citys in thorisins hands why so it is he thought rather dazedly he had been too caught up in the fighting to realize this was victory at last excitement flooded through him oh yes im perfectly safe alypias voice carried a weary cynical undertone marcus had not heard in it before my uncle will no doubt welcome me with open arms me the wife of his rival avtokrator and plaything of she broke off unwilling to bring even the thought to light we all knew the marriage was forced scaurus said stoutly alypia managed a wan smile but more at his vehe mence than for what he said some of his elation trickled away there could be an uncomfortable amount of truth in alypias worries he was distracted by the sound of nepos coming down the spiral stairway it was easy to recognize the priest by his foot falls his sandals slapped the stone steps instead of clicking off them as did the romans hobnailed footgear it was also easy to guess his mood for his descending steps were slow and heavy altogether unlike his excited dash upwards the first glimpse of him confirmed the tribunes fears the light was gone from his eyes while his shoulders slumped as if bearing the worlds weight gone marcus asked rhetori cally gone nepos echoed the stink of magic will linger for days but its author is escaped to torment us further skotos drag him straight to hell is there no limit to his strength a spell of apportation is known to us of the academy but it an emperor for the legion requires long preparation and will not let the caster carry chat tels yet avshar cast it in seconds and vanished armor sword and all phos grant that in his haste he blundered and projected himself into a volcanos heart or out over the open sea there to sink under the weight of his iron but the priests forlorn tone told how likely he judged that nor could scaurus make himself imagine so simple an end tor avshar the wizardprince he was sure had gone where he wanted to go and nowhere else whatever spot his malice chose as the one that would ham videssos worst and with that thought what was left of the taste of triumph turned sour in the tribunes mouth ix viridovix said it only goes to show what ive said all along theres no trust to be put in these videssians the city folk stand by the sphrantzai all through the siege and then turn on em after theyd gone and won it things are hardly as simple as that marcus replied leaning back in his chair the romans had returned to the barracks they occupied last year before mavrikios set out on campaign against the yezda the sweet scent of orange blos soms drifted in through wideflung shutters fine mesh kept nocturnal pests outside gaius philippus bit into a hard roll part of the iron rations every legionary carried as supplies inside the city were very short he chewed deliberately reached out to the low table in front of him for a mug of wine to wash the bite down aye the bloody fools brought it on themselves he agreed if rhavas no avshars i should say brigands hadnt been off plundering to celebrate beating us back zigabenos coup wouldnt have had a prayer his and alypia gavras marcus corrected a pail dropped with a crash and made gaius philippus jump have a care there you thumbfingered oafs he shouted the barracks were not in the same tidy shape the romans had left them during the siege they had held kha morth and from the smell and mess their horses as well legionaries swept scrubbed and hauled garbage away others made up fresh straw pallets to replace the filthy ones that had satisfied the nomads reluctantly the senior centurion returned to the topic at z an emperor for the legion hand well yes he said grudgingly to scaurus slow as usual to give a woman credit for wk and pluck but here credit was due marcus thought rumors still flew through videssos like cheese they had ripened through the day and now at evening some were truly bizarre but unlike most of the city scaurus had talked with some of the people involved in events and he had a fair notion of what had actu ally gone on lucky for us alypia realized thorisin would never take the city from outside he insisted the timing was hers and it could hardly have been better the princess and mertikes zigabenos who had kept his post as an officer of the imperial guard were plotting against the sphrantzai before thorisins siege even began alypias handmaiden kalline made the perfect gobetween her pregnancy protected her from suspicion and as it had resulted from a rape by one of rhavas roughs bound her to the plotters cause but as long as it seemed thorisin might capture videssos the conspiracy remained one of words alone after his assault failed though assault from inside the city suddenly became urgent alypia managed to get word to zi gabenos that ortaias had closeted himself away in the isolation of the private imperial chambers to compose a victory address to his troops gaius philippus knew that part of the story too his com ment was the lady could have sat tight one day more if there wouldnt have been a mutiny after that speech i dont know soldiers the senior centurion had endured more than one of ortais sphrantzes orations and exaggerated only slightly most of the regiments of the imperial guard had been lost at maragha though mertikes zigabenos kept his title outis rhavas troopers actually warded the sphrantzai but the romans had given them a hard tussle at the walls and after ward most of them went on a drinking spree which quickly led to fistfights and looting their victims naturally fought back which brought more of them out of the palace complex to reinforce their mates and gave zigabenos his chance he only commanded three squads of men but at the head of one of them he descended on ortaias secluded retreat harry turtledove seized the feckless avtokrator at his desk and spirited him away to the high temple of phos balsamon the patriarch had long been well inclined toward the gavrai the other two squads attacked the grand courtroom to rescue alypia and use her as a rallying point for rebellion their luck did not match their commanders kalline had been caught returning to her mistress rhavas himself questioned her he soon tore through her protests of innocence she started to scream an hour before midnight marcus remembered alypia saying and when she stopped i knew the secret was lost i never thought rhavas was avshar but i was sure he was not one to let her die under torture till it suited him the princess wouldbe rescuers walked into am bush none walked out again but zigabenos was either a student of past coups or had a gift for sedition from the high temple he sent criers to every quarter of the city with a single message come hear the patriarch everyone who claimed to be quoting balsamons speech for scaurus gave a different version the tribune thought that a great pity he could all but see balsamon on the high tem ples steps probably wearing the shabby monks robe he pre ferred to his patriarchal regalia the moments drama would have brought out the best in the old prelate torches held high against the night a sea of expectant faces waiting for what he would say whatever his exact words were they swung the city to ward thorisin gavras in a quarter of an hours time marcus was sure the sight of ortaias sphrantzes trussed up and shiver ing at the patriarchs feet had a good deal to do with that swing as did rhavas thieving band rampaging through the shops of videssos merchants once given focus by balsa mon the city mob was plenty capable of taking matters into its own hands almost you could feel sorry for vardanes viridovix said wiping grease from his chin with the back of his hand from somewhere or other in the hungry city he had managed to come up with a fat roast partridge the puppet master found he couldnt be doing without his puppet after all after what he had seen in the bedchamber over the throne room there was no room in marcus for pity over vardanes an emperor for the legion sphrantzes but the celts observation was astute much like the videssian army the citizens of the capital found ortaias foppish foolish pedantry more amusing than annoying and so his uncle had no trouble ruling through him but the elder sphrantzes though a far more able man than his nephew was himself quite cordially despised throughout the city once or taias was overthrown vardanes found no one would obey him when he gave orders in his own name his messengers had hurried out of the palace with orders for the regiments on the walls to put down the rising but some of those messengers deserted as soon as they were out of sight others were waylaid by the mob and those who carried out their missions found themselves ignored the sevastos videssian troops liked him no better than did their civilian cousins and his mercenaries thought of their own safety be fore his gavras would likely pay them too if he sat on the throne in the end only rhavas bandits and murderers stood by sphrantzes all hands were raised against them just as they were against him neither they nor he could afford fussiness vardanes got what he deserved the tribune said there at the last he was more avshars puppet than even ortaias had been his fish on a hook might be a better comparison yet he thought gorgidas said if rhavas and avshar are one and the same we probably know why doukitzes met the end he did eh why marcus said foolishly stifling a yawn two days of hard fighting left him too tired to follow the doctors reasoning gorgidas gave him a disdainful look to the greek wits were for use as a threat of course or more likely a prom ise you know the wizard has hated you since you bested him at swords that night in the hall of the nineteen couches he must have wished that were you under his knife not just one of your men avshar hates everyone scaurus said but gorgidas words carried an unpleasant ring of truth in them the tribune had had the same thought himself and did not care for it to be a viciously skilled mages personal enemy was daunting he was suddenly glad of his exhaustion it left him numb to worry harry turtledove despite the reassurances he had given himself that morn ing marcus was not eager to confront helvis with the obvious fact that they were staying in videssos he put off the evil moment as long as he could talking with his friends until his eyelids began gluing themselves shut the cool night air did little to rouse him as he walked to the barracks hall he had assigned to partnered legionaries it was not the same one of the romans four they had used the year before that hall with its partitions for couples privacy had been primarily a stable to the khamorth and the tribune wished hercules were here to run a river through it though the hall he had chosen for partnered men was tidier than that he found helvis busily cleaning not satisfied with the job the legionaries had done hello she said pecking him on the cheek as she swept on campaign i dont mind dirt but when were settled i cant abide it under other circumstances that speech might have glad dened scaurus who was fairly fastidious himself when he had the time but helvis voice was full of challenge we are going to be settled here arent we she pursued the tribune wished he had fallen asleep where he sat worn out as he was he did not want a quarrel he spread his hands placatingly yes for the time all right helvis said so abruptly that he blinked im not blind i can see it would be madness to leave videssos now marcus almost shouted in relief he had hoped her years as a soldiers woman would make her understand how the land lay but hadnt dared believe it she was not finished though the blue of her eyes re minded scaurus of steel as she went on this time well enough but the next we do what we must there was no doubt in the tribunes mind what she meant by that but he was content to let it go the issue was dead anyway he thought with the civil war done defection would not come up again he stripped off his armor and was asleep in seconds thorisin gavras was avtokrator selfproclaimed for nearly a year with ortaias sphrantzes beaten no one disputed his an emperor for the legion claim yet he remained a pretender in the eyes of videssian law until his formal coronation as with any other aspect of imperial life formality implied ceremony gavras was hardly inside the city before the cham berlains took charge of him the empires topsyturvy politics had made them experts at preparing coronations on short no tice thorisin for once did not squabble with them his le gitimacy as emperor was too important to risk thus scaurus found himself routed from bed far earlier than would have suited him given hasty instructions on his role in the upcoming ceremonial by a selfimportant eunuch and placed at the head of a maniple of romans close behind the sedan chair that would carry thorisin from the palace compound to the high temple of phos where balsamon was to anoint and crown him emperor of the videssians thorisin emerged stifffaced from the hall of the nine teen couches and walked slowly past his assembled troop con tingents to the litter by custom the procession should have begun at the grand courtroom but that building was already in the hands of a swarm of craftsmen repairing the damage it had suffered in the previous days fighting in all other respects though the new avtokrator followed traditional usage on this day he put aside the soldiers garb he favored for videssos splendid imperial raiment above the red boots his calves were covered by bluedyed woolen leg gings his bejeweled belt was of links of gold while the silken kilt hanging from it was again blue with a border of white his scabbard was similarly magnificent but marcus noticed that the sword in it was his usual saber its leather grip dark with sweat stains his tunic was scarlet shot through with cloth of gold over it he wore a cape of pure white wool closed at the throat with a golden fibula his head was bare namdaleni videssian soldiers videssian sailors kha trishers more videssians as thorisin gavras strode by each company the troops went to their knees and then to their bel lies in the proskynesis acknowledging him their master that was still a custom marcus used to romes republican ways could not bring himself to follow he and his men bowed deeply from the waist but did not abase themselves before the emperor for a moment thorisin the man peeped through the impe rial facade stiffnecked bastard he murmured out of the harry turtledove side of his mouth so low only the tribune heard then he was past settling himself into the blue and gilt sedan chair that was used only for the coronation journey mertikes zigabenos and seven of his men were the imperial bearers their pride of place earned by the coup that had top pled ortaias zigabenos himself stood at the front right a thinfaced lantemjawed young man who wore his beard in the bushy vaspurakaner style slung over his back he bore a large bronzefaced oval shield it was nothing like any a presentday videssian would carry into battle but marcus had been briefed on the role it would soon play are we ready gavras asked zigabenos gave a curt nod then lets be at it the emperor said a dozen bright silk parasols popped open ahead of the trav eling chair further tokens as if those were needed of the imperial dignity zigabenos men bent to the handles at their commanders signal then straightened raising thorisin to their shoulders their pace a slow march they followed the parasol bearers and thorisins stronglunged herald out through the gardens of the palace compound toward the plaza ofpalamas behold thorisin gavras avtokrator of the videssians the herald roared to the multitude assembled there the citi zens of the capital like the court functionaries knew their role in the coronation thou conquerest thorisin they cried the traditional acclamation for new emperors delivered in the archaic videssian of phos liturgy thou conquerest thou conquerest they thundered as the imperial procession made its way through the square marcus was surprised at their enthusiasm from what he knew of the citys populace they would turn out for any sort of spectacle but would almost rather face the rack than admit they were impressed he understood a few seconds later when palace servants began throwing handfuls of gold and silver coins into the crowd the videssians knew the largess to which they were entitled on a change of emperors whether the tribune did or not hey the moneys real gold hurrah for thorisin gavras someone yelled startled out of formal responses by the quality of thorisins coinage the cheers redoubled but scaurus knew the vaspurakaner mines from which thorisin had taken an emperor for the legion that gold were now in yezda hands and wondered how long it would be before the currency was cheapened again still this was no time for such gloomy thoughts not with the applause of thousands ringing in his ears hurrah for the ronams he heard and caught a glimpse of arsaber standing tall in the middle of a knot of prosperouslooking merchants one or more of them he suspected would go home lighter by a purse more cheering crowds lined middle street every window of the threestory government office building had two or three faces peering from it look at all the damned penpushers wondering if gavrasll have em for lunch gaius philippus said me i hope he does a few blocks past the offices the imperial procession turned north toward phos high temple the golden globes atop its spires gleamed in the bright morning sun the high temples great enclosed courtyard was if any thing even more packed then the plaza of palamas had been priests and soldiers held a lane open in the crush and kept the throng from flowing onto the broad stairs leading up to the shrine at the top of the stairs somehow not dwarfed by the loom ing magnificence of the temple behind him stood balsamon the partriarch was a fat balding old man with a mischievous wit but it suddenly struck scaurus how great his power was in videssos ortaias sphrantzes was not the first emperor he had helped cast down and thorisin gavras would be what the third the fifth over whose accession he had presided but his time was not quite come mertikes zigabenos and his guardsmen carried gavras through the crowd which grew quiet knowing what to expect followed by the ceremonial contingents the emperors litter climbed the stairs it halted two steps below the patriarch the bearers lowered the chair to the ground thorisin climbed out and waited while his troops arranged themselves on the lower stairs zigabenos unslung his shield and laid it face up before the emperor thorisin stepped up onto it it took his weight without buckling marcus was already marching up toward him as were the other commanders of the units he had chosen to honor the admiral elissaios bouraphos baanes onoma goulos laon pakhymer utprand dagobers son and a nam dalener the tribune did not know a tall dour man with pale ham turtledove eyes that showed nothing of the thoughts behind them scaurus guessed he had to be the great count drax perhaps included here to show that his mercenaries were still wanted by the empire even under its new master once again though zigabenos had precedence he took from his belt a circlet of gold which he offered to thorisin gavras following custom thorisin refused zigabenos of fered it a second time and was again refused at the third offering gavras bowed in acceptance zigabenos placed it on his head declaring in a oud voice thorisin gavras i confer on you the title of avtokrator that was the cue scaurus and gavras other officers had awaited they stooped and lifted the ceremonial shield to shoulder height exalting the emperor atop it the waiting expectantly silent crowd below burst into cries of thou con querest thorisin thou conquerest baanes onomagoulos lame leg almost gave way beneath him as the officers lowered thorisin to the ground once more but drax and marcus who stood on either side of the vides sian took up the weight so smoothly the shield barely wa vered steady old boy its all done now gavras said as he stepped off it onomagoulos whispered an apology scaurus was glad to see the two men usually so edgy in each others company behave graciously now it seemed a good omen no sooner had gavras descended from the shield than bal samon clad in vestments little less splendid than the em perors came down to meet him the patriarch performed no proskynesis in the precinct of the temple his authority was second only to the avtokrators he bowed low before thori sin the wispy gray strands of his beard curling over the impe rial crown which he held on a blue silk cushion as the patriarch straightened his eyes lively beneath bushy stillblack brows flicked over thorisins companions that halfamused halfironic gaze settled on scaurus for a moment the tribune blinked had balsamon winked at him hed wondered that once before inside the temple last year surely not and yet again as before he was never sure balsamons glance was elsewhere before he could make up his mind the patri arch fumbled produced a small silver flask not the least of an emperor for the legion phos inventions pockets he remarked the top rank of sol diers might have heard him the second one surely did not then his reedy tenor expanded to fill the wide enclosure a younger priest stood close by to relay what he said but there was no need bow your bead balsamon said to gavras and the avtokrator of the videssians obeyed the patriarch unstoppered the little flask poured its con tents over thorisins head the oil was golden in the morning sunlight scaurus caught myrrhs sweet musky fragrance and the more bitter but still pleasing scent of aloes as phos light shines on us all balsamon declared so may his bless ings pour down on you with this anointing may it be so thorisin responded soberly still holding the crown in his left hand balsamon used his right to rub the oil over thorisins head as he did so he spoke the videssians most basic prayer the assembled multi tude echoing his words we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor amen the crown finished marcus heard the namdaleni add their own closing to the videssian creed on this we stake our very souls utprand spoke the addition firmly but drax closer yet was silent scaurus head turned in surprise had the great count adopted the empires usage he saw draxs lips soundlessly shaping the namdalener clause and wondered whether courtesy or expedience caused his discre tion the amens fortunately were loud enough to drown out most of the sound of heresy it would have been a fine thing marcus thought to have the coronation interrupted by a reli gious riot balsamon took the crown a low dome of gold inset with pearls sapphires and rubies and placed it firmly on thorisin gavras lowered head the throng below let out a soft sigh it was done a new avtokrator ruled videssos the murmuring died away quickly for the crowd was waiting for the patriarch to speak he paused a moment in thought before beginning well my friends we have been disabused of a mistake and abused by it as well a throne is only a few sticks plated with gold and covered by velvet but its said to enoble whatever funda harry turtledove ment rests on it by some magic subtler even than they work in the academy having a throne of my own ive always sus pected that was nonsense you know one bushy eyebrow raised just enough to show his listeners they were not to take this last too seriously but sometimes the choice is not between bad and good but rather bad and worse without an avtokrator we would have perished like a body without its head marcus thought of mavrikios end and shivered to himself coming from republican rome he had doubts aboutthat statement as well but videssos he re flected had been an empire so long it was likely true for her balsamon went on there is always hope when a new emperor sits the throne no matter how graceless he may seem and a new sovereigns advisers may serve him as a mans brains do his face that is to give form to what would otherwise be blank someone shouted phos knows ortaias has no brains of his own and drew a laugh marcus joined it but at the same time he recognized the fine line balsamon was treading trying to justify his actions to the crowd and more important to thorisin gavras the patriarch returned to his analogy but there was a canker eating at those brains one whose nature i learned late but not too late and so i made what amends i could as you see here he bowed low once more marcus heard him stage whisper to gavras your turn now with a curt nod the emperor looked out over the throng for all his fancy talk ortaias sphrantzes knows no more of war than how to run from it and no more of rule than stealing it when the rightful holders away given five years hed have made old strobilos look good to you unless the damned yezda took the city first which is likely thorisin was no polished rhetorician like mavrikios he had a straightforward style adapted from the battlefield to the sophisticated listeners of the capital it was novel but ef fective therere not a lot of promises to make he went on were in a mess and ill do my best to get us out the other side in one piece i will say this phos willing you wont want to curse my face every time you see it on a goldpiece that pledge earned real applause ortaias debased coinage had won him no love scaurus though still wondered how an emperor for the legion z thorisin planned to carry it out if videssos penpushers with all their bureaucratic sleights of hand could not keep up the quality of the empires money could a soldier like gavras one last thing the emperor said i know the city fol lowed ortaias at first for lack of anything better and then perforce because his troops held it well and good ill hear no slanders over who backed whom or who said what about me before yesterday morning so rest easy there a low mut ter of approval and relief ran through the crowd marcus had heard of the informers who had nourished in rome during the civil war between the marians and sulla and of the purges and counterpurges he gave gavras credit for magnanimous good sense and waited for the emperors warning against future plots thorisin however said only youll not get more talk from me now i said that was the last thing and i meant it if all you wanted was empty words you might as well have kept ortaias watching the crowd slowly disperse a dissatisfied gauis philippus said he should have put the fear of their phos in em but the tribune was coming to understand the videssians better than his lieutenant and realized the armored ranks of soldiers on the high temples steps were a stronger precaution against conspiracy than any words an overt threat from the new avtokrator would have roused contempt gavras was wise enough to see that there was more subtlety to him than showed at first scaurus thought and was rather glad of it what should we do with him that was komitta rhan gavves voice merciless and a little shrill with anger she answered her own question we should make him such an example that no one would dare rebel for the next fifty years put out his eyes with hot irons lop off his ears and then his hands and feet and bum whats left in the plaza of the ox thorisin gavras still in full imperial regalia whistled in halfhorrified respect for his mistress savagery well or taias how does that program sound to you youd be the one most affected by it after all his chuckle could not have been pleasant in his defeated rivals ears ortaias arms were bound behind him one of zigabenos ham turtledove troopers sat on either side of him on the couch in the patri archs library he looked as if he would sooner be hiding under it in scaurus mind the young noble had never cut a prepossessing figure he was tall skinny and awkward with a patchy excuse for a beard clad only in a thin linen shift his hair awry and his face filthy and frightened at the moment he seemed to the tribune more a pitiful figure than a wicked one or one to inspire hatred there was a tremor in his high voice as he answered had i won i would not have treated you so no probably not gavras admitted you havent the stomach for it a safe quiet poison in the night would suit you better a rumble of agreement ran around the heavy elm table that filled most of the floor space in the library from komitta from onomagoulos and elissaios bouraphos from drax and utprand dagobers son from mertikes zigabenos nor could marcus deny that thorisin likely spoke the truth he could not help noticing though the patriarchs silence and perhaps more surprisingly alypia gavras in a somber tunic and skirt of dark green the paint scrubbed from her face the princess seemed once more to be as scaurus had known her in the past cool competent almost forbidding he was pleased to see her at this council a sign that contrary to her fears thorisin still had confidence in her but she kept her eyes downcast and would not look at ortaias sphrantzes the silver wine cup in her hand shook ever so slightly balsamon leaned back in his chair until it teetered on its hind legs reached over his shoulder to pluck a volume from a halfempty shelf scaurus knew his audience chamber on the other hand was so full of books it was nearly useless for its intended function but then the patriarch enjoyed confound ing expectations in small things as well as great thus the tribune was unsurprised to see him put the slim leatherbound text in his lap without opening it balsamon said to komitta you know my dear imitating the yezda is not the way to best them the reproof was mild but she bristled what have they to do with this an aristocrat deals with his foes so they can harm him no further her voice rose and a true aristocrat pays no heed to such milksop counsels as yours priest z an emperor for the legion though as your father was a fuller would not expect you to know such things komitta will you thorisin tried too late to cut off his hottempered mistress onomagoulos and zigabenos stared at her in dismay even drax and utprand to whom balsamon was no more than a heretic were not used to hearing clerics reviled but the patriarchs wit was a sharper weapon than outrage aye its true i grew up with the stench of piss but then at least we got pure bleached cloth from it now he wrin kled up his nose and looked sidelong at komitta she spluttered furiously but gavras overrode her quiet there you had that coming she sat in stiff rebellious si lence not for the first time marcus admired the emperor for being able to bring her to heel sometimes at any rate thorisin went on i wasnt going to do as you said anyway i tell you frankly i cant brook it not for this sniveling wretch be so good as not to waste my time with such meetings henceforth then if you have no intention of listening to my advice komitta rose graceful with anger and stalked out of the room a procession of one gavras swung round on marcus well sirrah what say you i sometimes think i have to pull your thoughts like teeth shall i send him to the kynegion and have done a small huntingpark near the high temple the kynegion was also videssos chief execution grounds in rome capital punishment was an extraordinary sen tence but thought scaurus it had been meted out to catiline who aimed at overthrowing the state he answered slowly yes i think so if it can be done without turning all the sealstampers against you bugger the sealstampers bouraphos ground out theyre good for nothing but telling you why you cant have the gold for the refits you need aye theyre rabbity little men the lot of em baanes onomagoulos said shorten him and put fear in all their livers but thorisin rubbing his chin as he considered was watching the tribune in reluctant admiration you have a habit of pointing out unpleasant facts dont you im too much a soldier to like taking the bureaucrats seriously but theres no denying they have power too much by phos harry turtledove who says theres no denying it onomagoulos growled he jabbed a scornful thumb at ortaias sphrantzes look at this uprooted weed here this is what the penpushers have for a leader what about vardanes that was zigabenos who had been in the city while ortaias reigned and his uncle ruled onomagoulos blinked but said well what about him another coward if ever there was one shove steel in a pen pushers face and hes yours to do with as you will which is of course why there have been bureaucrats or men backed by bureaucrats on the imperial throne for forty five of the last fiftyone years alypia gavra said her mea sured tones more effective than open mockery its why the bureaucrats and their mercenaries broke how many two dozen three rebellions by provincial nobles in that time and why they converted almost all the peasant militia in vi dessos to taxbound serfs during that stretch of time clear proof theyre walkovers is it not onomagoulos flushed right up to the bald crown of his head he opened his mouth closed it without saying anything thorisin was taken by a sudden coughing fit ortaias sphrantzes with nothing at all to lose burst into a sudden giggle to see his captors quarrel among themselves still beaming at his niece the emperor asked her what do you want us to do with the scapegrace then for the first time since the meeting began she turned her eyes toward the man whose empress at least in name she had been for all the emotion she betrayed she might have been examining a carcass of beef at last she said i dont think he could be put to death without stirring up enmities better left unraised for my part i have no burning need to see him dead he in his way was as much his uncles prisoner as was i and no more in control of his fate or actions from his wretched seat on the couch ortaias said softly thank you alypia and quite uncharacteristically fell si lent again the princess gave no notice that she heard him baanes onomagoulos still smarting from her sarcasm saw a chance for revenge he said thorisin of course she will speak for him and why should she not the two of them after all are man and wife their concerns bound together by a shared couch now you wait one minute scaurus began hotly but an emperor for the legion alypia needed no one to defend her moving with the icy control she showed on most occasions she rose from her seat and dashed her wine cup in onomagoulos face coughing and cursing he rubbed at his stinging eyes the thick red wine dripped from his pointed beard onto his embroidered silk tunic plastering it to his chest his hand started to seek his sword hilt but he thought better of that even before elissaios bouraphos grabbed his wrist through eyelids already swelling shut he looked to thorisin gavras but found nothing to satisfy him on the em perors face muttering no one uses me thus he climbed from his chair and limped toward the door his painful gait an unintentioned parody of komitta rhangavves lithe exit a few minutes before you may be interested in knowing balsamons voice pursued him that last night i declared annulled the marriage if such it may be called between sphrantzes and alypia gavra at the princess urgent request you may also be in terested in knowing that the priest who performed that mar riage is at a monastery on the southern bank of the astris river a stones throw from the steppe and i ordered that the day i learned of the wedding not last night but onomagoulos only snarled bah and slammed the heavy door behind him an ivory figurine wobbled and fell to the floor balsamon more distressed than he had been at any time during the meet ing leaped to his feet with a cry of alarm and hurried over to it he wheezed as he bent to retrieve it peered anxiously at the palmhigh statuette no harm phos be praised he said setting it carefully back on its stand marcus remembered his passion for ivories from makuran the kingdom that had been videssos western neighbor and rival until the yezda came down off the steppe and conquered it less than a lifetime ago more to himself than anyone else the patriarch complained things havent been where they ought to be since gennadios left the dour priest had been as much balsamons watchdog as companion scaurus knew and there were times when the patriarch took unecclesiastical glee in baiting him now that j he was gone it seemed balsamon missed him what became of him the tribune asked idly curious eh i told you balsamon answered peevishly hes harry turtledove spending his time by the astris praying the khamorth dont decide to swim over and raid the henhouse oh marcus said the patriarch had not named die priest who married alypia to ortaias but he was not surprised gen nadios was the man he had been the creature of mavrikios predecessor strobilos sphrantzes and doubtless stayed loyal to the clan it would have been commendable scaurus thought in a better cause he could not work up much regret at the priests exile are we quite through shillyshallying about thorisin asked with illconcealed impatience shillyshallying balsamon exclaimed mockindignant nonsense weve trimmed this council by a fifth in a half hours time may you do as well with the penpushers hmp the emperor said he plucked a hair from his beard crossed his eyes to examine it closely it was white he threw it away turning back to alypia he asked you say you dont want his head no not really she replied hes a foolish puppy not as brave as he should be and a dreadful bore indignation struggled for a moment with the fright on ortaias sphrantzes face but youd soon run short of subjects uncle if you did to death everyone who fit those bills were vardanes here now her voice did not rise but a sort of grim eagerness made it frightening to hear aye thorisins right hand curled into a fist well he resumed suppose we let the losel live ortaias leaned for ward in sudden hope his guards pushed him back onto the couch the emperor ignored him growling skotos can pull me down to hell before i just turn him loose hed be plotting again before the rope marks faded he has to know and the people have to know what a complete and utter idiot hes been and hell pay the price for it of course alypia nodded she was at least as good a practical politician as her uncle how does this sound almost all the units which accompanied thorisin gavras on his coronation march had been dismissed to their barracks while the emperor and his councilors debated ortaias sphrantzes fate only a couple of squads of videssian body guards waited for the emperor outside the patriarchal resi an emperor for the legion harp turtledove dence along with the dozen parasol bearers who were an av tokrators inevitable public companions the streets were nearly empty of spectators too a few videssians stood and gawped at the shrunken imperial party as it made its way back toward the palaces but most of the city folk had already found other things to amuse them thus marcus saw the tall man pushing his way toward them at a good distance but thought nothing much of him just another videssian with a bit of a seamans roll in his walk in the great port the capital was that hardly rated no tice even when the fellow waved to thorisin gavras scaurus all but ignored him so many people had done so much cheer ing and greeting that the tribune was numb to it but when the man shouted hail to your imperial majesty ice walked up scaurus spine that raspy bass better suited to cutting through wind and wave than to the city could only belong to taron leimmokheir the tribune had met ortaias drungarios of the fleet but twice once on a pitchdark beach and the other time when being chased by his galley neither occasion had been ideal for marking leimmokheirs features nor were those remark able perhaps fortyfive the admiral had a rawboned look to him his face lined and tanned by the sun his hair and beard too gray to show much of their own sun bleaching if marcus then had an excuse for not recognizing leim mokheir at sight the same could not be said for thorisin gavras who had dealt with the drungarios almost daily when his brother was emperor yet thorisin was more taken aback by leimmokheirs appearance than was the tribune he stopped in his tracks gaping as at a ghost his halt let the admiral elbow his way through the remain ing guardsmen exclaiming congratulations to you gavras well done leimmokheir went to his knees and then to his belly in the middle of the street he was still down in the proskynesis when thorisin finally found his voice of all the colossal effrontery this takes the prize he whispered then with a sudden fullthroated bel low of rage guards seize me the treacherous rogue here whats this take your hands off me leimmo kheir struck out against his assailants but they were many to his one and there could hardly be a worse position for self defense than the proskynesis in seconds he was hauled upright his arms pinned painfully behind him almost ex actly marcus thought irrelevantly as vardanes sphrantzes had held alypia the drungarios glared at thorisin gavras whats all this in aid of he shouted still trying to twist free is this the thanks you give everyone who wouldnt fall at your knees and worship if it is whats that snake of a namdalener doing beside you hed sell his mother for two coppers if he thought shed bring so much the count drax snarled and took a step forward but thor isin stopped him with a gesture youre a fine one to talk of serpents leimmokheir you and your treachery you and your hired assassins after a pledge of safeconduct taron leimmokheirs tufted eyebrows almost a match for balsamons crawled halfway up his forehead like a pair of gray caterpillars amazingly he threw back his head and laughed i dont know what you drink these days boy gavras reddened dangerously but leimmokheir did not no tice but pass me the bottle if theres any left when youre done whatevers in it makes you see the strangest things he spoke as he might to any equal ignoring the guardsmen cling ing to him scaurus remembered what hed thought the first time he heard the drungarios voice that there was no guile in him that first impression returned now as strong as before his two years in the empire though had taught him that deceit was everywhere all too often artfully disguised as candor that was how the emperor saw it if anything his anger was hotter at seeing himself betrayed by a man he had thought trustworthy he said you can lie till you drop leimmokheir but youre a tomfool to try theres no testimony for you to argue away i was there you know and saw your hired man slayers with my own eyes thats more than i did leimmokheir shot back but gavras stormed on aye and fleshed my blade in a couple as well the em peror turned to the guards take this fine upstanding gentle man to gaol well give him a nice quiet place to think until i decide what to do with him go on get him out of my sight holding the drungarios as they were the troopers could not salute but they nodded and hauled him away an emperor for the legion only then did leimmokheir really seem to understand this was not some practical joke gavras you bloody nincom poop i still dont know what in skotos frozen hell you think i did but i didnt do it whatever it was phos have mercy on you for tormenting an innocent man watch that you clumsy oafs he shouted to his captors as they dragged him through a puddle his protests faded in the distance matters pertaining to ortaias sphrantzes had been sched uled for two days later but it was pelting down rain and they had to be postponed it rained again the next day and the next watching the dirty gray clouds rolling out of the north scaurus realized the storm was but the first harbinger of the long fall rains where had the year gone he asked himself that question never had an answer at last the weather relented the north wind still blew moist and cool but the sun was bright it flashed dazzlingly off stillwet walls and made every lingering drop of water into a rainbow and if it had not had enough time to dry every seat in videssos huge amphitheater the people whose bottoms were dampened did not complain the spectacle they were anticipating made up for such minor inconveniences sure and theres enough people viridovix said his eyes traveling from the legionaries central spine up and up the sides of the great limestone bowl the poor omadhauns in the last row wont be after seeing whats happening today till next week so far away they are more celtic nonsense gaius philippus said with a snort ill grant you though we wont be much bigger than bugs to them his own practiced gaze slid over the crowd worth less most of em like the fat ones back home he meant rome and marcus winced to be reminded who come out on the feast days to watch the gladiators kill each other the tribune agreed with that assessment the buzz of con versation floating out of the stands had a cruel undercurrent and on the faces in the first few rows the ones close enough to see clearly the air of vulpine avidity was all too plain he caught a glimpse of gorgidas in the contingent of for eign envoys some little distance down the spine as an aspir ing historian the greek had wanted a closeup view of this days festivities and preferred the ambassadors company to disguising himself as a legionary he was listening to some harry turtledove tale from arigh arghuns son and scribbling quick notes on a threeleafed wax tablet two more hung at his belt taso vones the ambassador from khatrish waved cheerily to the tribune who grinned back he liked the little kha trisher whose sharp jolly wits belied his mousy appearance horns filled the amphitheater with bronzen music the crowds noise rose expectantly preceded by his retinue of parasol bearers thorisin gavras strode into the arena the applause was loud as he mounted the dozen steps that led up to the spine but it fell short of the deafening tumult scaurus had heard before in the amphitheater the emperor for once was not what the populace had turned out to see each unit of troops gavras passed presented arms as he went by at gaius philippus barked command the romans held their pila out at arms length ahead of them gavras nod ded slightly he and the senior centurion both lifelong sol diers understood each other very well not so the bureaucrats thorisin passed on his way to the throne they looked nervous as they bowed to their new sov ereign goudeles for one was pale against his robe of dark blue silk but gavras paid them no more attention than he did to the clutter of a millenium and a half of heroic art that he passed statues bronze statues marble some painted some not statues chryselephantine even an obelisk of gilded granite long ago taken as booty from makuran the emperor grew animated once more when he came to the foreign dignitaries he paused for a moment to say some thing to gawtruz of thatagush at which the squat swarthy envoy nodded then gavras included taso vones in the con versation whatever it was the khatrisher laughed and gave a rueful tug at his beard as unkempt as gawtruz even without hearing the words marcus understood the byplay he too thought the fuzzy beard looked foolish on vones who could have passed for a videssian without it but his ruler still enforced a few khamorth ways in memory of his ancestors who had carved the state from videssos eastern provinces centuries before and so the little envoy was doomed to wear the shaggy whiskers he despised thorisin seated himself on a high stool at the center of the amphitheaters spine the chair was backless so all the specta tors could see him his parasol bearers grouped themselves around him he raised his right hand in a gesture of command an emperor for the legion harry turtledove the crowd grew quiet and leaned forward in their seats cran ing their necks for a better view they all knew where to look the gate that came open was the one through which on most days race horses entered the amphitheater today the procession was much shorter thori sin gavras deepchested herald two videssian guardsmen gorgeous in gilded cuirasses and a groom leading a single donkey ortaias sphrantzes rode the beast but it needed a guide nonetheless for its saddle was reversed and he sat facing its tail long familiar with their own idiom of humiliation the watching videssians burst into gaffaws an overripe fruit came sailing out of the stands to squash at the donkeys feet others followed but the barrage was mercifully short vi dessos had been under siege too recently for there to be much food to waste the herald nimbly sidestepping a hurtling melon cried out behold ortaias sphrantzes who thought to rebel against the rightful avtokrator of the videssians his imperial majesty thorisin gavras the crowd shouted back thou conquer est gavras thou conquerest as heartily marcus thought as if they had forgotten that a week before they called ortaias their lord accompanied by the crowds jeers ortaias and his guard ians made a slow circuit of the amphitheater the herald all the while booming out his condemnation marcus heard more fruit splattering around sphrantzes the breeze brought him a rotten eggs gagging stench some of the hurled refuse found its target by the time ortaias sphrantzes came back into the tribunes sight his robe was dyed with bright splashes of pulp and juice the donkey he rode scaurus decided had to be drugged it ambled on placidly pausing only to dip its head to nibble at a fragment of apple in its path its leader jerked on the long guide rope and it abandoned the tidbit to move ahead once more at last it completed the course and halted in front of the gate through which it had entered the two guards came back and lifted ortaias off his mount then led him up before thor isin gavras when they released his arms he went to the ground in a proskynesis the emperor rose from his stool we see your submission he said speaking for the first time and such were the acoustics of the amphitheater that his words though spoken in the tone of ordinary conversation could be heard in the arenas uppermost rows do you then renounce now and forever all claim upon the sovereignty of our empire pro tected by phos indeed yes i yield the throne to you i the moment the answer thorisin gavras required was complete he cut ortaias off with the same imperious gesture he had used to summon him forth gaius philippus gave the ghost of a chuckle some things never change id bet the scrawny bastard just had a twohour abdication speech nipped in the bud and a good thing too says i thorisin spoke again receive now the reward for your treachery the guardsmen raised ortaias to his feet they quickly pulled the robe off over his head the crowd whooped gaius philippus muttered scrawny again one of the guards the larger and more muscular of the pair stepped behind the luck less sphrantzes and delivered a tremendous kick to his bare backside ortaias yelped and fell to his knees viridovix clucked in disappointment the gavras is too soft by half he said he should be packing a wickerwork all full of this spalpeen and howsoever many followed him and then lighting it off thered been a spectacle for the people to remember now you and komitta rhangavve marcus said to himself slightly aghast at the gauls straightforward savagery tis what the holy druids would do viridovix said right eously that scaurus knew was only too true the celtic priests appeased their gods by sacrificing criminals to them or innocent folk if no criminals were handy as ortaias sphrantzes rubbing the bruised part rose to his feet one of phos priests descended from the amphitheaters spine and approached him carrying scissors and a long gleaming razor the crowd fell silent religion was always respected in videssos but marcus knew no blood sacrifice was in the offing here another priest followed the first this one bearing a plain blue robe and a copy of phos sacred scriptures glorious in its binding of enameled bronze an emperor for the legion ortaias bowed his head to the first priest the scissors flashed in the autumn sun a lock of stringy brown hair fell at the deposed emperors feet then another and another until only a short stubble remained then the razor came into play sphrantzes scalp was soon shiny bare the second priest stepped forward folding the monks robeover the crook of his arm he held out the sacred writings to ortaias and said behold the law under which you shall live if you choose if in your heart you feel you can observe it enter the monastic life if not speak now but ortaias with everyone else was aware of the penalty for balking i will observe it he said the greatvoiced her ald relayed his words to the crowd there was a collective sigh the creation of a monk was always a serious business even when the reasons for it were blatantly political nor could faith and politics be neatly separated in the empire scaurus thought of zemarkhos in amorion and felt his mouth compress in a thin hard line the priest repeated the offer of admission twice more re ceived the same response each time he handed the holy book to his colleague then robed the new monk in his monastic garb saying as the garment of phos blue covers your naked body so may his righteousness enfold your heart and preserve it from all evil again the herald boomed out the petition so may it be ortaias replied but his voice was lost in the thousands echoing his prayer despite himself marcus was moved marveling at videssos force of faith almost there were times he wished he shared it but like gorgidas he was too well rooted in me perceptible world to feel comfortable in that of the spirit ortaias sphrantzes left the amphitheater through the same gate he had entered arm in arm with the two priests who had made him part of their fellowship well satisfied with the days show the crowd began to disperse venders took up their calls wine sweet wine spiced cakes holy images to protect your beloved raiii sins unhappy to the end gausi philippus grumbled and now hell spend the rest of his stupid days living the high life here in the city but with a bald head and a blue robe to make it all right harry turtledove not exactly marcus chuckled thorisin might be blunt but he was hardly as naive as that the tribune thought it altogether fitting that gennadios should gain some company in his monastery at videssos distant frontier he and the new brother ortaias no doubt would have a great deal to talk about harry turtledove x what do you mean no funds are available thori sin gavras asked his voice dangerously calm his gaze speared the logothete as if that financial official were an enemy to be ridden down the hall of the nineteen couches grew still marcus could hear the torches crackling hear the wind sighing outside if he turned his head he knew he would see snowflakes kissing the halls wide windows winter in the capital was not as harsh as in the westland plateaus but it was bad enough he pulled his cloak tighter round himself the logothete gulped he was about thirty thin pale and precise his name scaurus remembered was addaios vourtzes he was some sort of distant cousin to the city gover nor of the northeastern town of imbros he had to gather him self before going on in the face of the emperors hostility but go on he did at first haltingly and then with more animation as his courage returned your majesty you expect too much from the taxgathering facilities available to us that any revenues whatsoever have been collected should be praised as one of phos special miracles the recent unpleas antness now there thought the tribune was a fine bur eaucratic euphemism for civil war and worse the presence of large numbers of unauthorized interlopers by which he meant the yezda marcus knew on imperal soil have made any accrual of surplusage a manifest impossibil ity what was he talking about the tribune wondered irritably his videssian was fluent by now but this jargon left him floundering baanes onomagoulos translation was rough but service able by which youre saying that your precious duestakers pissed themselves whenever they thought they saw a nomad and turned tail before they could find out if they were right the noble gave a coarse laugh thats the way of it drax the namdalener agreed he turned a calculating eye on vourtzes from what ive seen of you penpushers any excuse not to pay is a good one by the wager youd think the money came out of your purse not the peasants well said thorisin exclaimed his usual distrust for the islanders quenched when drax echoed a sentiment he heartily shared the count nodded his thanks vourtzes proffered a thick roll of parchment here are the figures to support the position i have outlined numbers in a ledger though meant little to the soldiers he faced thorisin slapped the scroll aside snarling to the crows with this gibberish its gold i need not excuses elissaios bouraphos said these fornicating sealstampers think paper will patch anything that was why i put in with you your highness i kept getting reports instead of repairs and sick i got of them too if you will examine the returns i have presented to you vourtzes said with rather desperate determination you will reach the inescapable conclusion that the bureaucrats are out to bugger honest men ono magoulos finished for him everyone knows that and has since my grandfathers day all you ever wanted was to keep the power in your own slimy hands and if a soldier reached the throne despite you you starved him with tricks like this there is no trickery vourtzes wailed his distress wring ing a simple declarative sentence from him marcus had no love for the harried logothete but he recog nized sincerity when he heard it i think there may be some thing in what this fellow claims he said thorisin and his marshals stared at the roman as if disbe lieving their ears whose side are you on the emperor de manded even addaios vourtzes look of gratitude was wary he seemed to suspect some trap that would only lead to deeper trouble for him an emperor for the legion harry turtledove but alypia gavra watched the tribune alertly her expres sion was masked as usual but scaums could read no disap proval in it and unlike the videssian military men he had had civilian as well as warlike experience and knew how much easier it was to spend money than to collect it ignoring thorisins halfaccusation he persisted gather ing taxes could hardly have been easy this past year for one thing sir your men and ortaias both must have gone into some parts of the westlands with neither side getting all it should and baanes has to be partly right with the yezda loose parts of the empire arent safe for tax collectors but even where there are no yezda at any given moment the lands theyve ravaged still yield no cash you cant get wool from a bald sheep a mercenary with comprehension of basic fiscal reali ties vourtzes said to himself how extraordinary almost as an afterthought he added thank you to the tribune the emperor looked thoughtful but baanes onomagoulos face grew stormy scaurus watching the nobles bare scalp go red suddenly regretted his chancechosen metaphor aiypia took another jab at baanes not all arrears are the tax collectors fault she said if big landowners paid what they owed the treasury would be better off that is very definitely the case vourtzes said legiti mately credentialed agents of the fisc have been assaulted on occasion even killed in the attempt to assess payments due on prominent estates some of them properties of clans repre sented in this very chamber while he named no names he too was looking at onomagoulos the nobles glare was hot enough to roast the bureaucrat marcus and alypia gavra all together the tribune seeing alypias eyebrows arch nodded almost imperceptibly in rec ognition of a common danger as he had in balsamons library elissaios bouraphos tried to ease onomagoulos wrath putting a hand on his shoulder and talking to him in a low voice but the admiral was himself a possessor of wide estates and said to thorisin you know why we held back payments to the penpushers aye you did the same on your lands before your brother threw strobilos out why should we give them the rope to hang us by i wont say youre wrong there the emperor admitted with a chuckle since im not a penpusher though elis saios surely youll pay in everything you owe without a whimper surely bouraphos said then he whimpered so con vincingly that everyone at the table burst into laughter even addaios vourtzes mouth twitched marcus revised his esti mate of the admiral which had not included a sense of humor utprand dagobers son spoke up for the first time and the somber warning in his voice snuffed out the mirth you can wrangle al you like over who pays wat wat needs to be settled is who pays me rest easy thorisin said i dont see your lads on the streets begging for pennies no utprand said nor will you that was not warning but unmistakable threat the great count drax looked pained at his countrymans plain speaking but utprand ignored him they did not care much for each other scaurus suspected the namdaleni were not immune to the disease of faction gavras for his part was one to appreciate frankness youll have your money outiander he said seeing addaios vourtzes purse his lips to protest he turned to the logothete let me guess he said sourly you havent got it essentially that is correct as i have attempted to indi cate the precise situation is outlined the emperor cut him off as brusquely as he had ortaias sphrantzes in the amphitheater can you bring in enough to keep everyone happy till spring faced with a problem whose answer was not to his pre cious accounts scroll vourtzes grew cautious his lips moved silently as he reckoned to himself that is dependent upon a variety of factors not subject to my ministrys control the condition of roads quality of harvest ability of agents to pen etrate areas subject to disturbances from the way the bu reaucrat avoided it marcus began to think the word yezda made him break out in hives theres something hes leaving out baanes onoma goulos said and thats the likelihood the damned seal stampers are pocketing one goldpiece in three for their own schemes oh yes they show us this pile ofturds he pointed contemptuously at vourtzes assessment document but who can make heads or tails of it thats how theyve kept their power because no one who hasnt grown up in their way of an emperor for the legion cheating knows hes swindled until its too late for him to do anything about it vourtzes sputtered denials but thorisin gave him a long measuring stare even alypia gavra nodded however reluc tantly she might despise onomagoulos but she did not make the mistake of thinking him a fool whats needed then marcus said is someone to watch over these functionaries to make sure theyre doing what they say they are brilliant you should join the academy elissaios boura phos said sardonically whos to do it though who can among the men to be trusted were the lot of us soldiers what do we know about the clerks tricks the penpushers use i keep more records than most of us id bet having to keep track of ships stores and such but id founder in a week in the chancery to say nothing of being bored out of my wits youre right the emperor said none of us has the knowledge for the job worse luck for its one that needs doing his voice grew musing his eyes speculation in them swung toward the tribune or is that so indeed when you came to videssos from your other world scaurus do i re member your saying you had held some sort of civil post as well as commanding your troops yes thats so i was one of the praetors at mediolanum marcus realized that meant nothing to gavras and explained i held one of the magistracies in my home town responsible for hearing suits publishing edicts and collecting tribute to send on to rome our capital so you know something of this sharpers business then thorisin pressed something yes the emperor looked from one of his officers to the next their smirks said more plainly than words that they were thinking along with him few things are more pleasant than seeing someone else handed a task one would hate to do one self thorisin turned to scaurus again id say you just talked your way into a job and to vourtzes he added ha pen pusher what do you think of that try your numberjuggling now and see what it gets you whatever pleases your imperial majesty of course the logothete murmured but he did not sound pleased harp turtledove scaurus said quickly its not something ill put full time into i have to pay heed to my men of course of course the emperor agreed marcus saw drax utprand and onomagoulos nodding with him thorisin continued that lieutenant of yours is a sound man though and more than up to handling a lot of the daytoday things give it as much time as you can ill see if i cant come up with some fancy title for the job and a raise in pay to go with it youll earn the money i think fair enough the tribune said thorisins marshals made sympathetic noises marcus accepted their condolences and countered their bad jokes with his own in fact he was not nearly so displeased as one of them would have been a moderately ambitious man he had long since realized there were definite limits to how high an out lander infantry commander could rise in videssos on the strength of his troops alone and his plans at rome had been ultimately political not soldierly the military tribunate was a step aspiring young men took but not one to stand on forever so he had made his suggestion if thorisin gavras did not act on it nothing whatever was lost but he had acted and now the tribune would see what came of that anticipation flowered in him regardless of the contempt the soldier nobles had for the palace bureaucracy it maintained videssos no less than they nor as alypia gavra had pointed out was it necessarily the weaker party he saw her watching him with an expression of ironic amusement and had the uneasy feeling that all his half formed murky plans were quite transparent to her i am extremely sorry sir pandhelis the secretary was saying to someone outside the office marcus had taken as his own but i have specific instructions that the epoptes is to be disturbed on no account whatever as promised thorisin had conferred an impressively vague title on the roman meaning approximately inspector och a pox take you and your instructions both the door flew open viridovix stomped into the little room helvis just behind him seeing scaurus the gaul clapped a dramatic hand to his forehead ive seen that face before indeed and i have dont be telling me now the namell come back to me an emperor for the legion harry turtledove in a minute im sure it will he wrinkled his brow in mock concentration wringing his hands pandhelis said to the tribune im sorry sir they would not listen to me never mind im glad to see them marcus threw down his pen with a sigh of relief a new callus was forming on his right index finger shoving tax rolls and reckoning beads to one side of the untidy desk he looked up at his visitors what needs doing nothing needs doing were here to collect you helvis said firmly its midwinters day in case youve forgotten time for rejoicing not chaining yourself up like some slave but marcus started to protest then he rubbed his eyes redlined and scratchy from staring at an endless proces sion of numbers enough is enough he thought and stood up stretching till his joints creaked all right im your man i should hope so she said a sudden smoky glow in her blue eyes ive started wondering if you remembered hoho viridovix said with a wink his brawny arm pro pelled scaurus out from around the desk out of the cubicle and into the corridor giving the tribune no chance to change his mind come along with you roman dear theres a party laid on to make even a stodgy spalpeen like you frolic as always the first breath of frigid outside air made the tribune cough his own breath sighed out in a great steaming cloud whatever one could say against them the bureaucrats kept their wing of grand courtroom offices heated almost summerywarm it made the winter outside twice as hard to endure he shivered in his cloak ice glittered on barebranched trees the smoothrolled lawns that were the palace gardeners emerald delight in sum mer now were patchy and brown somewhere high overhead a gull screeched most birds were long gone to the warm lands of the unknown south but the gulls stayed scavengers and thieves they were birds that fit the capital and hows that bairn of yours viridovix asked as they walked back toward the roman barracks dosti he couldnt be better marcus answered proudly he has four teeth now two top and two bottom he likes to use em too he bit my finger the other day your finger helvis said dont complain of fingers my dear high time the boy was weaned oww viridovix sympathized the big gaul waved as soon as he was in sight of the barracks scaurus saw a roman wave back from a window what sort of ambush are you leading me into he asked youll see soon enough viridovix said the moment they walked into the barracks hall he shouted pay up the goldpiece you owe me soteric for heres himself in the flesh of him the namdalener flipped him the coin its not a betim sorry to lose he said i thought he was too in love with his inks and parchments to recall how the common folk cele brate to the crows with you marcus said to the man he counted his brotherinlaw aiming a lazy punch that soteric dodged viridovix was biting the goldpiece hed won its not of the best but then its not of the worst either he said philo sophically and tucked it into his beltpouch the tribune was not paying much attention to the celt looking instead from face to grinning face around him this is the crew youve gathered to carouse with he said to viri dovix grinning too the celt nodded then the gods look to videssos tonight marcus ex claimed and drew a cheer from everyone there was taso vones arm in arm with a buxom videssian woman several inches taller than he was gawtruz of thata gush stood beside him working hard on a wineskin how about some for the rest of us gaius philippus said pointedly whats a skin of wine among one man gawtruz re torted and kept drinking he lowered the skin again a mo ment later but only to belch soteric had brought fayard and turgot of sotevag with him turgot needed no help from gawtruzs wineskin he was already unsteady on his feet his companion was a very blond namdalener girl named mavia scaurus doubted she was out of her teens in a darkhaired land her bright tresses gleamed like a goldpiece among old coppers fayard greeted helvis in the island dialect her dead hus band had been his captain she smiled and answered in the same speech arigh arghuns son was in the middle of telling a dirty story to all three of viridovix lemans marcus wondered an emperor for the legion harry turtledove again how the celt kept them from catfights probably the happygolucky gauls own lack of jealousy he thought viri dovix seemed altogether unconcerned when they exploded into laughter at the end of arighs tale quintus glabrio said something lowvoiced to gorgidas who smiled and nodded next to them katakolon kekau menos of agder stirred impatiently are we then assembled he asked an it be so lets to the revels his accent was almost as archaic as the sacred liturgy agder though once part of the empire had been severed from videssos more quickly changing currents of speech for many years kekau menos himself was a solidly built saturnine man whose jacket of creamy snowleopard pelts was worth a small fortune in the capital marcus also thought him something of a prig as the party trooped out of the barracks hall he asked taso vones who invited the dog in the manger aesop meant nothing to the khatrisher as scaurus should have known he sighed there were times most often brought on by such trivial things when he was sure he would never fit this world he explained himself sans metaphor as a matter of fact invited him vones said the romans embarrassment seemed to amuse him he shared with balsamon a fondness for discomfiting people i have my rea sons agders a far northern land you know and the turn of the sun at midwinter means more to them than to the vides sians or me theyre always half afraid it wont come back when they see it start north again they wassail hard believe me videssos might not have feared for the suns return but it celebrated all the same the two midwinter fests marcus had seen before were in provincial towns the captials holiday was perhaps less boisterous than their uninhibited rejoicing but made up for it with more polish and the citys sheer size let the tribune imagine himself in the middle of a world bent solely on pleasure winters early night was falling fast but torches and can dles everywhere gave plenty of light bonfires blazed on many street comers it was reckoned lucky to jump through them helvis slid free of marcus arm round her waist she ran for one of the fires jumped her hair flew out around her head like a dark halo despite the hand she kept by her side her skirt billowed away from her legs someone on the far side of the fire cheered the tribunes pulse quickened too she came back to him flushed from the run and the cold her eyes bright when he put his arm around her again she pressed his hand tight against the top of her hip nothing escaped taso vones birdlike gaze with a smile up at his own lady whose name scaurus learned was pla kidia teletze he said better than crawling through co dices isnt it youd best believe it the tribune answered and tipped helvis chin up for a quick kiss her lips were warm and alive against his its a public disgrace youll make of yourselves virido vix complained to show how serious he was he planted good thorough kisses on all his lady friends they seemed perfectly content with his gallant impartiality from long prac tice it had almost a polish to it like a conjuror plucking his tenthousandth gold ring out of the air waves of laughter came rolling out of the amphitheater a sound like a gods mirth videssos mime troupes naturally were the best the empire could offer eyeing the failing day gorgidas said its probably too dark for them to squeeze in another show what say we find an eatery now before the crowd coming out fills them all to overflowing always is a good idea food gawtruz said in the heavy khamorthflavored accent he affected most of the time the envoy from thatagush slapped his thick belly his appetite was real but scaurus knew the boorishness was an act to lull the unwary a clever diplomat hid beneath that piggish exte rior gorgidas good sense got his comrades into an inn a few blocks off the plaza of palamas while the establishment was still only half full the proprietor and a serving girl shoved two tables together for them before they had finished their first round of wine soteric fayard and katakolon kekau menos chose ale the room was packed the owner hauled a couple of battered tables from the kitchens out into the street to serve a few more customers planting fat candles on them to give his guests light i wish id bought that bigger place marcus heard him say to himself as he bustled back and forth delicious odors wafted out of the kitchen scaurus and his friends nibbled on sweetmeats and drank waiting for their an emperor for the legion harry turtledove dinner to cook at last a servingmaid staggering a little under its weight fetched a fat roast goose to the table steel flashed in the torchlight as she expertly carved the bird the tribune liked most videssian cooking and when the eaterys owner proclaimed goose our specialty he had gone along without a qualm his first bite gave him second thoughts the goose was smothered in a sauce of cinnamon and sharp cheese a combination piquant enough to bring tears to his eyes there were times when the empires sophisticated striving for pleasure through contrasting tastes went beyond what his palate could tolerate gaius philippus seemed similarly nonplussed but the rest ate with every sign of enjoyment stifling a sigh the tribune took a handful of shelled almonds from a dish by the halfde molished goose they were sprinkled with garlic powder the sigh became a groan why hadnt the garlic gone on the meat instead youre not eating much hevis said no perhaps it was just as well being chairbound day in and day out had made him gain weight and he thought raising his cup to his lips he had more room for wine here pretty one would you care to sit by me that was gauis philippus greeting a courtesan in a clinging dress of thin yellow stuffs he stole a chair from a nearby table its owner had gotten up to go to the jakes the fellows compan ions glowered at the senior centurion he stared them down long years of command gave him a presence none of the city men could match the woman saw that too there was real interest on her face as she sat not just a whores counterfeit passion she helped herself to food and drink a pretty thing marcus thought and was glad for gaius philippus whose luck in such matters was usually poor the shade of yellow she wore reminded the tribune of the diaphanous silk gown vardanes sphrantzes had forced on alypia gavra and of her slim body unconcealed beneath it the thought warmed and annoyed him at the same time there should have been no room for it with helvis beside him her fingers teasing the nape of his neck turgot stretched across the table to reach for the dish of almonds he popped a handful into his mouth then tried to curse around them stinking garlic he said washing out the taste with a hefty swig of wine back in the duchy we wouldnt foul good food with the stuff he drank again his face losing its soldiers hardness as he thought of his home well i like it mavia said with a flip of her head her hair flashed goldred in the torchlight almost the color of flame itself to prove the truth of her words she ate an al mond then another one marcus guessed shed come to the empire long ago as a mercenarys small daughter and learned videssian tastes as well as the duchys turgot sitting hunched over his wine cup suddenly seemed sad and tired and old the videssian whose chair gaius philippus had annexed returned he stood in confusion for a moment while his friends explained what had happened he turned toward the roman an unsteady turn for he had considerable wine on board now you shee see here sir he began go home and sober up the senior centurion said not unkindly he had other things on his mind than fighting his eyes kept slipping hungrily to the courtesans dark nipples plainly visible through the fabric of her dress viridovixs admiring gaze followed his only when the drunken videssian started a further protest did the celt seem to notice him he burst out laughing saying to gaius phi lippus sure and the poor sots clean forgotten a pricks good for more things than pissing through he spoke in the empires language so everyone round the partys two tables could share the joke they laughed with him but the man hed insulted understood him too with a grunt of sodden rage the fellow swung at him a wild haymak ing right that came nowhere near the gaul viridovix sprang to his feet quick as a cat despite all hed drunk himself his green eyes glowed with amusement of a new sort your honor shouldnt ought to have done that now he said he grabbed the luckless videssian lifted him off his feet and hurled him down splash into the great tureen of seaturtle stew that stood as the centerpiece of his comrades table the sturdy table did not collapse but greasy greenish stew and bits of white meat splattered in all directions the drunk feebly kicked his legs as he tried to right himself his friends drenched by their dinners swore and spluttered and wiped at their faces an emperor for the legion what are you doing you loose fish you clappedout poxy blackguard you beggarly lousy beetleheaded knave gaius philippus courtesan screeched as she daubed futilely at her self a goodsized chunk of meat was stuck in her hair above the gold hoop she wore in her right ear but she did not notice it nor did the celt pay her bravura curses any mind the men hed swashed were coming at him with determination if no great skill viridovix flattened the first of them but the next one dashed a cup of wine in his face while he choked and gasped the fellow jumped on him followed a second later by a companion gaius philippus and gawtruz of thatagush hauled them off two against ones not fair the senior centurion said still mildly flinging his man in one direction gawtruz wasted no words on his but tossed him in the other if they had hoped to quell the fight they could hardly have done a worse job of it the hurled men went careening into tables bowling over two men seated at one and a woman at the other food flew what had been a private quarrel instantly became general viridovixs banshee howl of fighting glee rose over the anguished cries of the inns owner and the sound of smashing crockery the two tables were a bastion under siege and it seemed everyone else in the eatery was trying to storm them marcus had heard reports of viridovixs tavern brawling but until now had never been caught up in it himself a mug whizzed past his head to shatter against the wall a fat vi dessian punched him in the belly oof he said and doubled over he swung back felt his fist sink into flab you will excuse me i pray taso vones said and dove under the table pulling plakidia teletze with him she let out an unladylike squawk of protest as she disappeared it was marcus thought the most goodnatured fight he had been in perhaps all the battlers were in holiday spirits or was it simply that viridovix at heart a goodnatured soul had set the stamp of his character on the brawl hed started whatever it was none of the scrappers showed the slightest desire to reach for the knives that hung at most of their belts they pounded each other with high gusto but no serious blood was spilled yipe said scaurus thrashing frantically someone had pulled open his tunic and poured a bowlful of syrupsweetened harry turtledove snow down his back it felt like a million frozen crawling ants the eaterys owner ran from one little knot of fighting to the next shouting stop this stop this at once i tell you no one paid him any mind until the fat videssian annoyed at his noise hit him in the side of the head he stumbled out into the night the guard the guard his cries faded as he ran down the street a city man fists flailing charged arigh arghuns son who was not much more than half as big there was a flurry of arms and legs marcus could not see all that went on because he was trading punches with a man who reeked of wine and the videssian thudded to the ground he lay still whatever arighs handfighting technique was it worked well a plate broke almost in the tribunes ear he whirled round to see a videssian stagger away clutching his head helvis still had a piece of the plate in her hand thank you dear he said she smiled and nodded nor was she the only namdalener woman able to handle herself in a ruction mavia and gaius philippus tart were going at it hammer and tongs screeching and clawing and pulling hair and it was easy to see the blonde was getting the better of the battle but her foe was still game when the senior centurion tried to drag her out of the fray she raked her nails down his cheek missing his eye by no more than an inch stay and fight then you mangy trollop he yelled all vestiges of chivalry forgotten katakolon kekaumenos sat sipping his wine a bubble of calm in the brabble around him one of the brawlers was rash enough to mistake his quiet for cowardice and started to tip his chair over backward kakaumenos was on his feet and spin ning toward the videssian almost before it began to move he punched him once in the face and once in the belly then lifted his sagging body over his head and threw him through a win dow that done he straightened the chair and returned to his wine quiet as a snow leopard just after it has fed thatll teach you to be trifling with an honest man wont it now viridovix yelled after the videssian he got no an swer the tribune took a punch over the ear he saw brief stars but his assailant howled and clutched his left fist round a bro ken knuckle scaurus too experienced to throw that kind of an emperor for the legion ham turtledove punch hit him in the pit of the stomach he doubled over and fell gasping for air target and gawtruz both jumped on him all right in there enough now an accented tenor called from the doorway break it up or well use our spearshafts on you the mailshirted vaspurakaners pushed into the shambles that had been the inns common room break it up i said their officer repeated and someone yelped as one of the troopers carried out the threat hullo senpat marcus said indistinctly one of his hands was in his mouth trying to find out if a back tooth was loose it was spitting redly he asked hows your lady nevrat shes fine the young vaspurakaner noble broke off in midsentence a comic expression of surprise on his handsome features you scaurus of all people tavern brawling you the sensible sober fellow who keeps everyone else out of trouble by vaspur the firstborn id not have believed it without the seeing heresy someone muttered but softly fifteen vaspura kaners crowded the room every one of them armed embarrassed the tribune so far forgot his stoic principles as to cast the blame elsewhere its viridovix fault he started the thing dont listen to him for even a second sviodo dear the celt said to senpat he was enjoying himself as much as the rest of us and marcus wine and battle both still firing his blood could not say him nay the tavemer staring in horrified dismay at overturned tables broken chairs assorted potshards and half a dozen of his kitchen creations splashed everywhere let out a baritone shriek of despair not only was his eatery wrecked but this phosdespised foreign guard captain turned out to be friends with the wreckers whos going to pay for all this he moaned abrupt silence fell the men still standing looked at each other at their comrades unconscious on the floor at the door which was full of vaspurakaners someone had better pay the innkeeper went on his tone moving from despon dence to threat or the whole cityll know why and then shut up scaurus said hed seen enough antiforeign riots in videssos never to want to see another he reached for his belt the tavemers eyes widened in alarm but he was seeking his purse not his sword we share and share alike he said his gaze including his own party and everyone else in the inn why add me in gorgidas demanded i didnt help break up the place that was true enough the greek not caring for fighting of any sort had stayed on the sidelines then call it your fine for a liver full of milk viridovix hooted if youre after talking your way free whats to stop the rest of these omadhauns from doing the same gorgidas glared at him and opened his mouth to argue fur ther but quintus glabrio touched his arm the junior centu rion was another who did not brawl for sport but a swollen lip and a bruise on his cheek said he had not been idle he mur mured something gorgidas dipped his head in acquiescence the greek gesture giving his exasperation perfect expression there were no other arguments scaurus turned back to the innkeeper all right what do you say this stuff is worth seeing an ignorant outland mercenary in front of him the man doubled the fair price but the tribune laughed scornfully it was folly to think of gulling someone with his nose fresh out of the tax rolls at his counteroffer the tavemer flinched and called on phos but grew much more reasonable they settled quickly dont forget the fellow lying out there in the snow sen pat sviodo said helpfully the more shares the less each one pays three of his vaspurakaners dragged the fellow back and flipped water in his face until he revived it took several minutes marcus was glad kekaumenos was a friend is that everyone he asked scanning the battered room should be gaius philippus said but gawtruz broke in vones where is he his fat face was smug he loved to score points off his fellow envoy heads turned no one saw the little khatrisher then viri dovix remembered dove clear out of the shindy he did the celt said and lifted a tablecloth plakidia teletze screamed vones quicker thinking snatched the cloth out of viridovixs hand and yanked it down begging your honors pardon im sure viridovix said suave as any ambassador himself but when youre finished the rest of us would be glad for a word with ye then the effort of holding himself back was too much and he doubled over with a guffaw vones emerged a moment later urbane as ever wasnt an emperor for the legion what it seemed he said blandly merely a coincidence you understand the way we happened to fall grinning arigh interrupted your breeches are unbut toned taso why so they are not a bit nonplussed vones did them up again now then gentlemen what do i owe you for my share in the festivities plakidia scrambled out while he was talking she bolted away from him at senpat sviodos gesture his men stood aside to let her pass its not us you should be after paying at all at all viri dovix chuckled and vones got off free scaurus dug in his pouch filled his free hand with silver he counted out seven teen coins it took twentyfour to equal a goldpiece of pure metal but the tribune saw a couple of the city men spend two of ortaias debased coins to pay their shares and even then the innkeeper looked unhappy gaius philippus saw that too and narrowed his eyes in disgust you could be getting steel not gold he pointed out toying with the hilt of his shortsword he had the look of a man who had scores of taproom fights behind him and had ended some of them just that way the tavemer wet his lips nervously as he counted the coins and pronounced himself satisfied in fact he was hardly lying too often threats were all he got after a brawl come by the barracks when you have the chance marcus urged senpat sviodo as they left the inn we havent seen much of you lately ill do that the young noble answered i know i should have long ago but theres so much to see here in the city its like another world scaurus nodded his understanding next to videssos vaspurakans towns were but backwoods vil lages the courtesan in yellow tried to make up to gaius phi lippus but his cheek still smarting he rounded on her with advice more pungent than hed had for the innkeeper she answered with a twofingered gesture every videssian knew and cast sheeps eyes at the fat man whod hit marcus in the stomach they strolled off arm in arm the senior centurion stared glumly after her viridovix clucked foosh its a rare wasteful man yare he said that was a lass with fire in her a rare ride she would have given you scaurus thought that an odd sentiment coming harry turtledove from the gaul his own companions were all of them lovely but none had any spirit to speak of women gaius philippus said as if the word was enough to explain everything only take the time to know em roman dear and youll find em not so strange viridovix retorted and theyre great fun besides isnt that right my dears my darlings he swept all three of them into his arms the way they snug gled close spoke louder than any words of agreement gaius philippus did his best to stay impassive marcus was probably the only one who noticed his jaw jet saw his eyes narrow and grow hard the celts teasing this time had struck deep though viridovix himself did not realize it when the celt opened his mouth for another sally the tribune stepped on his foot ow bad cess to you you hulking looby viridovix ex claimed hopping what was the point o that scaurus apologized and meant it in his hurry hed trod harder than he intended well all right then the gaul said he stretched luxur iantly indeed and the shindy was not a bad way to be starting the evening if a bit tame lets be off to another tavern and do it ag och you black spalpeen that was no accident the tribune had stepped on his other foot viridovix bent down and flung a handful of snow in his face cheeks stinging and eyebrows frosted white marcus retaliated in kind as did helvis who had taken some of the snow that missed the roman in an instant everyone was pelt ing everyone else laughing and shouting and cheering each other on marcus was just as well pleased a snowfight was safer than most things viridovix reckoned entertainment sitting secure in videssos it was easy to imagine the em pire still master of all its lands or it would have been had scaurus not been wrestling with the imperial tax rolls in his office he had a map of the westlands showing the districts from which revenues had been collected most towns and vil lages in the coastal lowlands had little bronze pins stabbed through them indicating that imperial agents had taken what was due from them the central plateau though the natural settling ground for nomads like the yezda showed virtually a blank expanse of parchment worse a finger of that same an emperor for the legion harry turtledove ominous blankness pushed east down the arandos river val ley toward garsavra if the town fell it opened the way for the invaders to burst forward all the way to the shore of the sailors sea baanes onomagoulos was as well aware of the somber truth as the imperial finance ministry the nobles estates were hard by garsavra and his patience with thorisin never long grew shorter with every report of a new yezda advance the emperor knew the reason for onomagoulos constant reproaches and knew there was some justice to them he bore them with more selfcontrol than marcus had thought he owned he committed such aid as he could to the arandos valley more in scaurus eyes than videssos threatened all through the westlands could readily afford to spend there but at every session of the imperial council onomagoulos cry was always for more men thorisins patience finally wore thin about six weeks after the midwinter fest he told his captious marshal baanes i am not made of soldiers and garsavra is not videssos only weak point the nomads are pushing out of vaspurakan to ward pityos and theyre raiding in the westlands south as well and the winters cold enough to freeze the astris so the khamorthll likely poke south across it to see if we poke back the company i sent west ten days ago will have to be the last onomagoulos ran his fingers up over the crown of his head a gesture marcus guessed bom when hair still covered it two hundred seventyfive men huzzah he said sourly how many namdaleni aye and these other damned out landers too he added with a glance at scaurus are sitting here in the city eating like so many hogs drax answered with the cool mercenarys logic marcus had come to expect from the great count why should his majesty throw my men away in a fight theyre not suited for were heavierarmed than you videssians care to be most times we find it useful but in deep snow were slow and floundering easy meat for the nomads light horse the same is true of my men but more so for we arent mounted marcus echoed the quarrel might have been smoothed over there for ono magoulos was a soldier and recognized the point the others made but soteric happened to be at the council instead of utprand who was ill with a coughing fever scaurus head strong brotherinlaw took offense at baanes gibe at the namdaleni and gave it back in kind hogs is it you bloody cocksure snake if you knew anything about nomads you wouldnt have let yourself get trapped in front of maragha then you wouldnt be sitting here carping about the upshot of your own stupidity barbarian bastard onomagoulos shouted his chair crashed over backward as he tried to leap to his feet his hand darted for his sword hilt but his crippled leg buckled and he had to grab for the council table to keep from falling he had taken the laming wound in the fight soteric named and the namdalener laughed at him for it will you watch that polluted tongue of yours scaurus hissed at him drax too put a warning hand on his arm but soteric shook it off he and utprand bore the count no love onomagoulos regained his feet his saber rasped free come on basebom he yelled almost beside himself with rage one legs plenty to deal with scum like you soteric surged up marcus and drax sitting on either side of him started to grab his shoulders to haul him down again but it was thorisins battlefield roar of enough that froze everyone in place roman and great count no less than the combatants enough the emperor yelled again barely softer phos light the two of you are worse than a couple of brats fratching over who lost the candy mertikes get baanes chair he seems to have mislaid it zigalcnos jumped to obey now the both of you sit down and keep still unless youve some thing useful to say under his glower they did soteric a bit shamefaced but onomagoulos still furious and making only the barest effort to hide it speaking to gavras as if to a small boy the videssian noble persisted garsavra must have more troops thorisin it is a very important city both of itself and for its location the emperor bridled at that tone which he had heard from onomagoulos for too many years but he still tried for pa tience as he answered baanes i have given garsavra twentyfive hundred men at least along with the retainers you muster on your estates surely enough warriors are there to hold back the yezda till spring they dont fly over the snow themselves you know they slog through it like anyone an emperor for the legion else when spring comes i intend to hit them hard and i wont piddle away my striking force a squad here and a com pany there until i have nothing left onomagoulos stuck out his chin his pointed beard jutted toward gavras the men are needed i tell you will you not listen to plain sense no one at the table wanted to meet thorisins eye while he was being hectored so but all gazes slid his way regardless he said only you may not have them but there was iron in his voice everyone heard the warning except onomagoulos whose angry frustration made him exclaim your brother would have given them to me marcus wanted to disappear had baanes searched for a year he could not have found a worse thing to say thorisins jealousy of the friendship between mavrikios and onoma goulos was painfully obvious imperial dignity forgotten gavras leaned forward bellowing hed have given you the back of his hand for your insolence you toplofty runt unweaned pup your eyes arent open to see the world in front of your face baanes was not yelling at the avtokrator of the videssians but at his comrades tagalong little brother clod from a dungheap you think your precious estates are worth more than the whole empire i changed your diapers puling moppet they shouted insults and curses at each other for a good minute oblivious to anyone elses presence finally onomagoulos rose once more crying theres one more man garsavra will have by phos i wont stay in the same city with you the stench of you cur dles my nose its big enough thorisin retorted good riddance vi dessos is well shut of you by now scaurus thought i should be used to the sight of people stalking out of thorisins councils baanes onoma goulos stalk was in fact a limp but the effect remained the same as he reached the polished bronze doors of the hall of the nineteen couches he turned round for a final scowl at the emperor who replied with an obscene gesture onomagoulos spat on the floor as videssians did before wine and food to show their rejection of skotos he hobbled out into the snow where were we the emperor said harry turtledove marcus expected baanes to be restored to thorisins good graces the emperors temper ran high at flood but quickly ebbed onomagoulos anger though was of a more lasting sort two days after the stormy council he kept the promise hed made there sailing over the cattlecrossing and setting out for garsavra i mislike this the tribune said when he heard the news hes flying in the face of the emperors authority though he was in the roman barracks he looked round before he spoke and then was lowvoiced the price of living in the empire he thought discontentedly youre right i fear gaius philippus said if i were gavras id haul him back in chains the two of you make no sense viridovix complained it was the gavras who gave him leave to go or ordered him more like ordered him to drop dead perhaps gorgidas said but not to go off and fight his own private war he lifted an ironic eyebrow at the gaul when will you leam words can say one thing and mean another och you think youre such a tricksy greek this ill tell you though if it was my home in danger id go see to it and be damned to any who tried to stop me himself in cluded the gaul folded his arms across his chest as if dar ing the doctor to disagree it was gaius philippus though who snorted at him likely you would and maybe lose your home and all your neighbors in the bargain think of yourself first and your mates last and thats what happens why else do you think caesars been able to fight one clan of celts at a time viridovix gnawed at his drooping mustache the senior centurions gibe was to the point but he replied twont matter a bit in the end divided or no well be whipping the lot of you back home with your tails tucked into their grooves not a chance gaius philippus said and the old dispute began again ever since the romans came to videssos he and viridovix had been arguing over who would win the fighting in gaul they both took the question seriously although or perhaps because they could never answer it not much caring to listen marcus left for his desk in the an emperor for the legion penpushers wing of the grand courtroom the problems there were new ones but they did not seem to have solutions more definite than his friends debating topic pandhelis fetched him ledgers and reports in an unending stream they further confused issues about as often as they settled them videssian bureaucrats with their rhetorical training took pride in making their meaning as obscure as possible trying to thread his way through a thicket of allu sions he barely understood scaurus wondered why he had ever wanted a political career he slept at his desk that night stupefied by a pile of as sessment documents written in a hand so tiny as to defy the eye the legionaries were already at the practice field when he got back to the barracks he walked down middle street to join them breakfasting on a hard square ryeflour roll dipped in honey that he bought in the plaza of palamas it was another chilly day with little flurries of snow blow ing through the streets when the tribune came up to a bath house with an imposing facade of golden sandstone and white marble his enthusiasm for practice abruptly disappeared he wrestled his conscience to the mat and went in palling asleep to the press of work he told himself was enough to make anyone feel grimy the bathhouses owner took his copper at the door with a broad smile waving him forward into the undressing chamber he gave another copper to the boy there to make sure his clothes would not be stolen while he was bathing then shed his sheepskin coat tunic and trousers with a sigh of relief the sounds of the bath drew him on as was true at rome videssian baths were as much social places as ones devoted to cleanliness hawkers of sausages wine and pastries were crying their wares so was the hairremover for those men who affected such fastidiousness he fell silent for a moment then scaurus heard his client yelp as he began to pluck an armpit usually the tribune with stoic abstemiousness limited himself to a cold bath but after coming in out of the snow that was intolerable he sweated for a while in the steam bath baking the winter out then the cold plunge seemed attractive rather than selftormenting he climbed out of the pool when the icy water began to bite stretching himself on the tiles to harry turtledove relax for a few minutes before going on to soak in the pleas antly warm pool beyond scrape you off sir asked a youth with a curved strigil in his hand thank you yes the tribune said hed brought along a little money for small luxuries tike this as it was next to impossible for a bather to scrape all of himself he sighed at the pleasant roughness of the strigil sliding back and forth over his flesh around him plump middleaged men puffed as they exer cised with weights masseurs pummeled grunting victims now clapping hands down on their shoulders now cupping them to produce an almost drumlike beat three young men played the videssian game called trigon throwing a ball un expectedly from one to the next they feinted and shouted whenever one dropped the ball the other two would cry out as he lost a point off in a comer a handful of more sedentary types diced the morning away there was a tremendous splash as someone leaped into the warm pool in the hall beyond followed closely by cries of annoyance from the nearby people whom hed drenched the splasher came up not a whit dismayed after blowing the water out of his mouth and nose he started to sing in a reso nant baritone everyone thinks he sounds wonderful in the baths the youth with the strigil said cocking his head critically he fan cied himself a connoiseur of bathhouse music hes not bad i must say for all his funny accent no he isnt marcus agreed though his ear was so poor he could hardly tell good singing from bad but only one man in videssos owned that brogue tipping the youth a final cop per he got up and went in to say hello to viridovix the celt was facing me entranceway and broke off his tune in midnote when he saw the tribune if its not himself come to wash the ink off him he cried and a good deal of himself there is to wash too scaurus looked down hed felt his middle thickening from days in a chair without exercise but hadnt realized the result was so plain to see annoyed he ran three steps forward and dove into the warm water a good deal more neatly than viri dovix had it was a shallow dive the pool was no more than chestdeep an emperor for the legion he swam over to the celt the two of them were strange fish among the oliveskinned darkhaired videssians marcus dark blond his face arms and lower legs permanently tanned from his time in the field but the rest of him paler and viri dovix fair with the pinkwhite gallic fairness that refused to take the sun his burnished copper hair sodden against his head and curling in bright ringlets on his chest and belly and at his groin shirking again they both said at the same time and laughed together neither was in any hurry to get out the pool was heated to that perfect temperature where the water does not register against the skin marcus thought of the sharp wind outside then chose not to a small boy drawn perhaps by the celts strangeness splashed him from behind viridovix spun round saw his laughing foe do that to me will you now he roared mockferocious and splashed back they pelted each other with water until the youngsters father had to go and take his son unwilling from the pool viridovix waved to them both as they left a fine lad and a fine time too he said to scaurus from the look of you you had your fine time last night the tribune retorted he had been staring at viridovixs back and shoulders when the gaul turned them during the water fight they were covered with scratches that surely came from a womans nails one or two of them scaurus thought must have drawn blood they were still red and angry viridovix smoothed down his mustaches fairly dripping smugness he said a couple of sentences in his own celtic tongue before dropping back into latin which he still pre ferred to videssian a wildcat she was all right he said smiling at the memory you canna see it under my hair but she fair bit the ear off me too there at the end he was in so expansive a mood that marcus asked which one was it he was hard pressed to imagine any of the celts three women showing such ferocity they seemed too docile for it och none o them viridovix answered understanding the question and not put out by it plainly he felt like boasting theyre well enough ill not deny still the time comes when so much sweetness starts to pall the new one now harp turtledove shes slim so she is but wild and shameless as a wolf bitch in heat good for you then scaurus said viridovix he thought would likely jolly this new wench into joining the rest he had a gift in such matters aye shes all i hoped she would be the gaul said hap pily ever since she gave me her eye bold as you please down there on the foggy beach ive known shed not be hard for me to lure under the sheets good for the tribune started to repeat and then stopped in horrified amazement as the full meaningof virido vix words sank in his head whipped round to see who might be listening before he remembered they had been speaking latin one small thing to be grateful for he thought proba bly the only one do you mean to tell me its komitta rhan gavves skirt youre lifting arent you the clever one now but its herself lifts it i assure you as greedy a cleft as any ive known are you witstruck all of a sudden man its the em perors mistress youre diddling not some tavern drab and what o that a celtic noble is entitled to better than such trollops viridovix said proudly forbye if thorisin doesnt want me diddling his lady then let him diddle her his own self and not stay up till dead of night kinging it hell get himself no sons that way will you give him a redheaded one then if no other way hell know the cuckoo by its feathers viridovix chuckled at that but nothing the roman said would make him change his mind he was enjoying himself and was not a man to think of tomorrow till it came he started singing again a bouncy love song half a dozen vi dessians joined in filling the chamber with music marcus tried to decide whether drowning him now would make things better or worse xi pandhelis where have you hidden last years tax register for kybistra scaurus asked the clerk shuffled through rolls of parchment spread his hands regretfully mut tering a curse scaurus stood up from his desk and walked down the hall to see if pikridios goudeles had the document he needed the dapper bureaucrat looked up from his work as the tri bune came in he and scaurus had learned wary respect for each other since the latter began overseeing the bureaucrats for thorisin gavras what peculations have you unearthed now goudeles asked as always a current of mockery flowed just below the surface of his words when marcus told him what he wanted goudeles grew brisk it should be around here someplace he said he went from pigeonhole to pigeonhole unrolling the first few inches of the scrolls in them to see what they contained when the search failed to turn up anything his mobile eyebrows came down in irritation he shouted for a couple of clerks to look in nearby rooms but they returned equally unsuccessful his frown deepened ask the silverfish and the mice he sug gested no you probably trained them to lie for you marcus said when the roman first started the job the emperor had set him goudeles tested him with doctored records the tri bune returned them without comment and got what looked to be real cooperation thereafter he wondered if this was an other subtler snare but goudeles was rubbing his neatly bearded chin in harry turtledove thought that cadaster might not be here at all he said slowly it might already be stored in the archives building down on middle street it shouldnt be its too new but you never can tell i dont have it at any rate all right ill try there if nothing else ill get to stretch my legs thanks pikridios goudeles gave a languid wave of acknowledgment a strange character scaurus thought look ing and acting the effete sealstamper almost to the point of selfparody but with the grit to confront thorisin gavras in his own camp for the sphrantzai well he told himself only in the comedies is a man all of a piece the brown slate flags of the path from the grand court room to the forum of palamas were wet and slippery most of the snow that had blanketed the palace complex lawns was gone the sun was almost hot in a bright blue sky the tribune eyed it suspiciously there had been another of these spells a couple of weeks before followed close by the worst blizzard of the winter this one though might be spring after all the tribune had a good idea of the reception he would get at the imperial offices that housed the archives nor was he disappointed functionaries herded him from file to musty file until he began to hate the smell of old parchment there was no sign of the document he sought or of any less than three years old some were much older than that he turned up one that seemed to speak of namdalen as still part of the empire though fading ink and strange archaic script made it impossi ble to be sure when he showed the ancient scroll to the secretary in charge of those files that worthy said you neednt look as if youre blaming me what would you expect to find in the archives but old papers he seemed scandalized that anyone could expect him to produce a recent document i have been through all three floors of this building scaurus said fighting to hold his patience is there any other place the scurvy thing might be lurking i suppose it might be in the subbasement the secretary answered his tone saying he was sure it wasnt thats where the real antiques get stowed below the prisons i may as well try as long as im here take a lamp with you the secretary advised and keep your sword drawn the rats down there arent often bothered and they can be fierce an emperor for the legion harry turtledove splendid the tribune muttered it was useful information all the same though he had known the imperial offices held a jail he had not been aware there was anything beneath it he made sure the lamp he chose was full of oil he was glad of the lamp as soon as he started down the stairway to the prison for even that was below the level of the street and had no light save what came from the torches nick ering in their iron brackets every few feet along the walls the roughhewn blocks of stone above them were thick with soot that had not been cleaned away for years it was time for the prisoners daily meal a pair of bored guards pushed a squeaking handcart down the central aisle way two more almost equally bored covered them with drawn bows as they passed out loaves of coarse huskfilled bread small bowls of fish stew that smelled none too fresh and squat earthen jugs of water the fare was miserable but the inmates crowded to the front of their cells to get it one made a face as he tasted the stew you washed your feet in it again podopagouros he said aye well they needed it the guard answered unper turbed the tribune had to ask his way down to the subbasement he walked past the rows of cells to a small door whose hinges creaked rustily as he opened it as with many doorways in the imperial offices an image of the emperor was set above this one but scaurus blinked at the portrait a roundfaced old man with a short white beard who he held up his lamp to read the accompanying text phos preserve the avtokrator stro bilos sphrantzes it had been more than five years now since strobilos was emperor long before he reached the bottom of the stairway marcus knew he would never find the taxroll even if it was here the little clay lamp in his hand was not very bright but it shed enough light for him to see boxes of records haphazardly piled on one another some were overturned their contents half buried in the dust and mold on the floor the air tasted dead the lamp flickered scaurus felt his heart jump with it there could be no worse fate than to be lost down here alone in the blackness no not altogether alone as the flame blazed up again its glow came back greenly from scores of gleaming eyes some of them the tribune thought nervously were higher off the ground than a rats eyes had any right to be he retreated making very sure that little door was bolted strobilos stared incuriously down at him even the imperial artist had had trouble portraying him as anything but a dullard its torches bright and cheerful the prison level seemed almost attractive compared to what was below it the guards with their handcart had not moved ahead more than six or seven cells their rhythm was slow nearly hypnotic a loaf to the left a bowl of stew to the right a bowl of stew to the left a loaf to the right a water jar to either side creak forward and repeat you there someone called from one of the cells yes you outlander marcus had been about to go on sure no one down here could be talking to him but that second call stopped him he looked round curiously he had not recognized taron leimmokheir in his shabby linen prison robe the exadmiral had lost weight and his hair and beardwere long and shaggy months in this sunless place had robbed him of his sailors tan but as scaurus walked over to his ceil he saw leimmokheir still bore himself with mili tary erectness the cell itself was neat and clean as it could be cleaner in fact than the passageway outside what is it leimmokheir the tribune asked not very kindly the man on the other side of those rustflaked bars had come too close to killing him and was condemned to be here for planning the murder of the emperor the roman supported id have you take a message to gavras if you would the words were a request but leimmokheirs deep hoarse voice somehow kept its tone of command prisoner though he was marcus waited leimmokheir read his face oh im not such a fool as to ask to be set free i know the odds of that but by phos outlander tell him he holds an innocent man by phos and his light by the hope of heaven and the fear of skotos ice below i swear it he drew the sunsign over his breast repeating harshly he holds an innocent man the convict in the next cell a sallow man with a weasels narrow wicked face leered at scaurus aye were all inno cent here he said thats why they keep us here you know to save us from the guilty ones outside innocent his laugh made the word a filthy joke the roman though paused in some uncertainty barefoot and unkempt leimmokheir might be but his speech still had an emperor for the legion the oddly compelling quality marcus had noted when he first heard it on that midnight beach still carried the conviction that here was a man who would not or could not lie his eyes bored into the tribunes and scaurus lowered his first the food cart came groaning up the tribune made his decision ill do what i can he said leimmokheir acknowl edged him not with a nod but with lowered head and right hand on heart the imperial soldiers salute to a superior if this was acting scaurus thought it deserved a prize he began to regret his promise before he got back to the palace compound as if he didnt have troubles enough with out trying to convince gavras he might have made a mistake thorisin was much more mistrustful of his aides than mavri kios had been with reason marcus had to admit if he ever learned the tribune had planned to defect it did not bear thinking about if on the other hand he approached the emperor through alypia gavra that might blunt thorisins suspicions the more so if she took his side at least he could leam what she thought of leimmokheir which would give better perspective on how far to credit the exadmiral he smacked fist into open palm pleased with his own cleverness she might even know where that fornicating tax roll was he thought the eunuch steward mizizios rapped lightly at the hand some door like most of those in the small secluded building that was the imperial familys private household it was orna mented with inlays of ebony and red cedar yes bring him in of course scaurus heard the princess say mizizios bowed as he worked the silver latch he followed the tribune into the chamber but alypia waved him away let us talk in peace seeing the eunuch hesitate she added go on my virtues safe with him it was marcus thought as much the bitterness in her voice as the order itself that made mizizios flee but she was gracious again as she offered the roman a chair urged him to take wine and cakes thank you your majesty he said its kind of you to see me on such short notice he bit into one of the little cakes with enjoyment they were stuffed with raisins and nuts and dusted lightly harry turtledove with cinnamon better here than over goose he thought that midwinter meal still rankled my uncle has made it plain to both of us that the pen pushers iniquities are of the highest importance has he not she said raising her eyebrows slightly was that surprise at his thanks scaurus wondered or lurking sarcasm he could not read alypia at all and did not think the reverse was true he felt at a disadvantage if im interrupting anything he said and let the sen tence drop nothing that wont keep she said waving to a desk as overloaded with scrolls and books as his own he could read the title picked out in gold leaf on a leatherbound volumes spine the chronicle of seven reigns she followed his eye nodded history is a business that takes its own time the desk itself was plain pine no finer than the one marcus used the rest of the furnishings including the chairs on which he and alypia sat were as austere the only orna ment was an icon of phos above the desk an image stem in judgment at first glance the princess seemed almost equally severe she wore blouse and skirt of plain dark brown unrelieved by jewelry her hair was pulled back into a small tight bun at the nape of her neck but her green eyes rare for a videssian held just enough ironic amusement to temper the harshness she tried to project to what penpushers inquiries are we referring she asked and scaurus heard it in her voice as well none he admitted unless you happen to know where theyve spirited away kybistras tax records i dont she said at once but surely you could have a mage find them for you why so i could scaurus said amazed the notion had never entered his mind for all his time in videssos down deep he still did not accept magic and it rarely occurred to him to use it he wondered how much sorcery went on around him unnoticed every day among folk who took it as much for granted as a cloak against the cold such musings vanished as he remembered his chief reason for seeing the princess im not here on account of the pen pushers actually he began and set out the story of how an emperor for the legion taron leimmokheir had recognized him and insisted on his own innocence alypia grew serious as she listened alert and intent the expression suited her face perfectly marcus thought of the goddess minerva as he watched her she was silent for several moments after he finished then asked at last what do you make of what he said i dont know what to believe the evidence against him is strong and yet i thought the first time i heard his voice that he was a man whose word was good it troubles me well it might ive known leimmokheir five years now since my father won the throne and never seen him do any thing dishonorable or base her mouth twitched in a mirth less smile he even treated me as if i were really empress he may have been artless enough to think i was scaurus rested his chin on the back of his hand looked down at the floor then id best see your uncle hadnt i he did not relish the prospect thorisin was anything but rea sonable on the matter of leimmokheir alypia understood that too ill come with you if you like id be grateful he said frankly it would make me less likely to be taken for a traitor she smiled hardly that shall we find him now the barebranched trees shadows were long outside to morrow will do well enough id like to see to my men with whats left of today as is i dont get as much chance as i should all right my uncle likes to ride in the early morning so ill meet you at midday outside the grand courtroom she stood a sign the audience was at an end thanks he said rising too he took another little cake from the enamelwork tray then smiled himself as the memory came back hed had these cakes before and knew who baked them theyre as good as i remembered he said for the first time he saw alypias reserve crack her eyes widened slightly her hand fluttered as if to brush the compli ment away tomorrow then she said quietly tomorrow harry turtledove when the tribune got back to the barracks he found an argument in full swing gorgidas had made the mistake of trying to explain the greek notion of democracy to viridovix and succeeded only in horrifying the celtic noble its fair unnatural viridovix said twas the gods themselves set some folk above the rest arigh arghuns son who was there visiting the gaul and soaking up some wine nodded vigorously nonsense scaurus said the roman patricians had tried to put that one over on the rest of the people too it had been centuries since it worked but gorgidas turned on him snapping what makes you think i need your help your precious roman republic has its nobles too though they buy their way to the role instead of being born into it why is a crassus a man worth hearing if not for his moneybags what are you yattering about arigh said impatiently the allusion meant nothing to him and hardly more to virido vix the arshaum was a chieftains son though and knew what he thought of the greeks idea a clan has nobles for the same reason an army has generals so when trouble comes people know whom to follow gorgidas shot back why follow anyone simply because of birth wisdom would be a better guide be a man never so wise if he comes dungfooted from the fields and speaks like the clodhopper born no one be after hearing his widsom regardless viridovix said arighs flat features showed his contempt for all farmers noble and peasant alike but he followed the principle the celt was laying down in his harsh clipped speech he said to gor gidas here outlander let me tell you a story to show you what i mean a story is it wait a moment will you the physician trotted off to return with tablet and stylus if anything could ease him out of an argumentative mood it was the prospect of learning more about the world in which he found himself he poised stylus over wax all right carry on this happened a few years back youll understand arigh began among the arshaum who fellow the standard of the black sheep near neighbors to my fathers clan one of an emperor for the legion their war leaders was a basebom man named kuyuk and he had a yen for power he toppled the clanchief neat as you please but because he was a nobodys son the nobles were touchy about doing what he told them he was clever though was kuyuk and had himself a scheme one of the things the clanchief left behind when he ran was a golden footbath the nobles washed their feet in it aye and pissed in it too sometimes now kuyuk had a gold smith melt it down and recast it in the shape of a wind spirit he set it up among the tents and all the clansmen of the black sheep made sacrifice to it sounds like something out of herodotos gorgidas said little translucent spirals of wax curling up from his darting stylus out of what anyway kuyuk let this go on for a while and then called in his factious nobles he told them where the image came from and said you used to wash your feet in that basin and piddle in it and even puke now you sacrifice to it because its in a spirits shape the same holds true for me when i was a commoner you could revile me all you liked but as clanchief i deserve the honor of my station och what a tricksy man viridovix exclaimed in admi ration that should have taught them respect not likely the chief noble whose name was mutugen stuck a knife into kuyuk then all the nobles gathered round and pissed on his corpse as mutugen said gold is gold no matter what the shape and a basebom mans still basebom with a crown on his head mutugens son tutukan is chief of the black sheep to this day they wouldnt follow a nobody true your nobles wouldnt marcus said but what of the rest of the clan were they sorry to see kuyuk killed who knows what difference does it make arigh an swered honestly confused viridovix slapped him on the back in agreement gorgidas threw his hands in the air now put in a more dispassionate frame of mind by his ethnographic jotting he was willing to admit scaurus to his side he said dont let them reach you roman they havent experienced it and understand no more than a blind man does a painting honh said viridovix arigh what say you the two of us find a nice aristocratic tavern and have a jar or two o the harry turtledove noble grape tall celt and short wiry plainsman strode out of the barracks side by side gorgidas notetaking and his own visit to alypia gavra reminded marcus of the greek doctors other interest how is that history of yours doing he asked it comes scaurus a bit at a time but it comes may i see it the roman asked suddenly curious my greek was never of the finest i know and its the worse for rust but id like to try if youd let me gorgidas hesitated i have only the one copy but unless he wrote for himself alone the tribune was his only possible audience for his work in the original and no videssian trans lation even if somehow made could be the same mind you care for it now dont let your brat be gumming it of course not scaurus soothed him well all right then ill fetch it or such of it as is fit to see no no stay there dont trouble yourself ill get it the greek went off to his billet in the next barracks hall he re turned with a pair of parchment scrolls which he defiantly handed to marcus thank you the tribune said but gorgidas brushed the amenities aside with an impatient wave of his hand marcus knew better than to push him the physician was a large hearted man but disliked admitting it even to himself scaurus took the scrolls back to his own quarters lit a lamp and settled down on the bedroll to read as twilight deepened he realized how poor and flickering the light was he thought of the priest apsimar back at imbros and the aura of pearly radiance the ascetic cleric could project at will sometimes magic was very handy though apsimar would cry blasphemy if asked to be a reading lamp concentration on gorgidas history drove such trivia from his mind the going was slow at first scaurus had not read greek for several years it was distressing to see how much of his painfully built vocabulary had fallen by the wayside the farther he went though the more he realized the physi cian had created what was that phrase of thucydides a ktema es aei a possession for all time gorgidas style was pleasingly straightforward he wrote a smooth koine greek with only a few unusual spellings to remind one he came from elis a city that used the doric dialect but the history had more to offer than an agreeable an emperor for the legion style there was real thought behind it gorgidas constantly strove to reach beyond mere events to illuminate the principles they illustrated marcus wondered if his physicians training had a hand in that a doctor had to recognize a diseases true nature rather than treating only its symptoms thus when speaking of antinamdalener riots in videssos gorgidas gave an account of what had happened in the partic ular case he had observed but went on to remark a city mob is a thing that loves trouble and is rash by nature the civil strife it causes may be more dangerous and harder to put down than warfare with foreign foes it was a truth not lim ited to the empire alone helvis came in breaking marcus train of thought she had dosti in the crook of her arm and led malric by the hand her son by hemond broke free from his mother and jumped on scaurus stomach we went walking on the sea wall he said with a fiveyearolds frightening enthusiasm and mama bought me a sausage and we watched the ships sailing away marcus lifted a questioning eyebrow bouraphos helvis said the tribune nodded it was about time thorisin sent pityos help against the yezda and the drungarios of the fleet could reach the port on the videssian sea long before any force got there by land malric burbled on scaurus listened with half an ear helvis set dosti down he tried to stand fell over and crawled to ward his father da he announced dadada he reached for the roll of parchment the tribune had set down remem bering gorgidas halfserious warning marcus snatched it away the babys face clouded over marcus grabbed him and tossed him up and down which seemed to please him well enough me too malric said tugging at his arm scaurus tried hard not to favor dosti over his stepson all right hero but youre a bit big for me to handle lying down the tribune climbed to his feet he gave dosti back to helvis then swung malric through the air until the boy shrieked with glee enough helvis warned practically or he wont keep that sausage down to her son she added and enough for you too young man get ready to go to bed after the usual harry turtledove protests malric slipped out of shirt and breeches and slid under the covers he fell asleep at once what did you rescue from this one helvis asked heft ing dosti are you bringing your taxes to bed now i should hope not marcus exclaimed there was a per version not even vardanes sphrantzes could enjoy the tri bune showed helvis gorgidas history the strange script made her frown though she could read only a few words of videssian she knew what the signs were supposed to look like and was taken aback that a different system could repre sent sounds something almost like fear was in her eyes as she said to scaurus there are times when i nearly forget from how far away you come dear and then something like this reminds me this is your latin then not quite the tribune said but he could see his explana tion left her confused nor did she understand his interest in the past its gone and gone forever what could be more useless she said how can you hope to understand what will come without knowing whats come before what comes will come whether i understand it or not now is plenty for me marcus shook his head theres more than a little barbar ian in you i fear he said but fondly and what if there is her stare challenged him she put dosti in his crib he took her in his arms i wasnt complaining he said it always amused scaurus how students and masters of the videssian academy turned to watch him as he made his way through the gray sandstone buildings corridors they could be priest or noble graybeard scholar or ropemakers gifted son but the sight of a mercenary captain in the halls never failed to make heads swing he was glad nepos kept early hours with luck the chubby little priest could find his missing tax roll for him before he was due to meet alypia gavra at first it seemed he would have that luck for nepos hours were even earlier than hed thought when he peered into the refectory a drowsy looking student told him aye he was here but hes already an emperor for the legion gone to lecture where you say i think in one of the chambers on the third floor im not sure which the young man went back to his honeysweetened barley porridge marcus trudged up the stairs then walked past open doors until he found his man he slid into an empty seat at the back of the room nepos beamed at him but kept on teaching his dozen or so students scribbled notes as they tried to keep pace now and then a student would ask a question nepos dealt with them effortlessly but patiently always asking at the end of his explanation now do you understand to that scaurus would have had to answer no as near as he could gather the priests subject matter was somewhere on the border between theology and sorcery and decidedly too abstruse for the unini tiated still the tribune judged him a fine speaker witty thoughtful selfpossessed that will do for today nepos said as marcus was begin ning to fidget most of the students trooped out a couple stayed behind to ask questions too complex to interrupt the flow of the lecture they too looked curiously at scaurus as they left so did nepos well well he chuckled pumping the tribunes hand what brings you here surely not a profound interest in the relation between the ubiquity of phos grace and proper application of the law of contact uh no scaurus said but when he explained why he had come nepos laughed until his round cheeks reddened the tribune did not see the joke and said so your pardon i pray i have a twofold reason for mirth he ticked them off his fingers first for something so trivial you hardly need the services of a chairholder in theoretical thaumaturgy any streetcomer wizard could find your lost register for a fee of a couple of silver bits oh marcus felt his face grow hot but i dont know any streetcomer wizards and i do know you quite right quite right dont take me wrong im happy to help but a mage of my power is no more needed for so simple a spell than a sledgehammer to push a pinthrough gauze it struck me funny i never claimed to know anything of magic what else amuses you feeling foolish the tribune tried to hide it with gruffness harry turtledove only that todays lecture topic turns out to be relevant to you after all thanks to phos allpervading goodness things once conjoined are ever after so related that contact between them can be restored would you have perhaps a tax roll from a city close by kybistra scaurus thought yes back at my offices i was working on the receipts from doxon i dont know that part of the empire well but from my maps the two towns are only a days journey apart excellent using one roll to seek another wills engthen the spell for of course its also true that like acts most powerfully on like lead on my friend no dont be foolish i have no plans till the afternoon and this shant take long i promise as they walked through the palace compound the priest kept up a stream of chatter on his students on the weather on bits of academy gossip that meant little to scaurus and on whatever else popped into his mind he loved to talk the roman gave him a better audience than most of his country men who were also fond of listening to themselves marcus thought the two of them made a pair as strange as viridovix and arigh a fat little shavepate priest with a fuzzy black beard and a tall blond mercenarytumedbureaucrat do you prefer this to the field nepos asked as the tri bune ushered him into his office pandhelis the secretary looked up in surprise as he saw the priests blue robe out of the comer of his eye he jumped to his feet making the sun sign over his breast nepos returned it scaurus considered i thought i would when i started these days i often wonder answers are so much less clear cut here he didnt want to say much more than that not with pandhelis listening he returned to the business at hand doxons cadaster was where hed left it shoved to one comer of his desk will you need any special gear for your spell he asked nepos no not a thing merely a few pinches of dust to serve as a symbolic link between that which is lost and that which seeks it dust i think will not be hard to come by in these surroundings the priest chuckled marcus did too pand helis a bureaucrat born sniffed audibly nepos got his dust from the windowsill carefully put it down in the center of a clean square of parchment the man an emperor for the legion harry turtledove ifestations of the spell vary he explained to scaurus if the missing object is close by the dust may shape itself into an arrow pointing it out or may leave its resting point and guide the seeker directly if the distance is greater though it will form a word or image to show him the location of what hes looking for in rome the tribune would have thought that so much hog wash but he knew better here nepos began a chant in the archaic videssian dialect he held doxons tax roll in his right hand while the stubby fingers of his left moved in quick passes amazingly sure and precise the priest wore a smile of simple pleasure marcus thought of a master musician amus ing himself with a childrens tune nepos called out a last word in a commanding tone of voice then stabbed his left forefinger down at the dust but though it roiled briefly as if breathed upon it showed no pattern nepos frowned as scaurus imaginary musician might have at a lute string suddenly out of tune he scratched his chin looked at the roman in some embarrassment my apol ogies i must have done something wrong though i dont know what let me try again his second effort was no more successful than the first the dust stirred then settled mean inglessly the priest studied his hands seemingly wondering if they had betrayed him for some reason of their own how cur ious he murmured your book is not destroyed of that im sure else the dust would not have moved at all but are you certain its in the city where else would it be scaurus retorted unable to imagine anyone wanting to spirit off such a stupefying docu ment shall we try to find out the question was rhetorical nepos was already examining the contents of his beltpouch to see if he had what he needed he grunted in satisfaction as he produced a small stoppered glass vial in the shape of a flowers seedcapsule he put a couple of drops of the liquid within on his tongue making a face at the taste now this not every wizard will know so you did well coming to me after all it clears the mind of doubts and lets it see further thus increasing the power of the spell what is it scaurus asked nepos hesitated he did not like to reveal his crafts secrets but the drug was already having its way with him poppy juice and henbane he said drowsily the pupils of his eyes shrank down almost to nothing but his voice and hands drilled by years of the wizards art went through the incanta tion without faltering again the finger darted at the dust marcus eyes widened as he watched the pinches of dead stuff writhe like a tiny snake and shape themselves into a word successful magic never failed to raise his hackles how interesting nepos said though his decoction dulled the interest in his voice even aided i did not think the cantrip could reach to garsavra fair enough scaurus answered because i didnt think the tax roll could be there either he scratched his head wondering why it was no matter he decided onomagoulos could always send it back the tribune dispatched pandhelis to take nepos to the roman barracks and put him to bed the priest went without demur the potion he had swallowed left his legs rubbery and his usually lively spirit as muffled as a drum beaten through several thicknesses of cloth no dont worry for me it will wear off soon he reassured scaurus fighting back an enor mous yawn he lurched off on pandhelis arm marcus looked out the window then quickly followed the secretary and priest downstairs by the shortness of the shadows it was nearly noon and it would not do to keep alypia gavra waiting to his dismay he found her already standing by the grand gates she did not seem angry though in fact she was deep in conversation with the four romans on sentry duty for her uncle aye your gods well enough my lady minucius was saying but i miss the legions eagle that old bird watched over us a lot of times the legionarys companions nodded soberly so did alypia she frowned as if trying to fix minu cius remark in her memory marcus could not help smiling hed seen that expression on gorgidas too often not to recog nize it now the mark of a historian at work spotting his commander minucius came to attention grounding his spear with a sharp thud he and his comrades an emperor for the legion gave scaurus the clenchedfist roman salute as you were im outranked here the tribune said easily he bowed to alypia dont let me interfere between your men and you she said you werent back in his days with caesar in gaul the least breach of order would have disturbed him mightily two and a half years as a mercenary captain had taught him the difference between spit and polish for their own sake and the real discipline that was needed to survive the chamberlain inside the grand gates clicked his tongue between his teeth your highness where are your atten dants he asked doing whatever they do i imagine i have no use for them she answered curtly and ignored the functionarys in dignant look scaurus noted the edge in her voice her natural leaning toward privacy could only have been exaggerated by the time she spent as vardanes sphrantzes captive the court attendant gave an eloquent shrug but bowed and conducted them forward as the tribune walked up the colon naded central hall toward the imperial throne he saw the dam age of the previous summers fight had been repaired tapestries hung untom while tiny bits of matching stone were cemented into chipped columns then scaurus realized not all the injuries had been healed he strode over a patch of slightly discolored porphyry floor ing a patch whose polish did not quite match the mirrorlike perfection of the rest it would have been about here he thought that avshars fire blazed he wondered again where the wizardprinces sorcery had snatched him through all the winter there had been no report of him alypias eyes were fathomless but the closer she drew to the throne and to the passageway beside it the tighter her mouth became until marcus saw her bite her lip another chamberlain led katakolon kekaumenos back from his audience with the emperor the legate from agder gave scaurus his wintry smile inclined his head to alypia gavra once he was out of earshot she murmured youd think he paid for every word he spoke their guide fell in the proskynesis before the throne from his belly he called up to thorisin her highness the princess alypia gavra the epoptes and commander scaurus the harry turtledove ronam marcus stifled the urge to kick him in his upraised backside phos light fool i know who they are the emperor growled still with no use for court ceremonial the attendant rose he gaped to see the tribune still on his feet alypia was of royal blood but why was this outlander so privileged never mind kabasilas thorisin said my brother made allowances for him and i do too he earns them mostly kabasilas bowed and withdrew but his curled lip spoke vol umes gavras cocked an eyebrow at the tribune so epoptes and commander scaurus what now are the sealstampers si phoning off goldpieces to buy themselves countingboards with beads of ruby and silver as for that marcus said im having some trouble find ing out he told the emperor of the missing tax register thinking to slide from an easy matter to the harder one that was his main purpose here i thought you know better than to come to me with such twaddle thorisin said impatiently send to baanes if you will but you have no need to bother me about it scaurus accepted the rebuke like mavrikios the younger gavras appreciated directness but when the roman began his plea for taron leimmokheir the emperor did not let him get past the exadmirals name before he roared no by skotos filthfilled beard are you turned treacher too his bellow filled the grand courtroom courtiers froze in midstep a chamberlain almost dropped the fat red candle he was carrying it went out his curse a eunuchs contralto echoed gavras minucius poked his head into the throne room to see what had happened you were the one who told me it wasnt in the man to lie marcus said persisting where a man born in the empire might well quail aye so i did and came near paying my life for my stu pidity thorisin retorted now you tell me to put the wasp back in my tunic for another sting let him stay mured up till he rots and gabble out his prayers lest worse befall him uncle i think youre wrong alypia said what little decency came my way while the sphrantzai reigned came from leimmokheir away from his precious ships hes a child with no more skill at politics than marcus foster son an emperor for the legion the tribune blinked first at her mentioning malric and then at her calling him by his own praenomen when used alone it was normally a mark of close personal ties he won dered whether she knew the roman custom she was going on you know im telling you the truth uncle how many years now have you known leimmokheir more than a handful surely you know the man he is do you really think that man could play you false the emperors fist slammed down on the goldsheathed arm of his throne the ancient seat was not made for such treatment it gave a painful creak of protest thorisin leaned forward to emphasize his words the man i knew would not break faith but leimmokheir did and thus i knew him not at all who does worse evil the man who shows his wickedness for the whole world to see or the one who stores it up to loose against those who trust him a good question for a priest alypia said but not one with much meaning if leimmokheir is innocent i was there girl i saw what was done saw the new minted goldpieces of the sphrantzai in the murderers pouches let leimmokheir explain them away that might earn his freedom the emperor laughed but it was a sound of hurt marcus knew it was futile to argue further feeling betrayed by a man he had thought honest gavras would not could not yield to argument thank you for hearing me at least the tribune said i gave my word to put the case to you once more then you misgave it no i think not there are times outlander when you try my patience the emperor said dangerously scaurus met his eye hiding the twinge of fear he felt much of the position he had built for himself in videssos was based on not letting the sheer weight of imperial authority coerce him that for a man of republi can rome was easy facing an angry thorisin gavras was something else again gavras made a dissatisfied sound deep in his throat ka basilas he called and the chamberlain was at his elbow as the last syllable of his name still echoed in the highceilinged throne room marcus expected some sonorous formula of dis missal but that was not thorisins way he jerked his head harry turtledove toward his niece and the tribune and left kabasilas to put such formality in the gesture as he might the steward did his best but his bows and flourishes seemed all the more artificial next to the emperors unvar nished rudeness the other court functionaries craned their necks at scaurus and alypia as he led them away wondering how much favor they had lost that would be as it was marcus thought he laughed at himself a piece of fatalism worthy of the halogai when they came out to the grand gates once more alypia stopped to talk a few minutes longer with the roman sentries there then departed for the imperial residence scaurus went up to his offices to dictate a letter to baanes onomagoulos pandhelis script was far more legible than his own that ac complished he basked in a pleasant glow of selfsatisfaction as he started back to the barracks it did not last long viridovix was coming toward him a jar of wine in his hand and an anticipatory grin on his face the gaul threw him a cheery wave and ducked into a small doorway in the other wing of the grand courtroom maybe i should have drowned him marcus thought an grily had viridovix no idea what he was playing at there was no more caution in him than guile in taron leimmokheir what would he do next ask thorisin for the loan of a bed room the tribune warned himself not to suggest that viri dovix might take him up on it with the celt gone scaurus was surprised to see arigh at the barracks the arshaum was talking to gorgidas again while the greek took notes gorgidas was asking who sees to your sick then the question seemed to bore arigh who scratched beneath his tunic of sueded leather at last he said indifferently the shamans drive out evil spirits of course and for smaller ills the old women know of herbs i suppose ask me of war where i can talk of what i know he slapped the curved sword that hung at his side quintus glabrio came in he smiled and waved to gorgidas without interrupting the physicians jottings instead he said to marcus im glad to see you here sir a couple of my men have a running quarrel i cant seem to get to the bottom of maybe theyll heed you i doubt that if you cant solve it the tribune said but he an emperor for the legion went with glabrio anyhow the legionaries stood stifffaced as he warned them not to let their dislike for each other affect their soldiering they nodded at the correct times scaurus was not deceived anything the able junior centurion could not cure over the course of time would not yield to his brief inter cession the men were on formal notice now so perhaps something was accomplished arigh had gone when he returned gorgidas was working up his notes rubbing out a word here a phrase there with the blunt end of his stylus then reversing it to put his changes on the wax viridovix will think youre trying to steal his friend away the tribune said what do i care what that longshanked gaul thinks gorgidas asked but could not quite keep amusement from his voice sometimes viridovix made his friends want to wring his neck but they remained his friends in spite of it less pleased the doctor went on at least i can learn what the plainsman has to teach me there was no mistaking his bitterness marcus knew he was still seeing nepos and other healerpriests still trying to master their arts and still falling short no wonder he was putting more energy into his history these days medicine could not be satisfying to him right now scaurus yawned cozily warm under the thick wool blan ket helvis steady breathing beside him said she had already dropped off so did her arm flung carelessly across his chest malric was asleep on her other side while dostis breath came raspy from his crib the baby was getting over a minor fever marcus drowsily hoped he would not catch it but an itchy something in the back of his mind kept him from following them into slumber he rehashed the days events trying to track it down was it his failure to gain taron leimmokheirs release close he thought but not on the mark he had not expected to win that one why close then he heard alypia gavras voice once more as she talked with the legionaries outside the grand courtroom whatever else she knew about their ways he real ized she was perfectly familiar with the proper use of roman names he was a long time sleeping xll the tribune sneezed gaius phiuppus looked at him in disgust arent you through with that bloody thing yet it hangs on and on marcus said dolefully wiping his nose his eyes were watery too and his head seemed three times its proper size what is it two weeks now at least thats what you get for having your brat re voltingly healthy himself gaius philippus spooned up his breakfast porridge took a great gulp of wine thats good he patted his belly scaurus had scant appetite which was as well for his sense of taste had disappeared viridovix strode into the barracks splendid in his cape of crimson skins he helped himself to peppery lamb sausage porridge and wine then sank into a chair by the tribune and senior centurion the top o the day tye he said lifting his mug in salute and to you marcus returned he looked the celt up and down why such finery so early in the morning early in the morning it may be for some scaurus dear but im thinking of it as nights end and a rare fine night it was too he winked at the two romans mmph marcus said as noncommittal a noise as he could muster normally he enjoyed viridovix in a bragging mood but since the gaul had taken up with komitta rhan gavve the less he heard the better nor did gaius philippus incurious expression offer viridovix any encouragement the senior centurion marcus was sure was jealous of the celt but would sooner have been racked than admit it irrepressible as always viridovix needed scant prompting an emperor for the legion after a long noisy pull at his wine he remarked would your honor believe it the wench had the brass to tell me to put all my other lassies to one side and have her only not ask mind you but tell and me sharing her with himself without so much as a peep the cheek of it all he bit into the sau sage made a face at its spiciness and drank again sharing who with whom gaius philippus asked con fused by pronouns never mind marcus said quickly the fewer people who knew of viridovixs try sting the longer word of it would take to get back to thorisin gavras even viridovix saw that for he suddenly looked sly but his report of what komitta had said worried the tribune enough to make him ask what did you tell the lady what any celtic noble and gentleman would of course to go futter the moon no colleen bespeaks me so oh no scaurus wanted to hold his aching head in his hands with komittas savage temper and great sense of her own rank it was a wonder viridovix was here to tell the tale in fact what did she say to that och she carried on somewhat sure and she did but i homed it out of her viridovix stretched complacently the tribune looked at him in awe if that was true the gaul was a mighty lanceman indeed viridovix routed a piece of gristle out from between his teeth with a fingernail then belched still and all he said if ye maun play the tomcat of evenings then the days the time for lying up a bit o sleepd be welcome now so by your leaves he rose finished his wine and walked out whistling cheerily enough of your never minds gaius philippus said as soon as the celt was gone you dont go fishbelly color over trifles whats toward so marcus his hand forced told him and had the remote pleasure of watching his jaw drop to his chest almighty jove the senior centurion said at last the lad doesnt think small does he now he thought another minute then added hes welcome to her too for my silver id sooner strop my tool on a sword blade than go near that one all in all its safer the tribune winced at the image but slowly nodded down deep inside he felt the same way harry turtledove as spring drew on scaurus spent less time at tax records most of the receipts had come in after the fall harvest and he was through most of the backlog by the time the days began to grow longer once more he knew he had done an imperfect job of overseeing the videssian bureaucracy it was too large too complex and too well entrenched for any one man let alone an outsider to control it fully but he did think he had done some good and kept more revenue flowing into the impe rial treasury than it would have got without him he was only too aware of some of his failures one after noon pikridios goudeles had mortified him by coming into the offices with a massy golden ring set with an enormous emer ald the minister wore it with great ostentation and flashed it at the tribune so openly that marcus was sure its price came from diverted funds indeed goudeles hardly bothered to deny it only smiling a superior smile yet try as scaurus would he could find no errors in the books goudeles let him stew for several days then still with that condescending air showed the roman the sly bit of jugglery hed used for he said having used it myself i see no point in letting just anyone slide it past you that would re flect on my own skill more or less sincerely marcus thanked him and said noth ing further about the ring he had fairly lost this contest of wit with the bureaucrat just as he had won the one before they remained notquitefriends each with a healthy regard for the others competence as scaurus came less often to his desk in the grand courtroom wing he sometimes missed the seal stampers dry delicate wit his exquisite sense of where to place a dart before long only one major item was outstanding on the tribunes list the tax roll for kybistra onomagoulos ignored his first request for it he sent out another more strongly worded that echo will be a long time returning i think goudeles told him eh why marcus asked irritably the bureaucrats eyebrow could not have lifted by the thickness of a hair but he contrived to make the roman feel like a small stupid child ah well goudeles murmured it was a disorderly time for everyone scaurus thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand an emperor for the legion harry turtledove annoyed with himself for missing what was obvious once pointed out onomagoulos had taken refuge at kybistra after maragha the tribune wondered what part of his accounts would not bear close inspection thorisin he thought would be interested in that question too so it proved the imperial rescript that went out to gar savra all but crackled off its parchment by that time marcus cared less than he had he was working hard with his troops as they readied themselves for the coming summer campaign as he sweated on the practice field he was gratified to see the beginning potbelly he had grown during the winters inactivity start to fade away roman training techniques were enough to melt the fat off anyone the videssians vaspurakaners and other locals who had taken service with the legionaries grumbled constantly as soldiers will over any exercises gaius philippus naturally worked them all the harder for their complaints as for scaurus he threw himself into the drills with an enthusiasm he had not felt when he first joined the legions the troops exercised with doubleweight weapons of wood and fought at pells until their arms ached thrusting now at the dummy posts faces now at their flanks and again at thigh level they used heavy wicker shields too and prac ticed advancing and retreating from their imaginary foes hard work this gagik bagratouni said the vaspura kaner nakharar still led his countrymen and had learned to swear in broken latin as foully as in his hardly more fluent videssian by the time comes real battle a relief it wiu be thats the idea gaius philippus said bagratouni groaned and shook his head sending sweat flying every where he was well into his forties and the drill came hard for him he worked at it with the fierce concentration of a man trying to forget past shadows and his countrymen showed a spirit and discipline that won the romans admira tion the only thing that horrified the mountaineers was having to leam to swim the streams in their homeland were trickles most ofthe year floods the rest learn they did but they never came to enjoy the water legionarystyle as a pleasant way to end a days exercises the videssians among the legionaries were not quite at their high pitch a dozen times a day marcus would hear some roman yelling the point damn it the point a pox on the bloody edge it isnt good for anything anyway the imperials always promised to mend their swordplay and always slipped back most were excavalrymen used to the sabers sweet slash thrusting with the short gladius went against their instincts more patient than most of his fellows quintus glabrio would explain no matter how hard you cut armor and bones both shield your foes vitals but even a poorly deliv ered stab may kill besides with the stabbing stroke you dont expose your own body and often you can kill your man before he knows youve delivered the stroke having nodded in sol emn agreement the videssians would do as they were or dered for a while then there were those to whom roman discipline meant nothing at all viridovix was as deadly a fighter as scaurus had seen but utterly out of place in the orderly lines of the legionaries maniples even gaius philippus acknowledged the hopelessness of making him keep rank im just glad hes on our side was the senior centurions comment zeprin the red was another lone wolf his great axe un suited him for action among the legionaries spears and swords as did his temperament where viridovix saw battle as high sport the haioga looked on it as his cold gods testing place their shieldmaidens guide upwards the souls of those who fall bravely with my enemys blood i will buy my stair way to heaven he rumbled testing the edge of his double bitted weapon with his thumb no one seemed inclined to argue though to videssian ears that was pagan superstition of the rankest sort drax of namdalen and his captains came out to the practice field several times to watch the romans work their smart drill impressed the great count who told scaurus by the wager i wish that son of a pimp goudeles had warned me what sort of men you had i thought my knights would ride right through you so we could roll up thorisins horse like a pair of leggings he shook his head ruefully didnt quite work that way you gave us a bad time too the tribune returned the compliment drax remained a mystery to him a skilled war rior certainly but a man who showed little of himself to the an emperor for the legion harry turtledove world outside though unfailingly courteous he had a stiff face a horse trader would envy he reminds me of vardanes sphrantzes with the back of his head shaved gaius philippus said after the islander left but that far marcus would not go whatever draxs mask con cealed he did not think it was the unmoumed sevastos cru elty however much the namdaleni admired the legionaries the senior centurion remained dissatisfied theyre soft he mourned they need a couple of days of real marching to get the winter laziness out of em once for all lets do it then marcus said though he felt a twinge of trepidation if the troopers needed work what of him full kits tomorrow he heard gaius philippus order and listened to the chorus of donkey brays that followed the full roman pack ran to more than a third of a mans weight along with weapons and iron rations it included a mess kit cup spare clothes in a small wicker hamper a tent section pali sade stakes or firewood and either a saw pick spade or sickle for camping and foraging small wonder the legionaries called themselves mules dawn was only a promise when they tramped out of the city northward bound the videssian gate crew shook their heads in sympathy as they watched the soldiers march past make way there gaius philippus rasped and waggoners hastily got their producefilled wains out of the roadway like most of the empires civilians they distrusted what little they knew about mercenaries and were not anxious to learn more marcus pulled a round ruddy apple from one of the wagons he tossed the driver a small copper coin to pay for it and had to laugh at the disbelief on the mans face belike their puir spalpeen was after thinking youd breakfast on him instead of his fruit viridovix said there was less room for good cheer as the day wore along the military step was something the romans fell into with unthinking ease each of them automatically holding his place in his maniples formation the men who had taken service since they came to videssos did their best to imitate them but here as in so many small ways practice told and because the newcomers were less orderly they tired quicker still almost no one dropped from the line of march no matter how footsore he became blistered toes were nothing to the blistering gaius philippus gave fallersout nor was any trooper eager to face his fellows jeers phostis apokavkos first of all the videssians to become a legionary strode along between two romans hunching for ward a little under the weight of his pack his long face crin kled into a smile as he nipped scaurus a salute the tribune returned it he hardly reckoned apokavkos a videssian any more like any son of italys the exfarmers hands were branded with the mark of the legions when he learned the marks significance apokavkos had insisted on receiving it but scaurus had not asked it of any of the other recruits nor had they volunteered by afternoon the tribune was feeling pleased with himself there seemed to be a band of hot iron around his chest and his legs ached at every forward step but he kept up with his men without much trouble he did not think they would make the twenty miles that was a good days march but they were not far from it already they were past the band of suburbs that huddled under videssos walls and out into the countryside wheat fields forests and vineyards were all glad with new leaf there were newly returned birds overhead too a blackcap swooped low churr taktaktak it scolded the legionaries then darted off on its endless pursuit of insects a small flock of linnets scarlet heads and breasts bright twittered as they winged their way toward a gorsecovered hilltop gaius philippus began eyeing likely looking fields for a place to camp at last he found one that suited him with a fine view of the surrounding area and a swift clear stream running by woods at the edge of the field promised fuel for campfires the senior centurion looked a question toward scaurus who nodded perfect he said even though this was but a drill from skill and habit gaius philippus was inca pable of picking a bad site the buccinators horns blared out the order to halt the legionaries pulled tools from their packs and fell to work on the square ditch and rampart that would shelter them for the night stakes sprouted atop the earthwork wall inside eight man tents went up in neat rows that left streets running at right angles and a goodsized open central forum by the time the sun was down marcus would have trusted the camp to hold against three or four times his fifteen hundred men an emperor for the legion some of the fanners hereabout must have reported the romans arrival to the local lord for it had just grown dark when he rode up to investigate with a double handful of armed retainers marcus courteously showed him around the camp he seemed a bit unnerved to be surrounded by so much orderly force be gone again tomorrow you say he asked for the third time well good good have a pleasant night of it now and he and his men rode away looking back over their shoulders until the night swallowed them what was all that in aid of gaius philippus demanded why didnt you just tell him to bugger off youd never make a politician marcus answered after he saw what we had he didnt have the nerve to ask for the price of the firewood we cut and i didnt have to embarrass him by telling him no right out loud face got saved all around hmm it was plain gaius philippus did not give a coun terfeit copper for the nobles feelings the tribune though found it easier to avoid antagonizing anyone gratuitously with the touchy videssians even that little was not always easy he settled down by a campfire to gnaw journey bread smoked meat and an onion and emptied his canteen of the last of the wine it held when he started to get up to rinse it out he discovered he could barely stagger to the stream the break the first hed had from marching all day gave his legs a chance to stiffen and theyd taken it with a vengeance many legionaries were in the same plight gorgidas went from one to the next kneading life into cramped calves and thighs the spare greek looselimbed himself after the hard march spotted marcus hobbling back to the fireside kai su teknont he said in his own tongue you too son stretch out there and ill see what i can do for you scaurus obediently lay back he gasped as the doctors fingers dug into his legs i think id rather have the aches he said but he and gorgidas both knew he was lying when the greek was done the tribune found he could walk again more or less as he always had dont be too proud of yourself gorgidas advised watching his efforts like a parent with a toddler youll still feel it come morning harry turtledove the physician as usual was right marcus shambled down to the stream to splash water on his face unable to assume any better pace or gait his sole consolation was that he was far from alone about one legionary in three looked to have had his legs age thirty years overnight come on you lazy sods its no further back than it was out gaius philippus shouted unsympathetically one of the oldest men in the camp he showed no visible sign of strain och to the crows with you that was viridovix not being under roman discipline he could say what the legion aries felt the march had been hard on the gaul though larger and stronger than almost all the romans he lacked their stamina however much gaius philippus pressed as the legionaries started back he did not get the speed he wanted it took a good deal of marching for the men to work their muscles loose to the senior centurions eloquent disgust they were still a couple of miles short of videssos when night fell well camp here he growled again choosing a prime defensive position in pastureland between two suburbs i wont have us sneaking in after dark like so many footpads and you whoresons dont deserve the sweets of the city any way loafing goodfornaughts caesard be ashamed of the lot of you that meant little to the videssians and vaspura kaners but it was enough to make the romans hang their heads in shame mention of their old commander was almost too painful to bear when marcus woke the next morning he found to his sur prise that he was much less sore than he had been the day before i feel the same way quintus glabrio said with one of his rare smiles were likely just numb from the waist down there were quite a few bright sails in the cattlecrossing probably a grain convoy from the westlands southern coast thought scaurus a city the size of videssos was far too big for the local countryside to feed less than an hour brought the legionaries to the capitals mighty walls have yourselves a good hike one of the gatecrew asked as he waved them through he grinned at the abuse he got by way of reply it was hardly past dawn videssos streets soon to be swarming with life as yet were nearly deserted a few early an emperor for the legion risers were wandering into phos temples for the sunrise lit urgy here and there people of the night whores thieves gamblers still strutted or skulked a cat darted away from the legionaries a fishtail hanging from the comer of its mouth the whole city was sweet with the smell of baking bread the bakers were at their ovens before the sun was up and stayed till it was dark once more sweating their lives away to keep videssos fed marcus smiled as he felt his nostrils dilate heard his stomach growl joumeybread fought hunger but the mere thought of a fresh soft steaming loaf teased the appetite to new life the legionaries entered the palace compound from the north marching past the videssian academy the sun gleamed off the golden dome on its high spire though the season was still early spring the day already gave promise of being hot and muggy marcus was glad for a granite colon nades longcool shadow hoofbeats rang round a bend in the path loud in the mom ing stillness the tribunes eyebrows rose who was galloping a horse down the palace compounds twisting ways a typical roman scaurus did not know that much of horses but it hardly took an equestrian to realize the rider was asking for a broken neck the great bay stallion thundered round the bend in the track marcus felt alarm stab into his guts that was the em perors horse but thorisin was not in the saddle instead aly pia gavra bestrode the beast barely in control she fought it to a halt just in front of the romans whose first ranks were giving back from the seeming runaway not liking the check the stallion snorted and tossed its head eager to be given free rein once more alypia ignored it she stared down the long roman column despair on her face so youve come to betray us too she cried glabrio stepped forward and seized the horses head scaurus said betray you with a training march the princess and the roman shared a long confusion filled look then alypia exclaimed oh phos be praised come at once then a band of assassins is attacking the pri vate chambers what marcus said foolishly but even as he was filling harry turtledove his lungs to order the legionaries forward he heard gaius phi lippus below battle stations forward at doubletime scaurus envied the senior centurions immunity to surprise shout gavras as you come he added let both sides know helps on the way the legionaries reached back over their shoulders for pila tugged swords free from brass scabbards gavras they roared the emperors horse whinnied in alarm and reared pulling free of quintus galbrios grasp alypia held her seat she could ride as befitted a onetime provincial nobles daugh ter though thorisins frightened charger would have been a handful for anyone she wheeled it and cantered forward at the romans head get back my lady marcus called to her when she would not he told off half a dozen men to hold her horse and keep her out of the fighting they ignored her protests and did as they were ordered nestled in the copse of cherry trees just now beginning to come into fragrant bloom the private imperial residence was a dwelling made for peace but its outer doors gaped open and before them a sentry lay unmoving in a pool of blood sur round the place marcus snapped maniples peeled off to right and left for all his hurry he was horribly afraid he had come too late but as he rushed toward the yawning doorway he heard fighting within its a rescue not revenge he yelled the legionaries cheered behind him gavras gavras an archer leaped out into the doorway and let fly close behind scaurus a roman clutched at his face then skidded down on his belly no time to see who had fallen nor could the videssian get off a second shot he threw his bow to one side and drew saber he must have known it was hopeless with hundreds of men thundering toward him he set his feet and waited none theless the tribune had a moment to admire his courage be fore their swords met then it was all automatic response thrust parry slash riposte parry thrust marcus felt his blade bite twisted his wrist to make sure it was a killing blow his foe groaned and slowly crumpled the romans spilled down the hallway their hobnailed ca ligae clattering on the mosaic floor the light streaming through the alabaster ceiling panels was pale and calm not the an emperor for the legion right sort of light at all to shine on battle and battle there had already been aplenty the corpses of sentries and eunuch ser vants sprawled together with those of their assailants the red tesserae of hunting mosaics were overlain by true bloods brighter crimson it spattered precious icons and portrait busts of avtokrators centuries forgotten marcus saw mizizios lying dead the eunuch had a sword in his hand and wore an ancient helmet of strange design loot from a videssian triumph of long ago he had been a quick thinker to clap it on his head but it had not saved him a great saber cut opened his belly and spilled his entrails out on the floor shouts and the pounding of axes against a barricaded door led the legionaries on they rounded a last corner only to be halted by a savage counterattack from the squadron of assas sins in the narrow corridor numbers were of scant advantage men pushed and cursed and struck gasping when they were hit the assassins captain was a burly man of about forty in a muchbattered chainmail shirt he carried a torch in his right hand and shouted through the door to thorisin your bully boys are here too late gavras youll be roast meat before they do you any good not so cried zeprin the red who was fighting in the first rank of legionaries he still blamed himself for mavrikios gavras death and would not let a second emperor weigh on his conscience the thickmuscled haloga flung his great war axe at the torchcarrier the throw was not good quarters were too close for that instead of one of the gleaming steel bits burying itself in the videssians chest it was the end of the axe handle that caught him in the pit of the stomach mail shirt or no he doubled over as if kicked by a steer the smok ing torch fell to the floor and went out snarling an oath one of the trapped attackers sprang at zeprin who stood for a second weaponless the haloga did not could not retreat he ducked under a furious slash came up to seize his foe and crush him against his armored chest the tendons stood out on his massive arms his oppo nents hands scrabbled uselessly at his back scaurus heard bones crack even through the din of combat zeprin threw the lifeless corpse aside at the same moment viridovix with an enormous two handed slash sent another assassins head springing from his harry turtledove shoulders the tribune could feel the enemys spirit drain away a quiet bit of murder was one thing but facing these berserkers was something else again nor were the romans themselves idle their shortswords stabbed past the vides sians defenses while their large scuta turned blow after blow gavras they shouted and pushed their foes back and back then the blocked door flew open and thorisin gavras and his four or five surviving guards charged at the enemys backs crying the romans the romans it was more gal lant than sensible but thorisin had an unvidessian fondness for battle some of the attackers spun round against him still trying to complete their mission gaius philippus cut one down from behind you bloody stupid bastard he said jerking his gla dius free marcus swore as a saber gashed his forearm he tightened his fingers on his sword hilt they all answered no tendon was cut but blood made the sword slippery in his hand thorisin killed the man he was facing the emperor not one to relish having to flee even before overpowering numbers fought now with savage ferocity to try to ease the discredit only he felt when he had been sevastokrator he probably would have let his fury run away with him but the imperial office was tempering him as it had his brother see ing only a handful of his assailants on their feet he cried take them alive ill have answers for this most of the assassins knowing what fate held for them battled all the harder trying to make the legionaries kill them outright one ran himself through but a couple were borne to the floor and trussed up like dressed carcasses so was their leader who still could hardly breathe let alone fight back very timely thorisin said looking marcus up and down he started to offer his hand to clasp stopped when he saw the tribunes wound scaurus did not really feel it yet he answered thank your niece not me she lathered your horse for you but i dont think youll complain the emperor smiled thinly no i suppose not took the beast did she he listened as the roman explained how he had encountered alypia thorisins smile grew wider he said i never have cared for her scribbling away behind closed doors but i wont com an emperor for the legion harry turtledove plain of that any more either she must have gone out the window when the bamey started and run for the stables fire foots usually saddled by dawn marcus remembered gavras fondness for a morning gallop thorisin prodded a dead body with his foot good thing these lice were too stupid to throw a cordon round the build ing he slapped scaurus on the back enough talk get that arm seen to youre losing blood the tribune tore a strip of cloth from the corpses surcoat gavras helped him tie the rude dressing his arm numb a few minutes before began to throb fiercely he went looking for gorgidas the doctor marcus thought with annoyance did not seem to be anywhere within the rambling imperial residence how ever much the legionaries outnumbered the twoscore or so assassins they had not beaten them down without harm to themselves five men were dead two of them irreplaceable romans and a good many more were wounded more or less severely grumbling and clenching his fist against the hurt the tribune went outside he saw gorgidas kneeling over a man in the pathway a roman from his armor but had no chance to approach the physician alypia gavra came rushing up to him is my uncle she began and then stopped unwilling even to complete the question unscratched thanks to you scaurus told her phos be thanked she whispered and then to the tri bunes glad confusion threw her arms round his neck and kissed him the legionaries who had kept her from the resi dence whooped at the sound she jerked away in alarm as if just realizing what she had done he reached out to her but reluctantly held back when he saw her shy away however brief her show of warmth pleased him more perhaps then he was ready to admit he told himself it was but pleasure at seeing her wounded spirit healing and knew he was lying youre hurt she exclaimed spying the oozing bandage for the first time its not too bad he opened and closed his hand to show her he could though the proof cost him some pain true to his stoic training he tried not to let it show on his face but the princess saw sweat spring out on his forehead get it looked at she said firmly seeming relieved to be able to give advice that was sensible and impersonal at the same time scaurus hesitated wishing this once for some of viridovix brass he did not have it and the moment passed anything he said would too likely be wrong he slowly walked over to gorgidas the doctor did not notice him he was still bent low over the fallen legionary his hands pressed against the soldiers face the attitude marcus realized of a videssian healerpriest the greeks shoulders quivered with the effort he was making live damn you live he said over and over in his native tongue but the legionary would never live again not with that greenfeathered arrow jutting up from between the doctors fingers marcus could not tell whether gorgidas had finally mastered the healing force nor did it matter now not even the videssians could raise the dead at last the greek felt scaurus presence he raised his head and the tribune gave back a pace from the grief and selftormenting impotent anger on his face its no use gorgidas said more to himself than to scaurus nothing is any use he sagged in defeat and his hands redblack with blood beginning to dry slid away from the dead mans face marcus suddenly forgot his wound jupiter best and greatest he said softly an oath he had not sworn since the days in his teens when he still believed in the gods quintus glabrio lay tumbled in death his features were already loos ening into the vacant mask of the dead the arrow stood just below his right eye and must have killed him instantly a fly lit on the notching felt the perch give under its weight and darted away let me see to that gorgidas said dully like an automa ton the tribune held out his arm the doctor washed the cut with a sponge soaked in vinegar stunned or no scaurus had all he could do to keep from crying out gorgidas pinned the gash closed snipping off the tip of each fibula as he pushed it through with his arm shrieking from the wound and the vine gar wash marcus hardly felt the pins go in tears began streaming down the greeks face as he dressed the cut he had to try three times before he could close the catch on the com plex te a that secured the end of the bandage are there more hurt he asked scaurus there must be yes a few the doctor turned to go marcus stopped him an emperor for the legion harry turtledove with his good arm im sorrier than i know how to tell you he said awkwardly to me he was a fine officer a good man and a friend but he broke off unsure how to continue ive known you know for all your discretion scaurus gorgidas said tiredly that doesnt matter any longer either does it now let me be about my business will you marcus still hesitated can i do anything to help the gods curse you roman youre a decent blockhead but a blockhead all the same there he lies all i hold dear in this worthless world and me with all my training and skill in healing the hurt and what good is it what can i do with it feel him grow cold under my hands he shook free of the tribune let me go and well see what miracles of medicine i work for these other poor sods he walked through the open doorway of the imperial resi dence a lean lonely man wearing anguish like a cloak what ails your healer alypia garva asked scaurus jumped lost in his own thoughts he had not heard her come up this is his close friend he said shortly nod ding at glabrio and mine as well hearing the rebuff the princess drew back marcus chose not to care the taste of triumph was bitter in his mouth lovely isnt it thorisin said to marcus late that after noon he was speaking ironically the little reception room in the imperial chambers had seen its share of fighting there was a sword cut in the upholstery of the couch on which the tribune sat horsehair stuffing leaked through it a bloodstain marred the marble floor the emperor went on when i set you over the cadasters outlander i thought you would be watching the penpushers but it seems you flushed a noble instead scaurus grew alert so they were onomagoulos men then the assassins had fought in grim silence for all the tribune knew ortaias sphrantzes might have hired them gavras though seemed to think he was being stupid of course theyre baanes i hardly needed to question them to find that out did i i dont understand scaurus said why else would that fornicating polluted poxridden son of a twocopper whore elissaios bouraphos have brought his bloody collection of boats back from pityos for a pleasure cruise phos light man hes not hiding out there you must have seen the galleys sails as you marched in this morning marcus felt his face grow warm i thought it was a grain convoy landsmen gavras muttered rolling his eyes it bloody well isnt as anyone with eyes in his head should know the plan was simple enough as soon as im dealt with across comes baanes to take over smooth as you like thorisin spat in vast contempt as if he could that bald pimple hasnt the wit to break wind and piddle at the same time and while he tries to murder me and i settle him who gains the yezda of course i wonder if hes not in their pay the emperor scaurus thought had a dangerous habit of underestimating his foes he had done so with the sphrantzai and now again with onomagoulos who loyal or not was a capable if arrogant soldier marcus started to warn gavras of that but remembered how the conversation had opened and asked instead why credit that seemed a safer word than blame me with baanes plot because you kept hounding him for kybistras tax roll there were things in it hed have done better not to write down ah marcus made an interested noise to draw the em peror out oh truly truly your friend nepos filled the assassins so fall of some potion of his that they spewed up everything they knew their captain skotos take him knew plenty too did you ever wonder why friend baanes did so careful a job of slitting throats when we were waylaid last year after the par ley ah marcus said again he jumped as several men in heavysoled boots tramped down the hallway but they were only workmen coming to set things to rights once more live long enough in videssos he thought and youll see murderers under every cushion but the day you dont theyll be there caught up in his own rekindled wrath thorisin did not notice the tribunes start he went on the dungfaced mid wifes mistake hired the knives himself and paid a premium for ortaias coin so no fingers would point his way even if something went wrong but he put everything down on parch ment so he could square himself with the sphrantzai if he did kill me and put it down on kybistras register why not he an emperor for the legion harry turtledove had the thing with him after all hed collected those taxes when he ran there after maragha after that he could hardly let you see it but he couldnt send a fake either now could he the emperor chuckled imagining his rivals discomfi ture scaurus laughed too videssian cadasters were invalid if they bore erasures or crossedover lines only fair copies went to the capital and once there they were festooned with seals of wax and lead and stamped with arcane bureaucratic stamps to which of course onomagoulos had no access once he was out in the provinces he must have niched it as soon as he found out i was going to look over the receipts the tribune decided very good gavras said making small clapping motions of sardonic applause marcus flush deepened there were times when the subtle videssians found his roman straight forwardness monstrously amusing even seemingly bluff blunt types like thorisin and onomagoulos proved as steeped in doubledealing as candied fruit in honey he sighed and spelled things out as much for himself as for the emperor a clerk even a logothete wouldnt have made much of some moneychanging probably figured he was lining his own purse and not worried much about it but he knew i was on that beach and he must have thought id connect things i recall the fuss he made about its being or taias money aye but id be lying if i said i was sure a few lines in a dull tax roll would have jogged my memory hed have been smarter letting things ride this time humorlessly thorisin chuckled again the ill doers conscience abandons the assurance of phos path he said quoting from the videssian holy books like a greek from homer he knew his guilt whether you did or not and if he is guilty then that means taron leimmokheir is innocent marcus said certainty blazed in him he could not keep all the triumph from his voice but did not think it mat tered there was such perfect logical clarity behind the idea surely no one could fail to see it but thorisin was frowning why are you obsessed by that graywhiskered traitor what boots is that he plotted with on omagoulos instead of ortaias he said curtly recognizing inflexibility when he heard it scaurus gave up again it would take more than logic to change gavras mind he was like a man with a writing tablet who pushed his stylus through the wax and permanently scarred the wood beneath buck up roman dear its a hero yare tonight not the spook of a dead corp the which wouldnt be invited to dinner at all at all viridovix said as they walked toward the hall of the nineteen couches he deliberately exaggerated his brogue to try to cheer up marcus but spoke videssian so helvis and his own three companions would understand crave pardon i didnt realize it showed so plainly the tribune murmured he had been thinking of glabrio helvis squeezed his left arm his right under its bandages he wished he could forget the smile he managed to produce felt ghastly from the inside but seemed to look good enough the ceremonies master a portly man not a eunuch for he wore a thick beard bowed several times in quick succes sion like a marionette on a string as the roman party came up to the halls polished bronze doors videssos is in your debt he said seizing marcus hand in his own pale moist palm and bowing again then he turned and cried to those already present lords and ladies the most valiant romans scaurus blinked and forgave him the limp handclasp the captain and epoptes scaurus and the lady helvis of namdalen that one was easy for the fellow worse chal lenges lay ahead viridovix son of drappes and his ah ladies the celts name was almost unprounceable for vi dessians the protocol chiefs brief pause conveyed his opinion of viridovix arrangement marcus suddenly groaned si lently by luck komitta rhangavve would be here tonight he had no time to say anything the ceremonies master was plowing ahead the senior centurion gaius philippusj the junior centurion junius blaesus blaesus was a longtime underofficer and a good soldier but scaurus knew he was hardly a replacement for quintus glabrio the underofficer minucius and his lady erene not the lady scaurus noted damned snob of a flunky minucius proud of his promotion had burnished his chain mail till it gleamed two more names completed the legionary party the na kharar gagik bagratouni detachmentleader among the romans zeprin the red haloga guardsman in roman ser vice despite persuasion gorgidas had chosen to be alone with his grief an emperor for the legion bagratouni too still mourned but time had dulled the cutting edge of his hurt the leonine vaspurakaner noble swept through the slimmer videssians as he made his way toward the wine scaurus saw his eyes moving this way and that no doubt bagratouni was very conscious of the figure he cut and of the ladies among whom he cut it the tribune and helvis drifted over to a table covered with trays of crushed ice on which reposed delicacies of various sons mostly from the ocean a dainty you wont see every day said an elderly civil servant pointing at a strip of oc topus meat the curled octopus you know with only one row of suckers on each arm splendid scaurus didnt know but took the meat it was chewy and vaguely seaflavored like all the other octopus hed ever eaten he wondered what the gastrophile beside him would have thought of such roman exotica as dormice in poppy seeds and honey a small orchestra played softly in the background flutes stringed instruments whose names he still mixed up and a tinkling clavichord helvis clapped her hands in delight thats the same rondo they were playing when we first met here she said do you remember the night naturally the what did you call it youd know i was lying if i said yes a lot had happened that evening not only had he met helvis though hemond had still been alive then of course but also alypia gavra and avshar for that matter as always he worried whenever he thought of the sorcererprince they drifted through separate crowds of bureaucrats sol diers and ambassadors exchanging small talk scaurus was unusual in having friends among all three groups the two imperial factions despised each other the videssian officers preferred the company of mercenaries they distrusted to the penpushers they loathed which merely confirmed their boor ishness in the civil servants eyes taso vones an imposingly tall videssian lady not plaki dia teletze on his arm bowed to the tribune where are you come from he asked with a twinkle in his eye how to shoe a heavy cavalry horse or the best way to compose a memorandum on a subject of no intrinsic worth the best way to do that is not to helvis said at once blasphemy my dear sealstampers burn people who ex harry turtledove press such thoughts but then i find cavalry horses no more inspiring with that attitude thought scaurus it was easy to see why vones held aloof from warriors and bureaucrats alike his sanctity phos patriarch balsamon the ceremonies master called and the feast paused for a respectful moment as the fat old man waddled into the chamber for all his graceless step he had a presence that filled it up he looked round then said with a smile and a mockrueful sigh ah if only you paid me such heed in the high tem ple he plucked a crystal wine goblet from its bed of ice and drained it with obvious enjoyment that man takes nothing seriously soteric said disap provingly though he did not shave the back of his head in usual island fashion helvis brother still looked very much the unassimilated namdalener in high tight trousers and short fur jacket marcus said its not like you to waste your time worrying over his failings after all hes a heretic to you is he not he grinned as his brotherinlaw fumbled for an answer the truth he thought was simple the videssian patriarch was too interesting a character for anyone to ignore servants began carrying the tables of hors doeuvres back to the kitchens and replacing them with dining tables and gilded chairs from previous banquets in the hall of the nine teen couches marcus knew that was a signal the emperor would be coming in soon he realized he needed to speak to balsamon before thorisin arrived what now my stormcrow friend the patriarch said as scaurus approached whenever you come up to me with that look of grim determination in your eye i know youve found your way into more trouble like alypia gavra balsamon had the knack of making the tribune feel transparent he tried to hide his annoyance and was sure balsamon saw that too more flustered than ever he launched into his tale leimmokheir eh balsamon said when he was done aye taron is a good man as far as scaurus could re member that was the first time hed heard the patriarch judge anyone so but balsamon went on what makes you think my intercession would be worth a moldy apple why marcus floundered if gavras wont listen to you an emperor for the legion harry turtledove he wont listen to anyone which will likely be the case hes a stubborn youngster the patriarch said perfectly at ease speaking thus of his sovereign his little black eyes still sharp in their folds of flesh measured the roman and well you know it too why keep flogging a dead mule i made a promise marcus said slowly unable to find a better answer before balsamon could reply the ceremonies master was crying out her majesty the princess alypia gavra the lady komitta rhangavve his imperial majesty the avtokrator of the videssians thorisin gavras men bowed low to show their respect for the emperor as the occasion was social rather than ceremonial no proskynesis was required women dropped curtsies thorisin bobbed his head amiably then called where are the guests of honor servitors rounded up the romans and their ladies and brought them to the emperor who presented them to the crowd for fresh applause komitta rhangavves eyes narrowed dangerously as they flicked from one of viridovix lemans to the next she looked very beautiful in a clinging skirt of flowerprinted linen marcus would sooner have taken a poisonous snake to bed viridovix did not seem to notice her glare but the celt was not happy either is something wrong the tribune asked as they walked toward the dining tables aye summat arigh tells me the videssians will be send ing an embassy to his clan theyre fain to hire mercenaries and the lad himself will be going with them to help persuade his folk to take service with the empire a halfyears journey and more it is and him the bonniest wight to drink with ive found in the city ill miss the little omadhaun beshrew me if i wont stewards seated the legionaries in accordance with their prominence of the evening marcus found himself at the right hand of the imperial party next to the princess alypia the emperor sat between her and komitta rhangavve who was on his left had she been his wife rather than mistress her place and the princess would have been reversed as it was she was next to viridovix an arrangement scaurus thought illomened unaware of anything amiss the gauls three longtime companions chattered among themselves excited by their highranking company the first course was a soup of onions and pork its broth delightfully delicate in flavor marcus spooned it down almost without tasting it waiting for the explosion on his left but komitta seemed to be practicing tact a virtue he had not as sociated with her he relaxed and enjoyed the last few spoon fuls of soup and and was sorry when a servant took the empty bowl away his goblet of wine now never disappeared whenever it was empty a steward would be there to fill it again from a shining silver carafe even if it was stickysweet videssian wine it dulled the ache in his arm little roasted partridge hens appeared stuffed with sauteed mushrooms balsamon who sat next to helvis at the tribunes right demolished his with an appetite that would have done credit to a man half his age he patted his ample belly saying to scaurus you can see ive gained it honestly alypia garva leaned toward the patriarch saying you would not be yourself without it as you know full well she spoke affectionately as to a favorite old uncle or grandfather balsamon rolled his eyes and winced pantomiming being cut to the quick respect is hard for a plump old fool like me to get youll note he said to helvis i should be mighty in my outrage like the patriarchs of old and be a prelate to terrify the heretic you are terrified i hope he added winking at her not in the least she answered promptly no more than you convince anyone when you play the buffoon balsamons eyes were still amused in a way but no longer merry you have some of your brothers terrible honesty in you he said and scaurus did not think it was altogether a compliment courses came and went lobster tails in drawn butter and capers rich pastries baked to resemble peahens eggs raisins figs and sweet dates mild and sharp cheeses peppery ground lamb wrapped in grape leaves roast goose sniffing the fa miliar cheese and cinnamon sauce marcus declined cab bage soup stewed pigeons with sausage and onions with of course appropriate wines for each scaurus arm seemed far away he felt the tip of his nose grow numb a sure sign he was getting drunk nor was he the only one the great count drax who wore videssianstyle robes unlike soteric and utprand was sing ing one of the fiftytwo scurrilous verses of the imperial an emperor for the legion armys marching song loudly accompanied by zeprin the red and mertikes zigabenos and viridovix had just broken up the left side of the imperial table with a story about marcus dug a finger in his ear trying not to believe he was hearing the celts effrontery a man with four wives thorisin roared out laughter with the rest stopping only to wipe his eyes i thank your honor viridovix said komitta rhangavve was not laughing her long slim fingers nails painted the color of blood looked uncommonly like claws dessert was fetched in a light one after the great feast crushed ice from the imperial cold cellars flavored with sweet syrups a favorite winter treat it was hard to come by in the warmer seasons the emperor rose a signal for everyone else to do the same servants began clearing away the mountains of dirty dishes and bowls but even if the food was gone wine and talk still flowed freely perhaps indeed more so than before dinner balsamon took thorisin gavras to one side and began speaking urgently marcus could not hear what the patriarch was saying but thorisins growled answer was loud enough to turn heads not you too no ive said a hundred times now its a hundred and one rather muzzily the tribune wished he could disappear it did not look as though taron leimmokheir would see the outside of his dungeon any time soon as the guests decided no further trouble was coming on the heels of gavras outburst the level of conversation picked up again soteric came over to tell helvis some news of namda len hed got from one of drax aides what bedard wood tooth become count of nustad on the mainland i dont believe it she said excuse me darling i have to hear this with my own ears and she was gone with her brother ex claiming excitedly in the island dialect left to his own devices the tribune took another drink after enough rounds he decided videssian wine tasted fine the interior of the hall of the nineteen couches though wanted to spin whenever he moved his head pisspot that was komitta rhangavves wildcat screech aimed at viridovix the son of a pimp in your joke would be no good to any of his wives after he had his ballocks cut off him she threw what was left in her goblet in the harry turtledove celts face and smashed the cut crystal on the floor then she spun and stamped out of the hall every step echoing in the startled silence what was that in aid of the emperor asked staring at her retreating back he had been talking with drax and ziga benos and like scaurus missed the beginning of the scene red wine was dripping from viridovixs mustaches but he had lost none of his aplomb och the lady decided shed be after taking offense at the little yam i told at table he said easily a servitor brought him a damp towel he ran it over his face i wish she had done it sooner as is im left wearing no better than the dregs thorisin snorted reassured by the celts glib reply and by what he knew of komittas fiery temper which was plenty all right then lets hope this is more to your taste he beckoned a waiter to his side and gave the man his own goblet to take to viridovix people murmured at the favor shown the gaul the room relaxed once more gaius philippus caught marcus eye from across the hall and hiked his shoulders up and down in an exaggerated sigh of relief the tribune nodded for a moment hed been fright ened nearly sober he wondered just how much he had drunk too much from the pounding ache that was beginning behind his eyes helvis was still deep in conversation with a couple of namdalener officers the dining hall suddenly seemed intolerably noisy crowded and hot marcus weaved toward the doors maybe the fresh air outside would clear his head the ceremonies master bowed as he made his way into the night he nodded back then regretted it any motion was enough to give his headache new fuel he sucked in the cool nighttime air gratefully it felt sweeter than any wine he went down the stairs with a drunken mans caution the music and the buzz of talk receded behind him nor was he sorry to hear them fade even the tree frogs piping in the nearby citrus groves grated on his ears he sighed already wincing from tomorrows hangover he peered up at the stars hoping their calm changelessness might bring him some relief the night was clear and moon less but the heavens still were not at their best videssos lights and the smoke rising from countless hearths and fire places veiled the dimmer stars away an emperor for the legion he wandered aimlessly for a couple of minutes his hob nailed caligae clicking on the flagstone path and then silent as they bit into grass an abrupt intake of breath made him real ize he was not alone who the he said groping for his sword hilt visions of assassins flashed through his head a landing party from bouraphos ships out there perhaps steal ing up on the hall of the nineteen couches im not a band of hired killers alypia gavra said and scaurus heard the sardonic edge that colored so much of her speech his hand jerked away from the scabbard as if it had be come redhot your pardon my lady he stammered you surprised me i came out for a breath of air as did i some little while ago and found i preferred the quiet to the brabble back there you may share it with me if you like still feeling foolish the tribune approached her he could hear the noise from the dining hall but at a distance it was bearable the light that streamed through the halls wide win dows was pale too the princess beside him little more than a silhouette he took parade rest unconsciously a relaxed stance from which to savor the night after they stood a while in silence alypia turned to him her face musing you are a strange man marcus aemilius scaurus she said finally her videssian accent making the sonorous sounds of his full name somehow musical i am never quite sure what you are thinking no scaurus said surprised again its always seemed to me you could read me like a signboard if it sets your mind at ease not so you fall into no neat category youre no arrogant noble from the provinces all horsesweat and iron nor yet one of the soclever seal stampers who would sooner die than call something by its right name and you hardly make an ordinary mercenary cap tain theres not enough wrecker in you so outlander what are you she studied him as if trying to pull the secret from his eyes the question he knew demanded an honest answer he wished his wits were clearer to give her one a survivor he said at last ah she said very low more an exhalation than a word no wonder we seem to understand each other then harry turtledove do we he wondered but his arms folded round her as her face tilted up she felt slim almost boyish under his hands the more so because he was used to helvis opulent curves but her mouth and tongue were sweet against his for a couple of heart beats until she gave a smothered gasp and wrenched herself away alarmed marcus tried to flog his brain toward an apology but her sad weary gesture stopped him before he could begin the fault is not yours blame times now gone she said casting about for a circumlocution no matter what i wish to feel there are memories i cannot set aside so easily the tribune felt his hands bunch into fists not the least of avshars crimes he thought once more was the easy death he gave vardanes sphrantzes he reached out to touch her cheek it was wet against his hand she started to flinch again but sensed the gesture was as much one of understanding as a caress her wounded strength the mix of vulnerability and composure in her drew him powerfully it was all he could do to stand steady yet however much he wanted to take her in his arms he was sure he would frighten her away forever if he did she said when i was a painted harlot you showed me a way to bear what i had been but because of what i was then i can have no gift for you now life is a tangled skein is it not her laugh was small and shaky that you are here and healing is gift enough scaurus replied he did not say he thought he might be too drunk to do a woman justice in any case but that was one thought alypia missed her drawn fea tures softened she leaned forward to kiss him gently youd best go back she said after all you are the guest of honor i suppose so the tribune had nearly forgotten the ban quet alypia stayed beside him no more than a second before drawing back go on she said again reluctantly marcus started back toward the hall of the nineteen couches when he turned round for a last look at alypia she was already gone a trace of motion among the trees might or might not have been her slipping toward an emperor for the legion the imperial residence the tribune trudged on his head whirling with wine and thought he knew most mercenaries if offered a chance at an impe rial connection would cut any ties that stood in the way drax would instantly he thought the man who was too adaptable by half what was the nickname that athenian had earned during the peloponnesian war the stage boot that was it because he fit on either foot but scaurus could not find it in himself to imitate the great count for all the attraction and fondness he felt for alypia gavra he was not ready to cast helvis aside they both some times strained at the bond between them but despite quarrels and differences it would not break nor most of the time did he want it to then too there was dosti we missed you my lord the ceremonies master said with another low bow as marcus stumbled back into the hall the roman hardly heard for a man who called himself a survivor he thought he had an uncommon gift for complicat ing his life xi phos blast that insolent treacher bouraphos into a thousand pieces and roast every one of them over a dung fire thorisin gavras burst out the emperor stood on videssos sea wall watching one of his galleys sink two more fled back to the city closely pursued by the rebel drangarios ships heads bobbed in the water of the cattlecrossing as sailors from the stricken vessel snatched at spars or swam toward videssos and safety not all would reach it tiny in the distance black fins angled toward them gavras ran an irritable hand through his hair ruffled by the sea breeze and why have i no admirals with the sense not to piss into the wind he grated a twoyearold in the bath house sails his toy boat with more finesse than those bullheads showed along with the other officers by the emperor scaurus did his best to keep his face straight he understood thorisins frustration onomagoulos on the western shore of the cattle crossing led an army far weaker than the one gavras had mustered against it what did it matter though when the em peror could not come to grips with his foe now if you had some ships from tduchy utprand dagobers son began but thorisins glare stopped even the bluntspoken namdalener in midsentence drax looked at his countryman as if at a dullard everyone knew the emperor suspected the islanders his eye seemed to say and to ask what the point was of antagonizing him without need cross as a baited bear gavras swung round on marcus i an emperor for the legion suppose youll be after me next telling me to turn leimmo kheir loose why no your majesty not at all the tribune said inno cently if you were going to listen to me you would have done that long since he scratched at his arm it itched fiercely still it was healing well enough that gorgidas had pulled the pins from it the day before the feel of the metal sliding through his flesh though not painful had been unpleasant enough to make him shudder at the memory bah thorisin turned his gaze out to the cattlecrossing again only scattered timbers showed where his warship had sunk bouraphos vessels were already resuming their patrol as if continuing an argument the emperor said what would it gain me to let him go hed surely turn against me now after being shut up all these months unexpectedly mertikes zigabenos spoke up for leimmo kheir the guards officer had come to admire the older sailor who showed repeatedly while the sphrantzai held videssos how a good man could keep his honor under a wicked regime zigabenos said if he grants you an ath of loyalty he will keep it no matter what you say sir taron leimmokheir would not forswear himself he fears the ice too much for that and besides marcus said thrusting home with a plea sure for which he felt no guilt at all whats the difference if he does betray you youd still be outadmiraled and hardly worse off whereas he fell silent leaving thorisin to work the contrary chain of logic for himself the emperor still in his foul mood only grunted but his hand tugged thoughtfully at his beard and he did not fly into a rage at the very notion of releasing leimmokheir his will was granite thought the tribune but even granite crumbles in the end so you think hell let him go helvis said that evening after scaurus recounted the days events one for you then i suppose so unless he does turn his coat once hes free that would drop the chamber pot into the stew for fair i dont think it will happen leimmokheir is honest helvis said seriously marcus respected her opinion she had been in videssos years longer than he and knew a good deal harry turtledove about its leaders moreover what she said confirmed every one elses view of the jailed admiral except the emperors but when he tried to draw her out further she did not seem interested in matters political which was unlike her is any thing wrong he asked at last he wondered if she had some how guessed the attraction growing between himself and alypia gavra and dreaded the scene that would cause instead she put down the skirt whose hem she had been mending and smiled at the tribune he thought he should know that look there was a mischievous something in her eyes he had seen before he placed it just as she spoke im sorry darling my wits were somewhere else i was trying to reckon when the baby will be due as near as i can make it it should be a little before the festival of sunturning marcus was silent so long her sparkle disappeared arent you pleased she asked sharply of course i am he answered and was telling the truth too many upperclass romans were childless by choice be loved only by inheritance seekers you took me by surprise is all he walked over and kissed her then poked her in the ribs she yelped you like taking me by surprise that way he accused you did when you were expecting dosti too as if the mention of his name was some kind of charm the baby woke up and started to cry helvis made a wry face she got up and unswaddled him are you wet or do you just want to be cuddled she demanded it proved to be the latter in a few minutes dosti was asleep again that doesnt happen as often as it used to marcus said he sighed i suppose ill have to get used to waking up five times a night again why dont you arrange to have a three yearold and save us the fuss that earned him a return poke he hugged her careful both of her pregnancy and his own tender arm she helped him draw the blouse off over her head yet even when they lay together naked on the sleepingmat the tribune saw alypia gavras face in his mind remembered the feel of her lips only then did he understand why he had paused before showing gladness at helvis news he realized something else too and chuckled under his breath what is it dear she asked touching his cheek nothing really just a foolish notion she made an in quisitive noise but he did not explain further there was no an emperor for the legion way he thought to tell her that now he understood why she slipped every so often and called him by her former lovers name lets have a look at that gorgidas ordered the next morning marcus mimed a salute and extended his arm to the doctor it was anything but pretty the edges of the gash were still raised and red and it was filled with crusty brown scab but the greek grunted in satisfaction at what he saw and again when he sniffed the wound theres no corruption in there he told the tribune your flesh knits well that lotion of yours does good work for all its bite gorgidas had dosed the cut with a murky brown fluid he called barbarum a compound of powdered verdigris litharge alum pitch and resin mixed in equal parts of vinegar and oil the roman had winced every time it was applied but it kept a wound from going bad gorgidas merely grunted again unmoved by the praise nothing had moved him much not since quintus glabrio fell now he changed the subject asking do you know when the emperor intends to send his embassy to the arshaum no time soon not with bouraphos ships out there to sink anything that sticks its nose out of the citys harbors why the greek studied him bleakly marcus saw how haggard he had become his slimness now gaunt his hair ragged where he had chopped a lock away in mourning for glabrio why gorgidas echoed nothing simpler i intend to go with it he set his jaw meeting scaurus stare without flinching you cant was the tribunes first startled response and why not how do you propose to stop me the doctors voice was dangerously calm i can order you to stay can you in law that would be a pretty point for the barristers back in rome i am attached to the legions aye but am i of them i think not any more than a sutler or a town bootmaker who serves at contract but thats neither here nor there unless you choose to chain me i will not obey your order but why marcus said helplessly he had no intention of putting gorgidas in irons that the greek was his friend counted for less than his certainty that gorgidas was stubborn enough not to serve if made to remain against his will harry turtledove the why is simple enough i plan to add an excursus on the tribes and customs of the arshaum to my history and i need more information than arigh can or cares to give me ethnography i think is something i can hope to do a proper job of his bitterness gave scaurus the key he needed you think medicine is not what of all of us youve healed some a dozen times what of this he held his wounded arm out to the physician what of it its still a bloody mess if you want to know in his wretchedness and selfdisgust gorgidas could not see the successes his skill had won a videssian healer would have put it right in minutes instead of this week and a halfs worth of worry over seeing if it chooses to fester if he could do anything at all marcus retorted some hurts they cant cure and the power drains from them if they use it long but you always give your best a poor miserable best it is too with my best minucius would be dead now and publius flaccus and cotilius rufus after maragha and how many more youre a clodhopper to reckon me a doctor when i cant so much as learn the art that gave them life the greeks eyes were haunted and i cant we saw that didnt we so youll hie yourself off to the steppe then and forget even trying gorgidas winced but he said you cant shame me into staying either scaurus the tribune flushed angry he was so obvious the greek went on in rome i wasnt a bad physician but here im hardly more than a joke if i have some small talent at history perhaps i can leave something worthwhile with that truly marcus he said and scaurus was touched for the doctor had not used his praenomen before all of you would be better off with a healerpriest to mend you youve suffered my fumblings long enough clearly nothing ordinary would change gorgidas mind casting about for any straw marcus exclaimed but if you leave us who will viridovix have to argue with now that one strikes close to the clout gorgidas admit ted surprised into smiling for all his bluster ill miss the redmaned bandit its still no hit though as long as he has gaius philippus hell never go short a quarrel an emperor for the legion defeated scaurus threw his hands in the air be it so then but for the first time im glad bouraphos joined the rebels not only does that force you to stay with us longer it also gives you more time to come to your senses i dont think ive left them i might well have gone even if things were otherwise the greek paused tossed his head uselessness is not a pleasant feeling he rose now if youll excuse me gawtruz has promised to tell me of his peoples legends of how they overran thatagush a compari son with the accounts by videssian historians should prove fascinating dont you think whatever marcus answer was he did not wait to hear it the tribune stood at stiff attention below and to the right of the great imperial throne for this ceremony he did not enjoy the place of honor balsamon the patriarch was a pace closer to the seated emperor somehow videssos chief pre late contrived to look rumpled in vestments of blue silk and clothofgold his pepperandsalt beard poured down in a dis orderly stream over the seed pearls adorning the breast of his chasuble at the emperors left side stood alypia gavra her costume as somber as protocol would permit scaurus had not seen her save at a distance since the feast two weeks before twice he had requested an audience and twice got no reply he was almost afraid to meet her eye but her nod as they assembled in the throne room had been reassuring with no official status komitta rhangavve was relegated to the courtiers who filed in to flank the long central colon nade in that sea of plump bland faces her lean hard beauty was like a falcons feral grace among so many pigeons at the sight of the roman her eyes darted about to see if viridovix was present marcus was glad he was not an expectant hush filled the chamber the grand gates closed after the functionaries entrance swung slowly open once more to reveal a single man silhouetted against the brightness outside his long rolling strides seemed alien to that place of gliding eunuchs and softfooted officials taron leimmokheir wore fresh robes but they hung loose ly about his prisonthinned frame nor had his release robbed him of the pallor given by long months hidden from sun and sky his hair and beard while clean were still un ham turtledove trimmed scaurus heard he had refused a barber his words were let gavras see me as he had me the tribune won dered what else leimmokheir might refuse so far as he knew no bargains had been struck the exadmiral came up to the imperial throne then paused looking thorisin full in the face in videssian court etiquette it was the height of rudeness marcus heard torches crackle in the silence enveloping the courtroom then with deliberation and utmost dignity leimmokheir slowly pros trated himself before his soverign get up get up thorisin said impatiently not the words of formula but the court ministers had already despaired of changing that leimmokheir rose looking as if every word tasted bad to him the emperor continued know you are pardoned of the charge of conspiracy against our person and that all properties and rights previously deemed forfeit are restored to you there was a sigh of outdrawn breath from the courtiers leimmokheir began a second proskynesis thorisin stopped him with a gesture now we come down to it he said sounding more like a merchant in a hard bargain than avtokrator of the videssians leimmokheir leaned forward too does it please you to serve me as my drungarios of the fleet against bouraphos and onomagoulos marcus noted that the first person plural of the pardon had disappeared why you and not them prison had not cost leimmo kheir his forthrightness scaurus saw courtiers blanched ap palled at the plain speech the emperor though looked pleased his answer was equally direct because i am not a man who hires mur derers no instead you throw people into jail the fat ceremo nies master who stood among the high dignitaries seemed ready to faint thorisin sat stonyfaced his arms folded wait ing for a real reply at last leimmokheir dipped his head his unkempt gray locks flopped over his face excellent thorisin breathed now with the air of a gam bler after throwing the suns he nodded to balsamon the patriarch will keep your oath of allegiance he fairly purred to a man of taron leimmokheirs religious scruples that oath would be binding as iron shackles an emperor for the legion balsamon stepped forward producing a small copy of the videssian scriptures from a fold of his robe but the drun garios waved him away his seamans voice used to overcom ing storm winds filled the throne room no gavras i swear no oaths to you for a moment everyone froze the emperors eyes went hard and cold what then leimmokheir he asked and danger rode his words should your sayso be enough for me he intended sarcasm but the admiral took him at face value yes by phos or whats your pardon worth ill be your man but not your hound if you dont trust me without a spiked collar of words round my neck send me back to the jug and be damned to you and he waited in turn his pride proof against whatever the emperor chose a slow flush climbed thorisins cheeks his bodyguards hands tightened on their spears there had been avtokrators and not a few of them who would have answered such defiance with blood in his years balsamon had seen more than one of that stripe he said urgently your majesty may i no thorisin cut him off with a single harsh word marcus realized again the overwhelming power behind the videssian imperial office in its formal setting in chambers balsamon would have rolled his eyes and kept on arguing now bowing he fell silent only leimmokheir remained un cowed drawing strength from what he had already endured the emperor still bore him no liking but grudging respect slowly replaced the anger on his face all right then he wasted no time with threats or warnings it was clear they meant nothing to me reinstated admiral leimmokheir as abrupt as gavras bowed and turned to go where arc you away so fast thorisin demanded suspi cious afresh the docks of course where else would you have your drungarios go leimmokheir neither looked back nor broke stride if he could have slammed the grand gates behind him scaurus thought he would have done that too between them the stubborn admiral and equally strongwilled emperor had managed to turn videssian ceremonial on its ear the assembled courtiers shook their heads as they trooped from the throne room remembering betterrun spectacles harry turtledove dont you just wander off thorisin said to the tribune as he started to follow them out i have a job in mind for you sire and spare me that innocent blueeyed gaze the emperor growled for all the wenches it charms it goes for nothing with me marcus saw the comer of alypia gavras mouth twitch but she did not look at him her uncle went on you were the one who wanted that graybearded puritan loose so you can keep an eye on him if he so much as breathes hard i expect to hear about it dyou understand me aye the roman had half expected that order just aye gavras glared at him balked of the chance to vent his anger further go on take yourself off then as marcus walked back to the legionaries barracks aly pia gavra caught him up i have to ask your pardon she said it was wrong of me to pretend i never got your requests to see me the situation was unusual the tribune replied he could not speak as freely as he would have liked the path was busy more than one head turned at the sight of a mercenary captain even one of the prominence scaurus had won walk ing side by side with the avtokrator of the videssians niece to say the least alypia raised one eyebrow she too used phrases with many meanings marcus wondered if she had deliberately chosen to meet him in public to keep things between them as impersonal as possible i hope he said carefully you dont feel i was ah tak ing undue advantage of the situation she gave him a steady look there are many benefits an officer with an eye for the main chance might gain some thing i might add i am as capable of seeing as any officer of that stripe that is the main reason i hesitated so long i never believed here alypia laid her hand on her left breast you were such a man it is though something one considers she cocked her head still studying him the main reason what of your young son what of the family youve made since you came to videssos at the banquet you seemed well content with your lady scaurus bit his lip it was chastening to hear his own thoughts come back at him from the princess mouth and an emperor for the legion you claimed to have trouble reading me he said embar rassed out of indirection for the first time alypia smiled she made as if to put her hand on his arm but stopped remembering better than he where they were she said quietly were those thoughts not there to read the ah situation her mockery of the tri bunes earlier pause was gentle would never have arisen the path divided we go different ways now i think she said and turned toward the flowering cherries that concealed the imperial residence aye for a while marcus answered but only to himself look what gavras gives me to work with taron leim mokheir shouted why didnt he tell me to go hang myself from a yardarm while i was about it he answered his own question he thought my weightd break it and he was right he looked disgustedly about the neorhesian harbor the capitals great northern anchorage was not a part of the city scaurus knew well the romans had patrolled near the harbor of kontoskalion on videssos southfacing coast and had also embarked on campaign against the yezda from there but kontoskalion was a toy port next to the neorhesian har bor named for the longdead city prefect who had supervised its building there were ships aplenty at the docks jutting out into the videssian sea a veritable forest of masts but all too many of them belonged to fat sluggish trading ships and tiny fishing craft like the one marcus had sailed on when thorisins forces sneaked over the cattlecrossing these by now rode high in the water their cargoes long since unloaded they were trapped in videssos by elissaios bouraphos outside as had been only proper then bouraphos had taken the heart of the empires war fleet when he sailed for pityos and kept it when he joined onomagoulos in rebellion leimmokheir had precious little left ten or so triremes and perhaps a dozen smaller twobanked ships like the ones the tribune knew as libumians he was outnumbered almost three to one and bouraphos also had the better captains and crews whats to do marcus asked worried the drungarios thought the task beyond him after his outburst leimmokheir was staring out to sea not at the choppy little waves dancing harry turtledove inside the breakwater but beyond to the vast sweep of empty horizon the admiral did not seem to hear him for a moment he slowly came back to himself hmm phos light i truly dont know left here with the lees to drink wait and watch for a bit i expect until i understand how things have gone since i was taken off the board ive come back facing a new direction and everything looks strange in the videssian board game captured pieces could be used against their original owners and change sides several times in the course of a game it was scaurus thought a game very much in its makers image seeing the roman troubled by his answer leimmokheir slapped him on the shoulder never lose hope he said seri ously the namdaleni are heretics who imperil their souls with their belief but they have the right of that no matter how bad the storm looks it has to end sometime skotos lays despair before men as a snare he was the living proof of his own philosophy scaurus thought his imprisonment had dropped from him as if it had never been but the tribune noted he had still not answered the question the last clear notes of the pandoura faded inside the roman barracks applause a storm of it followed swiftly senpat sviodo laid aside his stringed instrument a smile of pleasure on his handsome swarthy face he lifted a mug of wine in salute to his audience that was marvelous helvis said you made me see the mountains of vaspurakan plain as if they stood before me phos gave you a great gift were you not a soldier your music would soon make you rich curious you should say that he answered sheepishly back in my teens i thought about running off with a troupe of strummers who were playing at my fathers holding why didnt you he found out and stropped his belt on my backside he had the right of it phos rest him i was needed there even then the yezda were thick as tax collectors round a man whos dug up treasure and had i gone look what i would have missed he slid his arm round nevrat beside him the bright ribbons streaming from his threepeaked vaspurakaner z an emperor for the legion cap tickled her neck she brushed them away as she snuggled closer to her husband marcus sipped from his own wine cup he had nearly for gotten what good company the two young westerners made not just for senpats music but for the gusto and good cheer with which he indeed both of them faced life and they were so obviously pleased with each other as to make every couple around them happier simply by their presence where is your friend with the mustaches like melted bronze nevrat asked the tribune he has a fine voice i was hoping to hear him sing with senpat tonight even if videssian songs are the only ones they both understand little bird with a yellow bill gaius philippus began his baritone raucous nevrat winced and threw a walnut at him ever alert he caught it out of the air then cracked it with the pommel of his dagger the distraction did not make her forget her question she quirked an eyebrow at scaurus he said lamely there was some business or other he said he had to attend to i dont know just what but i can make a fair guess he thought nevrats other eyebrow went up when she saw him hesi tate unlike most videssian women she did not pluck them to make them finer but they did nothing to mar her strong featured beauty in this case marcus was immune to such blandishments he wished he had no part of viridovix secret and would not spread it further nevrat turned to helvis youre a big girl dear you should do more than pick at your food said in a different tone the words could have rankled but nevrat was obviously concerned helvis answering smile was a trifle wan theredjust be more for me to give back tomor row morning nevrat looked blank for a moment then hugged her con gratulations senpat said pumping marcus hand what is it the thought of going west that makes you randy thisll be twice now oh more than that helvis said with a sidelong glance at the tribune when the laughter subsided senpat grew serious you romans will be going west not so ive heard nothing either way scaurus said for now harry turtledove no one goes anywhere much not with bouraphos at the cat tlecrossing why should it matter to you youve been de tached from us for months now instead of answering directly senpat exchanged a few sen tences in guttural vaspurakaner with gagik bagratouni the nakharars reply was almost a growl several of his country men nodded vehemently one pounded his fist on his knee i would rejoin if youll have me the younger noble said giving his attention back to scaurus when you go west youll do more than fight rebels inside the empire the yezda are there too and i owe them a debt his merry eyes grew grim and i nevrat added having seen her riding alone through them after maragha and in the press when the legion aries fought drax men marcus knew she meant exactly what she said you both know the answer is yes whether or not we move the tribune said how could i say otherwise to sea soned warriors and bold scouts who are also my friends senpat sviodo thanked him with unwonted seriousness still caught up in his own thoughts bagratouni said hun grily and also zemarkhos there is his men nodded again they had more cause to hate the fanatic priest than even the nomads likely their chance for revenge would come too if the legionaries went west on the way to maragha thorisin had mocked zemarkhos and so the zealot acknowledged on omagoulos as his avtokrator his followers helped swell the provincial nobles forces the hall grew silent for a moment the romans were loyal to the state for which they fought but it was a mercenarys loyalty ultimately shallow they did not share or fully under stand the decades of war and pogrom which tempered the vaspurakaners as repeated quenchings did steel the men who styled themselves princes rarely showed that hardness when they did it was enough to chill their lesscommitted comrades out on the darkness senpat sviodo cried feeling the mood of the evening start to slide its skotos tool nothing else he turned to gaius philippus so you romans know the little bird do you his fingers danced over the pandouras an emperor for the legion strings the legionaries roared out the marching song glad to be distracted from their own thoughts are you well taron marcus asked you look as if you hadnt slept in a week near enough leimmokheir allowed punctuating his words with an enormous yawn his eyes were redtracked his gravelly voice hoarser than usual the flesh he had begun gaining back after his release looked slack and unhealthy its a wearing task trying to do the impossible even his once booming laugh seemed hollow not enough ships not enough crews not enough money not enough time he ticked them off on his fingers one by one outlander you have gavras ear make him understand im no mage to conjure up victory with a wave of my hand and do a good job too or well be in cells side by side scaurus took that as mere downheartedness on the admi rals part but leimmokheir grew so insistent the tribune de cided to try to meet with the emperor exhaustion had made the drungarios of the fleet irritable and unable to see any viewpoint but his own as luck would have it the tribune was admitted to the imperial presence after only a short wait when he spoke of leimmokheirs complaints thorisin snapped what does he want anchovies to go with his wine any fool can handle the easy jobs its the hard ones that show what a mans made of a messenger came up to the throne paused uncertainly well gavras said recognized the man went down in full proskynesis when he rose he handed the avtokrator a folded leaf of parchment your pardon your majesty the runner who delivered this said it was of the utmost urgency that you read it at once all right all right youve given it me the emperor opened the sheet softly read aloud to himself come to the sea wall and leam what your trust has gained you l drun garios commanding his color deepened at every word he tore the sheet in half then turned on scaurus shouting phos curse the day i heeded your poisoned tongue hear the braggart boasting as he turns his coat zigabenos gavras bellowed and when the guards of ficer appeared the emperor profanely ordered him to send harry turtledove troops hotfoot to the docks to stop leimmokheir if they could he grated itll be too bloody late but we have to try the fury he radiated was so great marcus stepped back when he rose from the throne afraid thorisin was about to attack him instead gavras issued a curt command come along sirrah if i must watch the fruit of your folly you can be there too the emperor swept down the aisleway an aghast scaurus in his wake everything the roman had believed of leim mokheir looked to be a tissue of lies it was worse than be trayal it spoke of a blindness on his part humiliating to contemplate courtiers scurried out of gavras path none daring to re mind him of business still unfinished swearing under his breath he stalked through the grounds of the palace com pound he mounted the steps of the sea wall like an unjustly condemned man on his way to the executioner he did not so much as look at scaurus what he saw when he peered over the gray stone battle ments ripped a fresh cry of outrage from him the pimps spawn has stolen the whole fleet sails furled the triremes and lighter twobanked warships were rowing west from the neorhesian harbor sea foam clotted whitely round their oars at every stroke marcus heart sank further he had not known it could and look the emperor said pointing to the suburban harbor on the far shore of the cattlecrossing here comes that cowfuttering bouraphos out to escort him home the rebel admirals ships grew swiftly larger as they approached thorisin shook his fist at them boots rang on the stairway a swearing trooper trotted up to the emperor he panted we were too late your majesty leimmokheir sailed really gavras snarled the soldiers eyes went wide as they followed his outflung arm leimmokheirs ships shook themselves out into a line fac ing the rebels his heavier galleys in the center with the libur nians on either wing even in an element not his own marcus knew a tactical maneuver when he saw one thats a battle formation he exclaimed by phos it is thorisin said acknowledging his pres ence for the first time what boots it though treacher or an emperor for the legion zany your precious friend will wreck me either way boura phosll toy with him like a cat with a grasshopper look at the ships he has with him whether or not gavras thought leimmokheir a turncoat plainly elissaios bouraphos did not his entire fleet was there to form a line of battle its horns sweeping forward to flank the smaller force it faced the curses thorisin had called down on leimmokheirs head he now switched to bouraphos zigabenos messenger listened admiringly marcus scarcely heard the emperor watching a fight in which he could take no part was worse than combat itself he i discovered in the handtohand there was no time to reflect now he could do nothing else his nails bit into his palms as he watched the rowers on both sides step up the stroke their ships leaped at one another the tribune wondered if leim mokheir had in fact gone mad if the egotism that seemed to lurk in every videssians soul deluded him into thinking his powers godlike the fleets were less than a furlong apart when one of bouraphos twobanked craft swerved inward to ram the tri reme next to it square amidships the heavier galley taken utterly by surprise was ruined oars snapped faint over the water marcus heard screams as rowers arms were wrenched from their sockets water gushed into the great hole torn in the triremes side almost with dignity the stricken ship began to settle the libumian backed oars and sought another victim as if the first treacherous attack had been a signal a score and more of the rebel admirals ships turned on their comrades throwing bouraphos line into confusion no longer sure who was friend and who foe ships still loyal lost momentum as their captains looked nervously to either side and into the chaos drove taron leimmokheir on the sea wall thorisin gavras did three steps of a jig see how it feels you bastard he screamed to bouraphos see how it feels scaurus abruptly understood leimmo kheirs sleepless nights the drungarios had been sowing this field for many days and come to harvest it now that it was ripe but for all the sowing the sea fight was far from won even with his suddenly revealed recruits leimmokheir was still outnumbered and elissaios bouraphos a resourceful corn harry turtledove mander it was his ships though that were pressed back into a circle with leimmokheirs prowling round them and when he tried to strike outward a galley of his that had bided its time drew in its starboard oars and sheared away its neighbors portside bank with its projecting bulkheads the crippled ship wallowed helplessly its conqueror joined the enemy boura phos attacking squadron daunted pulled back to add to the disorder both sides flew the imperial pennant with its central sun tiny in the distance marcus saw another banner at a triremes bow this one scarlet barred with gold the emblem of the drungarios of the fleet bouraphos must have decided the only way out of his predicament was to kill his rival admiral for four of his own galleys surged toward leimmokheirs sinking a libumian as they came no ships were close by to help the drungarios trireme spun in the water backing oars to port while pulling ahead on the starboard side it turned almost in its own length and sped away from the attackers some of leimmokheirs fleet might not be perfectly trained but he tolerated no slackness on his flagship the wake foamed up under the galleys bow it was driving almost straight back toward scaurus past the slowly settling hulk of the first trireme sunk when bouraphos ships began changing sides one after the others the rebels gave chase skotos and his demons take them theyre gaining thor isin said his hands clutching the battlements until knuckles whitened where minutes before he had been ready to dip leimmokheir an inch at a time into boiling oil now he was in an agony of suspense lest the drungarios come to harm but leimmokheir knew what he was about even at a range of more than a quarter of a mile his mane of graywhite hair made him recognizable his arm came down to empha size an order twisting like a snake the trireme darted round the sinking galley and rammed its leading pursuer before the startled rebels could maneuver bouraphos other three ships stopped dead in the water as if leimmokheir had shown him self to be a dangerous wizard as well as a seaman his daring put new heart into his fleet and seemed to be the blow that broke his foes in a desperate charge across the water about twenty of them broke through his line but all fight was out of them they fled toward the suburbs of the opposite shore another group seeing the way the wind was an emperor for the legion blowing went over to the winners and fell on their erstwhile comrades thorisin began to dance in earnest heedless of the impe rial dignity he pounded marcus and the messenger on the back and grinned as he was pummeled in return one squadron of about fifteen ships kept up the fight scaurus was unsurprised to spot asecond drungarios pennant among them game to the end elissaios bouraphos and his surviving loyal followers gave their fellows the chance to escape they tried to be everywhere at once whirling and dashing forward to the attack like so many dogs at bay facing so many the battle could have had only one result but the end came quicker than die tribune had expected all at once the coordinated defense dissolved into a series of single ship actions white shields came up on poles as the last of bouraphos captains began to yield sink em all gavras shouted and then a moment later reluctantly no well need them against namdalen one day he sighed and said to marcus ill turn forethoughtful yet damn me if i wont this wretched job will see to that he sighed again remembering the freedom of irresponsibility by the time the emperor reached the neorhesian harbor he was jovial again the space by the docks was filled with a nulling crowd of civilians and soldiers to the people of the city leimmokheirs triumphal return was a spectacle to make the day pass more quickly the soldiers knew how much more it meant now at last they could face baanes onomagoulos the shield that had separated them was hacked to bits thorisin nodded to every captain coming ashore he care fully made no distinction between the men who had sailed out with the drungarios and former rebels the latter knowing his reputation for a swift temper approached him warily but found their role in the victory outweighing earlier allegiance they left the imperial presence quite relieved taron leimmokheirs galley was among the last to put in it had taken damage marcus saw some oars trailed limply in the water for lack of men to pull them and a tenfoot stretch of the port rail was smashed to stovewood gavras soldiers cheered the admiral who ignored them until the trireme was tied up at the dock then a single short wave sufficed him with the agility of a much younger man harp turtledove he scrambled up onto the pier he elbowed through the press until he stood before the emperor he bowed low saying i trust my message sufficed to lay your concern to rest holding the bow he tipped a wink to scaurus with his left eye which thorisin could not see the emperor coloring inhaled ominously but before he could blast leimmokheir he spied marcus trying to swallow a grin then youre too fornicating trusting by half he growled but without sincerity ive said so for years youll recall so now my task is done its back to the cell eh the drungarios returned thorisins banter but scaurus heard noth ing light in his tone after the scare you threw into me you deserve a yes to that gavras eyes swung to the flagship what have we here two corseleted marines brought their prisoner before the emperor they had to half support him the left side of his handsome face and head was bloody from a slingstones glancing blow you would have done better to stay at pityos elissaios thorisin said bouraphos glared at him shaking his head to try to clear it we were nearly holding our own till that cursed rock flat tened me even with the bolters id bolt em proper i would the wordplay was feeble but marcus had to respect the rebels spirit for essaying it at all youre not likely to have the chance thorisin said i know bouraphos spat at taron leimmokheirs feet when will you fight for yourself gavras you used me to counter this bag of turds and then him against me what sort of warrior does that make you the master of you both the emperor replied he turned to the marines who came to attention expecting the order take him to the kynegion as they began to lead bouraphos away gavras stopped them for a moment in memory of the service you once gave me elissaios your lands will not stand forfeit to the fisc you have a son i think yes thats good of you thorisin hes never harmed me we can keep your head off the milestone too bouraphos shrugged do as you like there ill have no an emperor for the legion further use for it he eyed the marines well lets go i trust i dont have to show you the road he walked off between them his back straighter and stride firmer at every step unable to hold the thought to himself marcus said he dies very well aye so he does the emperor nodded he should have lived the same way to that the tribune had no good reply the small crowd studied the ship moored at the pier whats that written on its stern gaius philippus asked the letters were faded saltstained conqueror marcus read the senior centurion pursed his lips itll never live up to that the conqueror bobbed in the light chop beamier than the lean videssian warships it carried a wide squarerigged sail now furled and a dozen carports so the crew could maneuver in and out of harbors at need gorgidas who knew more of ships than the romans seemed satisfied it wasnt built yesterday or the day before either but itll get us across to prista and thats what counts he stirred a large leather rucksack with his foot having helped him pack it marcus knew that rolls of parchment pens and packets of powdered ink make up a good part of its bulk the tribune remarked the emperor wastes no time less than a week since he gained the sea and already youre off to the arshaum high time too arigh arghuns son said i miss the feel of a horses barrel between my legs pikridios goudeles gave a delicate shudder you will i fear have all too much chance to grow thoroughly used to the sensation as worse luck will i to scaurus he said the upcoming campaigns both against the usurper and against the yezda shall be difficult ones good arighs men will be too late for the first of them it seems but surely not for the second of course marcus said that thorisin had enough faith in goudeles to send him as ambassador surprised the roman or was the emperor clearing the stage of a potential danger to himself whatever gavras reasons his trust for the smooth harry turtledove tongued bureaucrat plainly was not absolute goudeles fellow envoy was a dark saturnine military man named lankinos skylitzes scaurus did not know him well and was unsure whether he was brother or cousin to the skylitzes who had died in the night ambush the year before in one way at least he was a good choice for the embassy the roman had heard him talking with arigh in the nomads tongue perhaps knowledge of the steppe was his speciality for he said theres another reason for haste a new set of dis patches came from prista last night avshars on the plains belike hes after soldiers too wed best forestall him marcus exclaimed in dismay and was echoed by everyone who heard skylitzes news in his heart he had known the wizardprince escaped videssos when the sphrantzai fell but it was always possible to hope youre sure he asked sky litzes the soldier nodded once no garrulous imperial here scaurus thought with a smile may the spirits let us meet him arigh said pantomim ing cutandthrust marcus admired his bravado but not his sense too many had made that wish already and got no joy when it came true gaius philippus undid the shortsword at his belt and handed it to gorgidas take it he said with that serpents spawn running free youll need it one day the greek was touched by the present but tried to refuse it saying i have no skill with such tools nor any desire to learn take it anyway gaius philippus said implacable you can stow it in the bottom of your duffel for all of me but take it he sounded as if he were taking a legionary to task not giving a gift but gorgidas heard the concern behind his insis tence he accepted the gladius with a word of thanks and proceeded to do just what the senior centurion had advised packing it away in his kit very moving goudeles said dryly heres something with a sweeter edge to it he produced an alabaster flask of wine drank and passed it to scaurus it went down smooth as cream nothing but the best for pikridios the tribune thought a gangplank thudded into place the conquerors captain an emperor for the legion a burly man of middle years shouted you toffs can come aboard now he wagged his head in invitation arigh left videssos without a backward glance his right hand on the hilt of his saber his left steadying the sueded leather bag slung over his shoulder skylitzes followed equally nonchalant pikridios goudeles gave a theatric groan as he picked up his duffel but seemed perfectly able to carry it take care of yourself gaius philippus ordered thump ing gorgidas on the back youre too softhearted for your own good the physician snorted in exasperation and youre so full of feces its no wonder your eyes are brown he embraced the two romans then shouldered his own rucksack and fol lowed the rest of the embassy remember marcus called after him i expect to read what you say about your travels so it had best be good never fear scaurus youll read it if i have to tie you down and hold it in front of your face its fitting punishment for reminding me youre my audience thats the lot of you the captain asked when the greek came aboard getting no contradiction he called to his crew make ready to cast off two halfnaked sailors pulled in the gangplank another pair jumped onto the dock to undo the fat brown mooring lines that held the conqueror fore and aft hold on avast belay whatever the plaguetaken sea mans word is the pier shook as viridovix came thudding up his helmet on his head and a knapsack under his arm he was crimsonfaced and puffing sweat streamed down his cheeks he looked to have come from the roman barracks on the dead run whats happened marcus and gaius philippus asked to gether exchanging apprehensive glances except in battle and wenching such exertion was alien to the gauls nature he got no chance to answer them for arigh shouted his name and leaped out of the conqueror to greet him come to see me off after all are you not a bit of it viridovix replied dropping his bag to the boards of the pier with a sigh of relief by your leave im coming with you the nomads grin flashed white in his swarthy face what harry turtledove could be better youll learn to love the taste of kavass i promise you are you daft man gaius philippus asked pointing to the conqueror he went on if youve forgotten that is a ship your stomach will remember whether you do or not och dinna remind me the celt said wiping his face on a tunic sleeve still and all its that or meet the headsman im thinking on the water ill wish im dead but to stay would get me the wish granted the which i dont fancy ei ther the headsman scaurus said thinking quickly he shifted to latin the woman turned on you as long as no names were named arigh and the listening sailors could not follow didnt she just the fickle slut viridovix answered bit terly in the same tongue his happygolucky air had deserted him he was angry and selfreproachful catching the gleam in marcus eye he said ive no need for your toldyousos either you did that and rightly would i were as cautious a wight as you the once that admission was the true measure of his dismay for he never tired of chiding the romans for their stodginess what went awry the tribune asked can you no guess that ones green as the sea with jeal ousy like a canker it eats in her and so she was havering after me to set aside my gavrila and lissena and beline and i said her nay as ive done before theyll miss me puir girls and you must be after promising not to let herselfs wrath fall on em of course scaurus said impatiently on with it man och the blackhearted bitch started shrieking fit to wake a dead corp she did and swore shed tell the gavras id had her by force a fragment of the celts grin appeared for a mo ment belike shed make himself believe it too shes after seeing enough of me to give sic charge the weight of detail you might say shed do it gaius philippus said without hesitation the very thought i had roman dear i couldna be cutting her throat with it so white and all i had not the heart for it to say naught of the hurlyburly itd touch off what did you do then marcus demanded let her go an emperor for the legion free by the gods viridovix the imperial guardsll be on your heels nay nay you see me revealed a fool but not a damnfool shes swaddled and gagged and tied on a bed in tile sleazy little inn where we went shell be a while working loose but im thinking the exercisell not improve her temper and so its away with me first gorgidas and now you and both for reasons an idiot would be ashamed to own the tribune said feeling the wrench as his tightly knit company began to unravel again he gave thanks that the romans had not had to split themselves between namdalen and videssos it would have torn the hearts from them all impatient with the talk in a language he did not understand arigh broke in if youre coming come i will that never fear viridovix clasped scaurus hand take care o the blade you bear roman its a bonny un and you yours viridovix long sword hung at his right hip he would have seemed naked without it the celts jaw dropped as he noticed gaius philippus weaponless wore it out did you dont be more foolish than you can help i passed it on to gorgidas did you now that was a canny thing to do or would be if the silly lown had the wit to realize what grand sport war is as is like as not hell lose it or else slice himself virido vix lip curled a second later he brightened och thats right ill have the greek to quarrel with nothing like a good quarrel to keep a day from going stale marcus remembered his own words to gorgidas when the doctor told him he was leaving at the time they had been a desperate joke but here they were coming back at him in all seriousness from the gauls mouth viridovix lived to wran gle whether with swords or with words the captain of the conqueror made a trumpet of his hands you there were sailing with you or without you the threat was empty while viridovix meant nothing to him he could hardly set off without the arshaum who meant every thing to the embassy the aggrieved shout underlined arighs unrest lets do it he said taking die celts arm viridovix rawhide boots harry turtledove clumped on the planking of the dock the nomad shod in soft calfskin walked silent as a wildcat looking like a live man going to his own funeral the gaul tossed his duffel to a sailor still he hesitated before following it down he sketched a salute to scaurus waved his fist at gaius philippus watch yourself runt he called and jumped and you you great baldarsed lunk to the captains shouted directions his crew backed water for a few seconds it seemed the conqueror was too bulky to respond to the oars but then it moved inching away from the pier when well clear it turned north ponderous as a fat old man marcus heard ropes squeal in pullies as the broad sail unfurled it napped loosely then filled with wind the tribune watched until the horizon swallowed it with regained mastery of the sea thorisin gavras threw drax and his namdalener mercenaries at baanes onoma goulos leimmokheirs galleys protected the transports from rebel warships the men of the duchy landed in the westlands at kypas several days march south of the suburbs opposite videssos a great smoke rose in the west as onomagoulos fired his camp to keep thorisin from taking possession of it baanes retreated toward his stronghold round garsavra he moved in haste lest the namdaleni cut him off from his center of power thorisin acting like a man who feels victory in his grasp retook the western suburbs marcus waited for a summons from the emperor expect ing him to order the legionaries into action against onoma goulos he drilled his men furiously wanting to be ready he still had doubts about the great count despite the successes drax was winning for gavras no orders came thorisin held military councils in plenty but to plan the coming summer campaign against the yezda he seemed certain anyone fighting onomagoulos had to be his friend scaurus tried to put his suspicions into words after one officers meeting saying to the emperor the nomads attack baanes too you know but not in your interest drax wars for no one but drax he travels under your banner now but only because it suits him an emperor for the legion thorisin frowned the romans advice was clearly unwel come youve given me good service outlander and that sometimes in my despite he said there have been stories told of you just as you tell them now against the namdalener a prudent man believes not all of what he sees and only a little of what he hears but this i tell you no rumorseller has ever come to me with news that drax purposed abandoning me at the hour of my peril scaurus belly went heavy as lead how had that report reached the emperor unsure how much gavras knew he did not dare deny it picking his words with care he said if you believe such tales why hold me and mine to your service because i trust my eyes further than my ears it was dismissal and warning both without proof gavras would not hear charges against the great count glad the emperor was taking the other question no further marcus left hastily he had expected a great hue and cry after viridovix but mat too failed to materialize gaius philippus misogyny led him to a guess the tribune thought close to the mark id bet this isnt the first time komittas played bumpbelly where she shouldnt the veteran said would you care to advertise it were you gavras hmm if that was so much might be explained from thorisins curious indifference to his mistress tale of rape to her remaining mistress instead of queen youre getting a feel for the politics hereabouts marcus told the senior centurion oh horseturds when theyre thick on the ground as olives at harvest time you dont need to feel em the smell gives them away in the westlands drax kept making gains when his dis patches arrived thorisin would read them out to his assem bled officers the great count wrote like an educated videssian a feat that roused only contempt in his fellow is lander utprand would you listen to that now the mercenary captain said after one session goals achieved objectives being met veres onomagoulos army and wy hasnt drax smashed it up tats what needs telling aye youre right soteric echoed vehemently drax greases his tongue when he talks and his pen when he sets ink to parchment harry turtledove marcus put some of their complaint down to jealousy at drax holding a greater command than theirs from cold expe rience he also knew how much such complaints accom plished he said of course the two of you are but plain blunt soldiers of fortune that you were ready to set videssos on its ear last summer has nothing to do with intrigue utprand had the grace to look shamefaced but soteric re torted if the effete imperials cant hold us back whose fault is that ours by the wager they dont merit this empire of theirs there were times when scaurus found the islanders insis tence on their own virtues and the decadence of videssos more than he could stomach he said sharply if youre speaking of effeteness then betrayal should stand with it not so certainly soteric answered utprand more wary than his lieutenant asked wat do you mean betrayal just this marcus replied gavras knows we met at the end of the siege and what befell by your phos gentlemen no roman told him leaving helvis out of the bargain only four ever learned what was planned and it never went beyond them some one of your men should have his tongue trimmed lest he trip on it as it flaps beneath his feet impossible soteric exclaimed with the confidence of youth we are an honorable folk why would we stoop to such doubledealing he glared at his brotherinlaw ready to take it farther than words utprand spoke to him in the island dialect marcus caught the drift secrets yielded accidentally could hurt as much as those given away on purpose soterics mouth was still thin with anger but he gave a grudging nod the tribune was grateful to the older namdalener unlike soteric utprand had seen enough to know how few things were certain backing what the officer had pointed out marcus said i didnt mean to suggest deliberate treachery only that you islanders fall as short of perfection as any other men you have a rude way with a suggestion soteric had a point scaurus realized but he could not make himself regret pricking his brotherinlaws selfimportance an emperor for the legion a priest to see me the tribune asked the roman sentry is it nepos from the academy no sir just some bluerobe curious marcus followed the legionary to the barracks hall door the priest a nondescript man save for his shaved pate bowed and handed him a small roll of parchment sealed with the patriarchs skyblue wax he said a special liturgy of rejoicing will be celebrated in the high temple at the eighth hour this afternoon you are bidden to attend the parchment here is your token of entrance i also have one for your chief lieutenant me gaius philippus head jerked up i have better things to do with my time thank you you would decline the patriarchal summons the priest said shocked your precious patriarch doesnt know my name gaius philippus retorted his eyes narrowed so why would he in vite me hmm did the emperor put him up to it the priest spread his hands helplessly marcus said gavras thinks well of you soldiers know soldiers gaius philippus shrugged he tucked the parchment roll into his beltpouch maybe id bet ter go putting his own invitation away scaurus asked the priest a liturgy of rejoicing in aid of what of phos mercy on us all the man replied taking him literally now forgive me i pray i have others yet to find he was gone before marcus could reframe his question the tribune muttered a mild curse then glanced around to gauge the shadows it could not be later than noon he de cided at least two hours until the service began that gave him time to bathe and then put on his dress cape and helmet sweltering though they were he ran a hand over his cheek then sighed a shave would not be amiss either sighing as well gaius philippus joined him at his ablutions rubbing freshly scraped faces the romans handed their tokens of admission to a priest at the top of the high temples stairs and made their way into the building the high temple dominated videssos skyline but its heavy form and plain stuccoed exterior as always failed to impress scaurus whose tastes were formed in a different school as he did not wor harry turtledove ship phos he seldom entered the temple and sometimes for got how glorious it was inside whenever he did go in he felt transported to another purer world like all of phos shrines the high temple was built round a circular worship area surmounted by a dome with rows of benches north south east and west but here genius and limitless resources had refined the simple basic plan all the separate richnesses benches of highly polished hardwoods mossagate columns endless gold and silver foil to reflect light into every comer walls that imitated phos sky in facings of semiprecious stones somehow failed to compete with one another but were blended by the artisans skill into a unified and magnificent whole and all that magnificence served to lead the eye upward to contemplate the temples great central dome which itself seemed more a product of wizardry than architecture liber ated by pendentives from the support of columns it looked to be upheld only by the shafts of sunlight piercing its many windowed base even to marcus the stubborn nonbeliever it seemed a bit of phos heaven suspended above the earth now here is a home fit for a god gaius philippus mut tered under his breath he had never been in the high temple before hardened as he was he could not keep awe from his voice phos himself looked down on his worshipers from the in terior of the dome goldbacked glass tesserae sparkled now here now there in an evershifting play of light stern in judgment the videssian gods eyes seemed to see into the furthest recesses of the temple and into the soul of every man within from that gaze from the verdict inscribed in the book the god held there could be no appeal nowhere had scaurus seen such an uncomprising image of harsh righteous purpose no videssian no matter how cynical sat easy under that phos eyes to an outlander seeing them for the first time they could be overwhelming utprand dagobers son stiffened to attention and began a salute as to any great leader before he stopped in confusion dont blame him a bit gaius phi lippus said marcus nodded no one tittered at the namda lener here the proud imperials too were humble fair face crimsoning utprand found a seat his foxskin jacket and snug trousers set him apart from the videssians an emperor for the legion harry turtledove around him their flowing robes of multicolored silks their highknotted brocaded fabrics their velvets and snowy linens served to complement the high temples splendor jewels and gold and silver threadwork gleamed as they moved exaltation a choir of boys in robes of blue samite came down the aisles and grouped themselves round the central altar exaltation their pure unbroken voices filled the space under the great dome with joyous music exaltation exaltation even phos awesome image seemed to take on a more benign aspect as his young votaries sang his praises exaltation censerswinging priests followed the chorus toward the worship area the sweet fragrances of balsam frankincense cedar oil myrrh and storax filled the air behind the priests came balsamon the congregation rose to honor the patriarch and behind balsamon was thorisin gavras in full imperial regalia along with everyone else marcus and gaius phi lippus bowed to the avtokrator the tribune tried to keep the surprise from his face on his previous visits to the high tem ple the emperor had taken no part in its services but watched from a small private room set high in the buildings eastern wall balsamon steadied himself resting a hand on the back of the patriarchal throne its ivory panels cut in delicate reliefs must have delighted the connoisseur in him after resting for a moment he lifted his hands to the phos in the dome offering his god the videssians creed we bless thee phos lord with the right and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor the congregation followed him in the prayer then chor used its amens marcus heard utprand soteric and a few other namdalener officers append the extra clause they added to the creed on this we stake our very souls as always some videssians frowned at the addition but balsamon gave them no chance to ponder it we are met today in gladness and celebration he shouted sing and let the good god hear your rejoicing his quavery tenor launched into a hymn the choir followed him an instant later they swept the worshippers along with them taron leimmokheirs tuneless bass rose loud above the rest the devout admiral his eyes closed rocked from side to side in his seat as he sang the liturgy of rejoicing was not commonly held the vi dessian notables civil and military alike threw themselves into the ceremony with such gusto that the interior of the high temple took on a festival air their enthusiasm was conta gious scaurus stood and clapped with his neighbors and fol lowed their songs as best he could most though were in the archaic dialect preserved only in ritual which he still did not understand well he caught a quick stir of motion through the filigreed screening that shielded the imperial niche from mundane eyes and wondered whether it was komitta rhangavve or alypia gavra both of them he thought would be there he hoped it was alypia her uncle the emperor stood to the right of the patriarchal throne though he did no more than pray with the rest of the worshipers his presence among them was enough to rivet their attention on him balsamon used his hands to mute the congregations sing ing the voices of the choir rang out in all their perfect clarity then they too died away leaving a silence as speaking as words the patriarch let it draw itself out to just the right length before he transformed its nature by taking the few steps from his ivory throne to the altar at the very center of the worship area his audience leaned forward expectantly to lis ten to what he would say his eyes twinkled he plainly enjoyed making them wait he drummed his stubby fingers on the sheet silver of the al tartop looking this way and that at last he said you really dont need to hear me at all today he beckoned gavras to his side this is the man who asked me to celebrate the liturgy of rejoicing let him explain his reasons thorisin ignored the irreverence toward his person from balsamon it was not disrespectful the emperor began almost before his introduction was through word arrived this mom ing of battle just east of gavras forces loyal to us even gavrass bluntness balked at calling mercenaries by their right name decisively defeated their opponents the chief rebel and traitor baanes onomagoulos was killed in the fighting the three short sentences bald as any military communi que touched off pandemonium in the high temple bureau crats cheers mingled with those of thorisins officers if the present avtokrator was not the penpushers choice he was a an emperor for the legion paragon next to onomagoulos for once gavras had all his governments unruly factions behind him master of his own house at last he basked in the applause like a sunbather on a warm beach now we will deal with the yezda as they deserve he cried the cheering got louder marcus nodded in sober satisfaction gains philippus fist rose and slowly came down on his knee they looked at each other with complete understanding our turn to go west next the senior centurion predicted still some work to do to get ready marcus nodded again its as thorisin said though at least well be fighting the right
