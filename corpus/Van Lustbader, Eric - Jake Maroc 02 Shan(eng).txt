 authors note in the buddhist religion the sanskrit word kalpa is used in several ways it is an almost incalculable period of time it is also the word used to measure the period between the creation and the recreation of the world each great kalpa is divided into four parts so too is shan those familiar with my novel jian will recall that the chinese transliteration of kalpa is ka the masters of wei qi the ancient board game of warfare and strategy that jake shi zilin and daniella vorkuta play in shan use the term to mean the point where the contending forces have reached a stalemate it is common knowledge among wei qi masters however that a jiana master general of wei qimay find a strategy to break ka it is shan the mountain shan contents part i destruction part ii emptiness part iii formation part iv existence according to known history there is no highly clandestine espionage organization called the quarry just as in the summer of there was no aide to maj gen patrick j hurley ambassador to china named ross davies but there could be and there might have been shan jake rodger donovan said without turning around he seemed quite calm despite the desperateness of the situation you seem to have as many lives as the hero of a novel i knew we couldnt kill you it didnt stop you from trying donovan winced at the tone of course not what do you take us for amateurs no more talk jake said take me to wunderman ah wunderman i imagine hell want to know how you evaded all our security measures then hell be disappointed come on lets go jake maroc in hong kong dreaming of another time another place of a day nine months before a rainswept day he had flown into washingtons dulles international airport after spending hours with bliss deciphering the papers for which so many people had died not the least of whom was david oh jakes closest friend papers that irrefutably identified henry wundermannow the director of the clandestine intelligence organization known as the quarry for which jake had workedas a double agent working for the kgbs daniella vorkuta his code name was chimera general vorkuta and chimera the papers showed had masterminded the assassination of antony beridien just weeks before beridien the quarrys first director and its founder now jake was in washington racing by car to great falls where nestled within the rolling emerald hills greystoke sat the nineteenthcentury mansion seat of power for the new director and wunderman asserting that it had been jake himself who had murdered antony beridien in retaliation for the directors cutting jake off from the quarry had instituted a number of new security systems at greystoke this is what jake dreamed of the day he confronted his father and struck him down forever not that henry wunderman was jake marocs real father but as jake dreamed of crouching in the high grass just outside the perimeter of greystokes eastern boundary his thoughts were filled up with images from a time when jake was young a wild orphan roaming the filthy back alleys of hong kong a great unwieldy anger riding his shoulders like a deformity henry wunderman had changed all that he had come to hong kong to search jake out to recruit him into the quarry henry wunderman had given jakes life a purpose his faith in the young man had redeemed jake from emptiness and perhaps even selfdestruction he was jakes spiritual father and now jake was forced to destroy him to do it jake needed bamahk bamahk meant literally feel the pulse it was a state of mental preparedness in which one was able to feel the energy sources of ones surroundings through bamahk one could therefore discover much that was hidden from the normal five senses one could even discern the strategies of ones opponent and thus counter them even as they were occurring bamahk is what jake used now at the eastern edge of the treacherous minefield of security traps that henry wunderman had devised he sat and entered bamahk for him it was another world entirely it always had been here he was free of corporeal concerns he was almost entirely spirit or as the chinese would say qi qi was the inner energy that resided in every living thing it was in essence life without qi a man had no strength no inner reserves he was not in harmony with either himself or his surroundings in bamahk jakes qi his strength of spirit expanded like the ripples on a lake widening from the spot where a stone had been thrown so jakes extraordinary qi roved outward encountering first the infrared units like rogue blades of grass well camouflaged to the eye then the ultrasonics implanted as clumps of speckled mushrooms at the foot of rustling trees bamahk revealed to him the outer defenses of greystoke he moved around them above them so that the electronics were as oblivious to him as they were to the wind that rushed by his side within the double outer ring jake stopped and returned fully to bamahk it was a comforting sensation as if one were to return to a private world where the very pulse of the cosmos could be felt examined and absorbed jake was aware of how much he delighted in of how much he depended on bamahk it was his ultimate weapon the manner by which he had gained his victories for the quarry and after for himself and for his father his real father shi zilin it was bamahk jake knew that made him special it was bamahk that guided him through the dangers inherent in the life he had chosen to lead without it he would never have been able to make it to greystoke sitting like a great old man at the center of the security web the dogs were next dobermans trained to scent out humans and immobilize them at the point of contact bamahk picked them up allowing jake to keep downwind of them to pass them by without incident his dream never revealed to him how many more rings he had to pass through the number was irrelevant infiltration into greystoke was akin to a game of wei qi the ancient chinese board game of strategy it would have been fruitless to take the security rings one at a time for they had been so set up that often the solution used to penetrate one would have set off the next bamahk allowed jake to feel several of the rings at once so it was that jake had come at last upon rodger donovan the quarrys wunderkind and numbertwo man working on his corvette in the driveway beside greystokes famous rose garden it was donovan who took jake into the house itself into the inner sanctum of the director face to face with henry wunderman the prodigal son had returned home to face the wrath of his father the replaying of events of mythic proportion there should have been portents thunder crashing lightning forking instead the black skies were almost somnolent and the only discernible sounds were the droning of the bumblebees greedily gathering attar from the roses two stories below the scent of the enormous flowers was in the room and it was to this aspect that the end of jakes dream clove the struggle with henry wunderman while rodger donovan looked on sphinxlike was inextricably bound to the rich perfume wunderman had pulled the pistol by all rights he should have shot jake dead where he stood not two meters away but bamahk had revealed his intent to jake even before the movement had begun enough timejust enoughfor jake to spill his body forward the shot passing through the spot where he had been now the die had been cast the stink of death mingled with the scent of the roses the strangled sounds of their struggle punctuated the droning of the gluttonous bees how many myths in how many different cultures scattered throughout time and place foretold the prodigal son returning to kill his father jake in righteous anger used bamahk yet again to penetrate wundermans defenses used the lethal liver kites because of david oh because of jakes wife mariana because of jakes halfbrother nichiren chimera had had a hand either directly or indirectly in all their deaths protected by bamahk from the terrible implications of what he had to do death was in jakes mind in his hands death was in his heart the naked flame of revenge expunging the light of all the pure stars in the vault of the heavens and now in the space of a heartbeat everything had changed instead of the satisfaction of revenge there was only death appalling and irreversible the knowledge and the guilt and the crying inside was too much too much mingled always with the scent of roses powerful as the oceans tide i destruction samvarta winterspring present hong kong beijing washington moscow jake and bliss were down in the hole in the night the sounds of hong kong came to them as through a mist they were so near the harbor they could hear the laplap laplap of water against pilings the highpitched squeal of rats came to them now and again through walls of packed earth and rotting timbers the sounds of gambling took precedence over everything else that was the essence of the hole a warren of underground chambers linked by low tunnels gambling the only legal gambling allowed in hong kong was the horse races at happy valley but the chinese were insatiable gamblers it was very dark down in the hole jake had no love for it but it was the spot insisted upon for the rendezvous how well do you know this man bliss asked him jake stared at her he is one of the halfdozen i have been running for the past six months he caught her tone i trust him bliss shivered a little i dont like this place she said echoing jakes own thoughts he must have a reason for meeting us here jake said bliss looked around easy to get trapped down here just as easy to get lost jake said dont worry she gave him a little smile just nerves he could see the long sweep of her beautiful neck i dont like to be underground you could have stayed home i told you not after what your contact hinted at she moved and the hollow of her throat filled with shadow jake do you really think hes that close to the spy who has infiltrated our inner circle jake was watching the lowceilinged corridor there had been some movement there like i said clickclackclick of the ivory mahjongg tiles i vetted him himself cigarette smoke blued in the bare bulb light thick as fog as i do all my operatives jumble of cantonese rising as the bidding became more heated i trust him shadow and light moving i wouldnt be down here otherwise bliss turned her head jake could feel the tension come into her frame is that him jake looked at the thin chinese with slickedback hair he was young to be down here the hole was generally the province of the older men who remembered when smugglers used these tunnels no jake said watching the thin chinese stand there observing the mahjongg game when he began to joke with the participants jake turned his attention elsewhere hes late bliss said your contact hell be here youve had leads before bliss said theyve all been dead ends jake said he was looking beyond the gamblers my operatives get so far then its as if a door gets slammed in their faces time to take another tack jake considered this he knew how smart bliss was that was part of what he loved about her maybe she was right maybe he should he began to move forward hes here jake was in the light and the stocky mustachioed chinese saw him he motioned for jake to stay where he was movement at the mahjongg game was furious as the last of the tiles were laid out the contact made his way past the gesticulating gamblers his movements were quick darting then he seemed to stumble and with a cry he fell forward into the midst of the gamblers the ancient wooden table collapsed beneath his weight tiles scattered and the old men shouted lurched out of their chairs then jake saw the young chinese with the slickedback hair he was racing back along the tunnel down which the contact had just come jake sprang toward the jumble of the gamblers and their ruined game bliss shot past him as he bent over the stocky chinese his contact and turned him over there was blood everywhere jake saw the knife and thought he got the heart hes a professionala good one there was nothing in the stocky mans eyes no recognition no intelligence the spark had been extinguished in a second life to death without warning ignoring the shouts of the gamblers jake took off after bliss and the assassin i should have kept my eye on him jake thought i should have known why didnt bamahk alert me instead he had put bliss into great danger she slammed around a corner and catching sight of the chinese with the slickedback hair she raced after him the cloying scent of opium was strong in the air almost masking the acrid odors the sweat of feverish gambling was as dense as mist in the subterranean air through a clot of thin old men playing fantan they turned cursing at her what was a woman doing down in the hole anyway get back to shelling shrimp where you belong they shouted leave men to their important business she ignored them as she had ignored similar poison all her life she had seen the man with the slickedback hair dart around to the left and pushing aside several gamblers adrift on opium currents she ran into shadows at top speed he was waiting for her a curled arm like steel smashed downward and bliss gasped as she felt the pain sweep through her collarbone and neck her legs went out from under her and she slid onto the corridors earthen floor half stunned she felt herself being dragged into a small evilsmelling room the soft stirring of the opium addicts came from all around her she could barely make out supine shapes in the darkness here and there miniature fires were lit the tears of the poppy was burning in the tiny bowls of longstemmed pipes she felt his presence like a heat above her she knew he would kill her just as efficiently as he had killed the contact as he stood over her she knew what she must do in her mind she could hear the ancient gamblers screaming at her whats a woman doing down in the hole anyway this man was no different from the rest she would use it against him she could hear his panting it contrasted with the slow deep exhalations of the addicts among whom she lay bliss lifted a hand curled it around his neck brought him down against her face she could see slivers of yellow light reflecting in his eyes she could scent his arousal killing sometimes did that to people she had heard she needed time to recover to fix on a strategy bliss opened her legs thrust her breasts up all the while the hand she had placed behind his head was moving ever so slowly she twisted her breasts beneath his hands now the pad of her thumb was just over the right side of his neck she must give no pressure no warning bliss knew that she would only get one chance if she did not get it dead on he would kill her she had absolutely no doubt of that she concentrated on what she had to do the carotid she knew the nerve meridian well still she hesitated so much was riding on the split second of her commitment death was waiting for her she felt him against her soft flesh and she had had enough she summoned all her inner strength she concentrated her qi down to this one point on his anatomy the carotid meridian opened her mouth wide and shouted as jake had taught her simultaneously she pressed inward at the meridian juncture the effect on the assassin was astounding he jumped a fish on a line his eyes flew open she could see the whites all around they began to bug out as the color drained from his cheeks realizing what she was doing he responded instinctually he hit out his fists were like blocks of iron they struck bliss tears of pain welled up in her eyes dizzy grinning the man hit her again he laughed he was enjoying this perhaps he was still as hard as he had ever been bliss abandoned the carotid meridian and smote the underside of his rib cage with the heel of her hand she heard the sickening snap as the two lowest ribs shattered jake having heard blisss cries slammed around the left turning racing down the neardeserted corridor of shadows his peripheral vision brought him the movement of the struggle and he leapt into the opium den he grabbed the man with the slickedback hair and jerked him backward bliss so focused that she was still unaware that he had come into the room saw her opening and jammed her hand into her assailants abdomen as jake had taught her to do she used her rigid fingers to puncture skin muscles organs all in one blurred motion of such power that it was unstoppable no jake cried as he saw her begin the lethal blow but he was too late she had been fighting for her life and had become an organism too busy with the business of surviving to be concerned with outside stimuli the assassin spit blood and bile as he died reaching down jake scooped bliss up off the floor and put the side of his face against hers he kissed her on the lips bliss are you all right jake her head against his chest brave one he said softly and took her out of there bliss sat in their apartment a neat scotch in her hand jake maroc was in her eyes he was stretched out at her side his long legs crossed at the ankles i messed it up she said softly he was going to kill you jake said you did what you had to do you had no choice not too many people would have been able to survive that let alone succeed concentrate on that but if id just disabled him we would have been able to question him the whiskey was against her opened lips maybe we wouldve even found out who the spy is he was a professional bliss chances are we would have gotten nothing from him im just glad were both okay the repulse bay crescent was not far away but they were too high up to hear the crying of the gulls a huge black kite sat in the treetop outside the window the early morning sunlight turning its feathers iridescent another dead end she said and swallowed half her scotch she had taken a long hot bath and then she and jake had made love that was what she had wanted the most my father jake said staring at the kite he must be up for hours already bliss watched from her long almond eyes after a long time she stirred as if making up her mind jake you dont understand i am part of the yuhnhyun the inner circle i am part of you if i cant be of help jake turned his head and smiled he reached out took her hand in his what would i do without you bliss joss that my contact was killed joss that his murderer was too if i hadnt wanted you with me id have made damn sure that you stayed behind he frowned i need you with me i dont know what id do otherwise in the middle of the night he was talking about the long ordeal he had so recently been through for the entire nine months since he had returned to hong kong from washington where he had wiled henry wunderman jake had been able to sleep only an hour or two a night near midnight he would pass out as if drugged and bliss in the middle of reading would quickly turn out the lights and slide down next to him between one and two his animal cry of terror would start her awake he could never remember the nightmare that had gripped him but bliss was certain that his guilt at having killed his surrogate father was the source bliss reached out now her long cocoacolored fingers twining about his slender waist they traced the network of long flat muscles out of the corner of her eye she watched the worry lines etch themselves across his face the hospital she said jake smiled absently i remember what a shock to see you again after all that time we were childhood sweethearts in the streets of hong kong is that what we were he pulled himself close to her i always thought so thats because you were precocious the palm of his hand slid along her cheek to me you were my best friend bliss laughed you see what i mean what other boy would think of a girl as his best friend i guess youre right jake said i must have been in love watching as blisss eyes closed to his caress or his words he was not certain it mattered or crazy her eyes flew open and now it was his turn to laugh im glad youre not angry with me she said why should i be angry he said sliding out of bed because when i came back into your life a year ago it was as an agent of your father because i was forbidden to tell you about certain things the inner circle included before a specific time jakes extraordinary coppercolored eyes were hooded as dark now in their centers as lead you were chosen by my father to lead me back to my family because of you i found my halfbrother nichiren i found my real father shi zilin because of you i am part of the yuhnhyun the inner circle of people who will control all of asia someday you are much more than that my darling bliss said you are zhuan your father is preparing you to be the new leader dont you see you are becoming the most powerful and influential man in the entire eastern hemisphere jake looked away and bliss thought what is wrong he went barefoot into the bathroom he did not bother to close the door bliss heard him urinating then the tap water going she drew her knees up to her chin and watched his shadow blocking the bathroom light it fell upon the tiles in sharp angles when he came out of the shower he looked into her beautiful face and seemed to see right through to the core of her no one else in the world could have done what you did he said you fought at my side against spies and assassins like tonight the extreme danger never fazed you my father trained me well bliss said but her mind was far away she was thinking of how jake had changed since zilin had arrived in hong kong he had become at once more in command and more secretive she wondered whether the one was part of the other and found herself fervently hoping that was not true jake was very close to her she felt the force of him it was like being bathed by the noonday sun the struggle is just beginning his voice was very quiet its on a larger scale than any of us could have dreamed before its over bliss well all need every ounce of strength we possess his words fell like hammer blows bliss felt her heart beating fast whats happening jake what arent you telling me he smiled suddenly and kissed her hard on the lips nothing he said and kissed her again speaking of your father jake said ill need to see three oaths tsun this afternoon do you wish to see the inner circles other tai pan or just my father what was it she wondered what was darkening jakes thoughts she could feel it was it the specters of the dead he had so recently buried for just an instant she had a premonition a remarkable sword of light pierced her consciousness there was something more something that even he might not be aware of she felt a chill of fear run through her if jake was out of phase with his environment or with himself the consequences could be disastrous he needed all his concentration in order to formulate his own strategy within the inner circleand to try to discern the strategies of his enemies if his qi was not in harmony his decisionmaking prowess would be in serious jeopardy no i want to see three oaths tsun alone jake said will you set it up for three oclock bliss nodded of course she thought of three oaths tsun as her father because he had brought her up bliss had never known her real father and remembered her mother only as a distant blur like a badly outoffocus photograph and dont forget the emergency meeting andrew sawyer has called for noon bliss said that was the soonest all the tai pan could be rounded up jake nodded do you know what thats all about she asked anxiously andrew sounded quite upset when he called jake said andrews always upset about one thing or another she opened her mouth to tell jake that she wanted to help him more but he had turned away she sensed that he was gone from her just as surely as if he had already walked out the door his mind no doubt was already on this mornings meeting with his father the great jian shi zilin before henry wunderman jakes surrogate father jake had had foster parents solomon and ruth maroc jewish refugees in shanghai had taken him and his mother in she had been sick and dying the marocs cared for athena and her frightened child by that time jakes real father shi zilin had already gone with mao giving up his family all that he held dear in order to direct the fate of the new china zilin worked behind the scenes with mao consolidating his power entrenching himself through all the agonizingly bloody years of revolution and struggles for power through the fall of mao the gang of four the abrupt end to the cultural revolution until he was beyond all the infighting the internecine warfare that led inevitably to the purges philosophies eddied and flowed around the seat of power in china but because he was secreted away from it zilin was always spared not that there werent those who had tried to destroy him the latest in the long line had been wu aiping who had set himself up at the head of the group known as the gun reactionary ministers who were opposed to zilins forwardthinking views on economic and industrial progress but jakes father had outfoxed wu aiping as he had all his other enemies now the thinking of those who ruled china had turned his way and though old and ill he had journeyed south to meet his grown sons jake and nichiren the child of his mistress one son had lived the other had died in the pitched battle on the veranda of the villa high on the cliffs overlooking repulse bay nichiren having found out that his father had also been his control had attacked zilin jake had only wanted to protect the old man his father and in the process jake had killed his brother one could say halfbrother but what in the end was the difference the same blood zilins bloodflowed through their veins neither had known it until the very end they had spent a good deal of their adult lives hunting one another hurting one another as bitter enemies it had been nichiren who had been responsible for jakes daughters murder at the sumchun river threeandahalf years before as part of the american organization known as the quarry jake had done his best to track nichiren down as he had peeled away the layers of deceit he had gone from seeing nichiren as a lonewolf assassin to being controlled by the russiansby general daniella vorkuta until recently vorkuta had been the head of the kgbs most feared extraterritorial wing the kvr and then jake had discovered that nichiren was in fact being controlled by zilin out of beijing it was all part of zilins master plan what the old man called his ten his harvest shi had created an inner circle a yuhnhyun of powerful people included in the inner circle were the major tai pan the heads of hong kongs most powerful trading housesand also the dragons the overlords of the three largest triads the secret societies and the man to direct them all jake maroc or jake shi take your pick the tai pan of all tai pan the most special one jake was zhuan ever since he had been reunited with zilin jakes obsession had been the old man his father his days were spent at zilins side deep in conversation his zeal taxed even the old mans phenomenal endurance they would sit by the shoreline their trouser legs rolled up their bare feet in the surf even hunger did not stop their dialogue they ate while they spoke hardly tasting the food they were brought neither of them noticed the triad members assigned to them who strolled the beach looking fondly at babies toddling on stillsoft legs carefully searching the faces of any others who entered the vicinity of father and son both jake and zilin appeared oblivious to danger on this day there was a mist in the air as if the night had refused to relinquish its hold it is time for you to begin your work as zhuan zilin sat as a child might his legs straight out in front of him the brace was off the right leg but his gnarled hand massaged the atrophied muscles along its upper length talk is constructive up to a certain point zilin said after that only action matters though it was in the low sixties a winter coat was draped across zilins bony shoulders his baggy cotton trousers were rolled to just below the knee still in spots the fabric was darkened splashed by the surf of the south china sea the zhuan is the tai pan of all hong kong tai pan he is the head dragon of the inner circle the zhuan will eventually control all business throughout asia he will be the funnel through which beijing will make its deals through which the indonesianized chinese businessmen will clear their profits through him the british will do their trading as will the americans the japanese the thais and malaysians zilin stared out to where the sunlight was a swath of beaten brass over the waves this is the ultimate stage of my ren my harvest for fifty years this has been my dreama united china i have told you how i came upon the beginnings of communism in china my first wife mai was sun zhongshans assistant he was speaking of dr sun yatsen founder of the guomindang we met in shanghai at the founding of the chinese communist party i have already told you of my boyhood in suzhou of how much time i spent in the garden of my mentor the jian here it was that i was taught the overriding importance of artifice in life the jians garden looked so perfectly natural that i believed for some time that every tree bush shrub rock and hill in it had been there for hundreds of yearssince even the beginning of time imagine then my consternation when the jian revealed to me his secrets the secrets of the garden the hillock he had made himself to create a certain calming effect the stones he had had brought from a brookside these trees planted from here those shrubs he had lovingly put in but three weeks ago yet all was harmonious natural surely i had thought the hand of buddha had shaped this spacenot the mind of one man but it was true i saw that it was true i became part of the jians plan for his garden all this was never truly out of my mind as i grew up and by the time my family moved to shanghai and i went to college i knew that somehow i must employ the jians strategy in the game of life i was already a wei qi grand master on the game board as well i was able to use artifice to win matches in those days jake my friends spoke about nothing other than ridding our shores of the foreign devil who had invaded us the foreign devil systematically pulled the natural resources out of china for their profit and at our expenses but china was divided at war with itself how then could it also fend off the foreign devil this was the subject of many debates i listened but rarely made a comment for i saw how clever the foreign devil were and i thought if we could only employ artificegive the foreign devil what they thought they neededthen we could begin to use them as they had been using us we could begin to harness their talents in the service of china but first china had to be united i had no clear idea how such a vast country riddled with poverty and unrest could be tamed then i went to the fateful meeting in shanghai i came face to face with the concept of communism and i knew instinctively that i had found the means of bringing peace to china this jake was the first stage of my ren of my fiftyyear harvest but it required that i leave shanghai leave athena my second wife and your mother leave you i had no choice china came first china has always come first now at last we are in the final stages you will be the conduit through which the power of all asia will flow china will at last be whole again not by destroying hong kong as some in beijing still fervently wish to do but by utilizing all the advantages that the foreign devil have given to this colony free trade open markets an unhindered unlimited pipeline to the west without losing face we can solicit the industrial and electronic aid we so desperately need from the foreign devil within the spreading arms of the inner circle all china will prosper and grow it is your joss to see the fruits of my ren my harvest over the years communism will wane it was a powerful tool for us in the past it roused the colossus that is china out of its slumber and moved it to a certain point but now it is stagnating us we have been strangling on doctrine while the world around us has moved into another age if we cannot move also into this great new realm then china is doomed to backwardness and is in real danger of being subordinated to moscow the soviets have sought for many decades to control the direction of our future zilin moved uncomfortably and for the briefest moment a flicker of pain shadowed his face i knew from the beginning jake that i could not go beyond the stage of jian i have accomplished enough in my lifetimenow that i have found my son i am the creator it was for you to be zhuan the international conduit through which all asian and asianrelated business flows i admit that i could not control all the forces that must now come into play not only from the mainland and hong kong but in bangkok singapore manila kuala lumpur new delhi tokyo and osaka some of those contacts have been made and have been passed on to you others you must make yourself that is for the zhuan to doas it is to continue the fight to subdue our enemies a junk with a sail the color of pumpkins turned the point tacking out to sea its hull canted over as the winter wind took it zilin held out his hand and jake produced an oval of carved jade depicting two creatures locked in mortal combat at some time it had been cleaved into four pieces which were now bound together by solid gold clasps now it is not enough to dream and to spin webs of power he turned the jade over and over in the palm of his hand schemes will fail us in the end if the yuhnhyun the inner circle breaks apart the bond between those of the ring may be more fragile than you can guess yes the triad dragons and the tai pan of my choosing are bound by this fu the emperors seal of carved lavender jade that you and nichiren and bliss and andrew sawyer brought together he lifted the oval into the sunlight its translucence was aglow with a radiance that almost brought the two carved animals to life but consider what the fu depicts the legendary battle between the dragon and the tiger for supremacy of the earth this is perhaps also what we truly speak of when we imagine the enormous task before the yuhnhyun first to protect the new emerging china from its enemies the soviets the british the americans and those in beijing who are determined that communism shall not die second to unite hong kong and the mainland gradually adding japan malaysia indonesia thailand the philippines to take a strong and homogenous china swiftly into the twentyfirst century we must not become divided among ourselves for now the forces are linked my brothers three oaths tsun and t y chung andrew sawyer loyal to me and my family through the unimaginable favor i did him so many years ago the dragons of the three major triads but these dragons especially will be wary constantly seeking to gain an edge over their rivals within the inner circle nor can they be counted upon for substantial amounts of capital their support is manifest in other ways these facts we cannot dispute nor waste energy in trying to change it cannot be changed joss we must ever be aware that our enemiespowerful enemies in many countriesseek to smash the yuhnhyun if they should succeed then hong kong will become a mercantile battleground each country each faction will seek to exploit to his own advantage the riches that flow through hong kong there will be a cessation of profits there will be war and china will sink back into the medieval sloth it is only now beginning to outgrow divided we are vulnerable and may be cut down seek to avoid this at all costs you are zhuan without your strength and expertise china will never make the transition into a modern world power without you and the inner circle there is no hope for us as a people zilin turned his head away from the flat oblate of the sun within the shadows his black eyes sparked with ethereal energy any lesser man would have already succumbed to the debilitating pain of his degenerative disease but though his body had betrayed him his mind was so disciplined that it could effectively cut itself off from the network of nerves that constantly throbbed with pain our enemies are known to us father jake said in russia general daniella vorkuta seeks control of the inner circle and of all hong kong but her agent here sir john bluestone tai pan of five star pacific is well known to usthough he does not suspect that his cover has been blown but already a warning had been sounded the spies jake employed throughout hong kong had reported an odd occurrence a weekend party aboard sir john bluestones foot yacht trireme the guest list included at least four powerful tai pan jake had not been able to find out the names of everyone who was there yet the knowledge that four powerful tai pan had been together with bluestone for a significant amount of time was enough to make him uneasy perhaps the weekend was nothing more than a twoday lark on the south china sea after all bluestones entertaining was legendary in the crown colony but there was that warning buzz that question mark that jake could not erase no matter how hard he tried how he would have liked to have a spy among the crew of the trireme he made a mental note to work on that when he returned to the office you are forgetting the agent still unknown to us who informed chimera that you possessed a piece of the fu zilin said you must find this spy and destroy him how we have suffered because of his treachery the death of mariana the death of your brother nichiren retribution must be taken the spy is deeply buried father jake could not get the party on the trireme out of his mind i am afraid that many roots will have to be unearthed before we discover who it is time is a commodity we are short on jake would you have me tear apart the entire inner circle the jian shook his head absolutely not the inner circle is allimportant if that is destroyed then my entire lifeall my sacrifices all the pain all the deaths i have caused and have been witness to will have been in vain only the yuhnhyun can hold the new china fast against its enemies from without and just as importantly from within but this spy has demonstrated time and time again the ability to hurt us deeply he reached out in a rare physical gesture to grip his sons arm you are the zhuan by all means do as you see fit i know that whatever happens you will not fail me you must keep the yuhnhyun together at all costs i must emphasize these words at all costs if you cannot be ruthless with your allies as well as with your enemies then you will not succeed as zhuan and my ren my fiftyyear harvest will have been for naught consider chinas recent history our own petty bickering allowed the foreign devil to invade us our ignorance of world culture allowed the foreign devil to exploit us all but it was because china had been turned into a huge nation of povertystricken coolies that i knew a concept such as communism could galvanize even a nation as large as ours but communism was only a means to an end those ministers in beijing who still cling to its rigid tenets do so only because of the power it gives them communism is no longer useful to china on the contrary it is impeding our progress my goal all along has been to use hong kong as the sword with which to slowly shed our old outdated doctrines without losing face the method was obvious to me beijing could not be seen to discard wholesale what it had espoused for so many decades my ren has been a constant struggle to save china from itself the old man shook his head hong kong is the key to ourto all of asiasfuture safety and prosperity unfortunately our enemies know this as well he bowed his head and jake said father what is it suddenly the jian seemed old frail desperately tired like an after noon sky abruptly devoid of sunlight zilins countenance was bleak wintry jake felt his stomach tighten in a spasm of anxiety father are you in pain the old man shook his head he held himself carefully as if afraid that he would shake apart the pain i feel has nothing to do with my illness he closed his eyes for a long time not a word passed between them gulls cawed shrilly above them circling in the watery sunlight mist lay along the water like dragons breath jake felt the imminence of terror lurking in the mist jake i have hesitated to tell even you zilin said at last but the time is now such that i no longer have a choice he held the jade tightly in a fist made white by tension the one topic about which we do not often speak is kam sang our trump card jake said as you have told me kam sang may very well end up being the salvation of china now the jian shuddered visibly kam sang was always a twoedged sword we all knew that going in in any project of this sort the potential for destruction exists however at the time we felt that the risk was worth taking we felt that we had built in adequate controls and safeguards he took a deep breath but now everything has changed in the deathly silence jake could hear the plashing of the waves as if they were rows of crystal smashing what has happened at kam sang father he could not recognize his own voice his rapid pulse made his ears ring zilin looked out to sea beyond the surf and the small junks lifted high on the oceans crests as they tacked for shore a discovery has been made by the scientific cadre there he said softly a frightening terrible discovery it was accidental they came upon it by chance during their experiments his head swung around and his dark gaze impaled jake it threatensjake it threatens the entire balance of power here in the entire world kam sangs possibility for destruction is now virtually limitless the destructive potential is so heinous that you must ensure that it can never be implemented sane menof all nationalitieswould shun it but there are others he broke off abruptly shivered slightly and turned his face into the wan light the russians would gladly kill for the secret of kam sang so would the americans and the british but you jake you are its sole guardian now he placed the jade fu in jakes hand and said though this jade has been near you and near me yet is it still cool jade is always cool unlike men who grow heated with passions and lusts that is a lesson to be learned zilin placed his hand atop jakes so that the jade linked them there is a saying jake he said older than the tao on the mountain it is dark and cold but without these discomforts there would be nothing he moved his legs in the surf that is where you are nowon the mountain you must begin to feel the dark and the cold without giving them substance you will be lost you will feel only fear for the rest of your life jake felt the sand beneath him felt the salt wind on his cheeks somewhere he heard the sound of childrens laughter a dogs yelp of joy most of all he felt the weight cool and curved of the jade fu father he wanted to say when i learn your lesson will it make me allpowerful or just inhuman but sitting on the beach at repulse bay next to the jian the creator he made no comment at all he merely waited for his father to explain to him what had occurred at kam sangand to explain how the world was now a different and infinitely more dangerous place jin kanzhe was in qianmen just south of beijings tienanmen square in among a warren of tiny side streets filled with food shops and vendors stalls he wore a puttycolored trench coat belted and epauleted the hem reaching to the ground it made him seem even taller and slimmer than he was behind jin kanzhe a torrent of bicycles shot along the main streets the heavy cold damping down almost all sound so that their passing was eerily silent the smell of coal dust turned the air to molasses jin saw the stocky man outside the carpet shop and approached him good morning comrade and how is our lizi our deadly little plum colonel hu sucked on his teeth our lizi is as well as can be expected he said as always colonel hu was uncomfortable around jin his features roughhewn undistinguished were a far cry from the narrow elegance of jin kanzhes the mission concerning the girl went well he asked they moved slowly through the throngs of shoppers jin kanzhe liked to be in motion there was no undue difficulty colonel hu said jin concentrated on a tonal shading he did not recognize the strategy you proposed was the correct one they are used to being sought out near the rivers it has been the established way for years we found cheng and the girl on the mountainside we caught them asleep colonel hu shrugged still i lost two men one more is in a coma these are resourceful people jin kanzhe wondered whether it was a note of respect he detected in colonel hus voice we used every precaution and still they were able to counterattack it was a pity about her escort jin kanzhe said i would have preferred to put him under articulated interrogation cheng colonel hu shrugged he died a soldiers death he took a bullet through the heart jin kanzhe snorted a soldiers death you give it a romantic ring there is nothing romantic about death colonel hu said nothing they turned right as they came to the end of the block they were in an area adjacent to the railway station as they walked they passed a line of traditional apothecaries their narrow interiors lined with dusty glass cases stocked with deer antlers ground tigers teeth ginseng root and all manner of fungi jin kanzhe nodded dismissing the subject it is the girl who concerns us after all we have wu aiping to thank for detecting her presence among the steel tiger triad his almost pathological interest in the shis led him to track down before his death her identity and whereabouts this was the legacy left for his friend huaishan han he led us to the girl yes jin kanzhe said thoughtfully she will soon be the engine of your making there is a good chance colonel hu said slowly that what you are asking me to do to her will change her in a very basic manner yes jin kanzhe said to himself yes she is like some mythical creature all men who look upon her face are captivated by her he stopped turned to face colonel hu i must tell you something in no uncertain terms this is so critical that neither of us can afford to misunderstand the other he was silent for a moment allowing his intense gaze to register on the other man after a time colonel hu nodded yes sir for the first time he understood the true nature of his discomfort around this man i am afraid of him colonel hu thought with some surprise jin kanzhe knows how desirable the lizi is has she so profoundly affected me her captor is jin kanzhe making a shrewd guess what troubled hu most was that he himself did not know the answer good comrade colonel zheige lizi hai mei shu ne this plum is not yet ripe but that doesnt mean that she is not dangerous on the contrary she is exceptionally deadly jin kanzhe abruptly began to walk again and colonel hu taken unawares was obliged to hurry to catch up you have a point colonel hu said however i must confess that i am unsure whether you are aware of just how deadly i have made her jin kanzhe turned his head the oblique light flashed off his eyes as if energy was pouring out of him tell me comrade colonel he said have you ever been to sea colonel hu was puzzled no sir the truth is the water makes me seasick jin kanzhe laughed yes that seems to be the case for many of our countrymen however there is a nautical term that you should take to heart when it comes to our lizi our unripe fruit she is like a beautiful sloop with her one may come to feel that anything is possible therefore beware of sailing too close to the wind comrade colonel otherwise you may find yourself drowned he glanced at his watch i am late colonel hu knew a dismissal when he heard one he watched jin kanzhe stride off in a moment the tall man was swallowed up in the swirl of pedestrian and bicycle traffic that ran like an endless river through qianmen ian mckenna was out with his police unit quelling a disturbance in stanley when he was handed the briefcase one moment he was directing three of his men in beating back a phalanx of jabbering chinese so intent on getting through the doors of the closing hongkong bangkok trust bank that they had flung aside the sawhorses mckennas men had erected the next a nondescript chinese had placed something in his free hand at sixfootthree mckenna was easy to spot for a moment mckenna was not even aware of what had happened he was intent on parting a chinese from his teeth swinging his burnished teak walking stick over his head and bringing it down with a crunch he believed to be one of the most satisfying sounds in the world then as the blood began to flow and he was about to step over the prone chinese he became aware of the added weight he turned his head saw the briefcase and the nondescript chinese at the same moment inspector ian mckenna this is for you hey he called hey you but it was already too late the figure melted into the riot of color and motion that surged all around him mckenna was known as great pool of piddle by all the chinese who came into contact with himand this included those who served under himbut never to his face only when they were among their own speaking in their native tongue mckenna was a firehaired australian who spoke cantonese and a smattering of the hakka dialect with an atrocious accent he had served his apprenticeship in police work in the outback down under before emigrating to hong kong ten years before he was made a corporal in the crown colonys police force and by a combination of a roughhewn guile and an often violent force of will worked himself up to the rank of captain he possessed the animals innate ability to go for the jugular when confronting his enemies this trait caused him to be feared by almost as many of his superiors as those who toiled in his command but there were others who did not fear ian mckenna among them was formidable sung the of hong kongs largest cantonese triad the k it was formidable sung who failing to strike a bargain with mckenna had discovered the australians weakness photographs had been obtained of mckenna and an elevenyearold chinese boy in poses of such extreme intimacy that the public exposure of same would spell not only instant dismissal for mckenna but more than likely criminal prosecution now twice a week mckenna reported the details of his pending workload directly to formidable sung in a break with tradition it had been the himself who had handed mckenna the sheaf of photographic prints sealed in a glossy crimson envelope the symbolic gesturesuch a red envelope was traditionally given to a defeated business rival along with a token sum of money in order for him to keep some semblance of facehad not been lost on the australian he would never forget the moment formidable sung placed the thing in his hand each sound each smell and above all the laughing glitter in the s eyes were indelibly etched into mckennas brain he would not forget such an insult for formidable sungby coming himself to the rendezvous and by staring openly into his face when he slit open the envelopehad left mckenna with no face at all now as the men in mckennas command beat back the last of the wouldbe rioters mckenna wondered what new indignity the dragon of the k was foisting upon him his face was red and not from the exertion of wading through a bunch of hysterical heathens mckenna blew his whistle calling his men back to the wagon that had brought them from the station house he stared down at the unconscious chinese and spat heavily into his broken face what he really wanted to do was spit into formidable sungs face he turned stomping back to the police wagon thinking one day ill do just that then ill watch ft is face turn red a pox on him and all his accursed triad mckenna did not open the briefcase until he had returned to the precinct even then he did not trust the operation to his office instead he went down the mustysmelling hall to the evilsmelling mens room one grimy window was painted shut the black desiccated bodies of flies lay on the rotting sill above one of their brothers still alive beat itself feebly against the painted glass there was just enough sunlight filtering in to give it a false sense of hope mckenna paused the taptaptapping of the fly seemed to echo eerily in the enclosed space taking on supernormal proportions suddenly mckenna was back in australias northern territories outside of bundooma the edges of the simpson desert where he and his partner had tracked a trio of aborigines accused of stealing six head of steer mckenna remembered how his partner deak jones had balked at the sight of the simpson not in there mate he had said the eyes in his sunburned face squinting up let the buggers go theyll fry anyway in there january in the simpson was no place for a living thing to be without shade and water in good supply thats their turf mckenna had replied theyll slaughter the animals as they go drink their blood eat their flesh theyll get off scot free if we turn back now they were starving they stole in order to live theyll see this mckenna unholstered his magnum theyll know theyve done wrong he licked his lips cocking back the hammer its our job deak mlad if we dont have that we dont have a bloody thing were going to bring them back ian deak said eying the muzzle of the huge pistol lets remember that mckenna grinned savagely push off mate push off it took them two days to get the scent and overtake the abos near to dusk they topped a rise and found the trio and what was left of the cattle by then they had been in the desert for close to fifty hours and it had taken its toll they were dehydrated and without sleep and jumpy enough to be spooked by any sound of unknown origin lets take them deak said through crusted lips and mckenna had headed down the slope silent as a dog the aborigines looked up at the policemens approach as mckenna had predicted they had slaughtered a steer its blood was pooled at its open belly nothing was said the aborigines made no move there was no animosity on their faces no remorse not even mckenna had thought later surprise all right deak had begun beginning a speech mckenna knew well mckenna drew his magnum and shot them each once through the center of their foreheads they pitched forward at once covering the animal they had so recently slit open christ jesus deak swung on his partner have you gone mad we were meant to take them back alive mate ableedinglive mckenna bolstered his weapon now you listen to me were more than two days into this stinking hellhole there were three of them and only two of us how long would we realistically last dyou think you could stay awake another night or get by on four hours sleep what dyou think would happen if you closed your eyes even for a moment theyd be all over you and then me thats what this was the safest way the only way they camped there for the night feasting on the carcass of the steer but the flies had come scenting the reek of death it was odd to see them in the desert but they were unstoppable crawling all over the steer and the abos without a trace of discrimination taptaptap in the last of the light mckenna had turned his head taptaptap his gaze followed the sound back to its source a fly was beating against the open filmed eye of one of the natives as if it was a pane of glass as if it were trapped taptaptap taptaptap over and over again without meaning until the tattoo began to grate on mckenna he got up and walked over to the corpse taptaptap he looked down into the opaque orb taptaptap god rot you his boot lashed out viciously crashing into the ashen face shuddup wiped what was left of the fly off his sole the dead abo wouldnt know or mind but that night mckenna had heard the recurring sound again and this time he could do nothing to stop it he was staked out on the sere desert floor sunlight blinding him and he felt them all over his exposed flesh the flies crawling he awoke from the dream dripping wet his heart pounding painfully in his chest deak jones was sitting close to him his knees drawn up he was staring into mckennas face when he saw him awake he said i was wondering if you could tell me how youre able to sleep when they had returned to civilization jones had asked for a transfer and mckenna had not seen him again but as for the taptaptapping that was another matter entirely now thousands of miles and thirteen years later that moment in time rushed back on mckenna with the force of a piledriver in two quick steps he crossed the small room and reaching out a spatulate thumb and forefinger squeezed the bloated black fly against the dirtencrusted pane like getting rid of a pimple he said and went into one of the two adjacent cubicles he closed the door and locked it sat down with the briefcase across his lap for a time he did nothing he shook out a cigarette and lit up taking the tobacco deep into his lungs the air hissed in exhalation it was like a sigh of resignation perhaps with a sudden flip mckenna unsnapped the brass latches he opened the lid unconsciously he held his breath the cigarette dangled loosely from his pursed lips smoke curling past his eye christ it was a reedy whisper as if of their own accord his hands began to flip through the stacks of bills three thousand dollars us currency part of his mind still numb he did a recount and came to the same total only then did he see the note it was taped to the inside of the lid he opened it for services rendered he read should such a weekly stipend be of interest to you please come to hair pin beach at two thirty this morning at the second light stanchion three kilometers northeast of stanley walk straight down the beach to the edge of the water the note typewritten and obviously untraceable was unsigned mckennas gaze was drawn back as if by magnetic polarity to the contents of the briefcase he gave a little shiver as if of anticipation there was a small painting by georges seurat that rodger donovan had brought with him when he had moved into the office that had been antony beridiens until the thendirector of the quarry had been assassinated donovan thought of it as a most extraordinary painting it had been a gift twice dailyat dawn and duskwhen the light from outside was right the points of seemingly disparate colors swirled through eye and brain to create a unity of tone and even quite miraculously form that was donovan supposed why he was drawn so strongly to seurats work it was the miracles the artist could perform for donovan was quite certain that no true miracles existed in daytoday life seurat had the ability to take donovan quite out of himself now with the heavy gunmetal rain rattling against the windowpanes he turned away from his contemplation of a miracle the buzzer sounded again and he said come the thick door opened between two threeinch mahogany panels a sheet of steelalloy an inch thick protected him from the unlikely event of an attack unlikely because of the sixlevel security system he had had installed after the death of henry wunderman a tall lanky figure stood in the doorway he wore a donegaltweed sweater pleated wool trousers the color of burnt butterscotch and cordovan tasseled loafers his long frizzy hair and high forehead made him seem no older than nineteen or twenty rather than his true age of thirtyone he was paleeyed and fairskinned with cheeks made ruddy in the winter by skiing in the summer by windsurfing donovan gestured to a bentwood chair take a pew tony tony simbals long strides ate up the distance between them like gary grants they were fluid so effortless they attracted the attention of a majority of the female population in his immediate vicinity he folded himself into the chair his longfingered hands neatly folded over his crossed knees how was new york donovan asked simbal grunted grimy and theres so much traffic these days youre forced underground in order to get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time he grinned down there you need a magnum in order to survive nothing untoward occurred i take it not really i just bared my teeth at the natives that seemed enough to keep the zulus at bay zulus donovan gave a little laugh his handsome blond visage breaking its somber facade that word took him back tony simbal was a relative newcomer to the quarry still he was one of the closest to donovan that was because the new director had reached out his long arm and snatched simbal away from the dea donovan and simbal had gone through the stanford mill together they had been fiercely competitive roommates fraternity brothers and the best of friends they had grown up together their fathers vying for regional chess titles all along the pacific coast in rebuilding the quarry after the twin debacles of beridiens and wundermans deaths donovans aim was absolute trust his recruitment of tony simbal was the essence of that trust in high school the two boys had actually gone after the same girl she being openminded and flattered had dated each one on alternating saturday nights until they had asked her to make a choice she had told them that she could not because each had qualities she loved and did not want to give up and that comment had sealed their friendship forever after that they continued to compete with one anothermostly in the academic worldbut neither really kept score of the victories and defeats they seemed to share the elation and the disappointments equally remembering what that girl in high school had told them now long after both had forgotten her name they recalled that moment in time as if it had the magical aura of arthur pulling excalibur free of the stone no zulus in chinatown donovan said now zulus had been their word for blacks on the wrong side of the law no simbal agreed only one very dead white man how bad was it the tall man grimaced he got up restless in highrises of any kind he crossed to where the seurat hung looked like a barbecue gotten all out of hand his face was basically fleshless can you believe this alan thune was roasted by a dragon pardon simbal was still studying the seurat it was chinese new year thune was set to pick up payment for threequarters of a ton of number four opium the tears of the poppy instead he met up with a dragon it opened its mouth and fried thune donovan looked at him and simbal smiled the dragons traditional at new years a papiermache head people inside only this time there was also an antipersonnel flamethrower there couldntve been much left of him donovan said simbal grunted there wasnt but our boys did a dnt on him all the molars were in the right place it was alan thune all right bastard donovan sat back in his leather swivel chair i only wish i had been the one to do it behind him through the darkblue latticework of the bali microblinds simbal could see the white house part of the immaculately tended rose garden both were partially obscured by the rain he wondered what it was about thune that had gotten under donovans skin at stanford he remembered there was nothing that fazed that handsome placid facade not the most difficult final not the breakup with a girlfriend it wasnt simbal had eventually learned that donovan did not have emotions it was that he wasnt fond of putting them on display as he had now you spent two years in southeast asia donovan said after a time all that time you were monitoring the diqui diqui the mandarin word for the planet earth seemed an altogether accurate name for an organization of such vast power and influence any ideas as to whats going on simbal was still focused on the seurat this the real thing no donovan said a copy i only wish i had the real thing id have to go back to paris for that simbal grunted swung around the light was fading theres no easy explanation as to why a mans fried by a dragon but one things certain it was a gaudy public way to go and that tells us something a warning simbal nodded no doubt but of what thune was the diquis top american courier was he skimming from the diqui is someone making a move against them was it a personal vendetta did the diqui itself have some gripe against thune he shrugged right now its impossible to say donovans gray eyes regarded his friend for a time a french antique carriage clock ticktocked on a chrome and rosewood sideboard across the room outside the window umbrellas were being shredded as the wind picked up it sounded as if disgruntled demonstrators were throwing pebbles against the steelmesh glass i dont care for the word impossible whats your best guess simbal went back to the chair folded himself into it again for a time he said nothing the carriage clock marked the interstices of silence ive run as much as i have through the computer simbals voice carried a tone of absolute authority but you know what i think of computers rodger they only spew out what other people have programmed into them federal agents are by and large nitwits they are trained to think in terms of budgets and of what has happened before they lack imagination and therefore their informational data banks possess the same drawback donovan laced his fingers began to tap their tips together dont tell me that brain of yours hasnt narrowed the possibilities simbal smiled thinly my nose says that it wasnt the diquis doing ive traveled after thune for a long time unless hes done something very bad while ive blinked his standing inside the diqui was solid in fact i suspect that he was being readied to move up someone was grooming him for bigger things than the fun city run like who simbal shook his head sorry i havent been able to get that far yet then take another tack simbal watched donovans head it seemed he was holding it still with some great inner force and once again he asked himself whats gotten under rodgers skin whatever it takes simbals eyes opened wide schiffer wont like it he was speaking of his dry section case officer field operatives were wet section he didnt even like it that i went off to new york without letting him know he chewed my ear off about it first thing this morning thats all in the past donovan said meaning from now on you report to me and me alone clear simbals eyes seemed as pale as winter sunlight on inimical ice when i was in burma i met a woman a girl really she was a shan she had that almost polynesian beauty the burmese possess she was uneducated from a western point of view but she could outshoot threequarters of the deas marksmen including me and her father possessed undreamedof wealth mainly in uncut gemstones though i seem to recall that he dealt in the tears of the poppy as well in the shan states rodger there is no such thing as civilization there is only life and death only love and hate that realization shook me apart it was why i realized i had come there why i turned down that plum job at cray computers that the rest of the top ten percent of our class probably would have killed for i am not i suspect a civilized man simbal hunched forward now and donovan could see the power in his hands i do not like civilizations dictates and its rules cray was not for me neither was dea which has rules up the yinyang you couldnt pee without writing up forms i dont like writing forms and you didnt like reporting to schiffer donovan said i know that he looked at simbal in my predecessors time the quarry was mainly concerned with the machinations emanating out of moscow that was perhaps inevitable antony beridien founded this organization during the reign of john fitzgerald kennedy simbal snorted reign isnt that a little grandiose to describe an american presidents term of office not when were talking about jfk beridien spent many hours talking about those times camelot remember thats how the press spoke of kennedys reign the shining hundred days donovan grunted everything in americas reduced to the parameters of an advertising slogan advertisings what catches the american publics attention tony otherwise theyre too busy buying new toyotas and subarus to be aware of anything but we both know advertising for what it is bullshit simbal contemplated this allamerican fairhaired prodigy that his longtime friend had evolved into whod have thunk it he thought wonderingly back in the stanford days we were just two sexcharged boy geniuses look at the misfits weve turned into so the both of us need to get out out its civilization rodger it stinks ive said it now you have too in your own way donovan thought about that for a moment i was speaking about antony beridien and kennedy kennedy gave the quarry its original charter it was beridiens brainchild but it was jfk who breathed the breath of life into it the quarry tony was born out of paranoia the world was shrinking at a terrifying overwhelming rate in the sixties it seemed as if the russians were right next door the cuban missile crisis proved that dramatically anyway beridien and kennedy were asshole buddies the president knew strength when he saw it and he gave beridien his head but there was a caveat each incoming president had the option to cancel the quarrys charter within the first month of his term of office that was for a specific reason the quarry is the presidents responsibility period we dont have nosy senators ferreting around were not dependent on capitol hill for funds no one knows us or what we really do were a lonewolf quantity undoubtedly the last in american governmental history i want you to remember that donovan put his hands flat on the table it was beridiens obsession to go after the soviets not mine these days there are other more pressing matters that require our attention which is why i appropriated you from the dea the diqui was your bailiwick there and we need that experience here in the quarry international dope smugglings not exactly the quarrys thing simbal said deas got that tied up pretty tightly and i dont have to tell you how my old boss max threnody guards his territory he gets bent out of shape if someone extraagency even requests dea data thats just fine by me donovan said threnody can have all the cocaine and opium his operatives can lay their hands on youre right dopes not our thing but kam sang is ive been trying to get a line on that topsecret chinese project for a yearandahalf thats the main reason i tried to reenlist jake maroc some months ago i got a hunch he knows what kam sangs all about i have reports that his father has some link to kam sang what the old man knows i figure jake knows too why dont you ask him then very funny jake was loyal to the old quarry regime then they threw him out he wouldnt tell me the time of day if it didnt suit his purpose simbal came over to the desk what has kam sang got to do with alan thunes incineration i dont know donovan admitted maybe nothing at all but all of a sudden our far east signals eavesdropping is detecting diqui interest in kam sang why thats not their bailiwick either anyone been on this simbal wanted to know powers and choi shouldnt i speak to them in person youd better have a line on a good medium donovan said theyre six feet under dead shot through the eyes both of them diqui trademark simbal wondered whether this was why donovan was pissed off donovan stood ive got a feeling tony that somethings been started and now its out of control alan thunes death may be the start of an international bloodbath simbal watched donovans face about threnody he said what do i tell him oh christ use your imagination donovan said but whatever you tell him make sure it isnt the truth just east of a section of connaught road central was sawyer place the only street in hong kong named after an american the centerpiece of the twoblock narrow thoroughfare was the sawyer building a whitestone and bluegranite affair that had been built in the mids when such grandiose workmanship was still affordable now even the bank of china had to have its stone cut in canada to help defray the impossible cost of labor many companies were housed within this structure that stood between connaught tower and the equally ornate building that had until some months before been the home of mattias king company once the oldest and most renowned of all the major trading houses in asia mattias king companys new londonborn tai pan had seen fit perhaps at the urging of the queen herself to move the venerable houses headquarters to bermuda ostensibly that had been to ensure a taxfree haven for the company but privately the other tai pan in the crown colony knew that it was a panic move away from what the british obviously saw as communist chinese intervention on the freemarket running of hong kong while it awaited the building of its gargantuan new office tower designed by i m pei the bank of china had temporarily moved into the mattias king building it was andrew sawyer said a sign of the changing times the old tai pan his snowy hair much receded on his freckled scalp turned away from the tenfoothigh windows that looked out at all of kowloon victoria harbor and the hazy recesses of the asian continent from his office aerie atop the sawyer building sawyer sons was one of the handful of most successful western trading houses in hong kong and it had been so for many years in shanghai where the firm had been started by andrew sawyers father zilin had begun a clandestine partnership with barton sawyer the shis were not only a secret part owner of sawyer sons but andrew sawyer owed zilin a personal debt he could never fully repay without zilins intervention when he had been young and foolish andrew sawyer would never have become tai pan of the trading house that exalted position would have gone to chen ju barton sawyers trusted comprador peter ngs being revealed as a soviet spy andrew sawyer said now referring to his former comprador was the beginning of our woes it left security in a goddamned mess and the first thing i want to do is to hang sir john bluestone up by his thumb i dont think that would be the most prudent thing to do jake sitting in a leather sofa at the side of the enormous office said this slowly and calmly there was enormous tension in the room it had generated even before this extraordinary meeting of the yuhnhyuns principlesjake sawyer three oaths tsun and t y chunghad gotten under way it was sawyer the rings daytoday caretaker who had called the emergency session since the business feud between three oaths and t y chunga ruse dreamed up by zilin to allow both his brothers to amass fortunes and allies who would never have joined the two togetherwas still very much a public issue it was most dangerous for the two to be seen together nothing less than a fullfledged emergency would have caused andrew sawyer to bring the men together in broad daylight he felt that he had had no choice it was fornicating bluestone who turned my comprador its bluestone who is the soviets most highranking agent in all of asia sawyer said angrily he tapped a manila envelope weve got more than enough hard proof to convict him i told you before that we should have shut him down give me one good reason now why we shouldnt have special branch come and haul him away the primary one is that we now know who our enemy is jake said reasonably you are asking me to give up an enormous advantage and that i will not do we are in a position to monitor sir john bluestone the soviets most important agent on this continent if he is removed who will daniella vorkuta replace him with we wont know the man until perhaps it is too late also bluestones networks which we are finally beginning to infiltrate will be blown along with him his control at moscow center daniella vorkuta is sure to see to that shell close everything down and start over well be in the dark again is that what you want sawyer came and sat down in a chair at jakes left he ran a thin hand through the wispy strands of hair combed down over his mottled skull of course not no his cool blue eyes flashed but i want my justice against bluestone and so you shall have it jake said evenly in time the season has not yet come for reaping andrew meanwhile our empire is falling down around us bluestone is fighting us by proxy for control of our companywhich includes pak the subsidiary invested in the kam sang project it is vital that we maintain a majority interest in that warren of companies isnt that so honorable tsun i created the companies three oaths said i would say yes without that subsidiary we would lose close to two hundred million dollars american and the yuhnhyuns control of kam sang is absolutely vital jake said there can be no debate about this but our fight for control of pak combined with our own increased investment in kam sang has seriously depleted our liquidity sawyer said do you know what that means t y chung jumped in never in my life have i seen so much capital expended so quickly as we have poured into interasia trading we are three of the most wealthy tai pan in all of asia yet because of the extraordinary guidelines laid down to us by shi zilin we have assigned all our assets over to the zhuan i do not even know where my capital has gone to overextension three oaths said i dislike saying it but perhaps the jian has erred he turned to jake i still do not understand why we needed to start up this new entity interasia trading at a time when as the honorable chung has pointed out we are all expending our ready cash to keep kam sang on line it seems to me a grave miscalculation to have generated an entire new corporation especially one in which all our accumulated wealth has been sunk gods all our money is in interasia trading this can no longer be a secret from our enemies you know that zhuan i fear that interasia will become a lodestone attracting the business sharks what that dunggatherer bluestone wouldnt pay to take control of interasia trading there is the other side to consider jake said quietly because of my fathers maneuvering we now have a new business entity without a history or a modus operandi we can in short utilize interasia trading for any and all purposes we desire without causing even one eyebrow in the business or governmental sectors to be raised such freedom is impossible with our existing companies including southasia bancorp our banking subsidiary it is impossible with any of our other sector companies engaged in shipping warehousing real estate and so on interasia trading is an entity for the future a company to mold as we see fit eventually it will become an umbrella of new sector companies but precisely what businesses will interasia be used for zhuan t y chung asked we are still in the dark as to why we have all put our entire financial empires on the line interasia is not the subject of this session andrew sawyer interjected pardon me zhuan but i have withheld this news too long as it is using a linen handkerchief to wipe his sweating pate he continued it is my sad duty to inform you that as of midnight this morning our auditors have found that the comptroller of our southasia bancorp arm has systematically tunneled over twentyfive million dollars into private holdings outside the colony jake sat very still and he thought when this hits the press well be ruined all gods strike down wormridden bankers three oaths exploded nothing good ever came of those institutions i put my gold bars underneath my bed and dont have to worry about such defecators jake waited patiently until the tirade ended then he said youre certain it was teck yau absolutely sawyer said weve traced him to an air india flight to new delhi he is no doubt already in switzerland or liechtenstein laughing his head off about how much he stole from us leaving us to deal with the mess he made jake tapped his finger against the arm of the chair the first thing we must do is make sure there is no scandal one whiff of this in the local press and the southasia bancorp could suffer an irreversible loss of confidence among its depositors he did not have to add that the majority of them were chinese who like three oaths did not have much confidence in such western concepts as banks to begin with a scandal of this magnitude could cause a run that would shut down the southasia bancorp within a week since a majority of the yuhnhyuns freemarket cash flowed through the institution such an occurrence would be an utter financial disaster one from which jake very much suspected they could not recover surely he thought my father could not have anticipated this perhaps my uncle is right perhaps i have overgambled our position he thought again of bluestones weekend boat party what did it portend it would be unthinkable for him to go to his father in this situation that would undermine his authority permanently no he was zhuan he must take control and immediately andrew i want everything youve gotten so far on the loss jake turned to three oaths uncle i want you to contact the triad dragons who are part of the yuhnhyun all their power is to be exerted in clamping down on the incident if it reaches the press were dead in the water even they wont be able to keep tongues from wagging forever zhuan three oaths said you know how rumors spread in this city true jake said rising but all we need is a week or so by that time ill have found a way to siphon money back into southasia three oaths nodded ill do what you ask and so will they ill see to it personally good jake said and he thought we arc already on the brink one tiny gust of wind will send us tumbling over the edge he thought of what he had once learned many years ago one must seek to injure the comers when one comes up against a strong enemy fo saan his teacher his guide the extraordinary man zilin had sent to train him had counseled jake if you attack a foe who is obviously stronger than you in a direct fashion his spirit will overcome you and he will smite you down seek then to strike swiftly at the corners of his force in that way the main bodys spirit will be weakened and you may find a path to your enemys heart in a moment jake had made his decision it was obvious to him that the person who would benefit the most from the dissolution of southasia was bluestoneand daniella vorkuta could bluestone have infiltrated the inner circle yet again he had done it once as andrew had been quick to point out why not a second time jake rose and looked at the other men til leave you to get down to work then he hardly remembered going down in the elevator and getting into his car the moment he left sawyers office he had pushed the southasia fiasco to the back of his mind nothing to be done about that until sawyer delivered more detailed information jake turned his mind to the news reports coming out of tokyo and osaka bliss had called him in from the shower and dripping he had watched the television cameras recording the shattering aftermath of what the announcer called the bloodiest clash yet in the recent territorial wars between the rival yakuza clans kisan and komoto jakes closest friend mikio komoto was oyabun boss of the komoto clan jake was most concerned about mikio these scenes of death and destructionthree twisted bodies headless and bloated a burnedout building in osaka flames engulfing yet another structure in downtown tokyo following a thunderous detonation that many apparently took to be an earthquakefollow hard on the heels of a tactical battle that until earlier this month had remained very much in the shadows as an ongoing series of skirmishes more shots panning terrified faces more blood black and smeared by the imperfections of the broadcast medium now the wholesale slaughter that some officials of tokyos special antiyakuza task force had been predicting is here at last the only question remaining is where will it end jake had made a grab for the phone and called his friend but mikio komoto was not at home he was told yes his message would be passed on any way jake could be of help he would this morning after reading the newspaper dispatches jake tried to phone his friend no answer on his way into sawyers office he had asked sei an sawyers secretary to try mikio komotos home number again with the same negative result where is mikio jake asked himself what has happened to him when tony simbal arrived at max threnodys townhouse in georgetown the party was already in full swing threnody a tall slight bostonian had about him a rather donnish air as if he had come straight across the quad at oxford and was brushing the ivy leaves off his academic robes because of this image nobody in his right mind would believe that he was one of the ranking members of the drug enforcement agency he had also been simbals immediate superior in the dea it had been threnodys devious mind that had put simbal in the shan states to begin with the shan states in the middle of the golden triangle was where the majority of the worlds opium was harvested and refined into heroin of course it was a major dea target the shan states a mountainous region of northern burma shoved up against the china border were ruled by any number of tribal warlords whose armies were at constant war with the burmese and chinese governments both governments wished to wipe out the opium trade threnodys creamcolored townhouse was on r street in the hinterlands of georgetown from his kitchen windows could be seen a generous corner of dumbarton oaks from his upstairs bedroom one could see patches of lovers lane through the brushstrokes of the trees the party was mainly dea but as simbal strolled through the downstairs he saw a sprinkling of representatives from state congress even the cia there was nothing official about this party so whoever was here was strictly on amorous status with dea in other words it was a friendly affair the place was cozy filled with french provincial furniture more comfortable than might be expected the color tones tended toward the earth range built it seemed around the paintings displayed with such loving care whatever investments threnody had made were in the form of art which besides his work was his lone passion he loved the impressionists such as degas monet and manet and the related but less subtle pissarro and cezanne whose almost hallucinatory work he could absorb for hours on end like them he shared that tangential resonance with later luminaries so that it was not surprising to find a small picasso drawing here a minor braque there among the work of their artistic forebears the house had always had a calming effect on simbal he picked up a beer and went to say hello to his host threnody was in the kitchen his hands deep in some concoction he had just pulled from the cuisinart simbal had to squeeze out of the way as a couple of young modish dea types came laughing through looking for the ice threnody directed them in goodnatured fashion simbal felt a pressure against his back and turned around to find himself staring straight into those violet eyes hello monica he said he heard threnody say from behind him see you later tony then with a little laugh maybe its been a while monica starrs voice was just this side of husky her midnight hair was long cascading back from her face down her shoulders the effect was breathtaking when simbal had known her she had had short hair and there had been a pixieish quality about her that was now gone but she had been younger then he told himself the huntergreen sweater over the siennacolored gored tweed skirt showed how she had filled out after a while simbal became aware that she had begun to lead him out of the jammed kitchen weaving a path for them through the boisterous crowd the lights were off in one of the downstairs back rooms the bed was piled high with coats hats scarves and handbags a streetlight filtering in through the window provided ghostly illumination monica was wreathed in shadows she wore little makeup diamond studs in her ears like a prima ballerina he thought a small gold watch with a green lizard band on one wrist no other jewelry monica he said she smiled and slapped him hard across the face thats for walking out on me simbal stood very still it was a mission monica jesus christ what did you expect to hear from you when you got back i had to go to max and ask him if you had gotten back at all there was a quiver there and a thickness to her voice as her emotions swelled threatening to break through her iron resolve do you have any conception of what that cost me it is max threnodys considered opinion that running is too dangerous for women were too unpredictablei think that was his wordfor field work too emotional up until the moment when i burst into his office in tearsin tears over you you sonofabitchi think i was doing okay with him wearing him down to the point where hed give me the goahead to do some running on my own then he saw what youd done to me and that was the end for me do you understand what that means i put my guts into this job if i have anywhere else to go i sure dont know about it simbal thought he saw a glitter in her eyes the cusp of tears she had perhaps promised herself he would never see even a dog gets treated better than you treated me monica im sorry he reached out but she shook him off that wont make it right you know it wont he could sense how much it took for her to keep herself together max told me i was mad to feel anything for you he was right wasnt he the silence brought a bubble of laughter bursting in on them an ironic intruder someone came inneither of them saw whosaid oops and hastily departed answer me she had not raised her voice only lowered the pitch the result was akin to an animals warning growl simbal recalled his discussion with rodger donovan how could he explain his feelings about civilization to this woman she had been born in philadelphia had been educated in the best eastern private schools before going to smith what kind of experience could she have had with the primitive side of life how could she possibly understand the lure of the absolutes that civilization sought so hard to dissipate life and death love and hate no trappings no psychological baggage no modern jargon high up in the mountains of the shan states if someone crossed you you didnt say fuck you you killed him finis because it was wild up there the poppy fields brought danger secrecy doublecrosses in the shan states the strong survived feeding off the weak he wanted very much to lie to her but just as he was about to do so he paused biting his lip why should he lie that was the civilized thing to do and he was tired of civilization i saw something in you he said that i thought id never see again why she tossed her head what do you mean the last time we made love the night before i left i had my eyes open i saw the look on your face i wanted it to last but i knew that good smith girl that you are id most likely look for that emotion again and never find it monica moved and the streetlight oblique and opaque struck her she was shadowstriped and simbal recalled another woman striped in just the same way by the jungle foliage high up on a mountainside he could scent again her peculiar muskiness the animal smell of the jungle itself and behind them in her fathers house the heady perfume of the crates of uncut gems youre too civilized for me monica it was out before he had a chance to bite his tongue oh shit he thought now ive gone and done it monica threw her head back and laughed a harsh bitter sound he watched her long neck the argon streetlight turning her dusky flesh pale the arch of her throat made him feel heavy in his chest is that it she was virtually weeping with brittle laughter what a schmuck you are tony really i went to smith sure for twoandahalf years then i dropped out it wasnt the pressure that got to me i never felt any it was something else entirely something i couldnt define for a long time not to my college adviser not to my parents not even to myself i worked for a year at a baskinrobbins on the upper west side of manhattan while i was there we were held up maybe a dozen times a girl standing right beside me got shot to death we had bums coming in and throwing up all over the shiny counter we had guys come in and make a grab for usserious grabs they were interested in doing a lot more to our asses than pinching them but dont feel sorry for me i put in my time i made my own money because i didnt want to touch my old mans i was fed up with that as well that was part of it the feeling i couldnt quite define so after my year in hell i got out of new york of the us of a of the world as i knew it i went to tahiti and saw a mcdonalds sign i nearly vomited on the spot i went further past bora bora until i got to a beach that had no one on it where the nearest town was made of bamboo and dried plantain leaves where nobody would bother me for eighteen months i was alone with the bluegreen sea and the golden sky i watched the birds and they i suppose watched me they didnt care what i looked like or how i felt which was just fine with me why did you come back simbal said softly he could see just a hint of the amethyst in her eyes he thought her face had never looked more feline or full of energy because i found that you cantor i cant at any ratelive my life without human contactintelligent human contact learned people but being away from it all simbal began is what makes coming back all the more fascinating im sorry he said again monicas eyes went opaque the way they did when she was confused now i think you mean it i suppose i didnt before he conceded not really youre arrogant tony her soft tone went right through him you were so sure you knew me through and through the perfect rich girl breeding and schooling what more could a family ask of its child you must have broken your mothers heart my fathers too her full lips were back the tight compression another outward sign of her rage was gone i never came out i never finished college they dont even know what i really do government work my father tells his colleagues as if hes describing rat poison to him i am something incomprehensible a bureaucrat tony laughed maybe you should take max home one day that would seal your fate on the contrary she said i should really take you home to meet my parents he thought she was joking until he saw in her eyes that she was quite serious you would shake daddys tree something fierce she said simbal was abruptly aware of how close monica was to him her perfume hinted of jonquils and jasmine he reached out and this time she did not brush him away she made no move at all simbal felt his heart beating heavily this was not why he had come to the party there were some things he needed to find out and this was the place to begin the only place he had ferreted around for several days casually dropping in on known dea hangouts in georgetown and washingtons northwest sector at lunchtime nothing heavy just a casual beer and a subtle bump oh hi long time no see that sort of thing thats how he had found out about the party he knew that peter curran would be there if he was in town if not someone there would certainly have a line on currans whereabouts curran was the man simbal knew he had to see curran had taken over simbals role as chief diqui hunter at the dea that meant he had been in southeast asia or at least runningdeaspeak for field workwhile simbal had been in the necessary but frustrating transition period in washington learning the quarry system and training at the movie house the sprawling farm the quarry maintained in rural virginia for this reason alone he had told himself he had come to the party now he knew that he had been at least partially fooling himself he did not understand how badly until this electric moment smith wasnt a complete waste she was saying now her eyes were half mocking heres something interesting i learned there simbal felt his belt loosening then his trousers in an instant her hand had encompassed him monica made a husky sound you never wore these tiny briefs when i knew you whos been buying your underpants lately are you crazy simbal was regaining his equilibrium what if someone comes in but he was already hard and monica had peeled down his briefs now she moved so that she had her back to the doorway shadows danced in the room like ghosts spilled over from the party it could have been in another universe for all the meaning it had for the two of them if someone comes in monica said softly ill give her a reason to leave she put one foot on the low window sill and with her free hand lifted up her skirt drew simbal against her he gasped and she smiled she wore only a garter belt beneath her skirt and he felt the tangle of jungly hair caressing the end of him lets get you wet she said moving him against her lips monica what tell me what but his eyes were already closed she took a fierce greedy delight in watching the emotions play across his face his desire had made him a tabula rasa she no longer recognized him it was as if the burden of civilization had already been dispelled from him the hard streetlight fell across her breasts rising and falling now with greater energy the area of her flat stomach was shadowed and below the bunched tweed hid their hot liquid connection from sight just the head of him was inside her monica circled her hips swaying her full lips were halfparted and her breath was getting away from her simbal felt intoxicated he felt the exquisite sensations of her on him just a brief silken swirl across the most sensitive part of him he had hold of her shoulders was urging her on maxs house was overheated and the window was open from the bottom a couple of guests were apparently outside in maxs garden they were speaking in soft whispery tones the sounds floaty rising like steam in the night in simbals mind these halfheard words mingled with monicas caresses to create a kind of erotic intoxication a web of sound and feeling he shuddered heavily he wanted to penetrate her more fully but when he thrust he felt her fist encircling him preventing any forward movement monica he whispered kiss me she breathed his lips came down over hers and as their tongues touched she let go of her grip and he slipped all the way in a great groan escaped him filling her mouth with vibration monicas hips began to move then buck against him as he moved out then all the way in his hands slid over the soft wool of her sweater lifted it then felt her bare breasts they were warm the nipples hard and so sensitive that she gave a little cry ground her hips in a circle hard against him when his thumbs touched them make me come tony she panted in his ear im dying for you im dying for you the words reverberated in his head is that what he heard wafting in through the window from the sere garden downstairs im dying for you he felt her heat suffusing him there was a great weight in his loins so that he remained on his feet with the greatest difficulty he felt the muscles in his calves behind his knees begin to tremble he felt as if her weight was on him he felt he felt he felt in a moment he was aware of her fingertips sliding between his thighs lifting his testicles squeezing in gentle rhythm im dying for you oh he groaned oh monica yes her whisper the whisper of the couple in the garden simbal raced upward into her as far as he could go his heartbeat was in his throat and he lost all ability to breathe he gasped and began to shoot heavily into her ohh monicas eyes flew open and she groaned into the side of his neck the liquid heat at her core began her own spasming her face flushed and she felt the ripples spreading outward from the juncture of her thighs she ground herself into him feeling the harsh scrape of his pubic hair against her intimate flesh strangely this made her orgasm blossom to such a point that she lost all control climbing atop him she tumbled them from their precarious stance and they fell backward onto the pile of coats on the bed one of them began to laugh simbal covered by the folds of her skirt looked up into her amethyst eyes how could i have been so wrong about you like i said youre a schmuck she explored beneath her pooled skirt found him wet and still hard and what a schmuck in the garden below them the couple had ceased their whispering the gleaming black chaika stood waiting at the side of the runway at domodedovo airport the snow lay pale and gleaming in the moonlight piled in the aisles between the runways the winter chill still deep at this time of the year turned the exhaust as thick and white as clouds fifteen kilometers to the northwest the lights of moscow put the moon to shame reaching up into the night banishing the darkness inside the limousine general daniella vorkuta lay back against the leather seat her thick sable coat was opened around her like a bedspread its opulence contrasted with the severe line and color of her army uniform it was the dress uniform she had worn to yuri lantins funeral the creases pressed to an almost knifesharp edge the triple line of medals above her left breast shone dully in the cold blue airport lights for the moment her thoughts were far away from moscow and the man she was here to meet as usual her brilliant mind was reviewing the latest intelligence mitre her main asset in hong kong had transmitted to her hong kong that great teeming port was all daniella thought about lately the money that flowed through the crown colony drew her as unerringly as a magnet to true north it was not that daniella vorkuta was venal far from it she was one of a select few who could see beyond capitals gleaming immediate value to her money was power especially in hong kong and she knew that hong kong was the key to china possibly even to all of asia she knew that this was also shi zilins belief shi zilin the master strategist whose plan for china she had been attempting to infiltrate for three years now even though her best source to shi zilin his assistant zhang hua was dead of a heart attack she had something better lines of intelligence gathering into his most secret organization the yuhnhyun and daniella thought now even though she had been thwarted in every effort to infiltrate shi zilins other secret the kam sang project she now suspected that mitre had provided her with another mode of access to control hong kong that was daniella vorkutas most devout wish for she knew that if she controlled hong kong she would control all of china hong kong was and always would be chinas gateway to the west without hong kong as a middle ground with which to deal with the west she knew that china would be doomed to return to its backward past without hong kong china had no future at all it could never begin to compete in the modern world therefore hong kong was a pricelessand irreplaceablecommodity to china and now she knew the best way of gaining control of hong kong wresting the power that now resided in the yuhnhyun and making it her own this was essentially why she had had to destroy anatoly karpov her predecessor as head of the first chief directorate and his even more powerful ally yuri lantin the two had concocted a scheme codenamed moonstone that involved the military encirclement of china and a puppet war against it using north vietnamese regiments in malipo county in yunnan province her predecessors had wanted the destruction of china stupid men their scheming had brought russia dangerously close to a world war that could have devastated the entire planet daniella had a better fate in store for china subjugation with its profits funneled into soviet coffers that was hong kongs role in her strategy hong kong would bring her enormous wealthand with that wealth great power an awesome victory only she a master player of wei qi was an equal match for shi zilin he was the jian the supreme champion of the ancient board game if one was not weaned on wei qi strategy one had no chance at all of finding shi zilins weak spot and exploiting it she understood the strategy of wei qi at last she felt herself in position for taking the breath from shi zilins wei qi pieces she would have total victory millions of rubles would flow into the kremlin and into her pockets power undreamed of in asia would be hers soviet supremacy a dream russian patriots had nurtured since the emergence of that false communist mao zedong and when that was accomplished what further elevations in rank lay in store for her with an effort she pulled herself away from the seductive multifaceted jewel of her vision hes late she said the driver a kgb officer permanently assigned to her staff said the storm they would have hit it on their way over in any case the delay cant be major or i would have been informed daniella turned her beautiful head in his direction her thick blond hair fell across her throat and she pushed it back with curled fingers she disliked his tone the use of the i in his statement alexei was not as selfless as she would perhaps like him to be lyosha she said now using the diminutive please be smart enough to keep your mouth shut when he gets here dont worry he said his dark eyes on her in the rearview mirror daniella leaned forward breathing in his ear dont give me cause to worry her tone was as hard as flint he merely nodded his gaze now straight ahead jahwohl herr comrade general he said in his best clipped german daniella laughed ruffled his thick black hair from her position she could not see his sharply delineated widows peak or the precise serbian features of his face but she could easily bring to mind his lean sinewy athletes body the long flat planes of his abdomen and belly that she often painted with sweat she looked out the chaikas smokedglass window there were more than a dozen men in coarse blue overcoats and fur hats police she thought not sluzhba the colloquial term for the komitet gosudarstvennoi bezopasnosti the kgb daniella was the head of its first chief directorate the largest and most powerful subdivision of russias most feared apparat the plane is down comrade general alexei said daniella steeled herself there was already movement among the policemen she could see more of them now the blue flashing lights the glint off the kulspruta machine pistols and she thought who is the maniac who ordered drawn weapons he appeared out of the darkness his visage made indistinct by runway and airplane lights daniella could not as yet see his face but she recognized that walk it was the walk of a dangerous man quick and lithe full of power and hinting at lightning speed there was nothing of the hulking deliberation one associated with most of the highechelon kremlin officials he was surrounded by six plainclothes kgb operatives daniellas men despite the cold she had insisted they not wear their greatcoats your concealed armament will be no good to you beneath all that padding if an emergency should arise she had told them at the briefing this afternoon the bluecoated policemen parted like the red sea as he approached you have the route down daniella said and alexei hands on the steering wheel noted the tension in her voice yes comrade general he said formally the group had stopped one of daniellas men reached forward to pull open the door beside her then oleg maluta was climbing into the warmth of the limousines interior greetings comrade general his voice was like sandpaper over cement comrade daniella was aware of the heavy smells of tobacco and sweat it was work sweat the smell of a mover and shaker after a long day of complex negotiations alexei put the chaika into gear a drink maluta said he is not even civil daniella thought as she reached out a bottle of azerbaijani brandy as she poured she remembered that yuri lantins favorite liquor had been starka aged vodka that was how she had killed him overdosed his nightcap with his own sleeping pills then put his head in the oven to make it look like suicide in so doing she had taken the late unlamented anatoly karpovs place as head of the first chief directorate and consolidating her power had taken yuri lantins spot in the politburo she was the first woman to rise so high in the soviet hierarchy oleg maluta could destroy all that with one wave of his hand he had an oval face it was not the visage of a muskovite rather he had the odd almost almond eyes the fiat planular cheeks of a mongol his saltandpepper hair was shaved close to his scalp on the sides the bald patch on the back of his head gave him a benign aspect to those who had had no real contact with him to such an ignorant eye he might be an honored chess master his scheming mind turned to essentially harmless pursuits nothing could be further from the truth maluta accepted the glass from daniella downed three fingers of the fiery stuff at once his uptilted head revealed his prominent adams apple bobbing as he swallowed he handed her the empty glass wiped his lips with the edge of a yellowed forefinger he turned his head to watch the nighttime parade by him as if it were there for his benefit alone following daniellas instructions alexei veered off the kashira highway in order to take the streets that banded the moskva river maluta loved the river almost as much daniella suspected as he loved the ballet his apartment overlooked the river his offices were within one of the stuffy encrusted kremlin towers from whose windows he could keep the moskva in sight the moonlight looks fine on the water he said now as he shook out an unfiltered camel he did not offer her one which was just as well lantin had made her smoke and she had detested it now the stench nauseated her associated in her mind with the cloying odor of cooking gas it is because of the ice she said they were running along the embankment the gnarled and twisted shadows of the bare tree branches were like an old mans fingers stretched across the moskvas silver expanse the chaikas interior was filled with smoke daniella opened the window on her side a sliver how was leningrad she said now swallowing hard to rid her throat of the acrid smoke stultifying maluta said he continued to stare at his beloved moskva as they streaked toward the city he sat turned partially away from her staring intently out the tinted window comrade may i ask but his nicotinestained hand was waving her words aside i am hungry it was a rebuff pure and simple because i am a woman daniella wondered or is it something else something im unaware of as i digest my supper he continued you will digest my words sitting next to oleg maluta daniella decided was akin to coming into contact with a dark star the sensation of negative energy was enormous after ten minutes in his presence she felt chilled and drained she began to fight that feeling knowing that she would need all her mental acuity this night daniella had instructed alexei to make reservations at rossia on the moskvoretskaya embankment the hotel had nine restaurants daniella often went to the one in the basement because it boasted the best dance orchestra the restaurant they went to now was on the twentyfirst floor it had a most spectacular view of the kremlin and the green terracotta and yellow onion domes of st basils she thought this sight would please maluta and she was not disappointed how splendid moscow looks he said as they were seated at the best window table clean and sparkling he ordered vodka and zakuski two kinds of caspian caviar cold sturgeon in aspic pate he did not bother to ask what she would like daniella closed her eyes she thought of her wei qi board whenever she could she played the ancient chinese board game that the japanese knew as go it was said that a players strategy in wei qi was a mirror of his or her personal philosophy she wondered why maluta bothered to play these games with her plainly he detested her as he seemed to hate all women certainly he resented her promotion into the sanctum sanctorum of male power the politburo the liquor came almost immediately yet another demonstration of oleg malutas power he had chosen a pertsovka one of daniellas winter favorites the hot peppers gave the vodka a delicious soulwarming kick maluta waited until the appetizer tray had been set before them he made no move to eat though he had told her he was hungry we must know what kam sang is all about said without preamble what he said was a shock kam sang was the project in chinas guangdong province that she had been trying to penetrate for almost a year without success two men knew its secret shi zilin and his son jake maroc why was oleg maluta suddenly interested in kam sang daniella did not trust him if he needed kam sangs secret that meant that he would make certain that she was out of it when it came time to hand out the medals kam sangs secret could provide undreamed of power to daniella or maluta but not to both that will be most difficult to do daniella said carefully it must be done comrade general malutas eyes were blazing i mean to become the successor to fyodor leninin he was referring to fyodor leninin genachev soviet leader head of the communist party without the power kam sangs secret will bring me it will be next to impossible with friends like reztsov and carelin inside the politburo one cannot fart in bed without genachev knowing carelin had maluta another reason from bringing up that name she tried slow breathing she had been right what mad scheme was he hatching whatever it was he meant to enmesh her in it her mind was reeling she fought to remain calm you should have been there comrade general in leningrad you should have seen genachev he walked through the crowds smiling and calling out to them i am close to you now he said i am here to aid you to listen to your problems and to solve them i am here to begin a new russia maluta took a deep breath his face was that of one who had just smelled rotting flesh when i was a young man i saw nikita khrushchev he appeared in public all over russia he lapped up the adulation of the crowds visibility affected him like a drug he even went to america to disneyland i thought of him as a kind of hero do you understand a man of vision who had set his sights on affairs outside the soviet union until one day i heard my father speaking he was vilifying khrushchev this personality cult that khrushchev spends so much time building is a clear and present danger he said khrushchev spends too much time on khrushchev he apes the power and prestige of the american president kennedy theirs is a war not of ideology not of nations but of egos maluta began to put food into his mouth because in russia one did not drink vodka without eating it was taken as a sign of drunkenness for two days after that i locked myself in my room i did not eat i did not see anyone all i thought about was khrushchev and what my father said about him in time i came to understand that he was right khrushchev was driven by his egoa dangerous attitude for the leader of all the russias she took a deep breath do you really think that this talk is wise comrade malutas head snapped around he was like a falcon who had found its prey flying calmly a half mile below daniella felt transfixed by his terrible medusas gaze a thin line of sweat trickled down the indentation of her spine and she thought i am terrified of this man she fought it knowing with an absolute certainty that that very fear could kill her are you questioning my judgment comrade general his heavy emphasis on her title made it clear that he had no respect for it and again she thought is it because i am a woman no comrade it was a trial to keep her voice firm and sure i am merely questioning the circumstances out here here there is noise so much of it that no microphone could possibly pick up our conversation he continued to stare her down are you certain that this is the reason you are uneasy she kept her head still what do you mean maluta popped another appetizer into his mouth and shrugged the people love him genachev is fiftyfive young by the standards of the kremlin he shows them energy and they respond he announces that he will institute sweeping changes in the agricultural system the economythe economy it is all he speechifies about a four percent growth rate without any military cutbacks is what he promises the people the people comrade general then he brings his wife and daughter to parades to official functions at the moscow art theater the three of them arrive and are seated in the stalls along with everybody else instead of the balcony the traditional spot he reached inside his suit and pulled out several glossy pages have you seen this daniella took the cover and article from the current edition of time she saw the genachevs on the cover a rich color photo of the three of them smiling happily at some official function ecstatic crowds in the background first family soviet style the caption read she handed it back to maluta without opening it theres very little space in which to maneuver he said putting the magazine away he handled it as if he suspected it of being contaminated each day this newstyle leader of ours usurps more and more power each day his personality cult grows in stature genachev turns to the internal side of soviet politics without an understanding of what it will take to get this country moving again words to the people will not make a four percent net increase in the economy but it has taken him away from the international arena genachev ignores the china threat the afghan war we have suffered severe and i am afraid almost irreparable loss of prestige in africa after a decade of solid and consistent gains we have lost control of south america and all efforts to bring southeast asia into line have failed yet what is genachev spending his time on getting close to the people talking to the farmers reassuring them that their time of trial is at an end he snorted soon we will have farm subsidies just like in america malutas hand curled into a fist white with tension it is enough when you deliver to me kam sangs secrets i will prove to the entire politburo the truth of what i have been saying it is time to regain control over africa over south and central america it is time for the soviet union to push forward across the globe it is time for us to be more aggressive abroad rather than attempting to get our outofdate farm collectives to deliver more produce but as long as genachev holds sway no other voice in the politburo amounts to anything wanting to defuse him at least temporarily she gestured shall we eat comrade im starving they ate in silence for a time but she could see that malutas attention was not on his food of course she said after the remains of the zakuski had been cleared away you always have another option you could strike an alliance with genachev use a little give and take even perhaps persuade him to use you as his adviser on international affairs maluta said nothing but she could tell by his expression that his mind was turning over what she had said he spread his hands shrugged i cannot see how comrade genachev could afford to take any kind of advice from me mikhail carelin is his guru carelin the man with no face isnt that how hes known in some circles she said thinking about wei qi strategy trapping oleg maluta she thought about being able to implicate him in a plot to assassinate genachev amassing evidence irrefutable evidence that would sentence him to immediate execution carelin hes egoless they say content to remain in the background whispering in genachevs ear perhaps genachevs idiocies are in reality carelins you see its hard to determine whats what between them slowly slowly she thought her heart hammering suppose carelin himself recommended that genachev elevate you to adviser status maluta tapped the center of his livercolored lips with a forefinger he took out a camel and lit it daniella concealed her disgust now this is interesting comrade general there was a certain expression on his face and with dawning understanding she felt appalled it was a smile but the kind of smile that was more a rictus as if he did not have full control over his facial muscles but of course you are joking why should carelin cede any of his power to me because ill ask him to oho and i suppose just like that he will comply daniella put down her teacup perhaps six weeks ago mikhail carelin phoned me he invited me to dinner i assumed it had to do with some politburo lobbying as the most recent member i am perhaps perceived to be more vulnerable to persuasion on certain issues he took me to russkaya izba a surprise since it is somewhat out of the wayforty minutes from the center of town very romantic also to my surprise there was no talk of business instead we spoke of small things our backgrounds childhood memories and the like we were getting to know one another carelin asked you out on a date a date daniella confirmed that was it exactly he wants to see me again maluta thought of carelins wife squat and dumpy their two daughters built in their mothers image he grunted what is the american phrase quiet waters run deep close enough and what did you answer our gospadin carelin i gave him neither a yes nor a no women maluta said as if that one word explained everything he was silent while they served he did not look at his plate or at his stilllighted cigarette when the waiter left he said well perhaps in this case your female er indecisiveness has served us in good stead he did not immediately elucidate but rather lit into his pelmeni with gusto somewhere during the recent conversation he had regained his appetite it was not until he finished pushing up the last of the meat dumplings onto a thick slab of black bread that he spoke again i want you to be my sparrow with carelin he said around a mouthful of food and get him to use his influence with genachev thinking i have him now maluta nodded rinsed his mouth with a large gulp of the spiced vodka before swallowing that would do me very well he smiled his odd bonechilling smile she suppressed a shudder daniella felt the triumph like a dove fluttering against her heart she did not downplay the danger of such a double game but the risk was acceptable considering the circumstances she had also found out something quite vital about maluta he did not have surveillance on her otherwise he would have known that she had already been to bed with mikhail carelin feeling more relaxed than she had all evening she said all right i think i can manage it a direct line into genachevs mind he was deep in thought she nodded it is possible yes good initiate it as they retrieved their coats daniella thought i will be his sparrow i will spy for him yes if it means that i can bring him down it is worth doing this even for such a monster in the aftermath of the party simbal and monica ate overstuffed sandwiches he had slapped together from odds and ends lying around max threnodys refrigerator shoulder to shoulder they tore into them voraciously like little animals bent over the outsized double sink in the kitchen from the living room emanated the sounds of max seeing off the last of his guests dea types were tightly wound they tended to blow off a lot of steam in relaxed circumstances that was only to be expected it was in fact the major reason for maxs infamous parties steam was far better blown off in a private place than in public in the heat of all the emotion being thrown around simbal hadnt forgotten why he had come here around a swig of dos equis amber he said i didnt notice peter curran around tonight did i miss him and suddenly the blood drained from monicas face she put down her halfeaten sandwich in a small voice she said what made you say that say what mention peter he shrugged on his guard now he watched her carefully he wanted very much for her to face him so that he could see the full run of emotion in her peter and i knew each other fairly well when i was here thats all he waited a second monica what is it a worried friend nothing more above all he must convince her that he had no special interest in peter curran i didnt know that you and peter were friends she said still not looking at him we werent really it wasnt easy to get close to peter as i remember but we were in burma together for about six weeks before he was pulled out watch it yeah i remember that she picked up her sandwich again licked russian dressing off her fingers she seemed abruptly tired as if even this much talk about him exhausted her i didnt know you were there at the time i dont think wed met yet he said easily it seems to me i ran into you after i got back that first time it was here i think she gave him a wan smile you remember then her mind was clearly on something else peter curran he wasnt here i take it monica jerked as if he had pricked her with the tip of a knife and he thought what the hell is going on no she said so quietly he had to bend closer to hear her he wasnt simbal looked down saw her thumbs had gone all the way through the thick sandwich from the pressure she had been exerting best to ignore that he decided so hes on assignment then can we talk about something else her head swung toward him he was surprised at how pale she had become sure im sorry he touched her monica i wish youd tell me take me home tony there was no expression on her face she wiped her hands on a paper towel just take me home and dont say another word okay okay it wasnt okay but he was determined that she should not know that the chaika still stank of smoke even though alexei at daniellas unspoken command had done his best to air out the interior while she and maluta had been at dinner its cold in here maluta said get some heat up they pulled away from the curb and he sat back in the seat his oldfashioned suit smelled of ashes i have regards for you from uncle vadim he was referring to vadim dubas the current head of the communist party in leningrad and her late fathers brother how is he old and stubbornas always maluta said shortly he seems never to change he shook out another camel abruptly maluta leaned forward he tapped alexei on the shoulder i want to go to the monument do you know the one lieutenant yes comrade minister it was in the outskirts of moscow the angular steel crisscrossed almost like a modern sculpture atop its cutstone plinth except that the steel was real a portion of the four hundred miles of antitank traps and trenches erected by the remaining citizens of what stalin dubbed the hero city in the flush of their victory over the seventyfive nazi divisions that had been massed over the hills leading to moscow alexei slowed the chaika pulling to the side of the highway it was late past eleven and the roads were deserted there was little or no nightlife here or anywhere in russia maluta made no move until alexei opened the back door alexei handed him a flashlight but maluta made no comment merely flicked it on his shoes cracked the icy snow as he went across the verge to stand beside the monument daniella right beside him was astonished to see tears sparkling in his eyes so much blood spilled here maluta said his voice thick with emotion so much heroism the revolutionary spirit shone like a beacon in those dark days he was silent for a time the beam of light sparked like fireworks against the precise edges of the steel bars the snow maluta said into the dark i love the snow comrade general the snow is pure and white like the spirit of lenin which guides us always he put his foot out the toe of his shoe scraping away at the snow until the black earth was eventually revealed but the snow also covers a multitude of sins the beam of light stayed steady on the war monument but malutas gaze was fixed on daniella making her skin crawl these are still dark days comrade general no less dire than they were fortyodd years ago we are still fighting for our very existence this is war plain and simple daniella stood very still a pulse throbbed in the side of her head she knew she was in the presence of a very dangerous man indeed dangerous not only for herself but for the country as a whole let me tell you something comrade general he said his voice was like acid in this war you are either with me or against me do you understand daniella nodded not trusting herself to speak words maluta said i deal with words twenty hours a day the more i deal with words the more i am convinced that lies are commonplace and the truth is lost to sight he lit up a camel took his gaze from her he stared meditatively at the memorial the steel bars seemed to waver in the handheld beam of light the moon had gone and it had grown more chill the air was heavy incipient with snow the storm that had delayed malutas flight was catching up with them daniella pulled her sable coat closer around her a sudden gust of wind caught her thick hair whipping it across her face she made no move to pull it back the trouble with you comrade general maluta said after a long silence is that you are beautiful he exhaled took a bit of tobacco off his lower lip because of this you believe that you can extract anything from the men around you you open your thighs for anatoly karpov and you become head of the kvr maluta was referring to the clandestine section of the first chief directorate more commonly known as department k when it was referred to at all the kvr was responsible for extraterritorial assassination and wetfieldcounterintelligence you did the same for my late lamented colleague yuri lantin and following his untimely death you succeeded him still he would not look at her he smoked at leisure as if they were two close friends discussing nothing more momentous than vacation plans on the one hand i admire your guile i believe you to be an ingenious woman he threw away the butt it sparked in the night the only brief flash of color in the landscape before it died in the snow on the other hand i am aware of your ambition acutely aware i want you to understand that you cannot do with me what you have done with karpov and lantin and i am sure several others before them i am immune to your beauty i do not dream at night of your cunt his use of the derogatory term was deliberate it shocked her as it was meant to now maluta continued i want you to make your choice either you are with me or you are against me you have no other options i will tell you that much do you think for a moment i believed your little fantasy scenario back there mikhail carelin whispering in genachevs ear that he should elevate me to adviser status alongside reztsov and carelin himself there it was that unsettling rictus of a smile was back oh no no no comrade general even if your lovely cunt would have persuaded me to believe such nonsense i know that you would never propose such a thing to carelin he would laugh in your face comrade generaland your file reports that you do not care for such treatment daniella was shaking she suspected that she had seriously underestimated maluta and that in fact in taking yuri lantins place so quickly she had undone herself she wondered whether she was prepared for the rarefied atmosphere of the kremlin upper echelon or whether she was now truly in too deep she knew that she had to answer now suspected that he would only allow her one option i am with you she had had to open her mouth twice the first time her throat was so dry she knew only a croak would come out maluta nodded horosho good now alexei will not have to shoot you in the back of the head what again he had meant to disconcert her and he had his malevolent head turned toward her and she saw that awful rictus that passed for a smile yes didnt you know that your alexei reports to me all your movements comrade general all of them are known to me now daniella knew that he was lying if this was so maluta would know that she had already begun her affair with mikhail carelin she steeled herself to play his game at his own level maluta was watching her face carefully his black almond eyes glittered fiercely i see that you doubt my word that is understandable he reached inside his greatcoat producing a small wrapped packet he handed it over with yellowed fingers daniella stared down at the packet as if it were a poisonous thing her pulse rate rose and she felt the tremor again in the side of her face slowly she unwrapped the thing holy mother of god she thought staring down at the contents it was odd daniella thought with a kind of hysterical calmness how ungainly and almost comical two people looked when they were making love especially when one of those people was oneself shot after grainy shot of daniella and carelin in naked embrace writhing in obvious ecstasy flushed in orgasm maluta took the photos from her nerveless fingers he shuffled them like a deck of playing cards before extracting one this one i think is the best he went through the pile or perhaps this one stop it he wanted that reaction and having gotten it obediently put the damning photos away now he said i want you to do something for me it is a symbol that will bind us together much more securely than you and comrade carelin are bound in that little teteatete his voice was soft now almost tender i ask this of you comrade general because you have lied to me i assume that you have done so only once in the instance of mikhail carelin buthe shrugged who knows there may have been other instances in the past but you see i do not care about the past only the future he had produced it from somewhere beyond the limits of her sight i want this to be an object lesson for you comrade general take off your gloves please daniella did as he bade her mind partially numb how she thought could i have misjudged him so completely i was so certain that i had him he laid it into her bare chilled hand the pistol it had a silencer screwed onto the end of the muzzle daniella noticed that it was germanmade not regulation russian army a personal handgun a strictly forbidden item now i want you to shoot alexei she heard malutas voice as if in a dream do it as you have been trained to carry out an execution through the back of the head that was you recall how he was to kill you this is a nightmare daniella thought panic and fear raced through her like a brushfire she could not think it was as if the reasoning part of her brain had gone to sleep wake up she thought desperately what am i to do it shouldnt be too much of a task maluta was saying he was smoking again the wind bringing the vile smoke back into her face after all there is a revenge motive he had gained your trust and in return was spying on you it is only just dont you think to punish such a heinous crime i am in bed with a true monster daniella thought her stomach was a cold twisted knot she felt vertigo overcome her she was frozen to the spot i cannot do what he asks she thought i cannot why do you hesitate comrade general malutas voice had returned to rasping hardness this indecision is a poor trait for a member of the politburo i shall have to report this a serious offense a man would never show such weakness he pulled on his cigarette perhaps i should call alexei out here and have him kill you after all his eyes blazing oleg maluta crunched through the brittle snow he put his lips against her ear the tobacco smell was a nauseating miasma undaunted even by the chill and the wind do it comrade general do it now or your life is ended here at this moment daniella could not believe it herself but her body was moving toward the car she had no idea who was directing it surely not she inside she saw alexeis eyes on her in the rearview mirror whats happened he whispered you look as white as a ghost daniella saw herself lean forward her arm lift up she opened her lips to answer alexei just before the muzzle touched the back of his head she pulled the trigger she was gagging when she emerged from the back of the chaika her nostrils were clogged with the stench of death maluta moved very quickly he produced a clean white handkerchief and using it took the gun from daniellas hand your prints he said wrapping the thing with the utmost care and slipping it into his greatcoat pocket i want you to understand that i can have you brought up on murder charges at any time i have no patience with liars i would have had you killed but i need your acute mind daniella turned away from him and vomited maluta made no move but played the flashlight beam over the rippling surface of her sable coat the exquisite fur shone like platinum for a time he hummed tunelessly to himself you need me for what there was a bitter taste in her mouth that she was certain even mouthwash would not be able to take away why to get into shi zilins mind of course you see when i do my research i am quite thorough i know that the secret to kam sang resides in that old mans head youre going to extract it for me daniella felt as if she had suddenly been struck a blow from a hammer that is impossible she managed to stammer malutas heavy eyebrows lifted so in that case comrade general you are ordered to terminate shi zilin mouth dry daniella said shi zilin and jake maroc are inextricably linked all right maluta said i am a reasonable man the dry rustle of the snow like a living thing moving kill them both daniella felt an icy ball of fear turn her insides to water i dont think you understand what you are asking his teeth came together with a clack kam sang shi zilin jake maroc one two three what could be simpler daniella said nothing she could hear the rushing of her blood in her inner ears as if it were part of a spring thaw she knew now what he was up to knew that she could not have been subjected to a more thorough investigation had she been within the dank caverns of the lubyanka i run the china section she said there are longrange operations in progress you cant ask me to just oh but i can comrade general maluta took a long drag on his cigarette he was very sure of himself the problem is that when one has free reign over such a powerful lever ones mind turns to thoughts of personal use he leaned toward her hissing smoke into her face personal ends comrade general as opposed to those that will best serve the state that awful clacking of teeth again chimera is your power comrade general maluta said but i know that china is your overriding obsession i am not asking so much am i his voice had turned syrupy after all i could demand you reveal to me chimeras identity i could even take this asset away from you he grinned then where would you be you see seen in this light it is not so much what i ask of you to find out about kam sang and to get rid of shi zilin and jake maroc daniella was trembling for years her complete control of chimera had been the key to her rapid advancement without the fantastic flood of classified information chimera provided for her she would never have climbed so far so fast in what was quite literally a mans world in that maluta had been right on target chimera sat at the very center of the quarry though jake maroc believed that he had killed chimera during a confrontation at greystoke nine months before in fact the mole was not henry wunderman marocs longtime mentor daniellas maneuvering had camouflaged chimera perfectly and had fooled everyone even shi zilin now her situation was desperate she was not fooled by malutas words unless she could find some way to deflect or forestall him maluta would take full control of her china operations this is what his orders were leading to with shi zilin and jake maroc out of the way and with the secrets of kam sang in his hip pocket maluta would be invincible even carelins and reztsovs aid would not stop him from bringing genachev down russia run by this madman was unthinkable maluta already had so much power that if he was able to use kam sang to add to it he would be able to persuade the other members of the politburo that what he had donedestroy genachev was in fact in the soviet unions best interests and where will that leave me daniella thought permanently under his thumb because once maluta believes that he no longer can control me he will destroy me as well by the state daniella knew maluta meant himself are you saying that i am not fit to run the china operations possibly maluta nodded threw the glowing butt of the cigarette far out into the night the rage building in her sought an outlet she was mad with it and so she spoke without thinking you talk of the state but there is nothing of the state in you comrade this is personal pure and simple you are generating a power play and im to run interference for you she felt tears burning behind her eyelids and closed them tightly so that he wouldnt see them she began to pray for strength im to provide you with your silver bullet to lay genachev low and if for some reason security is breached i will be the one they put to the stake ah comrade general maluta smiled down on her benignly you have pleased me in so many ways tonight yes youre quite right in your assessment he shrugged but you will do as i ask just the same wont you daniella nodded numbly what choice did she have at least he would no longer spy on her companionably he took her arm as they went back to the chaika besides he said more easily now getting rid of the shis will be best in the long run i do not care for the power base they are forming in hong kong it had begun to snow together they maneuvered alexeis corpse into the trunk he handed her a chamois cloth took one himself and together they wiped away what little blood had seeped onto the front seat they threw the bloody rags back into the trunk maluta looking down at the white frozen face said he looks so surprised he slammed down the trunk well im not surprised really he was quite loyal to you comrade general daniella felt the ground give way beneath her she made a grab for the fender of the chaika missed and went to her knees maluta made no move to assist her he stood over her watching her behavior with the kind of total curiosity a scientist exhibits toward a laboratory specimen do you really think that i would be foolish enough to allow you to kill my surveillance of you had alexei actually been doing what i told you he was hed have been far too valuable for me to waste this way no my dear daniella i lied to you about alexei in that regard he was as pure as the driven snow you see now how it feels to be lied to he watched with a kind of trembling intensity the tears dropping from daniellas eyes they made dark indentations where they hit the snow soon he said thickly i will have photos of you weeping my surveillance of you will see to that with his breath clouding in the cold night he seemed to be panting the day after tomorrow is your birthday three oaths tsun said where would you like to go for dinner to gaddis at the peninsula neon chow said immediately three oaths tsun standing on the justwashed deck of his junk lying to at the floating hakka city in aberdeen harbor eyed his mistress oh no he thought of course gaddis for her twentyfourth birthday why shouldnt she be taken to hong kongs finest and most expensive restaurant gaddis he exploded by the celestial blue dragon if i know you at all youll try to bankrupt me there that was not to say that one should not show reluctance three oaths tsun thought in his seventyone years he had learned all the tricksor so he believed of the female mind ill do nothing of the kind neon chow said pouting deliciously she came across the deck to him ill only be twentyfour once should i not be happy she fondled the emerald necklace he had recently given her arent i worth gaddis her pout deepened i know you think ill embarrass you in such a fine place in fact three oaths thought nothing could be further from the truth whenever he took this exquisite woman out all heads turned in their directionfemale as well as male neon chow who worked part time for the governor could easily have been a recording or film star the only thing that would have stopped her he supposed was that she was essentially a lazy creature neon chow had never done an hour of hard work in her life and that was he was quite certain just how she liked it its true a tai pan of your stature cannot afford to be publicly embarrassed she went on sulkily so i shall rescind my request take me to that dirty old fishmongers you like so much in causeway bay i suppose i deserve nothing more anyway three oaths tried not to smile in reality she could ask anything of him and he would gladly grant it if it was within his power but it would do neither of them any good for him to make that manifest to her her powerful effect on him was similarly best kept to himself he believed no woman he had ever knownand in his lifetime he had known manycould move him as neon chow did and when they made love he was thirty years old again the clouds and the rain more dizzying even than when he had been in his rampant youth just watching her sent tremors of arousal through his sacred member as it happens you are in luck he said now his voice betrayed none of the emotion he felt energizing him i phoned the place in causeway bay but its not available because of a private party that was a blatant lie hed had no intention of taking her anywhere but the restaurant of her choice so i suppose gaddis it must be after all eeeee neon chow screamed throwing her arms around him she ground her liquid hips against his loins crushed her breasts against his chest how wonderful yes three oaths thought it certainly is honorable father they are here three oaths turned from her embrace to acknowledge his number one sons voice he went limping across the deck as jake and bliss came aboard my daughter looks more beautiful now three oaths thought than she ever has blisss skin is as translucent and glowing as alabaster it is as if she has waited all her life for jake maroc shi to return to herto return to her love greetings zhuan he said and turning to bliss daughter his face was serene none of his inner emotion showed may bliss go below jake asked my father has asked for the services of her healing hands certainly three oaths said leading the way ever since he had made the journey from beijing to be reunited with his family shi zilin had chosen to live on his brothers junk because he said it reminds me of the old days when we ran the tears of the poppy for the foreign devil tat pan in shanghai jake and three oaths watched bliss descend the companionway jake was aware of neon chow staring at him he did not look at her or acknowledge her presence he preferred to treat her as an object much like the bales and crates littering the freshly swabbed deck he did not think about neon chow in his mind she was his uncles responsibility certainly he did not consider her family he suspected privately that she was more interested in three oathss money than she was in him he had come across many beauties like her who had nothing more to barter with in life than their bodies a part of life in asia joss below bliss smiled into shi zilins face and picked up his hand she squeezed it stroking its back with loving affection in her eyes she kissed both his cheeks where is your pain the worst today ayeh she asked softly and when zilin told her she nodded well begin then with the liver meridian she moved down took off his shoes the sedating point is herepicking up one bare footon the sole just below the base of the middle toe now as i press here imagine the energy flow moving from the opposite end of the meridian the inner end of the collarbone down through the ribs into the pubic region down the inside of the leg to the knee then down farther along the inside of the ankle bone circling there until it reaches the point where i am pressing close your eyes now ayeh up on deck three oaths tsun watched neon chows slim back as she went forward when she had disappeared he shifted his gaze to the silver sky and then spat heavily over the side no sun no rain this is no weather at all bad for fishing bad for fornicating anything heya jakes hooded copper eyes were watching far out at sea tankers black and low filled with oil from the rich emirates steamed in twodimensional silhouette they had come no doubt through the strait of malacca one of the smallest and most strategic bits of territory in this modern petrofueled world it was at the strait of malacca as well as at the mainland zilin had informed his son that the soviets meant to strike as he stood there jake blotted out his uncle and neon chow recalling the conversation he had had with zilin earlier in the day the old man seemed obsessed with their old enemy the kgb and in particular two highranking officials over the last threeandahalf years the jian had said the russian army with the vital political backing of anatoly karpov and yuri lantin has begun a massive upgrading of their fiftyeight border divisions nine of them are now fully armored all are arrayed along chinas northern frontier in eastern siberia where we are historically the most vulnerable our latest intelligence tells us that approximately one hundred tu bombers and one hundred fifty ss mobile missiles armed with nuclear warheads have been deployed are those the backfire bombers jake had asked and when his father had nodded his assent he had thought they are currently the most modern the russians have fivethousandmile range nuclear capability with either bombs or airtosurface missiles they are all around us jake zilin had said but these are only machines machines need guidance the human mind here is the crux of the issue we have a new nemesis in the kremlin oleg maluta he is far worse than karpov and lantin ever were because his power base is virtually unshakable and if the time comes that he is ever elevated further buddha protect us his militancy is well documented afghanistan and pakistan were two of his pet projects the question we must now ask ourselves is in which direction is maluta turning his adders head will he make those backfire bombers take to the sky zilins glossy black eyes were depthless ageless the degenerative disease that continued to wrack him with pain had nevertheless failed to dim the inner energy or the acuity of his extraordinary mind how did maluta come to your attention father jake had asked through daniella vorkuta the old man said always and forever it is daniella vorkuta it is her eye that is constantly on china jake never for a moment forget that fact it is she of the russians now in power who understands the importance of controlling hong kong if the russians can gain enough hold over the trading companies here they can cut all revenue off from the mainland they can suck mainland companies establishing themselves in hong kong into bad ventures daniella vorkutas hold in hong kong must be broken forever or china can never gain her destiny as a future world power though maluta is dangerous because of his avowed militancy against us it is daniella vorkuta who can truly destroy us financially economically for all time general vorkuta plays wei qi she knows the strategies through sir john bluestone she has a substantial foothold here and though we have him in view we should not underestimate her mind only she of all the russians understands our potential here how much does daniella vorkuta know about kam sang jake had asked zilin had let out a long sigh she has already tried twice to infiltrate the project so far we have managed to ah appropriate her agents before too much information was leaked back to her but she will keep trying but this in itself seems to me to create a problem of its own jake had said the very fact of the intense security surrounding kam sang should be cause for alarm on her part she is smart enough to read the military implications in such massive security zilin had looked at his son indeed and if she becomes sufficiently alarmed so will oleg maluta and maluta will order the backfires up are you sufficiently relaxed jian bliss asked zilin opened his eyes his mind freed of the network of pain within which it had been gripped was floating he was in the center of daihei the great darkness where he had found all incorporeal essence resides when blisss voice called him back yes he said thickly you have done wonders for me bousehk precious gem that is what my younger brother calls you he moved slightly i thank you ten thousand times over i have only taken away your pain she said overwhelmed that he would call her by the loving term her father did i have given you nothing at all on the contrary his luminous eyes sought hers you have given me part of yourself bousehk listen to me your body is only part of what you have to offer others it is perhaps the most insignificant part yes your body can give and receive enormous pleasure but that pleasure is at best fleeting the mind on the other hand is nourished by your aura your essence your qi that which makes you unique this is in the end what the mind remembers what the soul cherishes bliss knelt beside the reed pallet her head bowed her hands were clasped in her lap tell me he continued do you know of dahei no godfather touch the tips of my fingers with yours his voice was but a whisper coming to her in waves like the tide that lapped gently at the hull of the junk look into my eyes now look into my eyes what am i supposed to see nothing he said but it seemed to her as if his mouth had not opened at all nothing there was a darkness in the room that was not gloom not shadow to bliss it was a source of illumination although she had no idea how darkness could be a source of light in the depths of zilins eyes was a spark of color unknown to her she stared long at the hue in an attempt to decipher its mystery and all about her the darkness crept stealing the light then the cabin disappeared and bliss heard the world calling up on deck jake was saying i have ten thousand threads all of which i must weave into one tight skein that is the zhuans job three oaths said watching carefully the famed intensity of jakes formidable gaze though his uncles tone was carefully neutral jake still picked up a subtle undercurrent and a warning siren went off in his head you do not approve of my fathers choice of successor do you elder uncle oh no no nothing could be further from the truth i just do not see how the yuhnhyun will survive without the jian i mean no disrespect younger nephew i could not love you more were you my own son but the jian has had eightyodd years of experience the yuhnhyun is his creationit has been evolving in his mind for fully fifty years the thought of losing him now at this most critical time fills me with dread the day was waning but the air was completely still forward jake watched neon chow chatting with three oaths number two daughter will you stay for dinner zhuan unfortunately i cannot jake said too much work to do he tried to smile but his face felt wooden there was too much happening too quickly jake wished desperately that he could talk to someone about his strategyto three oaths or to bliss but he knew that in this he was alone he must be it was part of being the zhuan he could afford to trust no one but he felt a burning in his heart he wondered how much it was costing him to push bliss away part of him wanted to take her into his confidence because he loved her so but another part of himthe zhuanknew that the information he possessed was far too explosive for any other person to have the enemy was too close too well hidden within the inner circle to take the risk still he was chilled by what he was being forced to do bliss was an integral part of his life he could not imagine living without her a junk its high triangular sail a glowing red in the dusk gradually swung into the harbor mouth from the east jake put his elbows on the top rail his sleeves were rolled up three oaths could see the sinewy power in those wrists and fingers the lines of callus along the edges of jakes hands were as yellow as ancient ivory uncle he said do you believe that bluestone is behind the embezzlement at southasia bancorp without doubt three oaths said decisively its clear the motherless dog who actually took the money did not have the brains to put such a scheme together he would have soiled himself first no the scheme required a brain such as bluestones as the crimsonsailed junk made for the typhoon shelter jake saw that the black smudge along the horizon had broadened a wind had sprung up but perhaps three oaths said heavily bluestone is inside the yuhnhyun deeper than any of us imagine jake said nothing watching the horizon with a blank look chimerathe soviet mole inside the quarry your former mentor henry wundermanknew about the emperors jade seal of power the fu pieces of which my brother left with you your halfbrother nichiren bliss and andrew sawyer how did he know about the jade jake took a deep breath bluestone is nothing elder uncle he is nothing more than a conduit daniella vorkuta is behind the scheme to bankrupt southasia daniella vorkuta is inside the yuhnhyun it is her brain at work here daniella vorkuta runs bluestone as she runs chimera runs chimera three oaths said incredulously what do you mean chimera is dead you killed him with your own hands i killed henry wunderman elder uncle jake said the pain in his voice now evident he wasin factnot chimera what jake still did not move three oaths realized he stood as still as stoneas death a week ago an agent of the quarry contacted me never mind who it was a deep cover asset codenamed apollo beridien and donovan perhaps a few others at quarry central knew about apollo but no one except henry wunderman knew apollos identity when apollo heard through high diplomatic circles of wundermans death and why he was killed it set him thinking he knew he knew elder unclethat wunderman could not possibly be a double agent apollo confirmed this he also confirmed that chimera is still operating over the months since apollo has been doing some thinking he has deduced the identity of general vorkutas mole inside the quarry rodger donovan jake watched a wallawalla carrying three mandarin businessmen somber as reptiles as it negotiated the narrow lanes between boats on its way to one of the floating restaurants moored in the harbor oily water lapped at the side of the junk jake turned to face his uncle donovans name is the only one that makes sense the ploy vorkuta used on all of us to persuade us that wunderman was chimera was as audacious as it was meticulous she used false intelligence to convince me that henry was chimera while she used other intelligencejust as falseto convince henry that i was behind the assassination of beridien the whole plot was dangerous to chimera at any time henry or i could have stumbled onto the truth about chimera so the reward must have been very high indeed id say that vorkutas mole taking control of the quarry is high reward indeed three oaths said oh yes jake said morosely three oaths watched the oily patches of water lap against the junk out in the harbor jumbo the giant floating restaurant was abruptly lit up sending gaudy red green and blue lights dancing over the waves are you certain of this perhaps this is another of accursed vorkutas diabolical ploys jake shook his head no i dont think so for two reasons one she would have no earthly reason to stir up my suspicions nowthe whole idea was for me to believe that chimera was dead two apollo told me what his last directive from wunderman was to terminate daniella vorkuta i have reaffirmed that directive may she die a hundred deaths for what she has done to you younger nephew three oaths said spitting over the junks side one will do elder uncle jake said bleakly general vorkuta caused me to kill one of my oldest friends he was watching something from very far away perhaps it was not anything in the real world she set us one against the other and neither henry nor i saw what was happening she destroyed everything we had between us friendship love trust like a master magician she paraded before us our own supposed deceit betrayal fear she separated us and thus defeated us worse she caused us to defeat one another she suspected rightly that our mutual love could be twisted into hate and that that hate would blind us to her illusion buddha how she must have gloated when i killed henry and became her assassin ahhhh it was a long drawnout sigh of recognition general vorkuta is a devil zhuan she is intent on our destruction how to believe such a diabolical mind resides in the head of a female the wind sang an eerie tune through the shrouds a tern called wheeling above them the light that surrounded them seemed abruptly leaden a deadening weight it was a long time before jakes gaze shifted and even when it happened three oaths knew enough to say nothing look elder uncle jake pointed at last to the thickened black smudge out to sea here comes your rain ian mckenna pulled at the collar of his shirt it was still and muggy after the brief evening rain the dark beach was stippled as if by a painters brush the tide washed detritus ashore mckenna shone his flash this way and that it was the middle of the night and so quiet he could hear the hoot of a ship far off across the water put it out if you dont mind mckenna stood very still chinese voice instinctively mckennas hand went to his service revolver calm down he told himself youll give yourself a heart attack if you go on this way he shut off the flash and was cloaked in darkness a light phosphorescencethe conglomerate of lights from nearby stanleyrode the water reflecting nothing but abstract patterns he felt a presence approaching over his right shoulder it came around until it was standing by his side good evening mr mckenna turned his head and saw one wideopen white eye glaring at him round moon face wide button nose a typical southern chinese face disfigured by a livid scar that pulled the bottom of the left eye downward creating a perpetual glare inwardly mckenna shuddered at the bad joss of this man lam whiteeye kao mckenna grunted youre all alike to me shanghainese cantonese whatever youre all bloody bandits for a moment whiteeye kao said nothing then his lips curled upward in a smile that did not stop you from accepting my money he said evenly money has no loyalty mckenna said i dont care where it comes from does tile amount seem sufficient whiteeye kao asked thinking jesus i may have found the goose that lays the golden egg mckenna said in his most selfimportant voice for the time being i believe it to be adequate but final judgment depends on what you want in return ah mr mckenna it is really nothing at all whiteeye kao put his hands behind his back though he stared out to sea his ruined orb continued to glare at mckenna the pale phosphorescence of the water lent it a ghostly hue as if it were the clouded eye of a dead mana dead man with a fly taptaptapping in its glutinous surface stop it mckenna screamed silently to himself he fought to calm his stomach but he could not suppress the image of the great fires along the outback sparks cracking upward threading across the dead black sky the chanting all right what dragged himself back from the terrifying memory i didnt hear you i asked if you were all right mr mckenna your face is pale mckenna wiped his face with a shaking hand it felt clammy im no im quite all right im fighting a bit of a stomach flu thats all you must take care of yourself mr mckenna whiteeye kao had taken out a cigarette he lighted it and inhaled deeply much depends on you now back to business what is it you want me to do whiteeye kao had had about enough of the foreign devils bad manners i wonder what your superiors would do to you if they got wind of the young man who lives with you color suffused mekennas face what the hell does that mean whiteeye kao clucked his tongue formidable sung head of the largest triad in hong kong knows this secret does he not mr mckenna he uses it against you from time to time to get you to deliver advance information on police raids thats utter nonsense is it mr mckenna whiteeye kao smiled how old is he mr mckenna your house mate eighteen no too old sixteen maybe does fifteen sound more accurate the chinese laughed he knows mckenna thought the little bastard knows it all suddenly the rage was there glowing red at his core the idea of dancing on a string held by these little slanteyed whoresons was too much to bear with a low growl he reached for his gun but whiteeye kao had anticipated him and he was so close his body was up against the largers man the gleaming blade of a knife was shoved against mckennas throat that was not an intelligent move mr mckenna those last two words were squeezed out of whiteeye kaos mouth only the fact that he was under strict discipline stopped him from slitting this foreign devils throat you may be powerful inside your precinct house but out here in the night you are nothing but a piece of stinking meat i can hang out to dry for the rats to find youll give them a festival feast mr mckenna i dont want you to forget that mckennas rage bubbled to the surface his head trembled with the force of it but he could feel the biting edge of the steel blade across his adams apple youre the one whos dead meat he thought thats bloody well the truth mate his lips were drawn back in an animal snarl no one treats me like this no one in a moment the steel blade had disappeared all appeared normal again the first service you may provide me whiteeye kao said just as if no threat had been uttered is confirmation of a rumor i have heard that there has been some troublesome very recent troubleat the southasia bancorp i bank at the institution and am understandably concerned as to the continued welfare of my money you understand mckenna laughed this is all on your own yes i understand thinking this wog may have given me a leg up on formidable sung that bastard has been blackmailing me long enough sung owns a part of southasia bancorp if there is a problem at the bank it will give me great pleasure to see the look on his face when i report it all right he said making an effort to throttle back his burning rage visions of formidable sungs thunderstruck face helped ill see what i can find out quickly whiteeye kao said do it quickly mr mckenna now go home throw your arms around your little boy and drift off to sleep in time perhapsif you run your errands faithfully and welli will give you that which you need in order to destroy formidable sungs hold on you darkness and within it whirling was the light how was that possible it was because the light was not illumination it was pain pain so delicate so exquisite so palpable that it took on an actual presence it hungthat was as close as one could get using a conventional verbin the center of her universe spinning blurrily like a scythe cutting her nerve ends leaving them raw and open and bleedinga pain she was certain would never end eventually however it did that was because colonel hu xujing ordered it qi lin heard his voice quite clearly over the discordant din that was but one component of her pain over the course of her internment she had lost her bearings she had no real words to describe the amount of time this pain this light had enveloped her a day a week a month or a century it was all the same to her beforebefore the pain that isshe recalled that her sense of time had been acute she had never needed an alarm to wake her up never needed to glance at a watch in order to make a rendezvous she was always on time time the pain ate time consumed it greedily in its maw of light then regurgitated what was left not time not emptiness either for that would have meant the absence of pain the pain was always there a light in the stygian blackness her only light and because it was made so for her it became in time her oasis her one friend until colonel hu colonel hu made the pain stop at first qi lin hated him for that for taking away her one and only light now there was only the darkness sheer emptiness encircled her a rage of silence of aloneness once she remembered dimly she could hold her pain closer to her it assured her that she was still breathing her heart was still pumping that she was still alive after the pain went away she was not sure for a time she suspected that she was dead she could feel nothing see nothing smell nothing hear nothing taste nothing what karma was this that had brought her to this unknown and horrific place was this the beginning of the wheel of life what arcane sins had she committed to find herself here then colonel hu brought her out from the nothingness qi lin believed later that it was like being born again literally there were no words to encompass the enormity of her gratitude he showed her lightreal light with color and gradationand so delighted was she that she reached out in order to bring it closer to her he brought to her ears the whisper of the wind through the trees the brief fluttery calling of the birds when he ordered it it began to rain and the soft comforting sound caused her to weep with joy colonel hu told her that they were the tears of a pure heart and a pure mind those were the first words she could recall his having spoken to her she took his hand shivering with the feel of his callused palm across her fingertips the first gulps of water he fed her went down her chin she was ashamed until she felt him wiping her off with a soft cloth he gave her a gentle kiss on her cheek and she was warm inside she slept when she woke she was ravenous colonel hu was there to feed her she tried to do it herself but it was as if she had forgotten what chopsticks were for she began to eat with her hands but he stopped her instead he fed her with the chopsticks slowly and carefully in a most instructional manner so that soon she was able to feed herself under his watchful gaze in all this time she had not said one word she found that she had no difficulty in understanding the simple things colonel hu said to her as with the chopsticks she seemed to have lost the ability to speak this too colonel hu taught her in the most patient manner possible qi lin could not imagine anyone being as patient as he was with her and she loved him all the more for it there were flashes of course times when she would remember with breathtaking clarity her other lifebefore she had been born again through the bright light of pain at those times she would speak up tell colonel hu that he was wrong that she knew the meaning of this or that the true meaning and why was he lying to her then the darkness would come down like a suffocating blanket and she would not even have the painthe very personal oasisto clutch to her breast instead she would be returned to the nothingness from which she had been born the first time this occurred qi lin said this cannot be happening i have already been reborn but no sound whatsoever came out and besides she almost drowned on the rush of fluid that filled her open mouth pain had long ago ceased to frighten her she knew instinctively that she could withstand any amount of agony because she knew the secret of turning it around like an alchemist she could transform agony into light a light that would keep her safe sound whole during the ensuing episodes she kept her mouth tightly shut that saved her perhaps from drowning but it did little to allay her terror there was nothing she concluded more horrifying than being thrust back into an endless void it was like dying for all eternity or worse not dying yet not living either eventually she learned to hide these bursts of what she termed color memory from those around her especially colonel hu who seemed to be watching her particularly for these socalled regression episodes in any case they began to occur less and less by the time colonel hu presented her with her target qi lin hardly remembered another life other than the one she had been leading here in the outskirts of beijing he floated on a lacquered ocean free of pain he was able to expand his qi his intrinsic energy so that he stretched out across the whole of the south china sea sunlight warm and lifegiving radiated down infusing him he watched the dolphins at play clowning through the foamy troughs made by the oilstained tankers in another quadrant he saw a herd of blue whales sounding they worked their flukes diving deep through layers of blue increasing to midnight in the blackness they sped the cows guiding their young with gentle nudges while silvery streams of bubbles trailed behind them and lazily rose into daylight are you relaxed ayeh bliss asked it was just before sunset and she had been working on his body for more than two hours very relaxed yesterdays pain is gone and today i have very little your hands work wonders on this ancient body warmth suffused him keeping for the moment the disease at bay she is the only one zilin thought who calls me grandfather to the others i am jian even to my son though bliss was more a goddaughter to him he loved that she called him ayeh grandfather was something lan jakes daughter would have called him lan he turned his mind to thoughts of her he no longer felt blisss hands kneading his ancient flesh his qi was expanded he saw and felt other more momentous things the petty concerns of the flesh were shut away for some time but in the end he returned to more human concerns i am jian he thought half dreaming i spent my entire life seeking to attain that exalted state now i can have no regrets about what it has brought me but oh i do i do it has cut me off from the life of a normal human being i come home to no wife no family gathered around the fireside i have sacrificed the traditions of the agestraditions that have made us the most unique and civilized people on earthin order to secure a safe pathway to the future we must learn new traditions if we are to survive and prosper but i do not know what they are i have nothing of that sort to pass on to jake i am truly suspended between two worlds i am of the old middle kingdom antiquated with superstition so i deliberately cut myself off from that level of thought the first jian the master of the fantastic garden in suzhou where i was born taught me the meaning of artifice in building a new world in school in shanghai my peers thought me odd a rebel whose views they could not fathom i can never forget my debt to the jian and i thank buddha every day that his living legacy bliss his greatgranddaughter is here with me now in hong kong zilin could still remember that day when blisss mother came to him he was still a rebel with mao hiding out in the hills of hunan while chiang kaishek sought a way to destroy the communist army he had done all he could for her in those dark days he had fed her and when she was sufficiently rested had used his influence with the leaders of the shan tribes in burma to get her through to hong kong and his brother three oaths tsun only microns thick his qi spread itself across the vastness of the lacquered ocean zilin was surprised by the continuance of its strength the disease that had been ravaging him for years now could only affect his body still because of the intense pain that would otherwise incapacitate him he had been obliged to draw more and more heavily on the power of his qi to keep himself sane and functioning it was good to know that he could not deplete that mystical reservoir in that sense he was as potent now as he had been when he was in his twenties no he thought now even more so because he developed the wisdom to know how to use his qi in ways he could not have imagined at that younger age but he also realized that his flaccid body required a trigger now to release his qi so completely it was no easy accomplishment these days with his nerve points so blocked with disease and pain it was difficult to maintain the free flow of energy throughout his system that allowed the release of his qi bliss worked his body like a magician using one set of unblocked points to aid her in freeing the next set and so on all along the nerve paths under siege by the ravages of time bliss he said now i am here grandfather you are good for an old man you make me feel young again thank you grandfather she said her head down but as to the other you are like granite you will never die ah my precious gem all who live must die it is buddhas will to defy that is to be greedy he sighed at something she could not discern some inward vision perhaps do you know what happened to the greedy man i dont no he at last came over the rise of a hillthe last of many in his travelsand saw before him a valley so vast that he could not determine its dimensions and this entire valley was encrusted with everything he had sought to possess during his lifetime everything he spent days running from piece to piece examining and sifting happy beyond all imagining at first his intense excitement and joy pushed the thought of food and drink from his mind but eventually the sight of his endless possessions began to pale beside his gnawing hunger and thirst now he stumbled through the encrusted valley but no longer did he care which bauble he passed hunger consumed him thirst dizzied him zilin was silent then and bliss was forced to prompt him then what happened the man found that he could bear his thirst and his hunger no longer he had no choice for the valley was indeed endless and nowhere within it was there food or drink all his life he had coveted riches and at last they were his but because his desire for them was so omnivorous there was no room even in that endless valley for food to grow or water to surface or for another soul to inhabit his universe bliss shuddered it seems a cruel fate cruelty breeds cruelty he said softly adrift on the lacquered ocean he became aware of a disturbance it was as if a storm was brewing on the far horizon stretching his qi to its limits he sought its source we are through for the day bliss said how do you feel wonderful zilin said feeling his qi rushing back to his core as if with the onset of night because of you wonderful still he thought of that faroff storm and because of that he said are you ready again to journey to dahei he spoke of the great darkness within which all human spiritual energy dwelled bliss nodded but i do not understand a cat does not understand why it is able to fall from a great height and land on its feet a bird does not understand how it is that it can fly it merely seeks the air and becomes one with it zilin held out his hand it is the same with you do you imagine that anyone may enter the sphere of dahei he grunted now give me your hand your eyes here and here are you afraid no not of dahei that i can feel i mean are you afraid of that which has no explanation i have been trained not to be yet you are afraid she bowed her head and whispered yes then you must know why it is you are afraid zilin waited until her head came up and their eyes met again it is because that which has no explanation is also without limit the responsibility the small cabin echoed her words her feelings and when she passed through with him into dahei her exhilaration and her dread jake was dreaming of his daughter lan he often did that and it was never pleasant always he was on the banks of the sumchun river the muddy water flowed over his feet so that he could neither see them nor feel them his daughter was running toward him she had her mothers body she was very beautiful she was clothed in gossamer instead of the ragged triad uniform she had actually had on that day she ran in the water she did not sink but rather ran on as if she were on solid land jake fearful for her opened his mouth lan he called lan but no sound came out he strained to call to her but there was no response from inside him at that moment mariana his second wife appeared beside him she was laughing so hard the tears were streaming down her face what are you doing she could barely get the words out dont you know you were born without vocal cords just as she was about to cry for real she vanished leaving him alone with lan coming across the sumchun river at full speed she saw him now and she smiled her arms opened wide then the blood started to flow from neat round holes in an oblique line down her body a fountain of blood her face filled with terror and she slipped sinking into the river jake shouting tried to get up but the river had his feet his legs ended in ankle stubs callused and worn he could not even hobble with a herculean effort he flung himself into the river down and down into its sluggish depths he sank without feet to propel him he was like a stone his arms and hands were useless near the muddy bottom he found her twined in weed and fern she swung bluewhite through the aimless current an errant eddy swirled her black hair across her face so that he was obliged to pull it away as he came up on her it was as tenacious as if it were alive it seemed vital to clear her face so he devoted himself to the task it took all his energy and when at last he had succeeded he let out a scream of sheer horror it was his face he saw swinging slackly before him his face his face woke up in a rush his chest was heaving like a bellows gone mad his skin slick with cold sweat sound filled the room jake there it was again chilling him jake stop it sound upon sound he began to shiver then to shake to sweat bliss tried to get her arms around him but he fought her hurting her not meaning to not yet seeing her or even knowing she was with him the sound echoed eerily through the core of him it had substance as much shape as a shadow he associated a color with it a deep nut brown rich and glossy filled with hidden tones skin tones skin running with crimson blood exploding mahogany trees piercing the sky like javelins thrown by giants jake jake together they struggled while the demons of sound howled and cried out his daughter calling out to him across the gulf of the sumchun river bahba bahba bahba while the bullets tore into her and she stumbled falling to her knees in the sluggish eddies regaining her feet turning and falling almost immediately the mahogany trees exploding upward in a great fiery burst as the mortars hit fountains of blood and rock chips threeandahalf years ago when jake was still an active member of the quarry on a mission at the border of the new territories and mainland china working with a secretive splinter triad misfits and daredevil maniacs outcasts of the major triads who patrolled the northern border of the new territories pulling fleeing communists across into the colony jake and his grouphis dantaihad been assigned to safeguard a crossing of three highlevel chinese scientists for that he had had to enlist the aid of the triad but something had gone very wrong someone had been pulled in at the last minute perhaps and been made to talk their operation had come unraveled beneath a withering counterattack the strategy had been flawless and jake had recognized the hand of a wei qi master at the head of the enemy nichiren the assassin he had been chasing the man who had shot jakes daughter lan lan falling into his already bloody arms her skin a deep nut brown so much like her mothers but already cool her eyes were distant and dark her long hair undone cascaded into the swirling river lan dying in his arms and her murderer jakes halfbrother nichiren on the far shore directing the counterattack the wei qi master jake had gone after him after him across the river into the jungle and then unsuccessful he had returned to find only the bodies of his massacred group the triad had gathered up their own casualties and faded back into the burning trees from that moment on the triad had severed all contact with jake believing that they were betrayed by someone inside the quarry a disaster on many levels for which jake had paid dearly for years afterward lan he screamed now beating bliss back against the wall lan jake she called to him breathlessly jake its only a dream a dream she fought aside his fists you are awake now beating aside his frightened blows listen to me you are awake lan is dead do you hear me dead jakes eyes were wide open he knew where he was but all he saw was the sumchun river the exploding trees the stumbling body of his longlost daughter bamahk he thought desperately bamahk was the way to energy calmness order inside oneself it was the way to see others strategies to win battles even wars bamahk feel the pulse it was the first lesson that fo saan had taught him he tried to concentrate feel the pulse and for the first time since it had been introduced to him jake felt nothing bamahk it was gone its power was closed to him only a great roiling at the core of him lan lan lan before he knew it he was crying into the hollow of blisss shoulder its all right she whispered its all right stroking him over and over wiping off the sweat brushing back the hair that had fallen over his forehead her palms against his chest kneading the tension out of the muscles the tips of her bare breasts crushed against him doing everything she could think of to bring the heat back into a frame that had gone cold as ice it was as if he diedor at least a good part of him diedduring these episodes his flesh turned cold his color paled his pulse became rapid and erratic his breathing was dangerously shallow as he exhaled in rapid pants rubbing her breasts against him breathing warmth into him through parted lips drawing him out because he was withdrawing and she feared that one time he would do so with such severity that he would no longer be able to return to her it was her opinionbut one that he had made her keep to herselfthat his episodes were becoming more and more severe once he dreamed of lan perhaps once a month now it was several times a week and the violence of the visions had increased at an alarming rate moved one hand down his body stroking his lower belly and inner thighs caressing his sacred sac squeezing ever so slightly grazing the sensitive skin with the edges of her nails until she felt the heat of him beginning to emerge as she placed the engorged tip of him against the flanges of her jade gate allowing their natural movements to move him against her slowly achingly so that without any other help her sex flowered open to him arousing him even more she gasped as he plunged into the core of her her head thrown back her breasts thrust into his chest his lips came down onto her exposed neck sucking there until she moaned with pleasure never once did her talented hands cease their work across his flesh never once did she allow him to slow circling her hips she thrust herself to the limit onto his hot pulsing sword long strokes then short quick strokes up and up until each moment hung suspended in ecstasy precious and sublime tender they entered each other in an entirely other way then and her qi sought to cleanse him of the remnants of his nightmare each scorching instant brought them closer together merged into time and space until jake could draw it out no longer and throbbing he shot and shot into her liquid depths groaning deeply exhaling the longheld air out of him all the way down to his loins bliss trembling like a leaf in a gale felt his orgasm reach out and surround her in heat in that moment she felt the onset of the clouds and the rain and abandoned herself to his inner core vulnerable and open to her widest extent she unwittingly entered dahei for the first time on her own and instead of confronting the coruscating colors of jakes exceptional qi she encountered something else entirely dahei the great darkness where all incorporeal essence resides revealed to her all that she needed to know her black eyes flew open and she looked upon the face of her beloved now relaxed drifting off to sleep his arms tenderly around her i will not weep bliss told herself but in this she was not successful mckenna went looking for big oysters pok he had been electrified by the thought that southasia bancorp might be in financial trouble if the rumors true he thought formidable sungs in a real mess half his life must be tied up in southasias vaults if there really is a case of fiduciary malfeasance at southasia i sodding well better find out about it mckenna prowled the nightside clubs of wan chai he went from one sleezy joint to another a world of revolving red and green lights watereddown drinks and pathetic whores addicted to the tears of the poppy at twelve old at fifteen masters of sleight of hand and deceit he had only ever seen big oysters in one of these places mckenna supposed the chinese lived in that world in a kind of permanent way big oysters the chinese said knew everything that went on within the crown colony the fact was that he made mckenna nervous he fell into none of the preconceived stereotypes that filled mckennas head and therefore he was a threat usually mckenna did not sit still for threats but big oysters was different mckenna needed him so he left him alone mckenna found him inside the white teacup an utterly ridiculous name for an establishment that dispensed swill and gonorrhea with equal indifference big oysters was sitting near the rear where mckenna was quick to notice the red and blue strobe lights were more subdued the music not as deafening and the drinks were full strength mckenna made his way through the sailors on shore leave with the kind of exaggerated swagger that had helped earn him his nickname great pool of piddlefrom the chinese big oysters was with a woman and not one of the local bgirls this one had class she was dressed to kill mckenna getting an eyeful fairly drooled over the cleavage and thigh the womans theatrical and expensive dress revealed seeing mckenna big oysters squeezed the woman on the elbow and she rose disappearing into the smoky pall of the nightclub there was nothing on big oysters face to indicate how he felt about this grossly oversized man sitting down across from him the fact was that mckennas very size made the chineses sacred sac pull up inside itself there was something intimidating about all that height and girth big oysters hated himself for feeling as he did but there was nothing he could do about it joss youve disturbed my evening he said sipping at his courvoisier mind if i have a drink help yourself big oysters said dont tell me you eat at joints like this mckenna sneered i have business here big oysters said i eat at star house in causeway bay sure i know it mckenna said nodding he looked at big oysters through the glass i need some information about southasia bancorp big oysters winced inwardly at the foreign devils total lack of manners the civilized man would have sat and drunk at least one full round with his host he would have asked after the hosts family the state of the hosts business enterprises he would have perhaps made a small wager on when rain would again fall when one sat down with a toad big oysters thought resignedly one must expect to be spattered with slime what about southasia i was hoping you would tell me big oysters watched those terrible pale blue eyes that looked as if they had witnessed something they should not have what do i get in return he asked twentyfourhour advance warning on the next special branch raid in your territory i want those raids to stop altogether christ mckenna thought even i dont have that much authority besides even if i did it would cause too much talk at the commissioners level theyd no doubt hear about it in london and then thered be a real flap a fullscale investigation and it all would be goneyour protection our arrangement everything big oysters turned his head and spat so much for the foreigndevil british their time here is done when and if they go it wont be the best scenario for the likes of you i can tell you mckenna said gracelessly the communistsll come in here and pull all the hairs from your sacred sac big oysters laughed to cover the enormity of his disgust for this barbarian i wouldnt worry about the communists he said weve got a surprise or two for them the southasia bancorp mckenna said he had no desire to debate politics with an ignorant chinese why did you come to me mckenna finished his brandy i have it on good authority that someone may have embezzled a lot of money out of there big oysters considered what great pool of piddle had told him i have heard nothing of this he said nothing and that is the most interesting aspect either your information is incorrect or or what mckenna prompted or big oysters said the embezzlement is so big theyve put a total security net over the whole thing then im wasting my time with you on the contrary how i detest this foreign devil big oysters thought but i need his information to keep my profits high i use him the way his kind have used us over the years be here this time tomorrow youll have your answer one way or the other bloody good mckenna said getting up oh one thing yes those raid warnings big oysters said shuddering inwardly at the mans abominable height youll provide them free of charge for six months impossible mckenna exploded nothings impossible to a man of your rank big oysters said evenly tomorrow at this time choking on his fury mckenna nodded then he spun around and stalked out there was too much noise for him to hear big oysterss laughter every day of the working week jake went into sawyer sons laboring at the zhuans business out of an office andrew sawyer had set up for him next to his own on the top floor of the tower on weekends jake worked either from home or from three oaths junk there was much to be done lines of communication into communist china into singapore bangkok manila jakarta toyko and osaka had to be maintained every day new contacts were being established increasing the depth and scope of the yuhnhyuns sphere of influence companies hewing cedar trees in indonesia building light machinery in singapore inventing new kinds of computer chips in tokyo were all linked together in a farflung skein of interrelated commerce and all had to be coordinated by the zhuan mornings and evenings were devoted to telephone and telex linkups with various company presidents and key division personnel in between jake was busy reviewing those companies computer readouts relaying updates on inventories production schedules leveraged buyouts long and shortterm debt market share and in the case of the public corporations how they were faring on their national stock markets the days were long and inevitably filled with problems but finding solutions was very much akin to planning moves across a wei qi board problemsolving became second nature to himas the jian knew it wouldprecisely because of his wei qi training jake was fascinated by the manipulations and the strategies he conjured up and implemented near evening he wrapped up his last call and slinging his jacket over his shoulder went down in the private elevator only he and andrew sawyer used out on the sidewalk the air was thick with humidity overhead the sky was clear streaked with a russet and amethyst sunset refracted off the spires of central it seemed to fill the air to the bursting point but to the west clouds were already pushing in and he scented rain on its way jake knew there was someone there as soon as he got into his jaguar the car was parked just outside the sawyer building a tick in tall grass he thought beginning to work out the vectors open to him all the while thinking two thoughts why is there someone following me and who is running the operation several other things occurred to him as he made his way along queens road why choose this moment to begin a tail on him was it coincidence or something more sinister in jakes experience it was dangerous to take an occurrence at face value his gaze flicked into the image in his rearview mirror silvergray alfaromeo spider veloce low and sleek the driver allowed a cordovancolored mercedes sel then a mitsubishi truck to get inbetween the spider moving up and back in the traffic flow sign of a very canny driver yet jake might not have been aware of him for some time had he not misjudged the timing jake heard his engine start up and then the alfas a millisecond later if his window hadnt been down he doubted that hed have heard the double sound at all joss bad for the tick good for him it was not until jake had parked his jaguar in the western district that he got a clear look the tick was a woman she did not have a typical cantonese or shanghainese face that did not mean that she did not fit in with her surroundings on the contrary she was chicly dressed in one of those oversize japanese sweaterblouses a graybrowntaupe striped thing with bat sleeves and an enormous cowl neck that hung around her throat like jewelry she wore mahoganycolored leather pants and anklehigh suede boots she could move too jake observed he had not once looked at her directly but instead was using what the territory naturally provided him shop windows glass doors it was imperative that he get the measure of her skill before he tried to lose her because it would give him an impression of how good the opposition wasand that by extension would give him a clue to the identity of the control also it would give him a better idea of which escape maneuvers would work best against her jake was due at three oaths junk in fifteen minutes for a meeting alone with his father a date he was now unlikely to make on time that was all right the first order of business after spotting the tag was to change his destination ticks were as often interested in where their subjects were going as they were in their subjects themselves that was why jake had gone in the opposite direction he needed to cut out the tick and in isolation go to work that was of course impossible while they were both mobile on foot there were innumerable methods of cut out and contact losing the tick in the jag had occurred to jake but was dismissed first know your enemy jake had been taught he hurried back toward the populated central district he was already working within an emergency situation bluestone had apparently seen to that in a red sector he knew evasion tactics were a waste of time evasion fo saan had told him is a delaying strategy at best therefore it is a weak strategy in all but the most specialized circumstances evasion has no part in the killing ground on the other hand time was against him cut outs required time there were complex often elegant affairs jakes meeting with his father in fifteen minutes was of the utmost importance zilin was ready to tell jake of the shadow enemies as he had put it so jake did the only thing he could he went off the street taking the steps three at a time he bolted up a staircase leading to the network of raised and covered walkways that joined the huge office towers of the crown colonys central district jake pushed people out of the way up against the billboards crossing to the island side of connaught road central turned a corner and using the glossy facade of an advertisement saw the woman right behind him her face in ghostly passage boutiques were no good because they were too small no place to get lost in and anyway no back entrances restaurants were another matter and he ducked into one brushing past the line snaked up for tables but it was no go she was too close behind him and he got out of there the skywalks were a trap he saw now and he went down to the street at the first chance she was good this unknown tick as good on foot as she had been in the alfa and now he was doubly glad that he had used a number of feints to get the feel of her because he knew this wasnt going to be easy knew too that he would have to lose her before he could head toward his meeting there was no way he could lead her to his objective he hurried down ice house street until he came to des voeux road central hung around the curb as if undecided as to what move to make next swung aboard the westbound tram at the very last instant and watched as the woman ran lunging for the open back doorway she wouldnt have made it either but some eagerbeaver tourist reached out and pulled her aboard lifting her off the pavement with his powerful suntanned arms he was still talking to her laughing and bobbing his head as jake edged away through the crowd toward the front of the tram where they turned onto tung street jake leapt off not caring now to hide his movements they were in the allchinese western district full of warehouses shipping firms snake shops fish markets and apothecaries she came down off the tram and began to follow him as he turned onto jervois street that was all right during the time on the tram jake had thought of how he would handle her and he did not want to lose her at least not yet he went two blocks then abruptly cut to his right up a narrow alley rank with the scents of gutted fish and drying skate the light was coming down the pale winter sun already dropped below the bosom of the sea the last watery fingers of its light played across the very tops of the midlevel residential skyscrapers that rose like groves of bamboo from the steep slopes of victoria peak shadows were everywhere their spread across the cracked cobblestones running dark with fish blood reminded jake of mikio komoto he had tried to reach him twice again today but even kachikachi mikios faithful adviser could offer no hope of finding komoto that was an unpropitious sign mikio had been forced out of his tokyo compound by the escalating yakuza war had he been injured was he now in a secluded hospital surrounded by members of his clan armed to repel an assassination attempt was his power in the japanese underworld gone there were no answers to these questions in desperation jake had phoned his information source in tokyo he was not home at noon which was unusual that was the time he and jake had set upon for their electronic rendezvous if jake had not had the southasia bancorp crisis on his hands he would have taken the next plane out of kai tak bound for tokyo as it was on ladder street he began to ascend the way was steep and narrow hence it name it was lined with doorless shops small spaces dim even at noontime within which were stacked square cages jake ducked into one of these and quickly made his purchase the price was exorbitant because of the time of year but he had no time to enter into an extended round of bargaining with his back to the street he tucked his purchase away and continued up ladder street his movement had been so quick and the light was now so bad that his tick had not been certain what he had done so much the better at the head of ladder street was an alley without a name he headed into it engulfing himself in shadow he went perhaps fifty yards down the fetid tunnel his back against the walls he stopped and listened now would come the test either she would follow him into the alley or she would stay where she was and wait for him to come out either way he would be ready for her he waited it was late for the western district which closed up shop between five and six a dog barked and then snuffling moved on somewhere above his head a baby began crying he heard the lilt of a female voice singing in cantonese soon the baby grew still now there was nothing and jake found himself thinking of mikio komoto again was he too crouching in the darkness somewhere waiting for an assassin to strike was he carrying a modern weapon or an ancient one gun or bow and arrow blood spilled in rivers in tokyo and osaka how many men had he lost and kisans clan as well the battle for territory and honor one must never forget the yakuzas fierce honor gin jake felt it now his obligation to his friend with all the weight on his shoulders that being the zhuan brought it was ridiculous that he should add to it but gin was hardly a matter of choice one either felt it or one did not it was as simple as that he felt duty bound to help his friend all the while his ears were open for any sound that might disturb the fragile integrity of the environment he checked his watch with a flick of his gaze it had been fifteen minutes she was not going to venture in well that said a great deal about her smiling to himself jake crept away from the head of the alley he had picked this one deliberately because it had the appearancelike many of its neighborsof being a culdesac what he had discovered quite by accident some time ago was that at its far end was a space between two warehouses just wide enough for a man to slip through tak ching road beckoned to him beyond the gray interstice jake took one last look behind him at the head of the alley shadows crept along the wall like cringing dogs but there was no sound at all no sign of pursuit let her guard her entrance well he thought as he slipped through the narrow fissure shell find nothing there he was through the narrow space struck by the lights of tak ching road and the muzzle of a pistol pressed against his face the cowl neck of her sweater framed her face with shadow when jake was leaving his office three japanese couples were deplaning from their flight in from tokyo at hong kongs kai tak airport they passed through immigration and customs without incident they were young and of approximately the same age perhaps in their early twenties they might have been affluent newlyweds off on an expensive shopping spree in hong kong a typical custom for many of the japanese rich and so they engendered the minimum of attention at the crowded airport as they collected their matched louis vuitton luggage and were met by a uniformed chauffeur they piled into a gleaming white rolls the men first the ladies standing about wideeyed and giggling in their albert nipon and gianni versace outfits they stayed at the ultramodern regent hotel because it was closest to the water and the harbor views were breathtaking but they went across the street to the most luxurious bastion of the british colonial occupation of asia the peninsula hotel because its spectacular lobby was the place to see and be seen while having tea or drinks they spent perhaps an hour there time enough for the haughty japanese to come to the attention of almost all the staff who in any case resented the japanese and saw them as uncivilized louts during that time it might have been notedhad anyone cared to pay attentionthat the women jabbered on much as all women would who were embarking on an exciting sojourn in a foreign land but the men spoke not at all rather they smoked furiously downing suntory scotch with almost mechanical regularity one moment there were six of them sitting comfortably the next moment only the women remained the three men were already down the marble steps and through the semicircular courtyards filled with rollses and mercedeses they did not go back to the regent but rather hailed a taxi to kai tak once at the airport they split up one of the men went through the main terminal to a bank of metal rental lockers using a key he opened one and withdrew three vinyl flight bags darkblue overprinted with a white airline logo he took these into the mens room inside he kept one distributing the others to his two companions who were waiting for him all three used the cubicles ten minutes later the first man emerged over the course of the next five minutes the other two came out all carried their darkblueandwhite flight bags but save for that element they were unrecognizable as the young affluent japanese who had arrived at the airport thirty minutes before at some point before leaving the terminal all three disposed of their bags in separate trash cans two took different buses the third climbed into a taxi despite the fact that they were using differing means of transportation they were all headed for the same destination the harbor at aberdeen in an unusual display of public affection three oaths took neon chows hand he could not help himself she was so dazzling he felt intoxicated by her presence it was the evening of her birthday andas she had requested they were at the elegant gaddis one of asias finest restaurants this was where neon chow had wanted to go and she had shown her appreciation by wearing his favorite dress that showed off the emerald necklace he had given her also out of deference to him she wore no other jewelry there was nothing to compete with the necklace three oaths felt better than he had in thirty years there was not a man present who was not looking or had not looked at neon chow men far younger than himself he thought there are some fires that age cannot diminish he was so happy that even the prospect of eating loh faan style did not bother him one night ingesting food that had been chopped minced pureed and whipped into consistencies that bore no relation to their natural state would not kill him he might have indigestion later on but neon chow knew how to cure that he smiled at the thought and his sacred member began to thicken underneath the table eeeeya neon chow cried as the sommelier brought over a bottle of dom perignon my favorite she had developed a taste for fine champagne from the governmental functions she attended with the governor personally three oaths thought all champagne tasted like cat piss but he thought this is her night and she will get what she wants he watched her stuff herself with foie gras and caviar and later venison flown in from buddha only knew where dripping in a reduction of juices and cream so rich that it made him bilious just to inhale the aroma but what did any of that matter as long as she was happy neon chows pleasure was at this moment very precious to him when she was happy she made him happy and considering the monumental business problems confronting him he needed her radiant energy like a fragile plant needed a fiery sun the final accountings at southasia had come in while he was again at andrew sawyers office as was their habit he and sawyer had been going over the monthly revenue returns on the tanker fleet owned by the inner circle and run by three oaths when the shock had worn off enough for them to regain their senses they had tried to locate jake but it was late in the day and jake had already left the office three oaths had called his daughter bliss had been on her way to aberdeen to give the jian another acupressure treatment aboard three oathss junk she had no idea where jake might have gone but she knew that he was due at the junk that evening to see his father normally a couple of hours would not have made a difference but the news the full audit had given them was chilling not twentyfive million but closer to fiftyfive million dollars american had been embezzled it was a staggering sum and a certain death blow to southasia as far as three oaths and andrew sawyer could determine it was difficult to conceive how such a vast sum of money could be filtered out of an organization without anyone suspecting three oaths had said but sawyer had explained the subtly veined network of international companies that surrounded southasia the bank sat at the very heart of them their nerve center an accountant and a comprador of sufficient guile and daring could manage to steal that much money over a specific period of time the trouble was sawyer had said that neither man had seemed to him capable of taking the enormous risk such a deception would entail three oaths had said the fact remains that the yuhnhyun has lost fiftyfive million dollars we are without sufficient funds to make up what has been embezzled in effect we have lost our depositors money if even a hint of that leaks into the colony southasia will be shuttered almost immediately dessert was a dense chocolate cake layered with praline buttercream three oathss stomach screamed for surcease but he ate his piece anyway hoping that the fragrant oolong tea would calm him of course they could abandon their fight to retain control of pak that would certainly free up enough cash but at what price it was unthinkable pak han min was the inner circles key into kam sang three oaths did not know why kam sang was so vital to the yuhnhyun though it had been he himself who had created the labyrinth of interlocking companies known as pak han min he had been under discipline to his elder brother zilin to do so why all the companies that comprised pak made an excellent profit due in large part to three oathss acute business acumen but that profit was funneled through a complicated and wholly clandestine method directly into kam sang why to his knowledge only the jian was privy to that secret information three oaths only knew that they must not lose pak han min did that mean then that they would have to let southasia bancorp shrivel and die what would be left of the yuhnhyun if that should happen what is the matter si ji since there was no definite word in cantonese for dear or darling neon chow used other nicknames si ji meant lion what she had broken in on his musings i saw you shudder do you have a chill is that why you have only been half listening to me all evening are you ill i am not ill three oaths said gruffly he did not like it when she treated him like a child it reminded him of his age and if i have not been as attentive as i should be ive not been aware of it but that shudder neon chow persisted seeming concerned only the air conditioning he lied i should have asked them to change the table seemingly mollified she said i know youve had a lot on your mind lately since youve been spending so much time at the sawyer building i see new creases on that beautiful lions face i dont like that i am tai pan he said with a tai pans responsibilities you know that somehow things were simpler i think you were happier before jake maroc became zhuan you two do not get along what is he to you neon chow said just your nephew he is the jians son three oaths said and he is zhuan why not one of your sons your number one son is more than qualified isnt he deserving of such a signal honor perhaps three oaths said but this was not my decision to make are you not a great tai pan neon chow insisted three oaths said why do you harbor these thoughts because jake shi says nothing if he were mute he would say as much to me i do not trust him you are being foolish it is part of being zhuan three oaths said it is not an easy thing to do to cut yourself off from all outside disturbances he must concentrate all his energies on leading the yuhnhyun toward what end neon chow asked dont you think all of us deserve to know that one china three oaths said his eyes shining that has been the jians dream for many decades mine as well a united china strong in the forefront of twentyfirstcentury world trade a modern china the remaking of the face of asia to do that neon chow said shrewdly beijing would have to divest itself almost entirely of communism it would have to become firm allies with the capitalist west yes thats quite true when sufficient time had passed neon chow excused herself she went into the ladies room in a tiny wallpapered antechamber was a pay phone she dialed a number and waited while it rang waaaaay peony she said identifying herself i need a rendezvous with mitre as soon as possible ill see what i can do the voice said tonelessly please hold neon chow began to sweat in the tiny airless cubicle come on she thought what could take so long seventytwo hours and thats the best these dungeating bureaucrats can do she thought what do they know of the emergencies that arise in the field dew neh loh moh on that she shouted down the line this is peony all right all right the voice said fortyeight hours but thats the limit by all the evil gods in hell she fumed silently if i were a man mitre wouldnt treat me this way damn all men she went into the ladies room she tried to calm herself while she urinated at the mirror she stared at her face as if she had never seen it before flaws and the marks of time were becoming more and more manifest with a sudden wave of disgust she found that she hated her face great buddha she thought communist china allied with the west what a monstrous idea she knew that she could not return to the table in this agitated state three oaths would pick up her inharmoniousness immediately above all she knew she must give him no cause for alarm if she made him even the least bit suspicious all would be lost she called upon her training breathing deeply and slowly thus she purged herself of all negative emotion when she was ready she returned to the dinner table three oaths had called for another pot of tea sit down please he said filling her cup i have something to ask you fear rushed like a stream through her and for a moment she was so dizzy that she thought her knees would not hold her calm yourself she thought fiercely do you want to die so young she sat opposite him and because she knew that this was what was called for she sipped at her tea all the time she was thinking i must get us back to the junk as quickly as possible but how what can it be she said when she could trust herself to speak that gives you such a serious face this is my birthday after all all serious topics are traditionally banished for the night ive waited as long as i was able he said by way of apology but certain business er problems dictate that the traditions be turned aside this one time all right si ji she said in her little girls voice it will be as you wish gods what has been going on between the tai pan up at sawyers office not as i wish not at all joss dictates this then i accept my joss she smiled a smile as false as her words he nodded as i knew you would i want you to contrive to meet sir john bluestone in the course of your job at the governors office neon chow had ceased to breathe she was certain that all the color had drained from her face and she thought frenziedly all gods bear witness he knows i want you to be as friendly as you can even flirt with him i want in short for you to present yourself to him then she thought he only suspects and is playing with me i want ultimately for you to become his confidante convince him that you are growing tired of me i am an old man after all perhaps my sexual prowess isnt what it once was but si it is a logical tack to take it is i think what mr bluestone would like to believe i think further that it will tickle him to cuckold me especially when you tell him that you will spy on me for him si ji now now that is only what i wish him to believe in reality you will be spying on him for me oh she cried clapping her hands you have the most deliciously clever mind the yuhnhyun is desperate for inside information on bluestones next moves will you do it she was laughing to herself he doesnt know after all he doesnt even suspect she wanted to burst into tears of relief of course ill do it she said leaning toward him across the table one hand had disappeared in a moment three oaths felt her nimble fingers at the apex of his thighs even through his trousers she could do things that aroused him to a fever pitch come she whispered huskily she encircled his sacred member as it unfurled let us go home as quickly as possible i want to consummate my birthday and our new business arrangement the snake when it came out of jakes shirt was already hissing he had bought it in the shop on ladder street this was the time the hibernating snakes were divested of a fluid said by the chinese to promote health and sexual prowess the warmth of being next to jakes skin had revived it from its winter torpor and now it was inquisitive about its immediate environment jake threw it at the tick she threw her arms up as the snake got tangled in the huge cowl neck of her sweater the gun went clattering down the alley jake watched fascinated as she struggled with it in this he made a mistake she struck him two lightning kites partially missing with the first but connecting fully with the second all the breath rushed from jakes lungs and he began to double over the snake was on the ground coiled its scales gleaming dully it hissed the womans left knee came up catching jakes cheek his vision blurred and he fell to the pavement then she was bending ripping off one highheel he turned his head and saw her gripping the top of the boot the heel was turned toward him and he could see the streetlight catch along the tip it was steelsheathed the weapon swung downward and jake rolled at the last possible instant heard the sharp report of the steel striking stone sparks shooting up and the arm already pulling back for the next strike jake in sumi otoshi his fingers sliding around the womans forearm and immediately he twisted to the left pulling her with him sucking her into the circular path of his own momentum she stumbled went down on one knee scraping it hard against the rough pavement jake used a kite at her wrist and the boot went skittering away into the permanent shadows of the alleyway he could hear the panting of her breath and he knew that he had a chance now regaining his feet as she did facing each other as she threw her other shoe into the darkness equal terms reestablished it was as if the last frantic few moments had never existed until she came at him in a circular pattern and used the double palm change and disrupted his strategy he not fully prepared and cursing himself as he went down in great pain having failed to follow fo saan and ultimately lao tzu who counseled in combat listen not with your ears which hear only ordinary things listen not with your heart which records only information of the rational world rather listen with the breath so that one may await extraordinary events in a noncommittal fashion he had heard with his heart had reacted to the woman the rational despite what his newfound experience told him that she could not be as deadly as a male opponent had not been noncommittal but had anticipated and in so doing had sealed his defeat went down in a blinding welter of pain that made his ears ring leached strength from his arms and shoulders she had used a strike from pakua one of chinas oldest martial arts one of the original war arts or wushu that stressed circular movements in attack and defense much like aikido which was jakes mainstay caught thus offguard he was defenseless her eyes followed the path her palms were taking she moved first through her waist low center of gravity then summoning the energy from that reserve transferred it into her arms moved with blurring speed got in four or five serious blows before jake could recover enough to block the next two that surprised her and gave him a bit of breathing room but again he anticipated sure that she would continue the attack with pakua instead she ripped the gold chain from around her throat flicked it outward in a kasumi throw just as if the gold links were the steel manrikigusari the japanese weighted chain struck him in the eye and immediately she had wrapped the chain around his neck pulling from both ends her knee pressed into his chest threw up both his hands slamming the wrists against the inside of her arm making her twist to her right grasping her right wrist as she did so with his right hand pulling it sharply down to his right while jamming his heel of his left hand against her right elbow heard a crack then a brief cry of surprise and pain from her as he pulled her hard forward throwing her completely offbalance she was against him and his intention was to use an atemi a hard percussion blow wanting only to stun her but saw the point of the knife just in time divining her intent and knowing there was no time at all because of how close they were had no choice then but to use the juthara one of the lethal atemi the one that broke the tips of the fifth and sixth ribs using them as internal weapons the concussion of the blow jamming them up into the heart within six minutes he had boarded a red doubledecker bus heading east he went immediately to the upper level so that he had a better vantage point of the environment the bus pulled out and he watched the street behind them until he was absolutely certain he was not being followed at the next stop he got off walked four blocks using natural cover as an added precaution took another bus back west into central the busy nightlife engulfed him it turned the red bus phosphorescent faces of the passengers were blue with reflected neon the tick had possessed no id jake would have been surprised if there had been any pockets contained some money no keys nothing at all save a tiny hastily wrapped parcel wedged into the seam of the lining felt the shape of it in the palm of his hand he unwrapped it and took a look an uncut opal with exceptional fire at the stop he needed jake descended at the last possible instant he was about to make his final run to his rendezvous and he was understandably cautious if there was one tick there might be others at last he felt safe enough to return to his parked jaguar with a squeal of burnt rubber he took off heading up over the peak toward aberdeen and the jian bliss was reading the jian a story it was one of his favorites the one about the hare and the sister stars who return to the middle kingdom in the form of human beings the stories the jian liked the best she had found were the ones involving transmogrification she suspected that was because he believed this is what had happened to him it gave bliss immense pleasure to read to him though in point of fact much of their quiet time together was spent with him telling her stories about her greatgrandfather the first jian and the legendary garden where zilins own philosophical nature had been formed bliss for all the love and training three oaths and his family had given her felt essentially rootless she barely remembered her mother and the time they had spent with the mountain tribes in the shan statesthough many years later three oaths had insisted that she go back to the burmese highlands as if she would discover a sense of place there as for her father she did not even know his name he had died while blisss mother was six months pregnant with her in the jian she had come home again full circle within the special glow of his loving presence she had found the place she had come from it was as if she had been conceived in the fabulous garden of her greatgrandfather which zilin drew for her in his evocative wordpictures she discovered quite without warning that she loved him with a fierceness and dedication that she had previously thought impossible it was not the kind of love she felt for jake or even for three oaths this was a transcendent emotion that made her feel as if she were truly a part of the earth the sea the sky she had never been a practicing buddhist but the love she experienced for the jian made her wish that she was she revered him above all other men but she was fully aware that he was a man for all that the jian believed that he was one of the celestial guardians of china thus his ren his harvest that took the form of the yuhnhyun in hong kong had been born and was given shape by him over the course of fifty years it was a monumental enough undertaking for an entire country for one man it seemed impossible yet she knew the jian was not one man he commanded a vast network throughout all of asia perhaps even farther who really knew the extent of the ren she suspected not even jake was as yet fully aware of the scope of the network zilin had created it was in the nature of the jian to keep his secrets he had needed to do so for so many years that it was now quite impossible for him to do otherwise slowly now he was teaching jake the meaning of the term jian jake was not jian but rather zhuanjian meant creator zhuan meant managerand the difference was vast privately in the most secret recesses of her own heart bliss wondered whether jake would one day earn the title of jian she had finished the story the hare had heroically sewed his role aiding the sister stars who now had returned to their place in the heavens all was right with the world bliss looked down at the reclining figure his ancient face was partly in shadow she was not sure whether he was awake or asleep she heard all about her the soft creaking of the junks fittings it was very quiet the guards made no sound no one else was aboard bliss suspected that if her father had decided to remarry instead of taking a mistress such as neon chow the children would have been made to stay aboard evenings she did not know whether or not that would be a good thing as three oaths was always quick to point out todays children were not like those of the past they had less sense of their forebears of tradition he fought that loss she knew with every fiber of his being but keeping the children locked on the junk was no answer and he knew that besides he was just as often ashore with neon chow until late in the night she rose certain that the jian had fallen asleep are you going bliss no ayeh she sat down again i thought you had drifted off i almost did his voice was as brittle as rice paper the pain woke me it kept me suspended between bliss glanced at him and he said what is it bousehk nothing i just i dont know why you must shoulder so much pain she said zilin peered into her shadowed face if i did not feel the pain i would no longer be certain that i was alive i am alive now heya you must think of that he struggled to sit up and she reached to help him when their flesh touched she jumped what did you feel he wanted to know a current an electric shock but that is impossible thinking of senlin he said nothing is impossible you know that very well yes but some things out of the ensuing silence zilin said there are no limits whatever may happen in the future it is imperative that you keep this thought close beside you in a moment he had twisted her around their faces were very close he saw the soft light falling like a mantle across her golden skin and he thought of her mother and how he had aided her in her time of need you have served me well and faithfully in the past bousehk you kept my son safe under the most trying circumstances do not think that for a moment i have forgotten this service he shook her a little now i know that you have something to tell me and you must do so you have so many other do as i say child her eyes locked on his and she thought that the entire universe must reside there i want to ayeh i so much want to but you are afraid he said intuiting as was his wont she nodded wordlessly you are not easily frightened bousehk this i already know dahei has frightened you what else she shook her head again only dahei she whispered only that what has happened bousehk i used she took a deep shuddering breath i used it or more accurately it came to me jake and i were in bed we were zilin nodded i understand go on at the end just before the the clouds and the rain i was opened up i was i dont know an empty vessel waiting to be filled up filled up with jakes love i reached out with my qi seeking to embrace his and i found she broke off she was pale her eyes were averted you found what he prompted another shuddering sigh and he could feel the emotion tremoring all through her frame nothing breath like a mist at dawn i found nothing at all it was as if i had fallen down a well and instead of hitting bottom just continued to fall now that it was out the hideous secret was shared bliss searched the jians face what has happened to jake ayeh what is it that i found for a long time there was no sound in the room but the creaking of the fittings as the junk rode at anchor every now and again a quiet plash of water against the hull at last zilin said do you remember the story of the mouse who asked what is it i dont think i ever heard it no the jian seemed surprised well then it is high time that you did he settled down into a more comfortable position it was his friend the rats birthday and there was a present waiting at the edge of the rats burrow it had a delicious smell the mouse thought what is it he wondered carefully he undid the wrapping it is not my present he thought but after all the rat is my best friend how could he possibly mind if i take a little peek at his present it was a piece of cheese one that the mouse was not familiar with it had the most delicious smell wafting even stronger now that the wrapping was undone well he thought the rat is my best friend and i love him like a brother would he not invite me to share in his present were he here of course he would the mouse decided answering his own question he began to nibble on the cheese whose flavor though unknown to him proved to be quite delectable so that without quite knowing how it came about the mouse ate up all his friends present when sometime later that night the rat returned from his nocturnal foraging he found his friend the mouse stiff and cold in front of their burrow the rat grew cautious and sniffed the area when he crept close to the dead mouse his keen nose scented the rat poison familiar to him but totally unknown to the mouse zilin was quiet for some time from abovedecks bliss could hear the low growl of a wallawalla passing close by are you saying that i should not ask what it is i found she said then the jians eyes were already closed she heard his stentorian breathing she had asked a question and he had told her this story why there was danger in the story and death was that true here was jake in danger or was she then an even more important thought came to her zilin had not been surprised when she had told him of the well without a bottom why suddenly that question overshadowed all the others the three japanese rendezvoused near the docks at aberdeen harbor they checked and rechecked to make absolutely certain that their security was intact though none of them believed that they had been followed now they were dressed as tanka sailors and in the softly glowing night it would have been difficult save at very close range to determine their true ethnic origin they were exceptionally well disciplined they knew the way to the proper quay as if they had been born here rather than in the japanese highlands they worked as a team rather than as individuals in japan they were known as a dantai by far the most deadly of raiding groups this was because the dantai developed a group identity we think therefore i am in effect the individuals did not exist separately they thought as one moved as one this was coordination of the highest order a wallawalla was waiting for them at the foot of a narrow concrete stair cut out of the side of the quay it was unattended and ready to go which was unusual in aberdeen harbor one man climbed in to check the outboard engine while a second began to untie the small boat the third stood at the foot of the tiny pier casually smoking a cigarette all the while his highly trained eyes were taking in the immediate environment in calculated sectors when all was ready a low whistle brought him around he threw his butt into the water and jumped in the wallawalla took off the man at the outboard carried no map save the one that he had memorized though he had never before been to hong kong he knew the maze of hakka and tanka waterways and junks that composed this floating city almost as well as did its oldest residents while he steered the two others huddled amidships they withdrew gion s from oilskin bags tucked into their waistbands these were miniaturized machine pistols with the stopping power of a magnum handgun while they were maneuvered through the shadowshrouded waterways between the high hulking junks they pulled the gions completely apart checking all parts for alignment and oil when they were through with theirs the steersman gave them his and they performed the same painstaking checks by the time they were finished they were almost to their destination i feel the storm bousehk his voice or rather what he said made bliss start what storm ayeh i dont understand it has been clear all evening heart hammering against her rib cage with such force that she could feel herself trembling i speak now of another kind of storm he said in a reedy voice a storm far more violent than any that nature can create he stirred can you feel it now bousehk do you feel the evil she could say nothing she only knew that the jian his qi stretched out wide upon the velvet night was in touch with some element of which she was not yet aware my qi tells me that it is time for my life to end bousehk no she cried flinging herself upon him as if in this manner she could protect him from all evil ayeh ayeh she chanted do not say such a terrible thing it is the truth bousehk but how how my qi is still strong my child my second sight has been my shield and my sword for seventy years do you think that it would fail me now but i love you i will take you away it is too late zilin whispered listen the small hairs on the back of blisss neck lifted the soft putputputput of a wallawalla very close and dying away at the same time penetrated the bulkhead of the cabin she grew very still until she felt as if she had ceased to breathe felt the gentlest of bumps who her whisper echoed his oh ayeh she clutched him as tightly as a mother does her child bousehk listen to me his voice was the only sound in the cabin permeating even the darkest shadowed corners that my death comes is meaningless joss one lives one must die it cannot be otherwise she could hear the rustle of clothing as he moved beneath her it is the manner of my death that concerns me i do not wish to die by an unknown assassins bullet he was lying face up now and his thin bony fingers gripped her arms do you understand me bousehk at first she did not her mind was gripped by a cold dread it was as if his physical paralysis had seeped into her brain numbing it i dont bliss his eyes were black burning with a kind of green fire she had never before seen it was as if he were some incarnation of an ancient god vishnu or buddha and she swore to herself later that she had actually seen the soft aura engulfing him pushing back the darkness of the cabin there is no time left you must do as i tell you take the pillow upon which my head rests ah dear buddha a rising terror gripped her now she could not breathe her mind was on fire nevertheless a moment later she found her hands gripping the pillow and she never knew whether it was the ethereal green fire in his eyes or the sounds of the timbers creaking above their heads that caused her to do as he said she felt the presence of others aboard the junkthe guards three oaths had left intrudersand she wondered whether this was because she was now linked so intimately with the jian she had never really understood the expansion of his qi as he had described it to her before this moment now she experienced it intimately with a gasp she felt the three men as they crept across the junk abovedecks she felt the chill of their intent the searing cold of their determination for the first time in her life she experienced the true meaning of evil it was a stench that caught in her throat and made her gag now sweet child it must be now they are too close to hesitate she heard his voice as if from the mists of some unknown void and she knew that he was right she could feel them silently descending the companionway she was weeping uncontrollably joutau ayeh good night she could not bring herself to utter the words goodbye in a moment the cabin exploded in deafening fury as the three japanese assassins emptied their gion s into every corner its a matter of economics plain and simple jin kanzhe was far too agitated to sit still he paced the study of the villa beyond the glass doors he could see the vast tiled veranda but then every room in this splendid house was vast it did not seem like china hereat least china as it had been since this villa was the dwelling place of an emperor the furnishings were precious antiques painstakingly selected from the finest works of the most skilled of the dynastic artisans but the antiques not only encompassed the history of china but of other southeast asian cultures as well there were tibetan prayer wheels patinaed wooden reclining buddhas from thailand blackrubbed bronze sitting buddhas from japan there were a series of exquisitely carved stone apsarases sacred dancers from cambodias richest archaeological treasure trove angkor wat miniature mandalay temples carved of gold and precious gems so intricately that it made jin kanzhe dizzy to look at them what small portion he had seen of the contents of the villa were worth many times more than the totality of the beijing historical museum i dont see how were going to be able to finance this his breath steamed the air what he thought but would not say is your obsession is going to undo us in the end i trust you are quite finished said a voice from out of the shadows or are you merely out of breath for the moment jin kanzhe swung around his expression said more forcefully than any words how serious he was on this subject a withered hand lifted fell like a dying butterfly come and sit down jin tong zhi have some chrysanthemum tea it will restore your calm it wont take care of the money that is needed but all the same he came over and sat beside the shadowed chair on the end of a rattan settee he accepted the tiny porcelain cup drank the tea without tasting it i think the voice out of the shadows said that you must beware of your own obsession jin tong zhi meaning what your tirades are becoming more frequent as well as more vitriolic finances are my concern and they are mine as well jin tong zhi please do not do me the discourtesy of thinking me ill prepared huaishan tong zhi the future is unknowable one cannot prepare for all eventualities even you of course not but the prudent warrior is able to translate the terrain about him into the variables he must consider there was silence for a time the great dog which slept by the shadowed figures side stirred growling in its sleep perhaps dreaming of a kill jin kanzhe stirred as well he did not like dogs especially ones that had been trained to rend flesh on command you leave the moneygathering to me huaishan han said i have many friends many political connections still but even they comrade must someday come to the bottom of their pockets i fear that day has come do you see the extent of your obsession jin tong zhi i told you that money is no problem it flows through my hands like an endless river i no longer concern myself with money the old mans eyes were blazing his breath filling the room with his expanding qi think instead of our lizi our plum who is our trigger how very ironic and fitting that it should be she who will seek out jake maroc and at the proper time the time i shall choosehere the old man began to laughhe will rush to meet her we will dislodge him from his own territory and he will run headlong to meet his own doom huaishan hans head was trembling with emotion i do not have to remind you of our great good joss in discovering her colonel hu will work his magic on her mind he can turn night into day i myself have seen him do it ah my vengeance will be sweet indeed so long in coming now all the sweeter what spoke to him in horrendous incendiary glyphs jin kanzhe wondered what was the source of the eerie light that glowed behind his eyes how much suffering should my revenge engender jin tong zhi you cannot see it but oh how i can suffering enough more than any human should have to bear the atmosphere in the villa seemed charged with the force of huaishan hans hatred and rage jake marocor should i say shi jake he is my ultimate target and arent we training the perfect assassin for him his voice once so fragile seemed to echo through the rooms filled with treasures think of it jin tong zhi his own daughter will hunt him down and kill him jake saw neon chow and three oaths strolling down the quay several hundred feet in front of him and he was about to call out to them when the screaming sound of the machine guns began and even as he began to run he thought gion his heart froze and his soul withered as he flung people from his path the night had exploded into ten thousand incandescent fragments he could not catch his breath fires were lit inside him as well and he thought of the woman who had followed him of how much sooner he would have been here had she not delayed him delayed him and from out of the past lan covered in blood sprawled half in the river calling bahba bahba dream and reality converging with the sudden impact of a granite slab hitting him in the chest jake jake dew neh loh moh jake neon chow running alongside him her fear in the air as he jumped aboard the wallawalla call the police he cried pushing her away as he shoved off gunning the engine slipping through the narrow harbor lanes between the high junks and the small craft gemlike lights winked merrily in the background while the night was filled with cruel explosions the stink of cordite while death groaned out its horrific litany a runic chant as old as time whats happened he thought whats happened intent on the navigation of the craft he wound his tortuous path through the floating city and came up on three oathss junk saw the wallawalla tied up by the side of the junk and he cut the engine drifting in without a sound copper eyes searching the shadows every square inch of the upcoming environment all senses alert the wallawallas touched bumped and jake was already over the side climbing the rope twisting over the side hand over hand his breath sounding in his ears the pounding of his heart overwhelming shadows enshrouded the deck the lights of jumbo were far away their brilliant sparkle too weak to pierce the chill the stink of cordite floating like a miasma bitter and choking soft noises from below as if rats had invaded the kitchen there were two exits from belowdecks and jake picked up a crate setting it atop the closed forward hatch then he crept along the deck heading aft the night was very dark it had begun to drizzle and he shivered as he made his way aft stopped suddenly went as still as stone then crouching he reached out a hand felt the warm sticky wet and knew before his eyes deciphered the black mounded forms in front of him three oathss guards one two three their necks had been sawed almost through with wire jake crept around them stared down into the blackness of the open hatchway dark as the entrance to hell he thought and something caught in his throat oh buddha keep my father safe but it was so still now and he shivered again the tiny rhythmic lapping of the wavelets against the hull of the junk seemed magnified a crashing of the elements against the creation of man the stench of cordite was even stronger here haze rose in spectral languor from belowdecks it was not a time to think clearly to consider options he knew that his father was down there and that invaders armed with gion machine pistols had let loose their fire we have many enemies in many countries who was down there with his father what evil wind had brought them here if zilin was dead then the chinese would say joss and go on with their lives but jake could not though he was halfchinese himself his western half cried out against a world this hideous his wife his daughter his friends and now his father all dead what evil joss was this far from being the zhuan he was the unluckiest man in the world if you cannot be ruthless jake then my ren will have been for naught jake felt as he did when he woke up screaming the dream of lan still clogging his brain and had bliss been beside him at that moment she would not have recognized him seeing instead the terrible mask monstrous with hate rage and fear like the disfigurement of some mythic creature anguish and agony were his companions as he dropped through the hatchway taking the steep companionway in the manner of a nocturnal animal gliding and spidery clinging only here and there as it aided his headlong descent within the bowels of the junk the whiff of death blew straight at him a night wind off the mountains animals stirring after the kill and the shadows erupted into whirlwind motion jake feinted left hurled himself bodily to the right bright lightning and the eruption of thunder wood chips whirring and spinning and he was forced to shield his eyes it was easy to be blinded by a near miss in these close quarters kicking out hearing the grunt and gagging within the hollowness of the awful silence moved back to the left striking out with his fist saw a head snap back brief flash of wide eyes then the jaw coming up and with another smash the cracking as the bone shattered blood upon him hot and sticky turning his hands black in the dimness a grim surgeon doing his work cutting and slashing with frightening precision the gion or its twin erupted close very close and jake took the breaths needed and opening his mouth to its fullest gave out with kiai the warriors bloodcurdling cry meant to confuse and terrify the enemy the effect achieved he plowed on able to pick out the living shadows from the inanimate ones heard gagging and almost slipped on a slick of blood creeping across the deck beneath his feet they had said not a word and this worried him he did not know how many were there only that his enemy numbered more than one he felt the silence of the professional and something more an element with which he was all too familiar dantai could it be no time as they attacked in concertthe wounded one as well impossible on his back after a succession of vicious kites to his rib cage robbed him of all breath he inhaled their breath their sweat the stench of animals on kill a pack dantai the butt of a machine pistol crashed into the side of his skull setting off flashing lights behind his eyes he was effectively blind for the space of several heartbeats and they took swift advantage of their gain working on the same spot on his rib cage forcing the breath back out of him yet again a kick and he groaned inwardly another one of those and his ribs would crack and splinter like his enemys jaw and the internal bleeding would begin the end he lashed out from his prone position and missed and knew discovered what it was that bliss had already discerned he was without bamahk in a flash he knew it was not going to come back the ability to sink into his surroundings to find the pulse of qi energy surrounding him was gone forever he felt like a man who upon waking finds that he has mysteriously lost his sight bamahk was what fo saan had taught him it was how he won at wei qi how he planned his strategies in life it was how he saw in the dark divined the intent of those around him how he prevailed in combat now there was nothing inside him but an open wound a pit blacker than the darkness enveloping him he was like everyone else he felt helpless the butt of the gion found him again and he grunted reaching blindly out with questioning fingers by accident and proximity he found the machine pistol and used the grip in an aikido throw employing the others momentum his own immobile position as the strong fulcrum to bring his enemy close to him inward in an arc at its apex when the enemys panting breath was full in his face brought the edge of his free hand down at the angle that would offset his own lack of leverage but from his prone position he was not able to exert the proper amount of force the vertebrae of his assailants neck did not crack felt the enemy gathering his strength and rolled because otherwise he would be dead in the next instant the butt of the gion descending again and this time smashing his skull one arm was pinned beneath him he struggled to free it but he was right up against the bulkhead and there was no room felt movement above him the intent to kill and he shot his free hand forward extending his fingers together stiff as a blade of steel without conscious thought rammed the weapon of his hand beneath the lower edge of his adversarys sternum through skin and muscle tendon and sinew felt the curve of the heart and squeezed rush of blood and feces as the sphincter let go in death but he had spent too long on his one enemy and the otherswere there two or threewere on him they had scented their compatriots death even if this truly was a dantai feeling the ending of his life a gion went off and jake felt the onrush of another figure kicked out thinking they were too dependent on those things missed and he was punished brutally for his error he thought he felt a rib give way this time and he knew that this was where he was going to die in this narrow black corridor with the stink of cordite and blood and excrement thick as fog he felt the fear rising in him because he was without bamahk and his enemies strategy was opaque to him the moments incremental and separate not part of a growing organic whole that he could use to defeat them two came at him and he had no chance chose one and attacked there while he was vulnerable from the opposite side consciousness was going the flashing behind his eyes becoming irregular interspersed for longer and longer periods of absolute blackness from which he awoke startled and dismayed at his disorientation and like a man going down in icy water for the last time he grasped out in desperation he ceded control conscious thought was forgotten he had even perhaps the wish to die here with his father because there seemed no reason to continue this cursed life instead the unconscious or more accurately that part of the mind which exists between the two and which governs so much intuitive thought rose to save him in this cramped environment the normal atemi or percussions were useless so the primitive mind sought to use the lack of space to the organisms advantage jake lashed out staggering another one of his enemies but there was the thirdjake had worked out their number by nowwho was already attacking this close jake knew instinctively that this was the one with the broken jaw used that the heel of his hand slamming crosswise had enough momentum for that at least and was rewarded with the sound of a heavy grunt not even crying out then part of him storing the fact went immediately for the cricoid cartilage buried behind protecting lines of cartilage in the center of his enemys throat used both thumbs in concert to break through and the body above him was done a soft sigh like air escaping a balloon at a childrens party shaking his groggy head jake rose his senses already questing in the gloom for his last enemy saw the glint of the gion and rushed toward it red rage suffusing him and now the stars exploding behind his eyes his brain dull and working it out slowly as he pitched toward the gion clutched in the stiffening grasp of a dead man bliss heard the chatter of the gion once twice the silence then so long and unnatural that she was tempted to emerge from her hiding place within the cavern of the great horizontal clothes locker but that would have been a mistake she knew and she had discipline patience she thought patience she jumped when she heard the third outburst from the machine pistol she heard nothing after that save the lapping of the water slowly carefully she crawled out and froze her eyes staring hard into the darkness belowdecks began to discern movement she could see from the formation that it was one figure but she could not discern much more the angle was acute enough so that even the ability to discern height was lost to her jake she said to herself where are you the figure was creeping along the corridor a dark shadow coalescing out of the eerie twilight belowdecks somewhere a lamp shone swinging crazily alternately throwing shadow and light the figure disappeared then abruptly reappeared disconcertingly near her the head raised and her eyes locked on its own and she screamed he was upon her in a blur of motion the gion came up a block of metal and struck her across the chest knocking her backward her foot caught on a rope slickened by the drizzle and she fell heavily on her hip she felt his weight on her and she tried to twist away striking with an atemi but the angle was all wrong and he brushed her weak blow aside without difficulty she was vulnerable to a body strike and he came in at an oblique angle confusing her pain filled her side and he increased the pressure of his pin because in that position she could get no momentum behind her percussives her eyes opened wide in fear they were nearer the crazily swinging light and she could see her target she whipped her head toward him biting down at the last instant with all her strength her teeth broke through the skin of his neck she ground down severing muscle and tendon and saw his head snap back in reflexive motion his hand let go of the gion to scrabble at her trying to pull her away but this was her only hope and she was not to be deterred he shook and she shook with him a dog with a sizable bone refusing to let go of her bloody grip she tasted his blood salty and sweet at the same time and fought not to choke on the hot flow his thumb found her throat and he began to press it was quick an improvisation and he wasnt able to find the right grip she growled deep in her throat and twisted his thumb slipping away but not before she had to stop herself from gagging his thumb was back and now he had thought it out the grip beginning and once he had it she would be done for because he would cut off her air supply unless she let go of him she felt the depression of his thumb the pressure beginning to build and she was struggling for air working her legs into the right position and bringing her leg up in a quick powerful motion she jammed her kneecap into the juncture of his thighs heard him grunt their eyes were very close entwined in as intimate an embrace as was possible without making love his hand had come away from her throat the strength going out of him he coughed and bliss bit down again and she thought i have a chance now he struck her just beneath her left breast and she felt her heart lurch a wave of dizziness swept over her and she thought i underestimated him nausea overcame her so that she was obliged to open her jaws he hit her again in the same spot blisss mouth went slack she groaned her gorge rose into her throat and she was gagging he staggered to his knees one hand grabbing at the gaping wound her teeth had made in his neck his shirt was hanging away from his shoulder his lips were pulled back in a snarl he hit her again bliss vomited he stood up and kicked her grunting with the effort and the pain in his arm he kicked her again and again in a frenzy now raging at himself for having been stopped so surely by a woman he slipped in the wetness and in one last desperate effort bliss reached out grabbing hold of his wounded arm he cut off a strangled scream and using his good arm chopped down at her bliss grunted but held blindly on she was covered in blood and slime he chopped down again this time more viciously and her grip slipped her fist ripping down the sleeve of his shirt exposing his bare flesh from shoulder to wrist for a moment her eyes opened wide at what she saw there then he had regained his feet and rocking there for a moment he kicked her again with all his remaining strength there was nothing left for her to hold on to in the utter darkness that suddenly engulfed her her unconscious mind thought i am the world bliss connected with the jian in the act of committing merciful murderif such a thing truly existed and was recognized by buddha had become a part of the jians expanding qi there was a time when their hot breaths were linked on either side of the pillow when their essences had mingled through the eiderdown terrified bliss had become aware of a stirring below her she had opened her eyes only to see his frail form still as a statue beneath her perhaps he was already dead she had surmised that it would not take much to take life from him now but when she closed her eyes again she felt the stirring and could not tell whether it was coming from around her or within her the theater of her mind was filled with images as if she were dreaming or her lungs were filled with the tears of the poppy she was stretched across the bosom of the south china sea it was night the sky full of rain and wind but still she could see the dolphins streaking through the inky blackness of the ocean following the bubbly luminous wake of the great whale herd they dove and leaped about calling to each other in bursts of odd high piping which contrasted with the whales low ululating dialogues drawn out like taffy an underwater symphony that brought tears to her eyes she was weeping for all the life around her it was as if she had been deaf and blind all her life until this revelatory moment her qi was everywhere at once and all that it touched it embraced with the fierceness that only true love can engender where did such pure feelings stem from she wondered she had never before experienced such emotions then she became aware that it was not her qi at all but anothers qi upon which she rode and knowing that she understood whose qi it was it was unmistakable and she was stunned that she had ever assumed it was her own but you are dead she thought you bade me kill you in this humane fashion so that your qi would not be defiled by an assassins bullets does this mean that i have not succeeded but she knew the answer deep down in her soul the jian was dead then what was happening to her she turned distracted by the ineffable beauty of the musical recital below the waves of the south china sea into the depths she dived on the wings of this powerful qi until she was surrounded again by the sleek creatures creations too of almighty buddha jake awoke spitting blood he choked briefly even as full conscious cerebration rose to the fore he gained a kneeling position and leaned against the bulkhead pain lanced through him firing into his nerve endings making coordination and concrete thought difficult the third man jake remembered his mistake lunging at the dead man because he had seen the gion the third man had come at him from behind how helpless i am without bamahk he thought he reached out and the motion almost made him scream my ribs he thought and he felt around the area wincing with the pain but it did not seem that there was anything broken picked up the gion he had to unwrap the corpses fingers one by one using the bulkhead as a brace he rose to his feet stepping gingerly over the corpse he moved down the corridor toward his fathers cabin felt the night wind blowing even before he reached the open doorway stuck his head in and thought oh buddha no the bulkheads ceiling deck were riddled with holes cracks loose shards swinging in the wind the place was still thick with cordite he went in feeling nothing at all as if his legs were not his own pulled the trigger of the gion and the third man pitched forward revealing the fragments of sheets pillows table legs and what lay beyond the feet were crossed at the ankles one arm flung up across the face either by the momentum of the fall or the force of the fusillade of bullets jake threw the gion aside and ran to take his father into his arms the jian was so light so light that he might have been composed of air the stained pillow by his side might have weighed more to find him after so many years only to have him taken away now like this how cruel and uncaring was life joss what was joss after all but a concept how could one accept such a monstrous fate it would be inhuman to do so how i hate this life his mind echoed with his cry there might have been danger all around him but he no longer cared all that existed at this moment was loss a love that had sprung up inside him greater than any he had ever known and like the desecration of some precious flower it had been cut down even as it had begun to bloom he was overcome by grief and a terror he found insupportable for all his life he had been without the trust protection and solace only a father can bring the advent of his real father into his life then had been a psychic relief of enormous proportions the presence of zilin had reached down stirring jakes very essence and now bliss his head jerked up and his heart beat faster hadnt she been here too had she been here during the attack jake remembered that bliss had been easing his fathers pain tenderly he set aside the shell of his father and limping a little in pain went down the corridor at the foot of the forward companionway he paused lifting his head he listened but could hear nothing but the creaking of the junk he began to retrace his steps then looking over his shoulder he saw the crumpled shapes went back down realized that he should have been aware of them long before bamahk would have revealed their presence to him he saw her and knelt down bliss he said lying on her side something running along the deck black in the darkness blood bliss he turned her to him cradling her in his arms brushing dark hair plastered by blood away from her pale face he said bliss he kissed her dry lips and as if he were in the middle of a childrens story her eyes fluttered open jake her voice was barely recognizable and he thought thank buddha shes alive dont talk bliss youre all right fingertips probing over her in expert fashion how bad was it keep still now as she struggled to speak again her lips moving spasmodically her tongue flicking out hush he said jake something in her eyes now that he knew he could not deny and he nodded jake he saw that her eyes were filled with tears he was yakuza at first he thought he had misunderstood her what he was what yakuza jake yakuza impossible bliss you must have been mistaken well talk about this the tattoos he went very still at her words tattoos of a phoenix and a spider irezumithe traditional japanese tattoos worn only by the clans of the japanese underworld he was yakuza she whispered bliss what did he but her eyes were closing her breathing was deepening lengthening and jake thought i must get her to a hospital he took her up the companionway and cradling her in his lap reached up throwing the crate off the closed hatch cover gained the deck poking his head up cautiously it was raining harder now and he could smell the sea fresh and clear sharp with phosphorus and salt tang he lifted his head father i need you why have you gone when i need you so but there was no answer everything had been set in motion and now the die had been cast truly there was no turning back and what if he had been wrong if he had misjudged his enemies strategies what then who would save him who could possibly protect the yuhnhyun jake the zhuan at this moment he felt as if he could not safeguard the life of an insect let alone the fiftyyear creation that would eventually remake the face of asia the sea lapped at the hull of the junk as it always had the stars hidden behind the rain clouds continued to wink down cold enigmatic signals the universe continued uncaring used to human suffering jake shivered he was cold sitting in the darkness the rain beat against him drumming along the deck and though he was aboard his uncles junk in aberdeen harbor he knew that he was on that legendary mountainside that zilin had spoken of father oh father there had been so little time he was weeping now his tears mingling with the chill rain he bent over blisss insensate form rocking her but also rocking himself shan he thought it rose black and forbidding in the symbolic geography of his mind the mountain summer winter chunking yenan peking there was a time when all things were possible like a fable come to lifean eerily twisted far east arthurian mythosthere was an era in china when great dragons roamed the mountainsides when thunder cracked the sky when rivers ran red with blood it was a time for heroes and villains and it was the time when zilin returned to lifeand also where the seeds of his death were sown and all because of a girl on the face of it it seems impossible and yet though it occurred in modern times this was a period in which not only heroes but an ancient form of magic manifested itselfperhaps at the behest of the celestial guardians of china nowadays chongqing sitting at the confluence of the yangtze and jialing rivers is a modern bustling town of wide streets indifferent architecture the rocky promontory on which it was built angling steeply into the waters filled with sampans and producebearing junks in those days of dragons and lightning when the town was still known as chungking it was built on stilts and composed of tiny creamcolored houses with slategray tiled roofs bowedbacked women in straw hats carried faggots of wood or open baskets filled with raw tea up narrow lanes then as now the summers in chungking were stifling and people not used to such weather sought the sanctuary of the lower reaches of the shadeshrouded jinyun shanthe red silk mountain on a day late in august mao zedong and his circle were settled at number zengjiayan they had made the journeymaos first by planeto meet with generalissimo chiang kaishek and the ambassador from president roosevelt major general patrick j hurley they were meeting to hammer out a compromise between the two chinese factions roosevelt had been outspoken against a resumption of the civil war that had been put on hold only by the larger global struggle but privately roosevelt feared mao and the ideology he espoused mao too was inclined toward a compromise with chiang he was well aware of how war had depleted china of its natural resources his own fear was for the future of his country he knew that china desperately needed to industrialize if it was to compete in the postwar international arena to do this he knew china would require foreign capital but the wily chiang was already ahead of mao on this score only days before he had signed the sinosoviet treaty of friendship and alliance in addition playing upon the welldiagnosed american phobia against communism chiang had made alliances with the united states as well in zilins mind at least chiang had made a grave error his feet straddle two divergent paths zilin had told mao on the flight south and this could prove disastrous for china should he continue to represent the country in a coalition such as the one i have in mind mao said he could at least be controlled i seriously doubt that mao tong zhi he who controls the army chiang has often said rules the nation as long as he believes that he will be intractable american military advisers have been at chiangs elbow whispering their expertise into his ear at the other elbow stand stalin and molotov the russians are already sweeping through manchuria they destroy our common foe the japanese yes but do they not also have another more sinister reason for invading manchuria they covet that territory mao tong zhi mao had been silent for a long time ever since the incident in the mountains of yunnan two years ago when zilins military strategy had defeated the arm of the nationalist army chiang had sent to destroy the then rebel leader and his upstart peasant army mao had kept his eye on zilin a most remarkable man it was mao who gave the orders thus it became maos strategy the victory his and because of it maos renown had spread through the southern provinces like wildfire even mao could not say how many men had been recruited into the army because of that one victory he only knew that in his forces were hovering around the eightythousand mark now the regular army numbered almost one million and the militia was over double that figure zilin had never asked to be known as the decisionmaker he had never even asked for recompense of any sort in fact when mao wanted to elevate him in ministerial rank zilin had refused i thank you mao tong zhi zilin had said but the humility of a lowly station is useful it serves to remind me of our place in the world he bowed his head if on occasion you and i speak and the product of our thoughts is constructive then that is sufficient he smiled and mao was to get one of his few glimpses into the workings of the inner man besides i think you will agree that you have enough public advisers as it is i believe that i can be more useful to you and to the cause if i remain hidden in the shadows unknown and unnamed mao sighed now gazing down at the landscape of his beloved china we are in an untenable position he said to zilin we need outside help the soviets fear us as you know both stalin and molotov have called us margarine communists because i have not strictly followed moscows directives besides they argue a true communist revolution comes about through the proletariat not the peasants he grunted our only hope is america they are already here they love to stick their noses into the internal affairs of other countries i believe that our postwar industrialization should come about through free enterprise theyll like that they have money far more than the soviets if we maneuver them properly i think we can get our capital from them toward that end i want you to spend time with this ambassadors aide of theirs ross davies he was a major once and from what i hear a good one speak to him of sun tzu maybe though he is a foreign devil he will recognize a kindred spirit through the art of war i understand ambassador hurley tells him everything i want to know what president roosevelt is thinking i want to know whether he will back us zilin held out no such hope for american aid he knew that the americans were very cleverly using chiang as their catspaw in china simply because they could control him they had no such illusions about mao and what zilin said with this in mind will he do if a fire starts in china let us set our minds mao said that there will be no fire but even if mao had not had a specific mission for zilin to accomplish he would not have wanted him at the bargaining table when he met with chiang zilins first wife mai had been assistant to sun zhongshandr sun yatsen when in generalissimo chiang broke with suns guomindang his strongarm men had returned to shanghai then the guomindangs main base and had destroyed them all chiangs men had come for mai in the night and had taken her away fearing for her safety zilin and hu hanmin had run after her and confronting her abductors zilin had shot them down but not before mai herself had been killed perhaps after all this time chiang had forgotten the incident and the manhunt that had ensued mao did not know but he was certain that he could not take the chance of the two coming face to face he had in fact debated whether to take zilin along with him at all but in the end his need for the younger man outweighed the possible danger zilins first encounter with ross davies occurred early one morning zilin was in the midst of tai chi chuan the air was very still although the sun had not yet crept above the rooftops the air was already heavy with the days moisture below the river shone bluewhite already sampans plied its currents somewhere down the narrow lane a cock crowed davies had awoken in a cold sweat sitting up in bed he had tried to get oxygen into his lungs he looked around it was dawn but it was not cool he had been in china for some time but he had been unable to grow accustomed to the climate summer was the worst for him he sweated through his clothes even at night he rose and dressing hurriedly went outdoors his tiny room seemed to be closing in on him wiping the sweat from his face he heard the cock crowing and in a moment he became aware of zilin at his exercises davies had taken the book on roman war tactics with him intending to calm himself by reading beneath the shade of a tree now he stood in the dappled sunlight watching zilin at his morning rituals it could not have been the first time that davies had seen tai chi demonstrated but it was certainly the first time that he had seen it performed with such liquid weightless grace this man was the only one of maos retinue on whom hurley had not been able to get a military dossier in fact almost nothing was known about the man even his function within the communist hierarchy and his relationship to mao were unclear in the relative cool of the shade davies was sweating he was a large man with an athletes body that had not run to middleage fat as many of his contemporaries had simply because davies worked at it he did fortyfive minutes of strenuous calisthenics twice daily except during the summer in china when he found it too hot to do much of anything as he watched zilin he marveled it was as if he had never seen the slow ritualized movements before the man had no trouble breathing though he was in direct sunlight davies could discern not a bead of sweat anywhere on his exposed flesh at length zilin was done he held the last position for what seemed to davies an eternity in the courtyard a breeze caught an eddy of dust lifting it in a tiny devil at zilins feet it was the only movement in the vicinity a dog barked and zilin came out of what might have been a trance he saw davies standing on the doorstep book in hand and smiled good morning zilin said davies nodded somewhat embarrassed he wondered whether he had transgressed twoandahalf years in china and he was still unsure about customs i was struck by your early morning exercises i hope you dont mind not at all zilin came across the courtyard to where davies stood i dont mind company he smiled as he had learned the foreign devil did it put them at ease somehow like animal signals zilin had read an account of the habits of the mountain gorillas of africa one approached them with eyes downcast and a neutral expression to show that no aggressive intent was meant baring ones teeth on the other hand would surely bring instant attack faan gwai loh zilin thought foreign devilthey were much like gorillas powerful and dangerous and primitive and in dealing with them one had to make certain of their motivation if one were to make use of them you speak english very well davies said unaware of the condescension in his tone it is he who thinks of me as the monkey zilin thought ah well the civilized man must put up with all manner of boorishness in order to gain his ends with barbarian devils i learned many years ago in shanghai zilin said as if nothing were amiss a friend from virginia was good enough to be my patient teacher a white lie but an excusable one under the circumstances daviess eyes lit up im from virginia he said which zilin knew very well my family has a farm outside roanoke my father raises horses race horses what is your friends name sawyer zilin said barton sawyer his family too were farmers though i dont believe they had anything to do with horses i dont know the name davies said obviously disappointed but virginias a big state and i havent been home in some time since i was a young boy actually zilin watching the expression softening daviess features thought well at least some things remain universal you must miss virginia as much as i miss suzhou davies gave a rueful smile and his face turned boyish he had a wide mobile mouth clear blue eyes and the kind of straight patrician nose unheard of in asia his shock of curly reddishblond hair covered the back of his neck in thoroughly unmilitary style i suppose i do he took out a chased silver case plucked out a cigarette he offered one to zilin who politely refused davies struck a match i was once quite a fine equestrianhorseback rider zilin suppressed the urge to grunt and hoot like an ape since he believes that i have a limited english vocabulary he thought i will not disabuse him of the notion i may be able to make use of his ignorance in the future horses are something of an oddity in china zilin said i dont suppose theres been much chance to ride davies laughed blew out smoke not a one well perhaps theres a farm near here where we can find you he bit back the word equisa noble steed to ride really davies came down off the steps relinquishing his added height advantage that would be most welcome quite fantastic really he thought a moment tapping ash off his cigarette look here shi tong zhi how would you like to learn how to ride not on your life zilin thought with an inward shudder he imagined himself atop the gigantic creature that would be most interesting mr davies i would like that daviess blue eyes got shrewdor zilin thought in his case as close as they could come to shrewd look here would you consider teaching me tai chi chuan in exchange for equestrian lessons a decade of plagues on your horses zilin thought a most splendid idea mr davies i would be most pleased to assist you on such a worthy journey shall we say tomorrow at five thirty davies swallowed in the morning zilin gave a little bow you learn quickly sir davies thrust out his huge hand youve got a deal grinning just like a gorilla in fact ross davies proved an exceptionally quick study while there was nothing fast about tai chi the american was swift to pick up on the mental aspects of the discipline this surprised zilin somewhat since it had been his experience that most foreign devils failed completely to understand the philosophic nature of tai chi relegating it to the province of old men and those too infirm to apply themselves to a real discipline involving speed strength and stamina the fact was that tai chi required great strength and stamina since to perform exercises slowly took far more control and agility than to run through positions by rote as for speed one had to have it in order to keep it in check as one did in tai chi besides the mind was at work here which made it a far cry from army calisthenics davies brought up this point to zilin at the beginning of their second week of morning meetings i start to do my jumping jacks he said and in this weather im overheated within a minute or two with tai chi we can work at it for over an hour and im still comfortable yet my body feels as if it has gotten as complete a workout as if id done my full complement of calisthenics i dont know much about what you call calisthenics zilin said but i do know that the body and the mind must be made one exercising the one without the other makes little sense they were sitting on a bench in the courtyard sipping tea i sleep better since ive started tai chi i smoke less davies said and here lookhe drank back his teai can put away hot tea in the summertime and not break out in a sweat what do you make of that shi tong zhi zilin laughed that youre becoming chinese he had made inquiries and had found them a farm it was up near the slopes of jinyun shan the red silk mountain where they harvested the areas fine jinyun tea zilin supposed that was why the horse hadnt been killed and eaten here because of the tonnage of the harvest he was more valuable to the peasant family alive indeed he was an excellent specimen davies assured zilin on their first visit he ate as well if not better than the family itself all the young menthere were five brotherswere off at war leaving the father who was close to zilins age the mother and three daughters yes indeed that horse was important their lone means of survival through the bleak years of the war up here on the fertile slopes of the shan where multitudinous subtropical plants grew in riotous profusion there were no mean seasons the carefully cultivated tea grew strong and full and in china there were always empty teacups to fill on their first visit zilin brought presents of fish and egg noodles staples to a faan gwai loh such as davies but manna from heaven for the pu family why dont you just give them some money davies said prompting zilin to think that no matter how tempting it is unproductive to believe that apes will ever be able to think to daviess way of thinking there was an awful lot of bowing and palaver considering these people were just a bunch of peasants but he did what zilin bade of him these people may be peasants he rationalized while on his knees bowing but they have a horse this is some animal he said sometime later in the ramshackle structure that served as barn he ran the flat of his hand across the animals fetlock feeling the long ropy muscles ripple beneath his palm im amazed they take such good care of him did you ever try to take a half ton of tea leaves down a mountainside on your back mr davies davies continuing his assessment of the stallion said i see what you mean accordingly we must be extremely careful with this animal zilin made sure that he stood well away from the monster he had no desire to be kicked in the head by this unthinking creature without him the pus would most assuredly starve or work themselves to death first no problem davies said and with a startlingly swift motion he vaulted onto the stallions back there was a soft whinnying and a certain amount of nervous stamping which had davies been more observant he would have seen panicked the other man zilin clung to a beam as if it were a spar off a broken ship clutched in a storm davies was bent over the stallions arched neck his hands gentled the creature while he spoke directly into its ear in a soft singsong whisper in a moment the horse was still save for the odd reflexive shiver running down one leg or another davies urged it forward by a method unclear to zilin he followed davies and the horse cautiously out it was near midday the time when the family traditionally rested from its labors and the intense heat it was no accident that zilin had picked this time to take davies here he never would have thought to interrupt the familys daily routine with such an idiotic request as to borrow their precious animal for sport the girls had come out of the house to watch the hideously tall faan gwai loh they giggled and stared and one of them asked zilin why if the barbarians hair was on fire he didnt burn up zilin watched in fascination as davies bent forward and the horse leapt ahead galloping along the steepening slopes racing in and out of the singing trees birds called scattering away from the pairs progress zilin saw the white tail of a rabbit bounding out of their way in a terrified zigzag he heard an odd sound the pu girls heard it too for they had fallen silent and then zilin knew buddha protect me he thought the barbarian is laughing for a long time after that ross daviess cries of sheer delight echoed down the slopes of jinyun shan where no such sound had ever been heard before in time davies returned he came back at a slower pace which he informed zilin later was important since the animal needed to walk off the sweat of his galloping pace davies redcheeked and grinning from ear to ear swung off the stallion and said now its your turn zilins bowels turned to water what davies cocked his head you dont think ive forgotten do you shi tong zhi if you taught me tai chi i promised to teach you how to ride is this my reward for living an honorable life zilin thought it is getting rather late he said perhaps another day nonsense davies patted the horses back its easy here youre not as tall as i am so ill give you a hand up he laced his fingers tightly together and bent over step right into there he said come on you wont believe how much fun it can be i dont know mr davies the prospect seemed somehow more appealing back at chungking i understand davies said his emotions so transparent zilin could almost see the light bulb going on over his head he swung back up on the stallions back and leaned over before zilin knew what was happening he felt himself being pulled up behind the american just put your arms around my waist shi tong zhi davies said and dug his boot heels into the horses flanks oh buddha this will never work zilin thought such physical contact in public was for himas it was for all chinesesomething one did not even contemplate but as they lurched forward he was almost thrown off sliding backward along the creatures sweatslick back and he reached desperately out seeing how far below him the ground was terrified of falling he wrapped his arms tightly around the barbarian closing his eyes and praying that none of his ancestors were awake and watching this humiliation he felt the rushing of the wind in his face and hair he heard the thrumming of the horses hooves felt the complex coordination of muscle bone and tendon as the great creature carried him along on its back he opened his eyes and almost passed out as the first wave of vertigo swept over him the world rushed by in a blur of brown and green and blue the sense of rapid movement without a vehicles intervening walls and floorboards turned zilins stomach upside down as a child suffering with a high fever and uncontrollable shakes he had vomited up the warm fish soup his mother had fed him he had been old enough and aware enough through the gauzy layers of his illness to feel the shame at wasting the food that other members of the family had foregone for him now as he felt the nauseating contractions in his lower belly he became terrified that he would do again as an adult what he had promised himself as a child he would never do a second time his loss of face would be incalculable and to a barbarian it was unthinkable so he closed his eyes and prayed to buddha to calm his tumbling innards enough to keep his gorge down toward this end as well he began to exert the power of his inner discipline he concentrated on his inner core seeking the place where his qi resided zilin was not yet as well acquainted with the extraordinary power of his qi as he would be in the coming decades it was still an essentially raw and primitive source over which he exerted only sporadic and limited control now he made his connection to a place known as shuijing ban de xiaolu the crystal path it was a place midway between the conscious and the unconscious mind a place where contemplation couldwith experience and practicebe transformed into action deed positive strategy it was a shining field with a vantage point on the world akin to no other from its heart one could discern the strategy of ones foes formulate ones own strategy by assessing the whole rather than a series of disassociated pieces within the aura of shuijing ban de xiaolu everything was seen to fit into everything else the connections like glimmering skeins illuminated by an innerdirected light it was qi intrinsic energy but it was something more as well without quite knowing how zilin reached out and gained the crystal path now he was no longer afraid rather he was connected with the powerful beast beneath him he could see it for what it was a mighty engine he felt with all of his senses the superb coordination of this animal and its power became his zilins eyes opened and his heart expanded to the elation such a swift passage through the world could bring high atop the galloping stallion zilin embraced the streaming foliage all about him he flew with the plovers and skylarks as they raced just above the treetops below fleecy scudding clouds he bounded through forest pathways an animal on the move he was one with the universe much later they rested in a glade beside a sparkling stream where water spiders skidded and frogs watched from the indolent shade of overhanging ferns the buzzing of the insects was thick the sound somehow applying itself to the honeyed sunlight lending it a heavy aqueous quality at their backs giant jinyun shan the red silk mountain rose on long steeply sloping ridges hairy with growth the peculiar scent of the tea plants young green shoots not yet ready for the harvest laced the air the horse was gone back at its mundane but crucial labor for the pu family still they smelled its essence on them a rich musk that wafted like perfume from a row of jasmine ross davies pulled out his silver case lit a cigarette he squinted as he stared out into the deep golden light that lay along the slopes like a carpet one of these days he said i must really give these up he smoked leisurely truly enjoying it zilin knew that he never would quit how is it davies said that you never ask questions i ask questions all the time thats what i was taught to do this cigarette case was a present from my father a kind of graduation present he was the first person who taught me to ask questions how do you learn anything if you dont ask questions perhaps zilin said gently there are other ways to learn he watched an ant make its laborious way toward them i do so by observation thats what i dont understand in china ive done my share of looking but im none the wiser for it there are still so many things i cant fathom that may be because you look but you do not observe the two are hardly the same davies sat up how dyou mean zilin pointed take this ant for example what do you see davies shrugged watching as the ant approached the line of his outstretched legs it began to climb his trouser and he brushed it off all i see is an annoying insect now you must observe him mr davies watch him with your heart instead of with your eyes i havent the vaguest idea what you mean by that if we were back in our courtyard at number fifty zengjiayan beginning our tai chi you would not say that mental discipline is one thing excuse me for interrupting mr davies zilin said but mental discipline is not merely for certain times in ones life one does not turn it on and off like running water mental discipline must be employed at every moment if one is to take advantage of life but what does that have to do with an ant you see how it comes back from the tremendous blow you have dealt it davies nodded and zilin continued now it approaches the spot where it was defeated before what does it do it climbs yes mr davies and without hesitation to the ant you are shan the mountain imagine yourself climbing jinyun shan mr davies imagine further that you get to a certain spot and a storm of furious proportions throws you back down the mountainside what will you do will you retreat or advance im a man not an insect shi tong zhi davies said i possess the ability to reason this creature merely knows that it must go forward even if that means being killed by some unknown force here he reached out and taking the ant between his thumb and forefinger crushed it into dust ah mr davies zilin shook his head tell me how you can have so much love and compassion for the stallion you just rode and yet have none for the ant you have destroyed how can an ant be useful to me davies said i see that is your criterion for life and death zilin stared at the american tell me then mr davies would you kill me if you found that i was not going to be useful to you dont be ridiculous zilin rose it is not i who has been ridiculous mr davies he began to walk off davies jumped up came after him i have offended you shi tong zhi he said please excuse me though i confess i have no idea what i have done that i believe is the heart of the matter zilin stopped and contemplated the other what is of concern to me is whether or not you can be made to learn davies bridled visibly like an animal or to be blunt a barbarian quite correct mr davies davies blinked his large blue eyes i suppose i should be offended dont be most of my brethren believe that the faan gwai loh are without the ability to learn that they can never become civilized i see no mr davies i regret to say that you do not zilin sighed you speak without sufficient thought you see without observing in short you go through life as if the world were your own private playground taking this and that at will at your own pleasure as if there were no other consequences involved you are here but this is not your land you are an alien and you are unwanted you are feared hated at times barely tolerated i should not have to remind you of this it is humiliating for both of us daviess boyish cheeks were flaming red and there was a look of pain and hurt in his eyes damn you he said he was shaking with rage you certainly are a bastard zilin said nothing his ears took in the sounds of the birds twittering insects humming the wind ruffling the treetops these were sweet sounds they were the sounds of life in time he said i meant what i said before i think you can learn i think mr davies that you possess the ability to make your time in china constructive this is i believe exceptionally rare in a westerner and i would give it the maximum amount of thought were i you but youre not me shi daviess voice was strained with anger he took out a sidearm from a hidden pocket it was not particularly large but zilin judged that its discharge would be lethal just the same you could never know what its like to be me to be caucasian youve got yellow skin and slanted eyes and you talk a bunch of nonsensedangerous nonsense if you go by whats said by some mighty powerful people back home he cocked the hammer of the gun i could kill you now just as easily as i killed that ant how do you like that for power zilin shook his head what you present to me here is not power mr davies it is force the two are often confused and that is most often when lives are lost stupid talk is that so if you kill me mr davies you are defeated why because you have lost me on the contrary shi i will have killed you taken your life i will have exerted my power over you in the ultimate fashion no you will have done nothing more than you accomplished with the ant a uselessand far worse a careless act you will exert a tangible power over me if you protect me keep me alive and become my friend then you will have recruited me to your cause or at the very least obtained an ally in times of trial then you will have acted with forethought and courage so your strategy will be created for a long time the two stood facing one another between them the gleaming barrel of the pistol the hammer cocked as ready as an adder to strike an ethereal stillness had come between them for years afterward ross davies would swear that he felt a tangible presence spring up in that glade on the lush slope of jinyun shan he had he would tell his drinking mates been choked by rage and humiliation he could admit to himself only much later that zilins words had struck him to the very core of his being at the time however he only knew that he had been made to feel small and insignificant all the anger he had been bottling up at his inability to puncture the tensile fabric of this strange and fascinating country had welled up exploding in the face of zilins admonition it was most odd davies would think in years to come just how close he had been to pulling the trigger an army man he knew well the draw of the killing urge and he felt it now as strongly as if a fire had been lit along the mountainside the smoke he scented was the smell of his own ego being singed it was at this precise instant that the peculiar stillness crept over him it was as if he felt the heartbeat of the earth upon which he stood rising up through him entering his body by what means he knew not suffusing his bloodstream he thought of tai chi of the rivers of silver thought that like strings from a master puppeteers fingers lifted leg and arm turned torso and neck locking him into the rhythms of the rising day in a moment he blinked he stared down at the weapon in his hand and abruptly aghast at its portent dropped it into the thick grass what happened it was night darkness crept along the slopes of jinyun shan as hours before sunlight had slid away before the blue of the lengthening shadows one of the pu girls the one who had asked about the fire in the faan gwai softs hair had brought them food a sharing of the gifts zilin had given the family and which they could not now refuse they had eaten in silence concentrating on the workings of their mouths and the tastes of the food it was only after they had put aside their bowls and chopsticks that davies had spoken there are some questions zilin said quietly that require no answers but you must learn to accept mysteries mr davies often enough life does not enjoy giving up answers to its enigmas he looked up through the inky blackness of the leaves the stars glittered in bluewhite splendor it had been some time he realized since he had seen such a sight for far too long the starshine had been blurred and dimmed by the vapors of war i will tell you a secret mr davies it is a mystery how i enjoyed myself so much this afternoon did you really like riding i did indeed the cicadas clatter was magnified by the vast wall of the mountainside they think youre the devil incarnate you know daviess voice seemed very close in the night as if he were whispering in zilins ear in the bibles book of revelations it speaks of the beast according to allan dulles you are the beast you and mao and all the rest of the communists is mr dulles the only one who thinks so good god no a great many wealthy and influential people agree with him henry luce bill donovan henry ford the lot of them davies turned his head do those names mean anything to you i believe they do yes zilin pondered whether to ask the question he felt the thunder of the horse still beneath him his connection to it his closeness to ross davies and of course he thought of the stillness that had overcome both of them in the afternoon and does president roosevelt agree with these wealthy and influential people to be honest i dont think it matters a good goddamn what mr roosevelt thinks zilin thought about this it had been his opinion that the american president hated and feared mao the president runs the country does he not yees davies said but only in some senses besides there being checks and balances built into our constitutional system of government the president in a very real sense is subject to the pressures brought to bear on him davies could not see zilin nod in the darkness and of course the universal law is that the wealthier one is the more pressure one is able to exert ross davies stirred beside zilin i think yes youve caught the nature of the situation at their next meeting on the slope of jinyun shan davies was not alone zilin recognized an officer from chiangs hierarchy he said nothing waiting to see what was on the americans mind shi tong zhi davies finally said beginning the introductions this is huaishan han a lieutenant colonel in the nationalist army and a confidant of generalissimo chiang zilin said i have heard of you he gave a stiff little bow which was returned in much the same manner well davies said rubbing his hands together shall we have lunch i had our cook prepare something his clear blue eyes darted from one man to the other as if waiting for the first bright spark to ignite he set down a large wicker basket beneath the shade of a tree the day was unusually stifling the afternoon air somnolent and without breeze weighing them all down davies busied himself pulling out sandwiches salads condiments from god alone knew where and a bottle of white wine are either of you hungry he asked hopefully i dont want all this food to go to waste huaishan han eyed the alien food he was whip thin with the kind of lower jaw one found among the manchus and the peoples high up near the northern frontier his ears were small fitting close to his head through the bristle of his coarse hair could be seen the beginnings of the inkblot outline of a purple birthmark crawling along his scalp perhaps because of the dominance of his jawline his nose and eyes seemed crowded into the upper portion of his face davies looking around after spreading out the repast said doesnt any of this appeal to you sandwiches zilin said there is no tea huaishan han said clouds obscured the sun for a time the glade seemed to lose dimension some of its quietude rolling away down the slope in the near distance the men could see mr pu with his stallion loading him up as his daughters handed over bushel after bushel of harvested tea plants wont the wine do davies popped the cork extracted crystal goblets from the recesses of the wicker basket i dont mind huaishan han said settling himself next to the american but i doubt whether our comrade here will be similarly inclined he turned his head as davies handed him the glass and taking a sip lifted the sparkling crystal in a mock toast you neednt bother with this wine comrade youll only choke on such elitist liquor he nodded his head and the sprawling birthmark appeared in full theres a small brook we passed on the way up the liquid of the earth is more fitting for a communist to drink zilin sat down on the other side of davies he wondered why the american had brought a member of chiangs staff along very quickly he determined that there was nothing for him to do but observe attitude was all the mens attitudes would reveal the answers to the puzzle davies set a glass of wine before zilin having the good grace not to attempt to hand it to him huaishan han leaned forward liquor was glistening on his thin lips the wine is quite fine comrade he said to zilin his voice slightly mocking why not try it after all it too has its origins in the earth he smiled small even teeth showing like bits of patinaed ivory no matter that it is the drink of choice for capitalist captains of industry he grunted but pardon me i forgot that industry is a word you communists know precious little about i shudder to think what this country would come to if mao gained power zilin said without a trace of rancor without communism china is doomed to perpetual piecemeal warfare communisms cause is the only effective rallying point for the millions of peasants who comprise the bulk of our populace without the unity that communism provides china will remain weak broken into shards through which the faan gwai loh will continue to pick like so many carrioneaters huaishan han grunted in disgust they are omnivores zilin went on the faan gwai loh they have no sense of culture propriety no sense of the universality of nature without the bulwark of communism to protect us they will surely pick our bones clean they will take out of china all that is prized and useful only then will they go leaving a wasted hulk huaishan han said you are as good with words as is your god mao my god is buddha zilin said i would have thought that selfevident he had picked up several slender shoots of bamboo now he pulled a folding knife from his pocket and commenced to make cuts here and there bending the supple shoots in a complex pattern davies eating a triangle of sandwich said what are you doing i am hungry zilin said i am doing something about it he rose and reaching up brought down a handful of hemplike vines his hands moved in a blur then he went off disappearing into the underbrush several minutes later he reappeared and came back to where he had been seated before i think he said that i will have a bit of this wine now he sipped it with slow deliberation savoring it on his tongue and in his throat one does not often find such excellent wine in china these days listen to him huaishan han said does he sound the communist now politics follows the force of conviction zilin said it is those who are dogmatically righteous in life who are most often struck down conviction by its very nature is unbending huaishan han pointed out i speak of the conviction of purpose zilin said in maintaining the good of the people one discerns the elasticity of means if we are dogmatic only then we shall surely fail in our goal of protecting the people from poverty ill health foreign intervention huaishan han downed the last of his wine asked for a refill my belly grows empty he growled there at least zilin said a nationalist and a communist may agree he rose again and disappeared when he returned from the underbrush he was carrying a hare which had been caught in his homemade snare lunch he proclaimed and as he set about killing and skinning the creature he said you see mr davies the land must support its people it is a universal law davies brushed crumbs off his lap didnt buddha preach that killingany killingis wrong he opened his silver case took out a cigarette huaishan han took one as well davies put a match to both i have heard that priests will not even put a spade into the earth for fear of killing an insect or a worm he said drawing smoke into his lungs is this true shi tong zhi it is zilin said gutting the hare but i am not a priest we all have our various functions on earth mr davies perhaps i am more like the fox than i would prefer to be but the world you will find is an imperfect place at best one must learn to accept what one is dont you agree without being asked to do so huaishan han made a fire first clearing a bare spot in the ground in time the two chinese were roasting the beast on a roughcut spit made of green branches the fat crackled and hissed as it dropped into the fire and the aroma of roasting meat perfumed the air davies could not find it in himself to indulgehe saw only the head with the dull glazed eyes staring blankly at him he much preferred his tobacco zilin and huaishan han shared the fragrant flesh seeming totally absorbed in eating nothing more was said until they were done davies was astounded to see that nothing whatsoever was left over even the innards wrapped and slow cooked in the embers while the flesh was consumed were devoured at meals end perhaps youve been wondering why i invited huaishan han along this afternoon ross davies said zilin said nothing he had found that gratuitous responses were the province of the foolish what wethat is he and iwould like to enquire is whether you would considerdavies cleared his throat he seemed to be staring at the shiny tips of his bootscoming over to ah our side another man might have leapt up in indignation an ideologue a righteous man zilin contemplated these two men and wondered what about this situation was wrong there was an inconsistency a sense that whatever strategy was on display here was subtly out of kilter by our side zilin said carefully i take it you mean the nationalist cause it is the american cause as well davies said zilin nodded yes mr davies we have already been made abundantly aware of your patriotism davies looked sheepish it shows that much huh like a shining beacon in the darkest night zilin said with more than a trace of humor but there is something refreshing in your transparency i hope that at least will not be ravaged by war and time all this banter may be very amusing huaishan han said but you have not answered our question comrade zilin looked directly into huaishan hans dark eyes that is because i did not take it seriously besides i do not for a moment believe that it was our question at all mr davies would know better than to ask something so fatuous of me but already zilin was aware of the tension that had come into huaishan hans frame the intensity building and he thought what is it that i am missing here this is not a joke comrade the other chinese said switching to mandarin it is a matter of some urgency for us to elicit a true response from you but my dear sir zilin said in the same dialect you have already gotten it i would no more contemplate joining the nationalist forces than i would think about taking my own life all of china hangs in the balance her future and her wellbeing is of the utmost importance to me you are not asking me to betray mao tong zhi but rather china itself huaishan han who had been studying zilin during all of this gave a quick decisive nod but oddly it was directed at ross davies well davies said beginning to gather up the leavings of their lunch i believe it is time we returned to chungking deep in the night zilin was caught in a dream the spirits of those chinese who had died at the hands of the faan gwai loh wailed speaking to him in tongues long lost a rhythmic tattoo rain beating against the window of his room the same sound as the gossamer sheets of his dream shredding the bamboo shutters rattled a shadow beside them long angular rising along the edge of the closed door a shadow that should not have been there zilin set his breathing deepening it returning to the crystal path shuijing ban de xiaolu in order to determine the identity of the anomaly in the room now he could hear the breathing his and anothers through the other sound of nature the storm another brief flicker and then the thunder crashing heavily rolling across the heavens he had been looking at the right place at the right time the crystal path had shown him the way huaishan han was in his room zilin remembered the nationalists tension the intensity in his eyes this is not a joke comrade it is a matter of some urgency for us to elicit a true response from you he remembered too the pistol that davies this mans ally had leveled at him slipped out of bed his mind prepared for battle he had no intention of attacking but he knew that he would defend himself to the death shi tong zhi rain like a mailed fist shi tong zhi rattling the shutters angrily i am here after he spoke he moved to another place in the room but the nationalist made no aggressive move i must speak with you you choose an odd and mannerless method no more mannerless than the war within which we find ourselves true zilin acknowledged speak your piece i will turn on the lamp no zilin was stopped by the urgency of the voice i beg you make no light here there must be no hint at all that i have made this visit huaishan han zilin said carefully you will pardon my skepticism but you are a rabid nationalist you made that absolutely clear yesterday afternoon further you have sought to recruit me to turn me into a traitor to the cause for which i have sacrificed everything in life in short you are my enemy tell me then if you can why i should not report your actions at once to my superiors and yours because huaishan han said in his reedy whisper my superiors have you marked for death in the eerie silence that followed thunder rumbled at some distance to them explain yourself as best i can huaishan han said but you must promise to keep the lights off all right somehow chiang caught a glimpse of you zilins heart picked up his pulse thrumming he still remembers the murders of his men by a man who was married to sun zhongshans assistant he still remembers the manhunt he directed he still remembers its fruitless end now he has marked you he will kill you here nonsense zilin said with a good deal more confidence than he felt this is politics the whole of china is at stake if chiang and mao can come to terms the coalition there will be no coalition huaishan han hissed that i can guarantee you then what is the reason for this summit meeting from the generalissimos point of view it is merely to placate the americans and the russians who have been pressuring him to negotiate the chinese people as well if it comes to that they are weary of war but i can guarantee you shi tong zhi that chiangs mind was made up before you and your contingent ever set foot in chungking it is a victory for him to have the great mao come humbly into his domain to sue for peace huaishan han shook his head but a coalition is out of the question chiang plans to procrastinate here then blame the breakdown of talks on the intractability of the communist position then he will take his army and smash you zilin was stunned because this was what he had believed chiang would do all along mao knew this but still he refused to believe it zilin did not believe in this mythical coalition and now it seemed neither did chiang if huaishan han was telling the truth there is no reason why i should believe any of this zilin said you are my enemy after what happened yesterday thats just it the nationalist said you are not yet aware of what really transpired at lunch i had no intention of recruiting you shi tong zhi merely of getting to the heart of youof your conviction i wanted to know beyond all doubt whom i was dealing with davies had told me that i could trust you but i didnt fully believe him he is a faan gwai loh after all no and what do barbarians know of chinese so you decided to see for yourself the pieces were beginning to fit together thats right huaishan han said that is why i baited you why i tried to recruit you now i know that your heart is pure now i am certain that i can trust you trust me what for it is i who wishes to be recruited shi tong zhi i cannot stand chiang or his militaristic ideas his mind is filled with the glories of warthe supposed glories he believes only in the army for him it is the end and the beginning about the people he cares scarcely at all so you wish to be a communist i wish the best future for my country i know that chiang will not be able to deliver it of course you told ross davies all this when you approached him to be the gobetween absolutely not huaishan han said indignantly do you take me for a fool what i told him was that i wished by informal means to advance the prospects of the coalition perhaps i told him if i approach one of maos advisers and we begin negotiations on a subrosa level we can speed up the process and he believed that why not you know davies as well as i do that notion is one that has great appeal to him he had to comply you see it was the patriotic thing to do zilin laughed yes yes the patriotic thing the best quality of the noble savage huaishan han said hes not a bad sort davies zilin said for a faan gwai loh huaishan han moved into the room i shall help you pack he said together we shall flee northward out of the stronghold of the generalissimo no zilin said that will solve nothing and your defection will create a major problem for mao we must think of a better solution solution huaishan han echoed how can you think of such a thing when you may be killed at any moment calm yourself comrade zilin said chiang will not have someone creep into my room at night and slit my throat he could ill afford such a scandal if what you have just told me is true he desperately needs to emerge from this stalemate with clean hands the americans at least will insist on it as a stipulation for their continued support and without the americans chiang is lost so chiang will take his time he knows that as long as mao is here im not going anywhere it must be made to look like an accident no culpability must be able to be traced back to the nationalist camp yes yes i see that huaishan han said but still patience my new comrade patience we will find a way in the morning zilin did not feel quite so confident for one thing ross davies did not show up for his tai chi lesson this was the first time that had happened since he and zilin had made their pact and it was a potentially ominous sign though zilin did not relish jumping to conclusions it was no secret that he did his exercises every morning at this spot at this time further if chiang wished to assassinate zilin he certainly would not want an american as a witness some reason could easily be found to keep davies away from the killing ground to add to his anxiety zilin had found upon arising that mao and his negotiating contingent had already left for their daily session though it was barely six oclock zilin could not even report the information he had received from huaishan han on zilins suggestion han would remain in place until he received an appropriate signal zilin had assured han that he would be of more use to mao for the moment right where he was inside chiangs camp the dawning day was still the ground of the courtyard was wet from the nights drenching no cock crowed no dog barked the heavens were obscured by a thick and unremitting layer of zinc clouds zilin began his exercises with only half his mind attuned to the moves his senses were questing outward beyond the walls of the courtyard for any alien sound he kept one eye on the arched doorway to the street as he worked he felt the short hairs at the back of his neck rise his skin felt charged with electricity he could almost feel the barrel of a long gun swinging in his direction the sniperscope zeroing in on the back of his head the steeljacketed bullet whirring toward him the tiny sound increasing to a buzz just before the point buried itself in his skull movement with an effort zilin restrained himself from turning his head he continued with his exercises trying to calm his tautened nerves used his eyes to discern if the movement he had picked up at the periphery of his vision was real or imagined an actual threat or a bird flitting off a branch a small movement yes the door it began after a moments hesitation to swing inward zilin ran silently on the balls of his feet from his position in the center of the courtyard to a spot just behind the door all was still as if whoever was on the other side of the door was taking a long look into the courtyard to determine his whereabouts his breathing was controlled but he found himself sweating and he recalled daviess remark to him with tai chi we can work at it for over an hour and im still comfortable the sweat scrolled off zilin he realized that he was afraid he did not want to die the urge to live rose up inside him like a kite and he found the anger that would keep him alivethe anger at someone who would seek to destroy him without that anger zilin knew that he could not take another human beings life the gate only an inch or two in front of him began to tremble then open very slowly zilins skin crawled at the thought of chiangs discovery at what the generalissimo would do to him now he could detect the presence of someone on the other side of the door there was motion and beyond that intent whoever it was was entering the courtyard and zilin knew that his time had come it was kill or be killed he knew that very well he had killed before chiangs men to be exact in order to save his wife mai he had had no choice no choice now either but he thought of buddha and his teachings in that at least davies had not been wrong or naive movement began in a headlong rush he was given no more time thought ceased and action took over the organism seeking to protect itself at all costs the blur of a figure on the run zilin lunged out from his hiding place arms wrapped his strength combining with his momentum to bring them both down his arm was raised to deliver the killing atemi when the image filling his eyes registered on his brain his arm came down and the heavy shudder of the excess adrenaline moving about with no release went through him the anger was gone what are you doing here she thought he was angry with her and she began to cry it was pus daughter the one who had seen the fire in ross daviess hair it was not good and zilin knew that it was not going to get any better the horse had stumbled perhaps its load had been too heavy or his hoof had caught in a root or a rock fissure it didnt really matter that part what mattered was that a thousand pounds of dead weight had come crashing down on mr pu the horses leg had fractured on impact of course zilin determined that mr pus lower intestines and spleen had been ruptured he had drowned in his own blood in the meantime the horse went on suffering with his broken leg he would be of no use to the pus now except as table meat but zilin had to do something about the animals pain he thought of ross davies and his wild exultant cries as his hands slid over the horses sweatsoaked hide he thought of his own wild rush at freedom astride this animals strong back he found the nerve juncture and pressed inward with a short sharp jab so that the light went out of those wildly rolling eyes the girls were weeping openly but their mother remained stonefaced her stoicism reminded zilin of the countless faces of war victims he had observed emptyeyed and emptyhearted he wondered whether in these pragmatic times the old woman mourned the loss of her husband or her horse the most without mr pu they would go on at the very least survive but the death of the horse was another matter entirely we have not even the money to pay for a proper funeral mrs pu said later her voice was as thin as the wind outside zilin and the girls had stayed behind to butcher the animal since its flesh needed to be eaten fresh the old man lay where he had fallen covered in black clotted blood and a shower of tea leaves what will become of his spirit if it is not properly ushered into the next life she spoke not to any one person though zilin and her daughters sat beside her but to the house as a whole it was as if she felt the spirit of her dead husband still inhabiting the rude rafters and floorboards and she expected the answers to emanate from there zilin had gotten the idea while he was working shoulder to shoulder with the pu girls on the horse he had said nothing but rather had begun to turn it over in his mind like a rare and fascinating jewel that needed to be observed from every angle it was a daring ideamore than that in fact it was crazy but then he told himself these were crazy times and of course there was a kind of buddhist symmetry to it a balancing of loss and gain that was appealing to that part of him that demanded a final accounting between what was right and what was wrong as he watched the pale light flow across mrs pus face as he absorbed a portion of the anguish that racked her he thought of what he was about to ask did he dare but he knew that the question was rather dare he not strictly speaking what he would ask of her was morally wrong according to the tenets of buddhism but china was at war survival was the goal at least for the short range until conditions improved and survival was precisely what zilin would be offering the pus survival in exchange for madam he said leaning forward so that he would not have to raise his voice there was no point in getting the girls involved at this point i know a way that you may ensure that your husbands spirit will be properly escorted to the next life her head came up she brushed strands of prematurely gray hair out of her eyes she had been weeping silent tears her head bowed so that her daughters would not see there was nothing zilin saw tired about her eyes they held his with a feverish intensity hers was a hard life this fact had long ago ceased to disturb her she had accepted her joss with the absolute faith of her forebears it was the way the only way our loss is great shi tong zhi she said but you have already done more for us than i could have asked or even have imagined it is wrong to ask more of you on the contrary madam he said carefully it is i who now must ask of you a terrible favor i have it in my power to grant your wishes i can provide the proper funeral for your late husband i can further provide your family with another horse mrs pu said nothing though she had ceased to weep her wise eyes searched his face at last she said the war is universal in the pain it inflicts neh zilin bowed his head in acquiescence we must survive shi tong zhi she said with a voice grown stronger no matter the cost if you can ensure that then i and my daughters will be in your debt for all time this i pledge to you zilin knew that it was he who was in her debt but he was intelligent enough not to argue i wish to tell you what it is i require before you give your consent her eyes narrowed momentarily you will not take my daughters from me never madam i thought not she settled herself like a bird upon its perch i know you shi tong zhi i have observed your heart that is not your way she nodded gravely do as you will then we shall survive tragedy will not break us though we bend like the supple bamboo i wish you to know she shrugged joss zilin nodded joss you are insane huaishan han said absolutely insane why zilin said because i want to die huaishan han snorted youll never get away with it with your help i will impossible zilin had sent one of the girls into chungking with a message for huaishan han he did not arrive until well after dark his face was pale and drawn buddha he said a bit breathlessly when you disappeared from town i feared the worst what has happened zilin told him then he began to explain about his plan now he said leading huaishan han out of the farmhouse i will demonstrate why it is not impossible he had built several small fires around the periphery of the area where mr pu still lay he had not wanted to move the body but something had to be done to keep the animals at bay look zilin said taking han inside the circle of fire we are of approximately the same age our height and weight vary only slightly certainly not enough for anyone to notice huaishan han grunted you dont look much alike true enough zilin said but when we get through with him that wont matter huaishan han turned to stare at zilin youre mad on the contrary i have found the path out of the dilemma chiang has put me in it is quite simple really my death will put an end to everything chiangs vendetta will be nothing more than a whiff of smoke how did you think of such a thing this man is dead zilin said i did not wish it but it is so his family has nothing without a horse who knows what will happen to them for the loan of this husk from which the spirit has already departed i will give them that which they need in order to carry on tell me something comrade with the pure heart huaishan han said with an edge to his voice what would you have done if mrs pu had said no would you have allowed them to starve i would have done precisely what i am doing now i would have assured mr pu of a fine burial i would have found them another horse there really is no other way huaishan han regarded him for some time the crackling of the fires lit up the night the smell of woodsmoke almost drowned out the sickly sweet smell of death i think mrs pu was aware of all this zilin said but her indebtedness to me precluded her turning me down as long as she knew i wasnt planning to take away her daughters she was willing to comply the exchange satisfied her sense of debt as well huaishan han looked away down toward the corpse he leaned down picked up a stiffened arm he turned the hand over so that it faced him palm up the face we can disfigure he said but what about these he brandished the hand thick and yellowed with peasants callus zilin laughed and held out his own hands for inspection their heavy layer of callus shone with the translucence of ivory you forget comrade that i am a true revolutionary i worked long years in the fields with the peasants i am one of them as all communists should be when we exchange clothes when we set my ring upon his finger when weve set the accident and it is you who finds the body i will be pronounced dead all right of that i am certain and it was as zilin had said no major inquiry was held at maos request the body of zilin found along the slopes of jinyun shan at the foot of a long drop off the roadside provided no ominous overtones it was obvious to everyone that he had been walking at night and had been struck either by a vehicle or a large animal and had been pitched over the side of the cliff regrettable certainly but hardly suspicious joss at maos express wishes huaishan han remained in place within generalissimo chiangs inner circle and the wealth of information he provided mao was to a large partat least in zilins opinionthe tide that turned fortune toward the communists mao stayed on in chungking until almost the middle of october of even though he knew from zilin that chiang had no intention of entering into a binding coalition agreement still his sense of duty and zilin supposed propriety dictated that he remain in the fall mao left chu enlai to continue the fruitless negotiations though this was little more than a sop to the insistent but increasingly frustrated ambassador hurley returning to yunnan mao set up his council of war the russians had at last entered the war against japan stalins keen nose scenting the kill divisions of the soviet army penetrated south into manchuria wiping out the japanese units as they went this was of paramount concern to mao whose greatest fear at the moment was that chiangs nationalist army would be allowed by the americans to take over the socalled liberated zones as the japanese divisions were defeated there was mao knew well a wealth of war ordnance and materiel that could be of incalculable assistance to his illequipped army he shuddered to think of what would happen if the nationalists gained the strength of that hardware and put it to use against his forces this fear he made manifest to zilin who alone of all his advisers he was candid with chiang has the superiority of number mao said one bleak rainfilled day near the end of the year he has the backing of both the americans and the russians his is the government recognized by the world he has the power now i fear to destroy us utterly zilin standing against the stone wall of the cave they had made their headquarters said that chiangs troops outnumber ours will not figure in the outcome of this conflict mao sitting crosslegged on a rug that had been spread along the floor regarded his most trusted adviser please continue comrade zilin closed his eyes put his head back against the cool stone outside the rain was a graygreen sheet obscuring the countryside sun tzu has said mao tong zhi that though the enemy may be as multitudinous as stars if he does not know your military situation he will not know how to prepare for your coming we must change our strategy chiang will become confused for by now he feels that he has divined our purpose that much han has assured me if you further disturb his regular military patterns with unannounced forays into his territory it will increase his confusion if you then follow a secret strategya strategy known only to ourselves and not even to the generals of our armiesthen truly you can say that you are the creator of this most important communist victory for a long time mao said nothing he rose and began to pace the cave manchuria is the key he said finally i can feel it manchuria is the key to chiangs victory that is why he has been so insistent about it in the negotiations if we can trap him there then we will have a victory zilins eyes were still closed to that end then mao tong zhi let us commit ourselves heavily to manchuria yes let us draw chiang northward into manchuria let us create for ourselves a memorable defeat in manchuria what mao stood stock still yes zilin said yes let us show our strategy to chiang we will mass an army at a city crucial to the taking of manchuria which one mao fascinated despite himself said ssuping would do nicely let it be ssuping zilin said nodding he opened his eyes it will mean great loss of life i am afraid but from this defeat chiang will surely believe that he has gotten a feel for us his superior strength will work against him zilin outlined his plan in may of the communist army suffered heavy losses in its defeat at ssuping two months later mao declared that his forces were henceforth to be known as the peoples liberation army now mao gave orders that his army abandon all cities in manchuria that could not be guarded by a minimum force the majority of the peoples liberation army began their new life as a guerrilla force highly mobile attack units chiang puffed up by what he thought was a decisive victory at ssuping viewed the pla change in strategy as another victory for his nationalist cause accordingly he directed massive numbers of divisions to move into the manchurian towns left behind byin his opinionthe fleeing communist forces added to this in the spring of chiang buoyed by his successes in manchuria began a furious offensive strike against the communist forces as maos armies split apart as mao and his advisers took to the hills of yunnan chiangs mind was filled more and more with the glittering prize of ultimate victory to this end he ordered more and more cities taken and garrisoned in the enormous spaces of manchuria until as zilin had predicted his forces were badly overextended cued by han maos peoples liberation army now began their first serious counterattack months long and unremitting it began to have its effect within nine months peng tehuai the communist field commander had defeated the nationalist army at sian this effectively cut off chiangs potential line of retreat from yunnan now the communist forces drove inward from two sides for the killing blow the americans poured advisers and money in ever increasing numbers on the nationalist side the worse the situation became the more terrified they were the more money they spent months before major general david ban had pleaded with chiang to abandon his positions in manchuria mao had left only skeleton divisions in manchuria but acting on his directives they recruited the remnantsthree hundred thousand strongof the manchurian puppet army of manchurian chinese used by the japanese and left behind after their defeat in the war and the russians subsequent withdrawal now the pla was strong in the north without having had to sacrifice divisions in the south but chiang abetted by some of his advisersamong them han refused to abandon so vital an area general barr was after all a faan gwai loh he could not be expected to understand the historical imperative of gaining control of manchuria in november of the communist army under the overall leadership of chen yi commenced an offensive of immense proportions in the central eastern provinces fully half a million nationalist soldiers were annihilated in just three short months now chiang was ready to sue for peace but the march to liberation had begun and not the generalissimo or the monied americans or the truculent soviets could stand in the way of the massive dreadnought created out of intervention bitter hatred and despair in april maos forces had captured nanking by the autumn complete victory was theirs on october in peking the peoples republic of china was born maochairman maohow he was hailed on that day as for the man who walked at the end of the line cast in shadow few knew his face and none knew his name ii emptiness samvartasiddha winterspring present new york hong kong washington moscow beijing tokyo when he had heard the machinegun fire and had seen neon chow running back from where jake had pushed off in the wallawalla three oaths had run back down the wharf to call the police he had already determined that the gunfire had emanated from his junk and he steeled himself for the worst his third cousin worked the night shift as desk sergeant at aberdeen and so the response to three oathss call was quick three oaths accompanied the four officers on the police launch as they threaded their way through the floating city three oaths stood fidgeting near the bow of the launch while just behind him the officers checked and rechecked their weaponry in much the same professional manner as had the three japanese members of the dantai some time before the rain stippled the dark water drummed against the hulls of the junks and launches three oaths wiped it from his eyes he saw jake sitting hunched over a long shape shrouded in shadow as they boarded stay here one of the officers hissed as three oaths identified jake he had already given them descriptions of the three family members he knew to be on board jake bliss and zilin bliss three oaths fell to his knees as he recognized the supine shadow jake clutched to him oh my bousehk his trembling hands reached out to brush the slickened hair away from her face his fingers came away bloody jake he whispered jake she needs a hospital elder uncle jakes face was pale his hooded copper eyes normally so filled with inner fire were colorless are you all right younger nephew yes it was a whisper and the jian jake blinked my father he began his eyes stared at three oaths my fathers life is ended ah evil gods that foresaw this day three oaths hands reached out again for his adopted daughter it was an instinctive gesture but no less important for that the family had been diminished now each member was that much more precious to him did you see them jake the assassins jake nodded i found them belowdecks there were three of them the damage they did was with gion machine pistols he shook his head they were very good very professional a dantai i think how could he tell his uncle about his loss of bamahk how could he explain the unexplainable how could he express the burden of guilt weighing him down he believed bamahk would have alerted him to the assassination attempt it would have at the very least allowed him to dispatch the three assassins before they had a chance to hurt bliss he held her tighter a hospital elder uncle he said we must get her to hospital the police launch is here theyll take her as quickly as can be managed he raised his head as the police officers reappeared from out of the hatchways fore and aft three men dead one of the officers said another was busy scribbling in a notebook lots of blood place is pretty well broken up looks like machine guns were used all over belowdecks like a hurricane three men three oaths repeated who the officers stared at him blankly and he returned his gaze to jake who were they well have to wait for that the officer said we found nothing on their bodies that would be useful for identification purposes all gods great and small three oaths thought what am i doing standing here talking to these corrupt sons of idiot sea slugs they know nothing and even if they did would tell me nothing he stood trying desperately to bring his emotions under control my daughter is in desperate need of medical attention officer he said in a brisk businesslike tone if you will be good enough to take her to a hospital what do you know about this incident sir the officer with the pad said nothing three oaths said what could i know nothing at all why do you ask me such an inane question purely form sir one of the officers said well have to talk to your nephew and to your daughter please three oaths said that can all be done in the morning right now my daughter is unconscious i have no idea how badly she is injured my nephew is in shock you have my word that everyone involved will give full and complete statements but right now the officer in charge looked from jake to bliss and nodded all right he gestured take her up boys thats right easy now easy watch her head there he watched as they took bliss down to the launch he stepped up close to three oaths i should caution you not to disturb or touch anything on board until the forensic men from special branch arrive also the coroners people are on their way youll give them free access yes of course the officer looked away the searchlight on the launch silvered his wide cantonese face my condolences this is bad very bad indeed he took a breath fumes from the launchs engines plumed upward hanging in the heavy night air does your nephew require medical attention as well ill take care of him three oaths said please see to my daughter the officer touched his cap he was waiting for three oaths and jake to move then he swung down onto the launch the engine pitched downward as they cast off and in a moment they were slicing the night this really takes me back there was a time when i couldnt afford any of these tony simbal looked at the paintings displayed in their ornate gilt frames this is the one it was a particularly aggressive cezanne the artists palette knife slathering thick streams of pigment that took on a demented almost physical aspect simbal did not understand it at all nor did he like it the thing that attracts me most to cezanne max threnody said is his treading on the brink of anarchy to create an entire universe that is so chaotic yet so well ordered is extraordinary dont you think threnody made some notes in the booklet he had been given when he had registered at the auction house on wisconsin avenue didnt see much of you at the party the other night monica and i got to dredging up old times threnody snapped the booklet shut and grinned is that why my coat room was off limits for an hour or so i guess so lets get a seat shall we they moved off to the bidding hall where rows of gray metal folding chairs had been set up the place was perhaps a quarter full it didnt end well i take it it didnt end at all the place was filling up fast threnody had been right to want to take seats i suppose monica told you that i was asking about peter curran simbal said threnody opened his booklet made some more notes why would you think that monica would tell me anything threnody asked but now that youve brought it up in your own clumsy wayi think weve got a problem later after he had missed buying the cezanne when the bidding went unexpectedly high they began to walk west down toward the water the afternoon was overcast heavy for a late winter day the wind off the potomac was as cutting as it had been when snow had blanketed the city and people had been skidding on the ice threnody who wore an old loden coat more suitable for a student at nearby george washington university tucked his head down like a turtle now whats this sudden interest in peter curran he asked you said before that you thought we had a problem what kind of problem is it with curran i wish max threnody said that we could stop fencing i dont work for you anymore max the dea no longer controls me yet here we are together again how do you explain that simbal relented i need information they had reached virginia avenue they began to follow it northwest if you dont come clean with me threnody said i dont see how i can help you you know you cant con information out of me and without access to the dea computer you wouldnt be able to he broke off abruptly monica the party he nodded his narrow head i gave you the perfect opening didnt i i must be getting old the thought had occurred to me simbal said to have monica lead me back to the dea computer it didnt work out ive got to give the girl credit shes far from stupid but her heart aches for you tony god knows why youre such a bastard given time shed relent all right but then i suppose she doesnt know you quite as well as i do you dont have to sleep with me threnodys eyes opened wide my goodness does that mean shes more in tune with the real tony simbal his voice was heavy with sarcasm they had reached the southern edge of rock creek park from their vantage point they could see the dam at the point behind them the watergate hotel reared its plush and now infamous bulk simbal was silent for a time he watched the sluggish water gray as a whales back and wondered why he couldnt think of a retort will you help me or wont you max as you said you dont work for me anymore there was something that simbal had to work out something going on here that he wasnt quite reading it had been happening at the periphery of his awareness ever since they sat down at the auction what maybe simbal said its time we tried to be friends i trusted you and then when you came home from burma you left the dea because your college roommate called who said the british had the monopoly on oldboy networks they stopped then in the silence staring at each other absorbing what the other one had said a barge invisible around the bend in the river hooted and simbal shivered jesus he said this sounds like a marriage gone bad maybe it is simbal took a deep breath can we end this animosity max id really like to threnody looked out along the river as if he expected to see the barge at last he nodded that suits me he put his hands together their backs were raw and redlooking i always admired you tony you were my best operative it hurt to lose you i was restless max simbal took another deep breath thats all sure threnody nodded with a kind of positive force we all have to move on its part of life they walked on in silence for a time a pair of business types in sweats came jogging by christ but they make me feel old threnody said peter curran is your resident diqui expert right simbal said alan thune was murdered in new york last week while on his way to a routine rdv with his regular contact i figure curran knows more than i do about the diquis current activities i cant figure your interest his pop eyes were always weepy in the wind he wiped at them now with the handkerchief correct me if im wrong but shouldnt you be leaving the diqui to us and the snits he was speaking of the cias strategic narcotics team the diquis just part of the beat donovans assigned me southeast asia he wants to know everything and if its moving why how and where to so how about you setting up a meet between me and curran thats hardly possible now threnody said staring hard at simbal peter curran has been terminated in this warm light her skin was as tawny as a cats with her thick sheaf of blond hair and her cool gray eyes she could have been an enchantress lorelei or perhaps more accurately circe for to mikhail carelin there was a quality about daniellas beauty that seemed descended from ancient greek legend carelin an ardent student of history saw in her aspects he associated with the peoples of asia minorthe mesopotamians assyrians babylonians she did not in any case possess a modern face her chiseled features were straight out of antiquity he often joked with her that she was the reincarnation of some ancient queen i am russian she would say i dont know anything about babylonia or assyria one time when she said this he thrust a book into her hands whats this she said i dont have time to read its a history on the military career of alexander the great he said i think you should make the time to read it why because he tried to conquer the entire civilized world he said and damn near succeeded carelin believed that daniella wanted to conquer the entire civilized world these days he said one needs more help than alexander had in his time he believed that she was overly ambitious and that this traitwhich in daniellas opinion was what made her strong and resilient in a mans worldwas also her hubris from the greek hybris carelin said to her meaning arrogance the dictionary defines hubris as exaggerated pride or selfconfidence whats wrong with that she had countered often resulting in retribution she had shut up then thinking of oleg maluta it had been because of uncle vadim that she had first met oleg maluta socially uncle vadim liked her to come to leningrad at the end of december the other members of the family assumed that was because it was the best time of the year for daniella only she and uncle vadim knew the true reason daniellas mother had been a member of the russian orthodox church this she had to keep a secret from daniellas father uncle vadim was a member as well and he liked daniella to be with him at christmastime it was in leningrad that daniella had first met oleg maluta she had just been named to the politburo where maluta was already a senior member uncle vadim had arranged the dinner at the delfin one of the floating restaurants in front of the admiralty of course at that time of the year the neva river was frozen solid though at fifty miles the neva was one of the worlds shortest rivers its current was so strong that there was little salt content in the gulf near the city therefore it was usually frozen all winter long from the beginning of december through may this man can help you danushka she remembered uncle vadim saying on the way to the delfin if he takes a liking to you many doors will open up for you and your most difficult timethe next six monthswill be made infinitely easier oleg sergeevich knows where all the brooms are in the closet not brooms daniella thought now bones your oleg sergeevich maluta knows where all of them are buried uncle and to whom they belong it was ironic that she had been elevated to one of the most powerful jobs in all of russia yet because of the evil cunning of one man she was trapped like a fox in its lair she dared not move against maluta in any overt manner because she had not yet begun her own consolidation of power she was new to the politburo and it would take time for her to learn her way in what had been strictly male territory she could not even use her own networks to defeat him from a clandestine position since he had made it clear to her that she was under constant surveillance that was not so easy a thing to do to the head of the sluzhbas first chief directorate she was not like an ordinary citizen after all the first chief directorate was a vast bureau and she was far from coming to know personally all its department heads many were from anatoly karpovs regime she was certain that maluta had suborned one of them it was the only way to keep her in view without eliciting a whiff of smoke use daniellas own people now as they stirred together in the big bed beneath the thick eiderdown comforter she wondered whether to tell carelin of malutas treachery what would he do if he knew that maluta had secreted away photographs of him and daniella in the act of making passionate love a murderous rage overtook daniella she jerked herself into a sitting position what is it koshka carelin liked to call her that cat just chill she said tears in the snowy night maluta drinking in her sadness and remorse like some dark vampire while someone in the night snapped photographs obscene closeups of the weakness the tears leaking out of her eyes nothing at all carelin sat up put his arms around her his face was in all respects nondescript he could be said to be neither handsome nor ugly his was a face that would never be noticed in a crowd the kremlin watchers in england and america poring over their surveillance passed him by time and again in favor of the genachevs and the reztsovs and the kulagins men with charisma who reached out and grabbed for power what then could a man such as mikhail carelin offer them yet for daniella who had schooled herself to the catechisms of power carelin was a man who held infinitely more allure than the more notorious powermongers inside the kremlin he possessed something far more valuable principally because he did not seek the international limelight an exceptional inner strength that was why genachev came to him for advice carelin was not a man who sought continually to expand his power base he possessed a confidence of self that daniella greatly admired he moved in the shadows along the corridors of power whispering in the right ears and creating policy while avoiding the lethal purges that were part of any highly ideologized political system maluta had called him egoless the truth was that carelin had subordinated ego to strategy and that was rare indeed in the world it seemed to daniella that mikhail carelin was filled with a wonderful ineffable peace and sharing that peacefulness brought her a great deal of joy joy as opposed to pleasure daniella had sought and gained pleasure from a great many men the male of the species she had found could be trained to give enormous pleasure not so with joy joy was an innate characteristic it could not be taught on the contrary it was so elemental a quality that it simply was but its existence was rarevery rare indeed according to daniellas experience mikhail carelin gave her joy and thus he was precious to her as no man before him had ever been this of course was a continual source of surprise to daniella she was usedhad become used perforce by circumstanceto manipulating men as a defensive counter to their manipulation of her it was when she moved from defensive to offensive strategyas with karpov and lantin in whose bed they now satthat her career took off like a rocket carelin was different perhaps it had begun in the same way had she seduced him memoryand emotion of coursetended to obscure certain facts and now their romantic origins were misted over as if they were the stuff of carelins legends instead of simply her life the mythos of daniella and mikhail the thought of that sometimes made her laugh at other times it caused her to hug his lean strong body to hers it was at those times that daniella understood that she was afraid of his leaving her it was an irrational fear to be sure she had no doubts about carelin he loved her fiercely and completely but with none of the slavish devotion that had disgusted her in many of her lovers she knew the difference in them she had manufactured their love and so in the end it had turned rancid in its artificiality she had had to do nothing in carelins case he loved her period come koshka he whispered lie down again and daniella listened to him as genachev listened to him during the day her body relaxed surrounded by his warmth she melted her eyes closed she sighed deeply in her sleep she spoke oleg malutas name and carelin wrapped up in her staring at the play of pale lights across the bedroom ceiling heard her maluta he thought and when she awoke near dawn he said tell me about oleg maluta on her guard daniella said i dont understand tell me koshka he said why you are frightened of him why do you say that because he stalks your dreams carelin turned to her even in your sleep you speak his name with hate and fear she reached out and touched his cheek with the flat of her hand why werent you asleep lyubimi carelin smiled i was listening to the night i was thinking and i heard you call out his name maluta you said what else only maluta now daniella was on the cusp it had been an eternity since she confided anything in a man she wished to with carelin which was precisely why she hesitated to do it there was danger in matters of the heart one was always betrayed this she had learned by hard experience still a heart in love longs to share for that sharing brings with it another kind of intimacy the kind that transforms pleasure into joy i want to tell you bit off her words in midsentence remembering in this war you are either with me or against me maluta had said the snow the stillness of the night the rasp of oleg malutas voice across her heart the taste of ashes in her mouth as she saw the light go out of alexeis eyes her finger trembling on the trigger her ears echoing with white sound in the aftermath choking on the cordite fumes and maluta taking the pistol from her hand so that only her prints would be on it a weapon hidden away never to be fired again but ready to be used against her i want you to understand that i can have you brought up on murder charges at any time koshka carelin said make love to me koshka the pain i see behind your eyes do as i ask lyubimi her hands moving along the planes of his torso please carelin enwrapped her his palms cupping her hard high breasts the pads of his thumbs rubbed her nipples and she gasped burying her head in his shoulder a thick wing of hair passed across his face smelling of lavender and citrus his hand wove patterns down to her belly and beneath found that she was already wet and open he turned lifting her over and up on top of him her thighs opened like the petals of a flower he entered her and at the same time bit into her cinnamon flesh daniella thought that she would faint her back rested against his muscular chest she could feel his heartbeat his pulse accelerating as he slid further and further up into her her head went back and her eyelids fluttered she felt him inside her like a second heartbeat the pleasure as he bucked up against her was a solid cylinder that reached all the way up to the top of her head she was on fire his hands kneaded her breasts gently pulling at her nipples making her shiver and pant with wanting lyubimi she said lyubimi she began to rotate her hips giving an added motion when he was in all the way so that her inner muscles caressed the very end of him she could hear his little cries feel his hot breath in her ear he seemed to be talking but it was in a language that registered only on her soul it was as if they were joined from the inside out instead of the other way around her fingertips urged him onward at the same time she was urging herself on koshka she felt that part of him not inside her drawn up as hard as rocks he expanded inside her he was so deep daniellas eyes glazed and unseeing opened wide she could not catch her breath her thighs were trembling and they closed inward trapping him pushing him even further as he began to convulse beneath her in so doing he pushed hard against the roof of her and she cried out grinding her hips down hard against him she was flooded with intense heat her insides had turned molten and she brought her own hands up over his squeezing in on her sensitive breasts she did not stop moving until he popped out of her then she turned and whispered hold me tight darling hold me very tight for the first time feeling fully the importance of this too with the dawns cool blue light she said i want to tell you about maluta in this war you are either with me or against me her fear of him blew like a cold wind against her heart i want to tell you everything because maluta had made her cry bitter tears stinging her cheeks and the snow all around her the isolating snow the tears he had forced out of her which had bared her heart to his avid gaze he had accomplished what no man since daniellas father had been able to do he had made her feel like a little girl he had forced her to shed her adult facade he had stripped her naked before him and in a terrible way that would be indelibly etched in her mind he had raped her nakedness of the body was nothing compared to nakedness of the soul like a good catholic i want to confess carelin lying with one leg thrown across her thighs said nothing he felt the thick sheaf of her hair against his cheek the sweetness of her breath he stared into those cool gray eyes and thought of the stormtossed black sea outside the wind had picked up handfuls of dry snow came rattling against the windowpanes and now and again the sounds of a vehicle passing could be heard chains clinking how has he hurt you koshka i work for him now her voice was low if they had not been so close carelin did not believe that he would have heard her bastard he said quietly evenly and by the tone of that single word he caused daniella to relax i am safe with him she thought he forced me to murder alexei she said in a choked voice he told me that he was using alexei to spy on me then after i had put the gunhis gun malutas weaponto alexeis head and shot him maluta told me the truth that a man was out there in the night taking pictures of me hes there now ive no doubt have you ever seen him do you know what he looks like m no carelin thought for a moment what happened to the murder weapon daniella sat very still her eyes were dry she seemed to have ceased to breathe maluta took it it has my fingerprints all over it it is untraceable to maluta he has photos as well of the murder now came the crunch of other things she whispered from unnatural stillness to unnatural movement she had begun to shake all over again what if because of this mikhail left her her nerve ends were on fire at the thought she did not think that she could face maluta again knowing that she was utterly alone what other things daniella burning up as with a fever remained mute her tongue clove to the dry roof of her mouth she felt a pressure on her vocal chords koshka he said gently now you must finish what you have begun he took her hand in his and just as if they were teenaged lovers beginning the intimidating ritual of physical intimacy twining his fingers between hers pressed hard in order to transfer his courage into her what could be so terrible daniella closed her eyes she felt as if she were about to jump off a boat into ten fathoms of water what would your wife do mikhail if she found out about us he laughed startling her why worry about that koshka the only one she could hear it from is you and you wont tell her will you then he saw the expression of agony on her face maluta his voice was like the tolling of a bell in the room maluta has photographs of us daniella nodded she did not trust herself to speak carelin put his head back against the wall oh koshka he said after a long time i think youve done us in so you see threnody said it is most unlikely that either you or i will be afforded the opportunity to speak with peter curran again simbal now understood monicas reaction when he had brought up currans name he and max began to walk again cued by some unspoken signal what happened his car was turned into a ball of fire by a pound of plastique ouch simbal stopped they had been walking for quite some time and the cold was getting to him id we had only the skeleton to work with threnody said its a physical match dnt was impossible since curran hadnt any dental work done but he always wore a peculiar signet ring threnody took it out of his pocket he belonged to something called the hellfire club at college yale i think it was anyway we found the ring inside the car had to peel lots of blackened skin off it to make the id thats it then threnody blew on his hands it doesnt have to be now simbal had it the something that had been going on at the periphery of maxs responses ever since they had met this afternoon clicked home you want me to take peter currans place infiltrating the diqui simbal said with some awe in his voice thats what youve wanted from the beginning yes and no threnody raised his hands before you get your irish up give me the benefit of the doubt hear me out then if you want to say no just walk away and that will be the end of it the truth is i need someone from outside the department to continue this investigation but no i do not want you to take peters place he was up to some very unusual stuff which is precisely why i need you after peter left on this last mission it was discovered that certain ah documents of a sensitive nature were missing from our files curran filched company goodies the wind had shifted gusting in from the water threnody pulled the collar of his loden coat up around his ears it would seem that way yes can you tell me what he took names dates places operation networks jesus well put tony our friends on capitol hill would love to pull us apart on something like this congressional subcommittees live off mistakes like this simbal turned to him is that what you call it a mistake whatever name you care to put on it threnody said it needs to be fixed and fixed with the utmost discretion it would be most embarrassing if this got around even interdepartmentally simbal knew that he meant donovan from behind them a siren sounded when the ambulance had passed and the normal traffic flow on the street had started up again simbal said ill need full access to the dea computer threnody nodded youll get whatever you need tony he held out his hand and when simbal took it gripped it hard the last of the rain slid down the glass inside the room it was very still so that the rhythmic sound of the respirator seemed harsh and alien three oaths played with the cord of the blinds turning gray light darker then lighter in minute increments he stared through the bars the blinds made as if he were in prison all gods destroy our enemies three oaths said the sound of blisss deep breathing the most tangible sign of her sedation was like a knife twisting in his heart each tidal sigh brought another wave of anguish the fornicating doctors know nothing he despaired they are helpless they say nothing they will not even admit to ignorance bliss could die this very instant and they would not be able to do anything about it or even tell us what happened calm yourself elder uncle jake said the doctor told us that the xrays were negative the eec showed no internal trauma then why do they want to make more tests probe my daughter with their gwai loh machines certain anomalies in her brainwaves is how the doctor put it i dont understand three oaths said neither i think do the doctors there you see he cried it is just as i said routine elder uncle the anomalies are not lifethreatening just puzzling ah buddha three oaths collapsed on a chair beside the high bed what evil joss has overtaken us jake what onerous deeds did we perform in a previous life to have generated such violent and powerful enemies first jake said we must discover who our enemies are three oaths looked at his nephew you said bliss saw their tattoos irezumi jake said she said they were yakuza i dont understand three oaths said we have no enemies in japan if shes right we do now jake rose and went to the window a flood of neon disfigured the ceiling in much the same way the special tattoos marked the yakuza warriors there is a war going on in japan he said into the void of the neonlighted night a yakuza war my friend mikio komoto is under siege and you think thatthree oaths gesturedthis had something to do with that friendship jake shrugged why not perhaps they were looking for me perhaps they killed my father out of frustration in not finding me three oaths was not persuaded they were professionals they were very good i am using your words now younger nephew you called them a dantai you yourself created two such dantai when you were working for the quarry i am not mistaken in thinking that a dantais qualities include extraordinary courage and discipline i ask you two questions one would a dantai not be able to pinpoint your whereabouts two would a dantai resort to wanton and to them quite useless destruction out of frustration jake said nothing but continued to stare out at the vibrating darkness he was thinking about the operative who had tailed him who had kept him busy away from the junk just long enough if he had been able to use bamahk he would almost assuredly become aware of the larger strategy it could have turned events on their side bamahk could have saved his fathers life fool he thought savagely that is your western half thinking use your chinese mind what has happened has happened joss get on with what must be done now in any case i will go to japan he said after a long silence and leave bliss and this fornicating mess with southasia bancorp bliss jake said will not recover any the quicker with me here as to southasia bancorp i have the entire yuhnhyun to think of there is the matter of your fathers funeral three oathss tone had turned hard he remembered what neon chow had said at gaddis about how qualified his own number one son was to be zhuan it is a sons duty do not presume to tell me jake said swinging around to face his uncle what is or is not my duty i am zhuan i understand my obligations the body will be cremated tonight you and i and t y chung will attend a service at dawn tomorrow my fathers ashes will be scattered into the south china sea as were his wishes but as to business something must be done here while i am away he handed a small packet over to his uncle choose one of your sonsi leave that decision to you see that he finds out all he can about that three oaths unwrapped the packet inside smudged bits of newspaper he discovered an unset opal its predominantly red flame winked and shone at him as he turned it this way and that where did you get this from the pocket of someone who was foolish enough to follow me jake said when was this just see that it is done jake said curtly to bring up the tick was to remind himself of his loss bamahk the way of strategy jake concentrated tried to feel the pulse nothing and he could not say a word to three oaths by the time i return i want to know where it was bought when and most importantly by whom three oaths rewrapped the parcel pocketed it it will be done he said his eyes dropped to his daughters pale face she is a part of me just as much as the children of my loins and she is more she is a piece of shi zilin my bousehk his tone was entirely different when he raised his head now i want you to go downstairs and let a doctor take a look at you if you must persist in your course of action i want to be assured of your continued physical soundness for the sake of the yuhnhyun you understand yes course the tension between them would not dissipate this was surely not how my father planned it jake thought oh buddha i cannot believe that he is gone give me the strength to carry out the strategy i am counting on you to keep the lid on the southasia situation you are indeed a hard one younger nephew three oaths sat very still though he said nothing for a moment his tone precluded any further comment from jake perhaps my elder brother was correct after all in believing you zhuan one must be cold and uncaring indeed to carry the weight of such a superstructure as the yuhnhyun on ones back i know that it would break mine his uncles words stung him pricked his heart decided his next action he took out an envelope elder uncle he said thickly i do not know where i will be in the next days or what will happen joss eh but i have made some provisions he held out the envelope inside you will find the name of apollo our mole in russia while i am gone you must maintain radio contact with him he must be made to feel that his lifeline out of russia is absolutely secure i cannot risk his abandoning his directive do you understand three oaths looked at his nephew his heart swelled with pride perfectly zhuan so neon chow was wrong after all he thought deep down he had known it to be so still it was gratifying to get this tangible proof of the esteem in which he was still held fortyeight hours after i am gone jake said you will open the envelope and follow the instructions for contacting apollo thereafter you will maintain a fortyeighthour schedule until my return which will be when younger nephew when buddha wills it jake handed over the envelope mckenna returned to the smoky labyrinth of the white teacup at the appointed time the police report on the incident in aberdeen since it had been remanded to special branchhad crossed his desk and he had read the account by the dispatched officers with more than passing interest three oaths tsun was part owner of the southasia bancorp and he wondered if this attack on his junk had something to do with the rumor that whiteeye kao had passed on to him he threaded his way through the packs of sailors and bgirls seeing big oysters pok at his usual table he thought i will have my answers soon big oysters pok was sitting alone and he waved a hand as mckenna came up sit down he said have a drink and laughed or are you on duty lieutenant mckenna contrived to ignore the joke and poured himself three fingers of johnnie walker black he downed the whole in one great swig as if he thought that this gesture would give him face with the chinesea commodity he felt was in short supply at the moment he did not care for big oysters poks attitude but he was hardly in a position to remark upon it no at least until he got what he wanted from the bastard mckenna bared his teeth soon he thought i will teach him a lesson i will teach him to respect an officer of the law what dyou have for me mckenna asked lieutenant big oysters pok said you remind me of the hare who could not wait to get across the highway languidly he reached out poured himself some whiskey he took up the glass and swirling the amber liquid around the curved side stared into its clear depths it bolted across just in time to be struck by an oncoming truck the offside tires flattened it into the baking tarmac he took a careful sip of the whiskey one must learn the art of patience patience my ass mckenna said he felt in a visea double vise really between formidable sung and whiteeye kao he felt as if he was being squeezed dry as if he had lost all initiative he was back again in the outback the fires burning sparking in great long sweeps like spectral writing across the inkblack skies as if from close at hand he heard again the chanting echoing through the scrubdusted wilderness i want answers he was shouting his great ham fist banging down on the table making the bottles and glassware rattle like the bone teeth the abos wore mckenna was shuddering answers he wiped sweat off his face big oysters pok sat back regarding the big gwai loh as one peers at a strange and not altogether pleasant creature in a zoo this man is not to be trusted he thought i must take care i have your answer he said good mckenna said bloody good he poured himself another drink and threw that one back as quickly as he had done the first lets have it i havent got all night feeling as if he were crouching in an evilsmelling cave with a dangerous bear big oysters pok said there is a problem at southasia bancorp what kind of problem their comptroller is no longer with them fired fled is how im told it went mckennas eyes were alight then there must be money involved big oysters pok nodded undoubtedly the only mystery is how much mckenna was rolling his glass around and around it matters a great deal how much the comptroller embezzled dont you think are you asking my opinion big oysters pok inquired mckenna looked up what oh yes of course the only way it would matter was if this man somehow managed to take out of the company sufficient funds to make it impossible for the bank to cover a serious run thats right mckenna assented any hint of fiduciary malfeasance to the depositors of southasia would create havoc only under the condition i just outlined the lid is on very tight mckenna mused that could be significant if theyve in fact got a shortage of cash the last thing they could afford would be to risk a run why does it matter to you what financial state southasia bancorp is in big oysters pok said thinking i know how much was embezzled but why should i tell him none of your bleeding business mate mckenna snapped but ill tell you what you can do get a line on how muchs missing and fast i am your errand boy now big oysters poks face was bland mckenna leaned forward across the table his face was flushed and his eyes were filled with the sparking fires that showered the outback listen to me mate the minute we began our little arrangement you put yourself in my pocket i can break you and haul you in any time i want to on any one of half a dozen complaints including conspiracy to bribe an officer of her majestys peace force you would only be implicating yourself big oysters pok pointed out mckenna barked out a laugh and who dyou think would believe you over me eh no judge in hong kong thats for sure use your head mate play along like a nice little doggie and do what youre told that way alls well that ends well okay ive done what you asked me to do big oysters pok said evenly we have our bargain that is as far as i care to go i am at risk already you little bastard youre already at risk with me dont you know that im the one to fear and no mistake fly buzzing against the film opaquing that staring eye rising and falling rising and falling im white mate have the power for a moment big oysters pok said nothing then he gave a curt nod and rose good night lieutenant he threw some money on the table and goodbye daniella and oleg maluta at the ballet watching sleeping beauty the splendor of crescendos of music of pas de deux of the principals swirling elegiac movements daniellas senses took in the overrich colors of costume the thickly textured rococo sets the melodramatic music she felt like a reveler at the end of a long night of banqueting idly she wondered why maluta had insisted that she go with him to the ballet for years he and his wife had been an almost permanent fixture in this giltedged box at the bolshoi then his wifes sudden enigmatic death had put an end to his attending his beloved ballet that was many years ago nowadays there were many people maluta could take to the bolshoi and gain political advantage sitting so close to him daniella thought about the current of his temper sometimes maluta seemed to be a dog in the early stages of rabies he shouted he screamed unreasoningly he was physically abusive at other times he was perfectly calm however he was at his most malicious when he was calm daniella of course had no desire to accompany maluta anywhere she would have much preferred to be with mikhail carelin his late meeting with genachev should have been over by now but she could not deny maluta anything she thought of the room where he kept securely locked the pictures of her and carelin making love the gun with which she had shot alexei the photos no doubt grainy because of the highspeed film that was used of her weeping by the side of the car in which alexeis still warm corpse lay slumped across the steering wheel more than anything she wanted those photos until she destroyed them their negatives and the man who had taken them she would feel utterly defiled maluta had in his possession not only the means of her political destruction but also a glimpse into her secret heart that he had the power to make her cry made her hate him with an intensity that was almost palpable and the absolute worst part was that she was utterly helpless against him though her desk at work was piled with reports and feasibility studies from several key departments she had spent the better part of the day digging deeper and deeper into her directorates computers heart in an attempt to find even the smallest chink in malutas armor in vain his school record indicated that he was at neargenius level by the age of fifteen he was a zealous marxist as were his parents malutas father had been an engineer working all his life in the service of mother russia malutas own rise within the soviet hierarchy had been swift and unerring if he had made any enemies they were no longer in power the only piece of tragedy in his life was the death of his wife twelve years ago in a raging fire that had consumed their dacha in zvenigorod in the thickly wooded hill country favored by many artists according to his dossier maluta had asked for and received a leave of absence and had almost singlehandedly rebuilt the dacha on the ashen foundation of the first one his form of mourning he must have loved her a great deal since he had never remarried in fact his file was devoid of reference to any liaison had he been celibate all that time daniella had wondered or was he too clever for the watchers who oversaw every person of power within russia now as the tchaikovsky music built to yet another crescendo daniella forced herself to relax that was the most difficult part about being in malutas company she never seemed to be able to relax she remembered uncle vadim saying to her once the male is the superior sex because he believes himself to be daniella thought that defined oleg maluta very well sverdlov square was alight when they emerged from the glitter of the bolshoi there seemed to be a sea of sables swirling like great dark tutus it was still snowing and the sound of the chains on car and truck tires was a clear rhythmic pulse echoed back by the walls of the edifices fronting the square in malutas thrumming chaika they took off into the night made pale by the snow and low clouds off which moscows lights reflected the privacy screen was up between the back seat and the driver in front maluta leaning forward rapped his knuckle against the steelreinforced glass the driver was completely unaware of the sound no one but us maluta said sinking back into the seat he was turned partway toward her daniella glanced out the window it appeared that they were headed for the moskva they were not going directly to her apartment she felt a slight queasiness in the pit of her stomach now she would find out why he had issued the command for her to come tonight how is the great love affair coming my sparrow she did not like his tone of voice if you had left me alone tonight i would have found out the substance of carelins crash meeting with genachev oh youll be home in plenty of time to ply him with the fur between your thighs maluta gave a quick laugh besides i enjoy the looks of envy and concern i receive when i am out with you at such an affair at the bolshoi my colleagues come not only to enjoy the arts but also to see who is in attendance with whom though they were both members of the elite politburo maluta had used the phrase my colleagues youve got a pessimists heart comrade general maluta sucked on his cigarette possibly that is because you are female will you faint at the sight of a mouse running across your ankles i wonder he laughed again and curled his hand into a fist i think not i have already seen you wield a gun you are an excellent shot but what will happen to you when you are tempered in the ultimate fire will you harden into crystal or will you break apart into ten thousand shards that is what i wish to know the chaika turned off the highway and slid to a stop ducking his head maluta got out he stood holding the door for her until she stood by his side together they went down a stone path at its foot it petered out with a series of broken pieces of slate the bank was fairly steep here and with the snow it was difficult to feel ones footing the lights of modern highrises glittered off the ice that before this last snow had begun to break up the moskva looked as dull and inert as lead nothing was moving along its length or its banks this is a favorite place of mine maluta said and then in case she might mistake this for a bit of confidence he added it is where i come for private conversations here i can be assured i will not be overheard or recorded he lifted his arms wide there is nowhere to hide i would see even a crouching figure the snow seemed pink in the haloed illumination coming off the city it drifted straight down in a night devoid of wind maluta brought them to a halt just a scant pace from the waterline it was just here that i almost died the end of his cigarette glowed an evil allknowing third eye i was fifteen and still foolhardy absolutely unmindful of rules he flicked ash into the darkness it was spring just about this time of the year i suppose the ice was thin treacherous my mother warned me i never listened maluta took a deep draft of the smoke let it out slowly he stood with his head slightly cocked as if he were listening for the soft grinding of the splitting ice his pose was arrogant his tone of voice angered her further but this was oleg maluta somber opinionated sharp to the point of cutting supremely arrogant and utterly brilliant again uncle vadims dictum rang in her inner ear the male is the superior sex because he believes himself to be daniella wanted desperately not to be intimidated by this particular male but she suspected that part of her inability to break free of her fear of him was the intensity of that desire i went skating that day maluta was saying i believe there was a wager and i was either too brave or too pigheaded to back down i went out on the ice i had enough experience to know that there was a problem right away it didnt feel right in patches it was dark which is a bad sign good thick ice is pale very pale i went down his arm lifted and the glowing end of his cigarette described a brief arc just there i heard the crack and thought someone had shot off a pistol along the river then i plunged into the river it was very cold and very dark he finished the cigarette and flipped the butt away now i take people here when their usefulness is at an end another form of termination typically he had not completed the story and daniella knew that he never would it was enough in his opinion for the listener to know that the lesson of long ago had been learned it was selfevident that he had not drowned in the moskva maluta laughed now but take heart my dear daniella alexandrova i have not marked you for termination of any kind you are much too special a creature you are rather to be treasured and shown off in public she watched him that was what you did with me tonight at the bolshoi why of course its all part of the game what game shadows broke along malutas thin face as if its angularity had the power to slice up light you were intelligent enough to work your way into the politburo up until this moment youve had it all your own way you have trapped menbright men even brilliant men in my opinionbecause you were able to exploit a common weakness in them because they wanted to possess youbecause you were clever enough to feed that desire in themthey provided you with all you needed to rise up the sluzhbas structure imagine they would have gone to the ends of the earth for you they sold their souls to you bowed their heads before you conferred to you all that made them powerful for this his hands pressed roughly against her breasts and this found the swelling mount at the apex of her thighs listening to this outpouring of the collective masculine ego this litany of distortion made daniella ill it was as if he believed that she merely had to open her legs to karpov and lantin and they had become children a red rage began to suffuse her and she could feel her rational mind closing down in just the same way that one feels cold at the extremities when one is severely depressed she stopped that and began to think do not she thought become what he has accused you of being a purely emotional creature devoid of intelligence or rational planning he has said that you think that you decide with your cunt will you now prove him right malutas eyes gleaming city lights on the moskva behind him a nocturnal animals glimmering the river seemed to breathe along with them its current a sigh or moan silent punctuation these were not men he continued relentlessly at least not by my standards you feel that you have arrived that you deserve a measure of respect even of equality nothing could be further from the truth now you must be shown your proper place you must in fact learn the humility of your station and of your sex you dared much when you insinuated yourself into this cynosure perhaps some comment on your audacity and foolishly admire it audacity is to be admired only in great men and in the noblest of animals and women fit into neither category she knew he was baiting her but she seemed incapable of ignoring him indeed not he lit another cigarette by the flare of the lighter daniella could see the hatred in his eyes and wondered at it by my lights you never should have been elevated into the politburo i fought against the nomination but too much was already being made of the intelligence you have gathered for the sluzhba so much for my minority opinion i pride myself on my pragmatism now that you are here i shall endeavor to make the most efficacious use of your talents im glad you think i have some when you open your legs men listen he spit out tobacco and perhaps something more something intangible that you are a slut is a given it is because you are that i can use you daniella had to restrain herself from leaping at his throat the flush of anger was so intense she felt her body break out into sweat maluta gave her a thin smile youd love to kill me wouldnt you daniella alexandrova youre good at that too ill give you that sex and death your metier eh he laughed again but i will have you by my side even when i become party president you are far too valuable an asset for me to squander away in any event i need you and as i have indicated i am a supremely pragmatic man which is why i am slightly disappointed in you tonight true you found a clever way to destroy shi zilin but your attempt on jake marocs life was a disaster this does not please me and are we any closer to penetrating kam sang perhaps i should punish you i have contemplated that all through sleeping beauty tchaikovskys music lends itself to such thoughts when daniella said nothing maluta took a step toward her she smelled his cologne the residue of tobacco the accumulation of the days sweat a miasma threatening to choke her you surprise me daniella alexandrova i expected you to raise your voice in your defense his head cocked to one side no well no matter no defense would really suffice he shrugged who knows perhaps you have already figured that out recovering herself somewhat she said what about carelin and reztsov do you think they will stand around and watch you gather power either of them would be next in line should genachev die is that so maluta said it was just what he had wanted her to say she is so predictable he thought termination is not the only way to remove obstacles from ones path what do you mean waiting for the fear to appear on her face and finding it he reached out and grabbed her by the front of her coat he swung her around with astonishing power slammed her back against a tree trunk look at yourself i have paralyzed you comrade general you the head of the first chief directorate of the sluzhba you know i can do the same with mikhail carelin do you think that reztsov is beyond my power abruptly his face darkened you are with me now remember that if you are stupid enough to disobey me you will be immediately picked up and charged with premeditated murder it will be lubyanka for you or a gulag for the rest of your life with a sound of disgust he let her go youve still to deliver to me jake marocs head as for the secrets to kam sang if you do not deliver them within ten days i will be forced to take other measures you are asking too much daniella said desperately these things will get done comrade general otherwise i shall be forced to order the immediate destruction of kam sang what her heart beat fast the destruction of a military installation inside chinas border was he insane oh come maluta said these matters are easily arranged pilot error an unfortunate mistake et cetera et cetera it is nothing we have not used successfully before he grinned at her and it will be done comrade general believe me one way or another kam sang will be rendered useless to the chinese in a moment she could hear the sound of his boots crunching through the crisp layer of snow as he climbed the bank of the moskva which lay thick and glowering heavy undercurrents sweeping reflected light downward into its murky depths from where he sat at the restaurants table huaishan han could see the hill of longevity rising up on one side he was at the best table at the ting le guan on the north shore of the lake beside which the summer palace was built the restaurant which specialized in fresh fish brought out of the lake each day was in fact within the precincts of the summer palace some fortyfive minutes from the heart of beijing huaishan hans ancient eyes traced the contours of the hill of longevity within whose shadow he now sat it is both ironic and fitting he thought that this hill should be manmade nothing goes on forever but still man in his egotistic way must strive to bring into his life the possibility that part of his essence at least will survive the decay of his corporeal body did the engineers who designed the hill of longevity huaishan han thought have this in mind when they began their project the pavilions within which ting le guan was housed had recently been restored their glazed tile roofs handsomely decorated columns and interior walls bringing back a semblance of the former splendor of the capitalat least that was how it appeared to huaishan han that was why he dined here often in the pavilion for listening to the birds sing that and because here he could be near the hill of longevity and contemplate its meanings for him though his villa was not far distant it had no view of the hill though ting le guan was well known for its food huaishan han certainly did not frequent it for that reason he had not been able to taste anything for so many years that he ate by color what appealed to his eyes he ordered and in some way unfathomable to his intimates enjoyed it was a bit early in the year still for the birds to be flitting through the trees lakeside but huaishan han did not mind a bit the quiet of the lake the security of being surrounded by the complex structure of the summer palace and all the memories it conjured up for him made his time here exceptional and there was always the hill it was his impression that shi zilinwhen he had been alivehad liked manmade hills but then shi zilin had been partial to yuan the carefully sculpted gardens of suzhou huaishan han supposed that was because shi zilin had been born in suzhou and therefore had harbored a particular affection for the gardens he himself found them confining overrefined abruptly he understood that it no longer mattered this inner debate about yuan was as dead as shi zilin that pleased han a great deal huaishan tong zhi yes shall we order huaishan han broke his gaze from the magnetic force of the hill he looked into the long thin face of jin kanzhe your stomach growls does it he grunted i no longer feel hungry just as i no longer require sleep i am long past the age where three meals or eight hours of sleep are a daily necessity when i close my eyes now i do not sleep i dream of battlefields and blood of the politics of change of the requisites of communism i hear the people of china calling me from the border of sleep in the blink of an eye i rest now out of age or of habit i do not know i am not sure that it matters he waved a thin hand as bony as a fish but go on then do not allow my speaking to interfere with the gratification of your stomach he grunted again no prawns for me tonight no just a couple of jiao zi thats all jin kanzhe did as he was bade ordering the deepfried dumplings for the old man a whole fish for himself and mao taia white liquorfor them both to drink the spirits came almost immediately and was poured for them then they were left alone jin kanzhe would have preferred to order more courses but he was careful not to do so in the old mans presence considering hans disability it would have been disrespectful tell me jin tong zhi huaishan han said did you dream last night jin kanzhe who by this time was used to the old mans seemingly bizarre questions said yes i did i dreamt of carp swimming in a clear brook they were golden and when the light struck their scales they shone like miniature suns hmmm huaishan han said contemplatively this is an auspicious omen the skin of his face seemed to be folded over again and again upon itself so that tissuethin layers lay in translucent creases that appeared to have no beginning and no end his hands and jowls were heavily marked by liver spots dark whorls upon his ricepaperlike skin the carp represents china huaishan han said or more accurately the people of china the golden people he nodded now his head bobbing on its stalklike neck it was a simple gesture made odd because of how the old man was forced to sit one misshapen shoulder higher than the other jin kanzhe had heard that huaishan han had broken his back many years ago it is good huaishan han mused for a bit his eyes opaquing as they often did when he was deep in thought tell me he said in his odd floating voice do you have children jin kanzhe sighed inwardly the old man not only knew that he did indeed have children but also how many their names and ages han had met them many times nevertheless jin kanzhe repeated like a sutra the list of his six children their names and ages huaishan han nodded as if hearing all this information for the first time then he said as he always did it is a blessing jin kanzhe to have children this was the only time the old man used jin kanzhes full name children are the most important aspect of life i myself tried for many years after my first wife died to procreate i took three other wives and once a mistress with translucent skin i have outlived them all but i have nothing to show for it none of them were able to conceive doctors a pox on all doctors he cried with more animation than he had shown all evening none of them were able to tell me a thing my women were fertile i was potent potent they told me until i was almost eighty yet i have no children you do not know what that is like jin kanzhe you cannot you are not cursed as i am were those incipient tears sparkling in the corners of his eyes jin kanzhe wondered it was entirely possible huaishan han was obsessed with the subject of children any other man would have rested now knowing that his enemy was dead but not huaishan han he wanted more he wanted to destroy shi zilins son as well his enemys child i do not think of children jin kanzhe said carefully my expertise lies in other areas like hong kong huaishan han grunted hong kong another curse that disgusting den of capitalist greed will be the downfall of china yet damn shi zilin to ten thousand flaming purgatories for his incursion into that place what evil gods possessed him to believe in such a quarter for the salvation of our country he shook his head sadly how misguided are people important people people whom other people listen to and rely upon for accurate information shi zilin believed himself a celestial guardian of china he laughed sourly what an idiotic notion what rubbish all this mystical claptrap is celestial guardian indeed he sent his family into hong kong and he wished to give them powerto transfer his vast power to them to an area outside of china whatever we do or say we will do in the future one thing is very clear hong kong will always be hong kong now and forever it is what the foreign devil made of it the corruption of it goes too deep we will waste our time in trying to change it better by far to cut ourselves off from it to forget that it exists the food had come some minutes ago but huaishan han appeared oblivious to it jin kanzhe longed to dig in but he could not begin without his elder and it would have been unforgivable of him to remind the older man of what was so obvious therefore jin kanzhe did nothing but listen that was all right he was in the presence of a power so strong that it was tangible jin wouldand indeed hadput up with much more than hunger for that why is jake shi still alive huaishan han demanded why isnt the shape of my revenge taking place colonel hu requires more time jin kanzhe said it is he says difficult to induce our plum to ripeness he watched han carefully in any case he told you quite clearly at the beginning that in dealing with the human mind rigid timetables were impossible to keep you said ive waited long enough huaishan han shouted you tell colonel hu that increasingly huaishan han was losing track of time and place he seemed to jin kanzhe to be living in another world altogether the old mans mind dwelt increasingly in his own inner landscape but if that were the case whence did his incalculable power stem he possessed riches beyond the imagination of any chinese jin kanzhe knew where did they come from this was the mans essential enigma that jin kanzhe wanted to solve our lizi is most precious i trust we are agreed on that at this huaishan han smiled our dangerous little plum yes our precious one he gave jin kanzhe a sharp look why should there be a question at this late date as to her disposition it has all been arranged jin kanzhe hid his exasperation there was something seriously wrong with huaishan han perhaps it was merely old age alzheimers disease was not uncommon or any one of a number of similar brain dysfunctions what would become of the old mans plans he wondered if he were not around to see to their implementation and what was his reward for keeping everything running smoothly huaishan han treated him as if he were an accountant he wanted he deservedhis share of the old mans wealth yes it is all arranged huaishan tong zhi he said easily but fortuitously shi zilin is dead do we really need to go on now what do you mean huaishan han said doesnt shi zilin live on and jin kanzhe thought it has finally happened he has lost his mind entirely doesnt shi zilin live on through his son shi jake huaishan hans wizened head was trembling his hand grasped at the tabletop seeking perhaps something tangible to crush jin kanzhe made no comment there was none appropriate huaishan han glowered at his companion i have waited in the shadows for so long jin tong zhi so long shi zilins power was such that i could not return to beijing for a very long time but he could not stop me from making inroads for myself with those ministers in power whom i singled out sometimes i used my own name at other times i employed a false one it did not matter other than it kept shi zilin from finding out about me now though you and others call me minister i am nothing of the sort i am more like a natural resource of china my power is still outside the government because of shi zilin his wretchedly long life has given me precious little time in which to work but now my time has come jin tong zhi now my star is in the ascendant all my preparations were for a purpose and that purpose is at hand with shi zilins departure from beijing ten months ago i was welcomed here by the friends i cultivated for years on end my private army is assembled it but awaits my final commands and now that i possess the means to wipe out shi zilins entire line now that he will be truly dead i will be able to give those commands slowly as if recovering from a dream huaishan han became aware that there was food before them he seemed surprised as if he had forgotten that they were in a restaurant or what such an establishment was for i am hungry he said and with that pronouncement he commenced to devour the dumplings after first having splashed them with a generous amount of soy and chili sauces nothing more was said until the food was gone this did not take huaishan han long when he was finished he put aside his chopsticks and set his gaze on the middle distance it was as if his companion had ceased to exist or had never been there at all the moment jin kanzhe was finished and tea had been brought however huaishan han said where did you serve your tour of duty while you were in the army jin tong zhi in cambodia mainly jin kanzhe said just like colonel hu ah hu huaishan han said he learned some dark tricks among the khmer rouge did he not his laugh was eerie there is a blackness about his spirit as if somewhere inside of him he has been singed i suppose it is so jin said thoughtfully colonel hu was wounded twice the first was not bad but the second time he was not so lucky a tracer bullet caught him in the gut the wound required extensive surgery they took a yard of his intestines out the pain will never really go away jin shrugged i suppose that is why he is so bitter about our offensive in cambodia his pain made him lose sight of chinas political imperative the russians were backing the north vietnamese the americans had taken up the french position of luring prince sihanouk with their siren songs chinas was an elementary decision from my point of view back the insurgents the khmer rouge their barbarism was wholly justified dont you think given the circumstances they were given the task of burning an entire nations politically and morally corrupt past and in its place creating a new regime a new politic a new society huaishan hans eyes contemplated his companion tell me jin tong zhi what was cambodia like jin kanzhe pushed his plate away there was nothing whatsoever left of the fish not even the bones have you ever been to hell he said for the first time since he knew him huaishan hans expression showed something other than his inner pain and the overriding thirst for revenge which despite his disclaimers to the contrary concerning the future of china appeared now to be his sole reason for living hell the old man said is where i have been residing for the past thirtyeight years gone gone where bliss asked to japan where where in japan that is his business bousehk three oaths said it is not for us to question the goings and comings of the great zhuan bliss heard something in his voice but she was too distracted to dwell on it why isnt he here she had just returned from the hospital where every test imaginable had been run through her brain the doctors having found nothing of a conclusive nature wanted her to remain several days longer to be subjected to further tests she had refused what is wrong with me she had asked them we dont know they had said nothing grasping sheets of computer printouts delineating the wave patterns of her brain we suggest that you stay here longer why so that we can find out find out what why all our tests show us nothing then there is something she had said there is nothing they had replied that we can find so far the eec it always came back to the eec the center of their concern certain spiky responses they said one or two giving the pattern a skew out of the norm then in your opinion there is a problem not that we know of so far if you would submit to several more she got out of there fed up with their enigmatic replies they were like ancient greek oracles they opined and said nothing left you to manufacture your own fears in private three separate crews were hard at work repairing her fathers junk three oaths had borrowed a junk from his vast fleet and mooring it near the first one in aberdeen harbor had installed himself and his family on the unfamiliar vessel this was where he had brought bliss when he had taken her home from the hospital he had said nothing to her about jake or his whereabouts until they were aboard though she had queried him several times in the hospital three oaths had managed to avoid any answer she had enough worries without adding to them where in japan she repeated that i do not know bousehk he shrugged tokyo most likely that is where his yakuza friend is neh mikio komoto yes yakuza murdered the jian he has gone to find out why for the first time bliss became aware of the extraordinary tension emanating from her father that is normal she thought shi zilin was everything to him she had fought not to think about the jian during those moments in the hospital when she had been lucid most of the time she had slept drugged and insensate at other times it seemed as if she was drifting through clouds of dreamstuff so tangible she wanted to reach out and feel them she dreamt of light and sensation she dreamt of floating of flying and of spheres more vast than her imagining spheres which spun in stately time within the bosom of a spangled blackness deep and wide often she would awake certain that one of the spheresthe closest to herhad about its terrain a disturbingly familiar cast then with a start so palpable it made her shudder the familiarity was brought into focus the face of shi zilin just before she placed the pillow over it compulsively then she would race away from the image engaging the doctors or if he was available her father in conversation speaking about anything at all so long as it kept her away from the image but once she dreamt of the image and in that moment became aware of the expression on the jians face as it was occluded by the white cloud of the pillow his eyes were closed of that she was certain yet she was just as sure that he was watching her how was that possible she thought of dahei the great darkness where all that was incorporeal about man resided she wondered if buddha would ever forgive her for what she had done but shi zilin had asked it of her as a favor she was saving him from assassins bullets now for the first time since the incident bliss wondered how the jian knew that they were coming knew even before the wallawalla bumped against the junks hull if he knew she thought now why didnt he act to save himself surely he had time to get us both off the junk bousehk heard three oathss voice as if from a great distance you did not answer my question i did not hear your question father she thought are you all right she opened her mouth to answer him though indeed she did not know the answer instead she was overcome the strange emotion inside her that had been stirring like a snake in spring emerging from slothful hibernation gyred upward and in its ascendancy it transported her once again she was stretched over the skin of the heaving south china sea as she had been when she had been bent over the dying form of shi zilin she saw the black bulk of the tankers newly from the strait of malacca full of flaming dark oil she heard the sea erns calling saw heir great flecked bodies dipping and gliding on the air currents above her below she heard the deep drawnout symphony reverberating through the ocean current carried for miles on end the whale schools communicated in an ancient arcane song elemental and powerful their speech filled her up as if she had been an empty vessel waiting upon the bosom of the sea and in their cries was recognition just a flash a whitehot instant of revelation that shook her to her core it froze her consciousness even while it galvanized the inner heart of her mind she saw and felt it once the source of this strange emotion she felt her qi linked and she thought all gods bear witness this cannot be happening i must be losing my mind look like a mi tuo fo seen a ghost felt herself being shaken and at last her eyes focused on her fathers concerned face by the celestial blue dragon he said youve gone as white as milk are you ill buddha she thought buddha protect me from this madness im not she put her hand to her forehead im not feeling at all well in fact she stood on wobbly legs will you excuse me she clutched at the railing her body bent over she tried to vomit and could not bousehk she wanted to stop this feeling of being in two places at once the south china sea beckoned with all its thrumming animal sounds what is happening to me she thought wildly she clutched at her head as her qi plunged downward into the depths of the water listening to the atonal symphony listening art is truth fo saan had said to jake art takes nothinga blank page a white canvasand makes of it something affecting art can only be defined by the emotion it engenders in the viewer it does not presuppose it does not contend like the great seas and rivers of the world art is one of the lords of the ravines its power comes from keeping low it was fo saan who trained jake in the ways of the mind and of the body it was fo saan who unbeknownst to jake had been sent by shi zilin to do just that when jake was just a boy of seven fo saan in his own way had been a part of the yuhnhyun the inner circle he had also been responsible for training jakes childhood playmate bliss it had been fo saan who had taught jake about cham hai sinking in and its ultimate phase bamahk there will come a time fo saan had said to his young pupil when you will find yourself contending against shadows perhaps you will know your enemy perhaps not in any event his intention will be hidden from you you will strike out here there but you will strike nothing only shadows then you must heed my words and seek to become one with the lords of the ravines you too must keep low this was what was in jakes mind when he told three oaths tsun that he was going to japan of course his anxiety for the safety of mikio komoto was a major factor but jake was acutely aware that the yuhnhyun was under attack he did not know who his enemies were or what their ultimate goal was the time that fo saan had foreseen for him had at last come and by taking himself away from hong kong from the center of the arena of contention he was keeping low hopefully then he would gather to him the power of the lords of the ravines fo saans bright button eyes dominated jakes dream as he slept on the flight out of kai tak airport he had slept fitfully for weeks and not at all since his fathers death and his fight with the dantai though effecting no permanent damage had taken a lot out of him both physically and emotionally the thought that a yakuza clan was involved in his fathers assassination made no sense it chilled him to the bone for his connection with the japanese underworld was directly through mikio had the raid signaled a sinister turn of events in the yakuza war was mikio already dead the victim of a rivals katana fo saan you are no longer a child no longer safe he takes jake by the hand and leads him into the night the skies are pellucid so that the stars seem a shower of sparks raining down upon the earth the bowl of the heavens is alight and afoot where are we jake asks upon the mountain where are we going up they walk for a very long time above their heads the blazing stars wheel in their predetermined arc an owl hoots and flapping its powerful wings takes flight its predatory head filled with enormous orange eyes scans the darkness before the bird plunges downward to the earth the man and the boy both hear the sharp crunch of tiny bones breaking with an almost suprareal clarity shan says fo saan from shan do the dieh loong the earth dragons greatest of all the species get their power from this mountain jake asks from any mountain ask the winds and the water fo saan says feng shui feng shui yes the art of geomancy of reading the magical portents from earth air fire water and metal the five cardinal elements fo saan back bent against the incline seems tireless though the way is long and at times arduous there is qi in the earth he says just as there is qi in all of us qi is a great spiral sometimes it is inhaled toward the center of the earth at other times it is exhaled upward into the valleys rivers streams and shan the mountains it is in these places that man seeks to live it is near to dawn by the time they reach the summit the stars are visibly closer but already beginning to dim in the east above the bowl of night is still dominant lie down fo saan says jake does as he is told close your eyes he does so in order for you to fend off death fo saan continues you must generate sufficient power to carry out the maneuvers you have been learning practice is one thing the killing ground quite another speed dexterity flexibility in body and thought is vital if you are to survive your first real encounter in the killing ground force energy power qi jake feels rather then hears the movement but he does not open his eyes you are no longer a child no longer a baby is there hidden significance in fo saans repeated words jake does not know you must begin all over again you must learn the bare essentials of life if you are to live it henceforth in this manner now jake gasps but does not cry out there is a weight on his chest of such proportions that he is certain it will crush him his eyelids flutter and fo saan says do not open your eyes jake obeys i cannot breathe jake says in a strained voice i will die there is a stone on your chest fo saan says a great heavy stone perhaps it is a scale from dieh loong that has been shed at the end of winter i cannot breathe then you must learn to breathe all over again fo saan says and jake understands the meaning of his mentors reiterated words you are no longer a child you are no longer a baby there is no oxygen left within him weight presses down upon him as if it were the shan itself atop his chest you must begin all over again you will ask fo saan says why do you not teach me to breathe all over again in tranquil surroundings with a pleasant breeze ruffling my cheek and an infinite amount of time in which to perfect my learning the voice was closer to jakes ear an insect buzzing near the gently curved shell my answer is that this is another form of learning we speak here of instinct when you are attacked instinct dictates that you hold your breath your muscles tighten qi ceases its flow then you will die instead you must learn to breathe under attack to keep your muscles supple the qi flowing you are under attack now you must breathe the voice subsides in the night there is a red rim around jakes eyelids he sees this aurora and wonders what is causing it his heart hammers in his chest his rib cage strains beneath the enormous weight his pulse thunders in his ears i will die he thinks then his body or his mindhe does not know whichmoves it comes to a clear space an otherworldly space here he feels no pain but rather the rippling of some gleaming constant flow is it qi as fo saan has suggested jake concentrates on this one spot a patch of silver moonlight pouring into the midst of a dense and stifling forest he moves within this glade he moves upward and as he does so he gathers power his muscles ripple and contract in unison as if galvanized by one momentous surge of inner energy upward he thrusts off comes the weight he hears the thunk of the stone he breathes and in his ear fo saan whispers jeuihjahp lihkleung you have gathered together the power you have learned to breathy all over again jake opens his eyes dawnlight shimmers the horizon illuminating at last the mountain upon whose back he has labored tony simbal at the dea computer getting the lowdown on encarnacion a town in southeast paraguay it was where threnody had told him peter curran had bought it simbal wasnt getting the usual stuffpopulation typography agriculture climate and the like he could have used the encyclopaedia britannica for that the dea files were gravid with information on that quadrant of the world from on with good reason that was when the futures of certain south american countries began to changeincluding paraguays certain leaders abruptly became stronger their private armies larger and better equipped enormous sums of money had been infused into these countries in an astonishingly short period of time and further within the space of five years new industries had sprung up and others were burgeoning all these industries were clandestine and at least in the majority of the world illegal the smartest and most powerful of the nazis who had made it out of germany and europe evading both the burning of berlin and the subsequent nuremburg war crimes tribunals had set themselves up for life deep within the emerald jungles of south america paraguay was high on the dea computer file list of countries whose regimes had aided and abetted the fleeing criminals for a price of course a price exacted that would ensure their own security among a populace stricken with intense poverty disease and educational ignorance encarnacion simbal learned had been nothing more than a backward town before the nazis had come they had terraformed nearly a continent now the diqui had begun to take over there why no one knew it was what apparently curran had been tracking down who was in encarnacion when peter curran was simbal said out loud i dont know monica said softly from a point just behind him she was peering over his shoulder the terminal screen was brightly lighted pulsing with information anyone from dea not that i know of lets bring that up and check whats the file name travel folder simbal found it coordinating the dates during which curran had been in paraguay drew blank okay she said what next he smelled the lemony tang of her soap mixed with the hint of perfume she used a stray strand of her hair brushed his cheek he felt her warmth vacations simbal said and she gave him the file name he called it up and went down the list there were six names none of their itineraries precisely coincided with the dates and in any case all were required to file destinations and local phone numbers with threnodys office monica pulled these there had been occasion to call three of them during the course of their vacations and they had indeed been where they had logged in three others were still out and had not been contacted none were anywhere near south america let alone paraguay but then simbal did not expect anyone to broadcast that fact do you know what youre looking for monica asked him just following my nose simbal said dialing the first number he put monica on and she made up a story about why she had to call it was late everyone was in bed just where they said they would be so much for vacationers monica said satisfied how powerful is this baby simbal patted the side of the monitor plenty why are you networked sure but it depends on the agency and within that agency on how the material is classified how about fbi cia snits monica put the flat of her hand over the keyboard whoa she said before i possibly incriminate myself and this agency i think youd better tell me what you have in mind hi l i cant then this is as far as we go together she reached to shut down the terminal and simbal took her hand monica no soft soap tony this is getting creepy i agreed to let you in here its strictly against the rules of the house max knows all about it really well hes said nothing to me about it do you want to find out who had peter curran killed monica gave a little shudder i already know that the diqui possibly meaning meaning i want to know what the hell the diqui is doing in encarnacion a place where they have no right to be because of the nazis because of the nazis there was silence for a time the twilit offices were still around them the air was off and it was stuffy what do you think happened to peter monica said after a time he ran afoul of someone simbal said but im not convinced that it was the diqui who then would you let me find out monica hesitated for just a moment then she said which agency drew blank with the fbi and the cia both but the cias strategic narcotics teamthe people simbal called snitshad their own computer network i think id better take over monica said displacing him in the console chair the snit files are like minefields theyre so paranoid over there the calling up of certain files triggers an internal alert any way to get around it what are we looking for same thing simbal said assignments vacations monicas fingers flew over the keyboard calling up and putting back files nothing that fits she said in either category so i see simbal said morosely she was just about to pull out of the snit files entirely when she caught an electronic asterisk whats that i dont know she said lets follow it a moment later the answer swam up onto the screen a leave of absence simbal said jesus christ the dates are right monica said the leave began two days after peter left for paraguay and hes not back yet you know this guy edward martin bennett zip personnel monica complied switching files ooops she said this ones mined all right ill have to find a way around it and did in twelve minutes okay she announced heres their scoop on bennett the screen began the scroll of data bennett edward martin born duluth minnesota parents skip that simbal said educated sindon grammar school fitzsimmons high school transferred to varley prep in valley forge pennsylvania ba ms from yale university class of member of swim lacrosse soccer teams phi beta kappa varsity soccer captain member hellfire club stop it right there simbal said feeling excitement growing in him this guy and peter were at yale together coincidence also the hellfire club is that significant yeah simbal said remembering the signet ring threnody said had been found it just may be monica withdrew from the snit files and they switched over to the airline schedules pick it up two days after peter left monica reviewed the carriers this could take some time nope simbal said his forefinger stabbing at the screen here it is pan am flight departing am jfk arriving pm bennett edward martin mexico city simbal said monicas fingers continued to work the keyboard theres no connecting flight to paraguay but there is a flight to buenos aires she hummed a little his names not on the passenger manifest im not surprised i wouldnt advertise if i was going that way either found his name again monica said simbals excitement was becoming contagious heres the flight plan mexico cityhe left there a week after we were notified of peters death he flew to san francisco after a days layover he flew out to miami he still there monica hit the keyboard well she said he hasnt flown out after they had shut down and left the offices she said i wish you could come back with me tonight he helped her on with her coat your family comes first he said in truth he was thinking about other things like edward martin bennett in miami you havent seen your cousin in what a year just about monica hesitated at the doorway her eyes when they looked into his shadowed face were luminous youre going to miami arent you he said nothing and she followed him out locking up behind them the night was unseasonably warm from where they stood they could see the washington monument lit up cool white majestic dont lie to me tony not again he nodded im going is bennett the one i wont know until i get there why dont you let someone else do it this time simbal was quiet and monica nodded then she quickly turned away and went down the marble steps and got into her mazda she took off simbal watched her go a little sadly he would have liked to spend his last night in washington wrapped in her warmth then he remembered that she had forgotten to supply him with the new entry code for the dea computer hed need that to run deep background on edward martin bennett on his own he ran down the steps shouting for her but she was too far away he ran to his saab turned the ignition and set off after her through nighttime washington they went a glittery world filled with public monuments parks pools ponds fountains into georgetown and suddenly simbal felt a chill seeping into him monica lived in alexandria which lay in the opposite direction she had made a point of telling him that her cousin jill was flying in from san diego that evening and would be spending a couple of nights at monicas yet she turned into r street and simbal continuing after her with his headlights doused thought what the hell he stopped the saab down the block and across the street watched with mounting dread as she went up the steps and rang the bell watched his old friend max threnody come to the door and usher her in tony simbal sitting in darkness listening to the saabs cooling fan quiet the powerful turbocharged engine felt an odd queasy sensation a knowledge of being betrayed a sense that home was no longer secure bluestone was a tall angular man with ruddy cheeks a decidedly roman nose a wide straight brow beneath which blue eyes peered out at the world with a great deal of inquisitiveness he wore savile row suits spurning the efforts of even the best of the hong kong tailors his shirts were handmade by turnbull and asser his shoes handlasted by church of england it was sir johns opinion that one could not pay too much to be dressed smartly and above all correctly and how is my little flower bluestone said i have something for you i know he said and smiled it is why i derive so much pleasure from having lunch with you lunch was my idea she said correcting him he frowned and an odd one too i might add he spread his hands this is a very public place they were sitting in the central district branch of princess garden high up overlooking the pedestrian walkway above chater road oh yes she agreed very very public there is i expect a good reason for this she looked smashing every inch a model or television star all heads turnedmale and femalewhen she came into the restaurant she wore a black shantung silk skirt and jacket beneath which peeped out an oyster white camisole edged with delicate open embroidery her only jewelry was a massive emerald ring he knew where that came from she had the ability to use western makeup to bring out the exoticism of her eastern face how many women he knew would kill to possess that talent prosit he said lifting his glass das vidanya she said in a ludicrous russian accent he scowled dont be idiotic idiotic neon chow said i am not idiotic three oaths tsun knows who you are they all know jake sawyer all of them bluestone put his glass down very carefully what precisely do you mean they know who i am they know that you are the kgbs top asian operative neon chow said she was openly enjoying his consternation dont look so sour she said sipping at her drink they want me to spy on you for them thats why i asked you to lunch when you came by the governors office yesterday bluestone watched her face his mind working furiously and in a moment he had worked it out perhaps this wasnt the disaster it had at first seemed to be christ he said three oaths tsun wants you to keep tabs on me thats right neon chow said the waiter arrived and they ordered when he had departed bluestone said this may be better than ever obviously they want to keep me in place a known enemy is far better than an unknown one and i have already deceived them concerning the southasia scheme oh yes neon chow agreed as i reported to you they suspect that you are behind teck yaus embezzlement thats all right he said still working out the refinements of his plan and because of that suspicion he thought gleefully they also believe that the scheme to embezzle funds from southasia is the full extent of my plan to defeat them he thought a moment listen to me i have a way to overcome their discovery of my identity if i can deceive them by running you back at them i may have everything i need to destroy interasia trading and all who back her but theres more neon chow said have you found out whos behind shi zilins murder forget about that she said quickly the old man was killed by a bunch of yakuza rivals of jakes yakuza friend i forget his name she put her empty glass aside what i have for you is far more important when three oaths took me out for my birthday i got him talking about the yuhnhyun their purpose is somehow to link certain tai pan here with interests in mainland china bluestone seemed stunned what are you saying hong kong and beijing would be in some kind of collusion yes impossible even when china takes full control of hong kong in the business interests here will fight the changeover to communism with every breath according to my information neon chow said there wont be a changeover to communism there will instead be one china one political system one economic system and that system will most assuredly not be communism bluestone already knew that but one was always safest confirming one source with another totally independent one this was a lesson daniella vorkuta had taught him and it had proved invaluable more than once espionage bluestone thought staring hard at neon chow was not a game for amateurs only the seasoned professionals survived taken completely out of time qi lin floated colonel hu had learned his trade well he had been warned by jin kanzhe how tough this subjects mind would be her mind and her will there was no doubt that she had exceptional qi one neededto be successful at this peculiar and twisted trade of mind sculptingto be fully aware of the subjects qi before one employed any technique qi could change everything colonel hu had observed this during his time in cambodia the khmer rouge whom he had aided had been rather crude in their mindsculpting techniques one had difficulty dealing with them and early on colonel hu had ceased to give them advice one could not have a dialogue with fanatics one merely spoke at them either they listened or they didnt during his time in cambodia colonel hu had learned to despise the khmer rouge learn from them he did for sometimes their techniques were wholly effective but he hated every minute in that bloodfilled land if the truth be known he had been terrified of the khmer rouge they were as unthinking as robots they had been programmed as effectively as their pitiable subjects colonel hu had of course confronted many fanatics in his time china itself was well known for its ideological fanaticism but none was on a level with those he found in cambodia in his mind their animalistic barbarism was forever linked with the stench of burning flesh and scorched hair there was not an hour he spent in cambodia when his nostrils were not clogged with the smell after a time he learned to live with it as he had learned to live among the vicious primitives it was also true that colonel hu drank to blot out the emotions that these dread people had engendered in him when he at last returned from his tour of duty in cambodia he had knelt down when no one was watching and pressed his lips lovingly into the soil of his native china he drank to forget but he could not forget the terror crept through even the most serious drunk only when he passed out near to dawn was his mind washed clean for a few hours but when he awoke the memories rushed back at him again like howling demons until he wished only to rip his own brain apart instead he steeled himself and got on with his job and now his job was brainwashing qi lin this was no easy task in fact she presented a number of unique and at first baffling problems that was quite all right with colonel hu the more difficult the subject the better he liked it because the deeper his mind was occupied work at least kept the hounds inside his head at bay the nights were what colonel hu dreaded most now his men were asleep and huaishan han had departed having spent all day with hu and his special subject hu was alone face to face with the chill solitary night filled as it always was with the scrabbling of nocturnal creatures the wind rustling down the trees like faraway voices voices of the dying of the damned it was then that colonel hu reached for the bottle at times he would not even bother with a glass it made the river of surcease flow too slowly on this night consumed by gusty winds that rattled sand from the gobi against the windows colonel hu lay in a semitorpor he had not dared to touch liquor while old crookedbacked huaishan han was here but huaishan han had left hours ago and the night grew long colonel hu drank one hand now grasped the neck of a nearly empty bottle of liquor with the kind of desperation only a drowning man summons up tiny droplets of sweat glistened like sad diamonds in his brushcut hair his eyes were filmy with the tread of ghosts marching in an endless parade through the interstices of his skull his uniform shirt was open at the neck and deep crescents of sweat showed beneath each arm and down the front where the starched fabric clung to his fluttering chest losing all shape his feet were bare he seemed to feel the squelch of that mixture of mud blood and offal peculiar to ravaged cambodia it had seemed to him that there was no soil left in the country this putrid compound slid across the valleys fields and lakesides like the effluvia of some monstrous volcano colonel hu started and shuddered hiccuping he said something indecipherable even to himself then he looked up qi lin was framed in the doorway there was nothing but utter blackness behind her and this stygian color seemed to dwarf her completely lending her the appearance of a street waif thin and illfed living from moment to moment is huaishan han gone already what are you doing here colonel hu asked with slightly slurred diction my sleep was filled with qi lins quavery voice trailed off she seemed so young so with what with life teeming life colonel hu thought of his own sleep and what it was like without the utter oblivion alcohol provided he shuddered again and swallowed he raised his hand discovered the bottle still in it and waved the thing at her come in there were guards all around the perimeter of the encampment but none at her doorstep that was not considered sound psychological practice sit down qi lin did as she was told perching herself on a bambooandcanvas ottoman she looked like a bird thin and frail seeming peering at him with those huge dark enigmatic eyes they were odd eyes they had held colonel hus attention from the moment he first saw her they were bright with intelligence glossy with a more elemental quality he could not name they were chinese eyes to be sure but they were also something else there was a western aspect to them as if the epicanthic folds were not complete or had been subtly altered in the formless genetic state colonel hu knew where that came from her eyes held him now their intensity burning through the deadening liquor like hot sunlight through a morning haze tell me about your dreams colonel hu said i was in a city qi lin said obediently it was big big as a hive it was built on a hill on many hills so that the streets were never flat never ever they rose and fell like the ocean tides it was strange in what way was it strange i felt perfectly at home there qi lin said with a bit of wonder in her voice i dont see how thats possible i know the jungle i know that is where i have been where i feel at home you have told me that time and again it is true then the city the city is a dream but it felt so real i dreamt in such detail the streets the houses shops even the people what people colonel hu was sitting up straighter he ran a hand through his hair wiped the wetness away on his trouser leg i dont know but you said you dreamt in such detail i did then describe the people i cant you are lying to me qi lin gasped and her eyes were filled with fear such a pity colonel hu thought because all the gloss went out of them they were dulled to opacity and then they became merely eyes as everyone had eyes nothing special at all no then tell me i cant tell me tell me colonel hu became aware that he was shouting he had hold of her and was shaking her violently he felt a constriction in his throat a rage suffusing him as the choir of the damned sang its funereal dirge in his inner ear qi lin was sobbing a tender shoot trembling before the force of a gale oh buddha she gasped buddha protect me colonel hus rage doubled and he shook her maniacally why do you invoke the name of buddha here that is forbidden strictly forbidden his rage fell upon her like cruel sleet blinding her making her choke and pant for breath she felt gripped by forces beyond her control forces which threatened to rip aside the fabric of this life to which she had become acclimated that would mean a return to the painthe awful ringing echoing reverberating pain behind which lurked the nothingness that froze her marrow thus she struggled hurling herself against him so that her tears streaked his cheeks running into his eyes salt droplets clinging to his lips trembling just before he swallowed them colonel hu felt her against him and he felt warmth her tremors went through him it was as if he was feeling her soul shaking itself apart and without even thinking he gathered her into him just as two animals in the wildenemies evenwill seek one another out and share in bodily warmth in order to survive the bitter cold of natures crudest months so colonel hu acted out of instinct it was as much for his own survival as it was for hers though he might not yet understand that all he was aware of was the suffering little one he murmured little one hearing her tiny whimpers and within them the anguished cries of the multitudes who had been mutilated in the name of a blasted nihilistic ideology without heart or soul those same multitudes through whom he had tramped their muck seeping into his boots squelching between his toes he felt her curling up against him her sobs slackening her tears drying and with them the terror in her soul warmth began to suffuse him and he wondered at it because it was a warmth from an outside source colonel hu was not a celibate he took his pleasure from a variety of women but all of them had thighs like alabaster cool and ungiving their jade gates were like marble smooth drawing from him his hot seed during the clouds and the rain but nothing more now it seemed to him as if he had the sun in his lap instead of this small frail woman who had appeared to him tonight as a girl and gradually it dawned on him that the heat had worked a specific source in him his loins were burning up he was as stiff as stone qi lin moved on him and he groaned unplanned and unwanted worse unthinkable nevertheless colonel hus sacred member arched upward and where it encountered the heat between qi lins thighs the sensation was exquisite colonel hu did not wish to be aroused but he did not want an end to this lifegiving warmth thus he hugged qi lin to him as she hugged him surrounding her with his arms and being thus surrounded himself he told himself that he did not desire her that he could not in fact desire her her jade gate was as forbidden to him as invoking the name of buddha was for her he had been warned in no uncertain terms in qianmen jin kanzhe had said zheige lizi hai mei shu ne the plum is not yet ripe but that doesnt mean that she isnt dangerous on the contrary she is exceptionally deadly such warmth could never emanate from death colonel hu decided in his mind along with the singing chorus of the dead all he wanted was to hold her other parts of him felt differently he was warring with himself and had not qi lin herself become an active factor he did not know what the outcome would have been that was all made academic however because she reached inward and gently grasped the head of his sacred member the touch was so electric that for a moment colonel hu felt robbed of all breath volition went as well and he surrendered to her touch in that moment he heard the rain begin to lash itself against the tiny windowpanes like an angry dragons tail colonel hu felt the buttons at his fly being opened one after another each one brought him closer to the heat he reached up and began to open the buttons on qi lins blouse it was rough cotton as were her drawstring trousers not prison garbthat too would have been unsound psychological practice he bared her firm ripe breasts at the same time that she wrapped her hand around his naked member he shuddered and drew her breasts against his mouth his lips opened to encompass the point of first one then the other qi lin licking her palm with her tongue used the moisture to aid her ministrations a storm tossed colonel hu as the storm outside bowed the tall trees lashed at the groundcover and the buildings of the encampment colonel hu wanted with such desperation to touch her bare thighs that his fingers shook as they attempted to unknot the drawstrings in the end qi lin was obliged to help him she slipped the trousers off without putting her feet to the floor she was partly nude since her blouse though open was still on and this inflamed colonel hu even more his sacred member was trembling as much as his hands he caressed her thighs and found them warm not cool as alabaster the flesh was smooth and soft beneath his callused fingers the backs of his hands brushed against the thick thatch of hair and he inhaled quickly qi lin turning her palm in a circular motion across the head of his sacred member guided him to the portals of her jade gate she left him there the bloated tip throbbing against her colonel hu groaned in anticipation he felt the unutterable softness of her brushing against his sensitive flesh and he felt the almost painful drawing up of his sacred sac he felt her slim arms come up over his shoulders caressing his hairless skin her moist lips came forward burying themselves in the side of his neck so that he felt little electric thrills race downward into his crotch all sensation was gathered there he felt comfortably bottom heavy as blood flowed into his engorged penis fingers in his ears and he could stand it no longer with a deep drawnout groan he heaved his hips upward slicing through the fluttering portals at that instant qi lins grip became sharply painful one hand was on either side of his head her left elbow braced against his face using the heel of her right hand as pressure and her left elbow as fulcrum qi lin jerked his head violently to the left the motion should have been enough to break his neck she performed the maneuver quite correctly just as she had been taught in the gong loufu it was colonel hus amorous thrust that had changed all the vectors she heard a sharp crack to be sure but this was followed by his explosive string of expletives and her insides turned to water colonel hu felt a singing in his ears his vision was blurred and there was pain somewhere along his nervous system he was in a state of semishock and his physical reactions at least were sluggish because of the pooling of blood in his lower belly and thighs yet his mind knew instantly what had occurred and jin kanzhes words bubbled up to him again she is exceptionally deadly his hands were pinioned by her lithe thighs and he tried to free them pain lanced at him canting his head at an angle the chorus of the damned bleated shrilly in his head like lambs to the slaughter his mind was filled with the yellow bilious skies of cambodia stained by napalm rent by bombs and artillery fire she had hurt him badly twice he might have been killed during his tour of duty but was spared his joss was good he was not going to die now bunching his muscles mightily he freed one hand and slashed it across her chest she cried out but his extremity felt as heavy and unresponding as a sack of cement his vision had cleared somewhat but there were still inconstant patches of blurriness that made him sick and dizzy with vertigo oddly insanely he was still inside her poking and prodding as he fought at her the pain had not withered him and he could not understand that he punched her in the stomach but he lacked any real momentum because they were at such close quarters he freed his other hand and hit cruelly at her breast then he felt her arms come around his head and he knew that she was going to try it again he fought her with all the strength he had left in him the trouble was that he was seated and thus much of his superior strength was negated too she had damaged a number of nerve networks in her first attack colonel hu used his spatulate thumb digging into the soft flesh at her collarbone he had gone for her carotid but she had twisted deflecting him now she had hold of his head and was applying pressure he gasped and swallowed almost bit his tongue in two he choked and coughed tasting the salty sweet taste of his own blood he dug inward farther and felt a bone snap she cried out and jammed her elbow into his eye blinding him dizzied colonel hu nevertheless raised his hand upward feeling the slack place she had left open when she had retaliated felt her neck and elation soared within him the carotid jammed his thumb inward in a vicious strike and felt the pressure come off his head for an instant then blinding pain hit him between his thighs pain that shot upward turning his stomach inside out clamping his heart between iron fists his thumb came away and qi lin got the placement right and jammed the heel of her right hand against the side of his head snap like thunder and colonel hu arched up as if struck by lightning qi lin let go and crawled off him she kept her eyes on him as she picked up her trousers backing away across the room she put them on buttoned her blouse wincing with the pain of the small bone he had broken outside the night was alive with rain silvery and flickering in the lights she knew where he kept his gun and taking it checked it for ammunition it was fully loaded she jammed it into the waistband of her trousers and grabbing up his military jacket slung it around her shoulders then she went out into the unquiet night colonel hu alone again fell from his ungainly position in the chair the fall revived him somewhat his head was at an unnatural angle he could hear a sound akin to a gushing water faucet and wondered at it he could not stand nor could he sit instead he crawled it took him a long time to reach the open door he saw only intermittently in between like a landscape quickly revealed in lightning bursts he saw the khmer rouge camp that had been his home for nearly two years he heard voices shouting harsh guttural the growling of hungry wolves he heard the flowering of the bombs bringing with them the pink flecks of flesh and slimy organs that stuck to ones face and clothes like glue saw also the bowed backs and exposed napes of necks so obscenely vulnerable of those found wanting by angka the mysterious khmer rouge hierarchical organization that seemed forever shrouded in shadowy rumor the pistol shots rhythmic and rapid as those deemed antithetical to angka were coldly executed a merciful death he had been informed by a grinning monkey of a lieutenant in the old days he said laughing when we were still struggling for power and did not yet have your benevolent backing we could not afford to waste a bullet we used clubs to beat them to death he had spat that was the better way i think it developed fortitude among our own soldiers out in the storm colonel hu was dying he was only dimly aware of his surroundings consciousness was turned on and off in bright painfilled bursts within one of these machinegunfire episodes of lucidity colonel hu realized that the sound of the gushing faucet that was following him was emanating from inside himself his lungs felt heavy and full it was a labor merely to take a breath he curled up on the ground the rain beat down on him and the mud crept through his toes that was his last memory the squelching of the muck the groundup paste of humanity feeding upon itself combining with the earth in time the wailing of the damned disappeared altogether memory in a mist an end to their hideous strength it took jake almost three hours to get into the heart of tokyo from narita airport it was nothing special just modernday japan the superhighways were clogged with bumpertobumper traffic from start to finish and when he was at last dropped off at the okura he was as exhausted as if he had taken yet another plane ride to a different time zone while the porter was opening his bags for him jake threw all the papers he had picked up at narita onto the bed there wasnt one whose front page wasnt filled with news of the yakuza wars the police were working around the clock but as was usual in a country where violent crime was by and large not a way of life they were having minimal success the special antiyakuza task force had been beefed up at the direct urging of prime minister nakasone some arrests had been made the latest one as recently as early this morningbut the raid had netted only underlings the yakuza oyabun remained at large and in asahi shimbun at least there was a blistering editorial aimed at the incompetence of the police of mikio komoto there was no mention whatsoever though his clan was often cited in the detailing of the war was that good news or bad jake was unable to read the portents alone in the room he thought of bliss her voice was only a phone call away yet he made no move for the receiver he did not want to speak with her now did not want any soft emotion to creep around inside him softness or any lack of concentration could get him killed here he stared into space his fathers voice swam in his head his fathers presence there was a senescent aroma when he was near jake that was peculiar to him warm rich comforting it reminded jake of the beach at sheko where they would sit for hours in the sunshine the wavelets of the south china sea lapping around their ankles speaking of many things and sometimes of nothing at all merely being together basking in the closeness that the intervening decades had made new unique more powerful gone all gone we have many enemies in many countries they will seek to smash the yuhnhyun an enemy in japan among the yakuza what was the connection with the yuhnhyun he put his elbows on his knees rested his weary head in his hands his body felt as if he had just gone fifteen rounds with the heavyweight boxing champ his mind was whirling with possibilities with a slight groan he rose and padded across the japanesestyle room his shoes had been left at the doorstep took a long scalding shower he lifted his head up to the water flow trying to wash the fatigue pain and fear from his body and his mind he knew that he was in a lethal area the yuhnhyun was under attack and unless he found the source at once the delicate ring of people his father had spent more than fifty years drawing together would blow apart the triad dragons especially will be wary shi zilin had told him constantly seeking to gain advantage over their rivals divided we are vulnerable and may be cut down fear flooded through jake once again the fear of failure he was on the mountainside in the dark and the cold his father had designated him zhuan the special one perhaps he had been wrong perhaps his love for his one remaining son had blinded his visionary instincts perhaps he only wanted jake to be zhuan had shi zilin chosen the wrong person jake toweled himself off and dressed in a cobaltblue linen suit dovegray shirt blueonblue polkadot tie as he brushed his hair he stared at himself in the mirror he saw the intense hooded copper eyes deeply set beneath a wide straight brow his curly black hair a genetic gift from his maternal grandfatherseemed unruly no matter how much he worked at it he threw the brush down and gathering up a couple of small items went out of the room it was early afternoon local time just after lunch so that the streets were merely crowded not jammed he had eaten on the plane but had tasted nothing his stomach was full nothing more traffic as usual was at a standstill in any case he felt like walking the day was sunny and exceptionally clear there was still a bit of a chill in the air but the first cherry blossoms were in bud and the air smelled fresher and cleaner than it had any right to jake strolled up to sotoboridori turning left down the wide avenue heading into the akasaka area near the mikado theater he went down off the street taking the choyoda subway line three stops to meijijingumae he emerged in harajuku in the old postworld war ii days this had been the site of washington heights where the majority of the united states occupation forces were housed within the precincts of tokyo nowadays harajuku was more the province of the wealthy younger classes trendy boutiques vied for the visitors attention with restaurants serving western food if one was in the mood for a hamburger and french fries rather than sushi or soba this was the place to go along the wide beautifully treelined boulevard known as omotesandodori young people danced on bright sunday afternoons dressed in fiftiesstyle leather jackets and winklepicker boots they wended their way into yoyogi park site of the towering meiji shrine to the insistent beat of blaring portable boom boxes they swirled and gyrated in an almost lunatic frenzy harajuku was also where mikio komoto had his corporate offices the skyscrapers of shinjuku were where one might have first thought to look for them since that was the real hub of tokyos corporate life but for many reasons mikio had decided to headquarter farther south it had proved a canny decision with harajukus blossoming popularity more and more small businesses were descending on the area in an effort to free themselves from shinjukus stifling atmosphere mikios offices were within seicho no le just across from the togo shrine within sight of the parks south pond and noted iris garden it was next to a hightech kissaten a stylish coffee shop where for two dollars one received a tiny cup of the liquid the sum was also a form of rent for the table where one sat and watched the world go by a relatively new japanese custom borrowed without shame or excuses from a much older european one this place with the odd name of the barking fish was done in glossy green walls highlighted by deep blue neon strips hidden behind polishedwood valences hanging from the glittery ceiling tiny marble tables were surrounded by midnightblue lacquer chairs jake pushed through the smokedglass doors beside the kissaten and ascended in an elevator to the top floor of the building at the end of a polishedgranite and brushedbronze hallway he went through the seeingeye glass doors on which was printed komoto shomu kogyo in english and kanji this translated roughly as komoto commercial industry a rather nondescript name which could encompass virtually anything and everything jake had no clear idea how the company actually made its money mikio was into just about everything electronics fiber optics robotics you name it if it was an upandcoming industry on the mitithe ministry of international trade and industrypriority list mikio was certain to be in it miti was the vastly powerful bureaucratic agency which since the end of the war set industrial trade policy for all of the private sector one effective method was to offer businesses certain incentives to start up kobunfirmsin the areas that miti had targeted as important for the countrys economic expansion just after the war heavy industry such as petrochemicals and steel had been at the highest priority now the emphasis had shifted to light industryelectronics and robotics computer generation and the like mikios outer offices were paneled in kyokijapanese cypress the builtin desks consoles and cabinets were all in gleaming black lacquer the floor was covered with an industrial berber carpet rich in tones of gray and brown seating in this areaat least for those waiting admittancewas composed of a line of attached wood squares covered on top with tatami jake went over to the plexiglas screen there was a male receptionist young and nattily attired jake gave his name and when the young man asked the nature of his business jake told him that it was personal as he leaned in a womanthe office lady jake assumedturned and looked at him she was wearing a severely cut suit of dark cotton her gleaming black hair was squarecut in a style jake had not seen here since the midsixties her wide eyes regarded him for a time then as if a trapdoor were slamming shut she blinked and swiveling around returned to her work please be seated the young man said after taking jakes business card i will contact mr komotos secretary he spoke english clearly and overdistinctly as if he were being careful about going too fast thank you jake said and went back across the room he sat he was by no means alone darksuited businessmen congregated like birds on a wire from time to time one or sometimes several were summoned by a bowing functionary who emerged from behind the internal barrier to greet them in polite fashion and usher them inside as appointments departed others arrived and the process was repeated jake had been waiting for just under an hour when he got up and stuck his head through the opening of the plexiglas screen i beg your pardon he said to the young man but i have heard nothing as yet i handed your card personally to mr komotos secretary the young man said as if that were in itself an explanation that was fifty minutes ago its a busy day the young man said his hair glistened it was brush cut and with the assistance of some modernday pomade stood straight up the intercom gave a muted buzz and he said excuse me he stabbed at a button spoke softly into the wire headset he had on in a moment he had rung off im a good friend of mr komotos jake said out of the corner of his eye he saw the office lady turn her head was she watching him again when can i get in to see him when i know the young man said so will you may i speak with mr komotos secretary then the young man glanced down at his glossy pbx im sorry but shes on the phone right now please have a seat another twenty minutes of that and jake was back at the plexiglas window the young man looked up he seemed disappointed when he saw who it was yes the bathroom out the door down the corridor to your left last door jake nodded and went out the mens room was as shiny and modern as the rest of the building but not large there were two urinals and when the door opened and a man came in he and jake were wedged tightly together the only sounds in the small room were of the men passing water jake saw that the other man was a japanese in his midforties he was wideshouldered with saltandpepper hair like every other businessman in tokyo he was dressed in a dark suit the only difference was that he looked ill at ease in his muscles bulged beneath the sleek fabric old scars shone in his cheeks he looked neither to the right nor the left but seemed fascinated by the blank wall in front of him jake was finished zipping up when the man said a cup of coffee might be in order he said it softly but quite distinctly he had not turned his head and when jake looked at him he made no sign that he was aware that anyone else was in the room with him he zipped washed up and was gone for a moment jake stood in the washroom wondering if he had actually heard the man speak he thought for a time he was getting nowhere at the offices of komoto shomu kogyo out in the corridor he looked both ways no one was about jake took the elevator down to the lobby out in the street he went left he passed a chic kenzo boutique decorated in the latest japanese minimalist style flat gray walls black rubberized wire racks gray carpet flowing up from the floor to cover low counters on which piles of clothes were set he gave it a glance and went by then he stopped and went back in the window was a highly stylized mannequin she had orange and green hair and nails the color of topaz she was wearing the suit the office lady at mikios had on an office lady wearing a kenzo outfit that would have cost her a years salary unless she wasnt an office lady at all then who was she a cup of coffee might be in order jake backtracked farther to the entrance of the coffee shop in mikios building the barking fish the kissaten he went in slowly taking some time for his eyes to adjust to the change in light the neons were softened cast against the deep lacquer paint of the walls he took a look around and saw the kenzo suit sitting at a marble table the office lady sat in western style with her legs crossed she was smoking a cigarette a minuscule cup of coffee had been set before her she smiled at him he went over and as naturally as if they had made this date to meet sat down across from her he ordered a coffee and when they were alone said who are you her full lips moved into a mock pout you are very rude mr maroc pardon my barbarian manners he said in japanese thats better she said switching from english im glad you got the message her eyes twinkled it was amusing to guess at how long your bladder was going to hold out jake was not amused where is mikio he said is he all right i need to speak with him the woman watched him with her glittering eyes her flat face was all cheekbone and brow she was not jakes idea of beautiful but she would certainly be someones do you know tsukiji she asked yes be there tomorrow morning just after fourthirty will mikio be there the kenzo suit was already standing she looked down at him for a moment before walking briskly from the restaurant she did not look back bluestone in his study watching the play of indirect light redefine itself as it passed through the exquisite translucent skin of the priceless qing vase it stood on a black lacquered pedestal alone along one wall its pale opalescent green was the only slash of a color other than black and chinese red in the entire room the ceiling was painted a rich glossy black the walls were papered in a pattern made expressly for bluestone blackonblack a glossandmatte pattern with a scattering of tiny red chrysanthemums the couch along the wall opposite the qing masterpiece was of black leather the matching chairs black the walltowall carpeting was black overlaid with red pindots the antique romanstyle desk was carved ebony massive and intimidating it was the only other objet dart in the room besides the vase bluestone sat behind the desk now and watched the qings inner power redefine light as he listened to whiteeye kaos report i have tracked great pool of piddle to the dens of his usual newspaper sources my sources have confirmed that he has already shot off his mouthfor a suitable amount of hyeung yau he was speaking of the fragrant greasethe bribes one needed to pay naturally bluestone concurred god forbid that our unwitting foil should surprise us the chinese sitting on one oversized chair seemed dwarfed by its proportions bluestone liked that the chinese turned his head and the light turned his one milky eye opaque whiteeye kao laughed no chance of that good bluestone said you have made certain that the honorable pok has no inkling that the information about southasia bancorps regrettable fiscal plight was deliberately leaked to him absolutely whiteeye kao said with great certainty his sources had to struggle to get every bit of it better and better bluestone said staring intently at the qing vase i was particularly impressed with the manner in which you disposed of teck yau sawyer and sons comptroller that was a pleasure whiteeye kao said that poxinfested sea slug was more foreign devil than chinese he laughed my third cousinyou know the one who works in the butcher shop on po yan streetwas all too happy to play along he has no love for the loh faan either whiteeye kao laughed the shop as you know sells to all the big hotels catering to the foreign devils ha ha what a tender meal the stupid gwailoh must have eaten that night nek watch your tongue bluestone said sharply i am also a foreign devil no whiteeye kao said with some fervor you are a communist you have a plan for all of asia for all of the world i know how you aid those unfortunate peoples oppressed by the loh faan in every country it is different with you yes bluestone said the light passing through the qing had changed subtly he couldnt say how it is the buzzer sounded on his desk and he picked up the receiver listened for a moment send him in he said and replaced the phone on its cradle bluestone who employed a fulltime secretary at home as well as at his officesince he was fond of working out the most complex business problems away from the hubbub of the five star pacific officesturned at last from his contemplation of mans mastery over nature whiteeye kao alerted turned his head as the door opened and sir byron nolinkelly came in he was a portly scotsman with wide white muttonchop sideburns and an immaculately groomed mustache waxed and curling upward at its ends his shock of thick white hair was combed straight back off his wide forehead his ruddy complexion and his bulbous clowns nose conspired to make him appear to be everyones kindly uncle in fact he was tai pan of pacific overland trading an influential firm almost as venerable as mattias king company the colonys oldest western trading company sir byron was something of a tyrant controlling pacific overland for the past fiftyfive years despite attempts by other members of his family to wrest power from him he was nasty and powerful and bluestone had spent much time romancing him the thing that sir byron liked most was a winner conversely he hated to lose at anything but especially in matters concerning his companys business it had been bluestones contention that the consortium of tai pan who founded interasia trading were doomed to failure the problems of capital shortfall at southasia bancorp which had been revealed to sir byron as well as the other tai pan aboard the trireme that weekendhad persuaded him good afternoon tai pan sir byron said bluestone returned the greeting turned to whiteeye kao this is ping po he said casually one of my compradors as bluestone had intended sir byron gave the chinese a perfunctory nod and forgot about his presence i have just now come from macao he said waving away bluestones invitation to a drink dark leong lau and sixtoe ping have arranged their financing and the buying bluestone said leaning forward in excitement sir byron nodded it has begun bobby chan has seen to it it is being distributed through enough unrelated brokers so that only a specific check would unearth the chain of buying then you and i will commence our purchases tomorrow sir byron nodded as we agreed bluestone watched the other tai pan carefully waiting for a hint as to why he had actually come this information could have been just as easily communicated via phone are you sure you wont have a seat bluestone asked gesturing to the empty chair vacated by whiteeye kao who was now discreetly across the room staring into the lovely depths of the qing all right sir byron said relenting he sat as stiffly as he stood a retired colonel whose training would never leave him before you and i embarked upon our end of this venture i wished to ask a number of questions bluestone shrugged you had ample time over the weekend on the yacht sir byrons iceblue eyes studied bluestone not in front of the natives old man this is just between you and me and whiteeye kao bluestone thought who you think of as part of the furnishings i want a true assessment of the danger factor the risk bluestone said without hesitation is great i cannot deny that he also knew that if he did sir byron would get up walk out the door and that would be the end of his involvement we are up against clever tai pan but i believe that their power is on the wane shi zilin is dead and his son well his son has disappeared disappeared wherever he is bluestone said hes not in hong kong who is going to run interasia now sawyer the old mans headed for senility three oaths tsun his business is the sea thats where he excels on land he relies on others now they have run out of money and we have a chance at the kam sang project if we control that with its revolutionary desalinization plant we will control all of hong kong i dont have to reiterate that water is hong kongs constant overwhelming need kam sang will allow us to control its flow we will be able to in effect set our own price for water there was silence while sir byron digested this at length he nodded im satisfied he said ill relay my recommendation to the others excellent bluestone said standing clearly the interview was at an end the two tai pan shook hands when nolinkelly had left bluestone turned to whiteeye kao said do you think he believed me buddha yes of course its what he wants to believe the others as well its in their own best interests to believe you how could they know that we desire control of kam sang for more than its desalinization plant whiteeye kao grunted you had only to watch his eyes to see that hes already blinded by the fantasy of money and power youve served up to him bluestone sat back down swiveled in his chair he stared again into the extraordinary translucence of the qing vase i wonder he thought aloud what our friend mr nolinkelly would say if he knew he was making an enormous financial contribution to the furtherance of the soviet union in hong kong in the blackness of the tunnel all public conversation was drawn to a muted hush the smell of charcoal dust was strong until with a rush that was almost euphoric the trolly burst out onto mayakovsky square and rumbling past the hotel peking braked to a halt in front of the moscow planetarium mikhail carelin liked this place especially he said because it was just across the street from a little place that seemed squeezed in between its neighbors the home of anton chekhov now turned into a memorial museum inside comets spun into the twinkling darkness their lighted vapor trails sparkling like diamond dust in daniellas thick hair they passed up a slideshow lecture on the sayut that they knew to be overblown almost stridently patriotic for the benefit of the many tourists who crowded through the doors outside it was gray raining instead of snowing which was at least a change of a sort here it was almost possible to believe that one was part of the weightless airless extraterrestrial nonatmosphere of space one had the sense of spinning in orbit so high up so detached that one saw the entire world revolve serenely at a distance vast enough to reduce all tension all worry in the cosmos there was no anxiety daniella was worrying what to do about maluta time was running out on her she had done all she could behind his back she was terrified that he would somehow get wind of her operation with sir john bluestone and take that over now that she finally knew the vast extent of shi zilins yuhnhyun she understood why he had gone to such lengths to hide its true nature from her mitrebluestonehad finally come through and daniella now knew that elements in hong kong and beijing were in collusion she was stunned at the thought of the resulting economic and political colossus that was being created she knew that it was not enough now to have burrowed her way inside the yuhnhyun she must either control it outrightor destroy it completely she was certain that should maluta ever get his hands on this intelligence he would take the chinese operation away from her this she could not allow but how to defeat a man who terrified her so his dossier was as clean as virgin snow what is it carelin said tracing the furrows in the flesh above her nose maluta she nodded i fear that i have destroyed us mikhail maluta has us both in a vise you cannot go to genachev that would destroy you utterly given how he feels about personal morals and if maluta threatens to expose us carelin stirred uneasily he hasnt yet has he no daniella admitted but only because he has a use for me and who knows for you as well the comet its tail greenandred fire came arcing down the sky overhead passing behind daniellas left ear for a moment her cheek was blushed by the simulated starlight then it fell back into shadow carelin felt his heart lurch his eyes were filled up with her his body expanded when he was with her there was a heaviness between his legs that never went away is there something youre not telling me danushka the blackness of space abruptly seemed lonely and desolate more than any place on earth could possibly be he has made me his stalking horse she whispered hoarsely i am carrying out his directives but everything is in my name if anything goes wrong i will be pilloried and he will remain blameless what is it precisely that he wants you to do it had been a dangerous line that she had been walking all afternoon and now she did not know which way to go certainly it would be easiest just to put her head back and tell him everything continue his role as her priestconfessor she was tired of the web of lies within which she was enmeshed each new lie she was compelled to utter seemingly enervated her more she was like a patient with a degenerative illness sinking further and further away from the world of normalcy and light she was ill and without a cure she took several steps away from him into the pale lavender light of jupiter its ethereal aura flooded her features with the kind of illumination one only finds on a clear summers night deep within a densely foliaged forest in a clearing moonlight filtered by treetops the engirding atmospheric layers kilometers of space carelin thought again of circe and felt himself ensorcelled by this extraordinary woman he knew from the first that his affair with her was stupid and worse dangerous but nevertheless he persisted it was as if he was split in two one side of him protested this liaison the other did not care and ignored all dangers then six months ago the highspeed scrambled transmission had come in and he had been undone selene the activation code selene goddess of the moon is that why he had thought of the moonlit glade itsan operation centering on hong kong daniella lied and something inside her gave off a long sigh the patient dying another death maluta has usurped mitre my asset in asia the best lies she thought always contained a core of truthor a version of it malutas taking over my operation there almost told him the truth almost mentioned kam sang what a disaster that would have been he would have gone straight to genachev with word of what jake maroc could tell them about kam sang and both of them would have been dead from that moment maluta would have known the origin of the leak and the evidence of the murder and their adulterous affair would have surfaced finis for both of them she knew carelin well enough his sense of fairness was acute as was his sense of loyalty he was a fanatic about both in fact his firsthis only reaction would be to run to genachev never considering the consequences for both of them time that was what daniella needed most time to find a way to defuse maluta but maluta wanted jake maroc dead now aware of the ethereal light on her face she began to move away from him into the shadows but carelin took her arm and held her fast dont do that he said i want to see you mary mother of god she thought dont let him find out the truth her mind raced it was up to her to save them both he pulled her close against him so that her scent came to him and a wave of her thick honey hair brushed his cheek because he wouldnt let her out of the light and the light revealed what was behind her eyes she let her head go forward so that her forehead was pressed against his chest oh mikhail hes going to take all my power away from me i cant allow him to do this to me mikhail it will destroy me youve still got chimera he pointed out daniella nodded i never suspected that he would rise to the level he has she acknowledged but even an asset of chimeras caliber will not save me now mikhail perhaps ill just shoot maluta and be done with it bang bang just the way mickey spillane writes em eh stop making fun of me she cried then stop acting like a child problems are not solved with a gun you of all people should know that daniella raised her head but malutas got a spotless file theres nothing in his past to make him vulnerable a wave of despair washed over her what was the point she thought leaning against him of describing how debilitating it was to be under malutas thumb of being the subject of his scrutiny he put his arms around her his face was lost in the fragrant mane of her hair never he thought had he loved a human being as he loved her perhaps i can find a way to take you with me when i go to geneva with genachev next month he said what made you think of geneva carelin shrugged i dont know he looked around perhaps it was this place one does not feel that one is even in moscow here it made me think of the geneva trip a foreign place away from malutas prying eyes his veiled threats away from all the intrigues it made daniella want to weep this small kindness in the midst of malutas monstrously labyrinthine intrigue hers as well she realized dully she had done nothing but lie to carelin standing here at the edge of jupiters orbit carelin went on unawares made me think that to us even geneva might seem like the ends of the earth for an instant daniella drew a blank like a sleeper awaking from a tomb of dreams remembering dreaming but nothing more she heard a reverberation inside her head what was it the ends of the earth then she had it maluta saying in his sardonic superior tones imagine they would have gone to the ends of the earth for you they sold their souls to you bowed their heads before you conferring to you on bended knee all that made them powerful for this his cold hands upon her breasts squeezing joylessly and this and inward against her mons but now oddly in this atmosphere that detached her from the earth his words held another meaning bowed their heads before you on bended knee why had he used such terms did he pull them out of a hat the hat of his subconscious daniella wondered now what it was in life for which maluta would travel to the ends of the earth bowed their heads before you on bended knee like a goddess or a sorceress like carelins circe in that case hadnt maluta already conferred upon her some kind of power did he in fact fear her is that where his contempt and hate stemmed from what really did maluta see in her what powers imaginary or real did he suspect that she possessed and finally how could that power be used against him turning their conversation around again in her mind daniella vowed to find out even if it meant that she must do what she most feared plunge into that fearful dark star that sucked in all power that negated all life oleg alexeevitch maluta the fish stared at him with an eye the color of gold leaf it was a great red tuna lying on its side just below its head a square paper sticker denoting size and weight was pasted over the scales the tuna was one of many at tsukiji tokyos vast fish market on the banks of the sumida river it was a quarter to five in the morning a light wind was gusting across an oystercolored sky much of the city lay shadowed sleeping in the distance the great steelandglass towers of shinjuku thrust upward into the low sky their silvery tips partially obscured by cloud in tsukiji the tuna were just being brought in off the boats and trucks for oddly enough some of them had been flown in over the pole from montauk long island jake could remember a week during one summer when he had stood on the pier at the most eastern tip of the island watching the japanese trading representatives frantically bidding for the tuna as the deepsea fishing boats docked in the late afternoon young men with short gaffs went among the tuna lifting them this way and that across the wet concrete by hooking them in the gills other men walked slowly among the deepening rows of fish spraying them with water all the while a pearlescent mist rose about their feet the spray from their hoses bouncing off scales and concrete to form miniature rainbows in the air at five minutes to five the men began stacking the most enormous mounds of pink and white sashimi sparkling dewy fresh ready along with the great fishfor auction the market was filling up with people buyers sleepy sightseers revvedup revelers who were making this their last stop among many during the long night marocsan jake turned saw a diminutive japanese come around from behind a stack of squid kachikachisan they bowed to each other performing the greeting ritual of the yakuza when i saw you last you were tied up by your own hand marocsan a thousand apologies the circumstances kachikachi nodded komotosan explained everything afterward it is about komotosan that i have come jake said is he here let us have breakfast kachikachi said he led the way across the concrete running with sea water and fish blood to a small restaurant that was no more than a counter beneath a striped awning over sashimi and kirin beer kachikachi said komotosan sends you his greetings jake said nothing he apologizes for the manner in which you have been led around as you said circumstances the war you come at the worst time imaginable kachikachi said crunching into a thick slice of abalone cunningly shaped to resemble a butterfly i know there is talk of an escalation of the war buddha jake thought it is already a bloodbath times are most difficult marocsan i spent fifteen minutes here making sure that you had not been followed before i made contact followed by whom these days kachikachi said dipping squid into soy sauce there are many enemies jake thought of his own situation i feared that komotosan was already dead he said i have been calling for days security marocsan kachikachi ordered more sashimi for them both and komotosan has no wish to involve you in this extreme danger its too late for that jake said im already here kachikachis face darkened i am afraid that it would be best if you left left kachikachi handed him a slim packet immediately jake opened it found a oneway ticket to hong kong what is this kachikachis eyes were sad it is my oyabuns wish jake put the packet on the counter between them this did not come from komotosan i regret to say that there is no choice marocsan kachikachis eyes were downcast one should not have to speak to a friend in such a manner but i too have been given no choice he reached into his pocket threw some bills on the counter please be on that flight he stood i want to see komotosan goodbye marocsan i will see him kachikachisan i must but kachikachi had already disappeared into the mist pocketing the ticket jake left the restaurant and went carefully through the market it was just past five thirty and the first auction had begun the crowds had increased and he had plenty of cover he spotted kachikachi and worked his way through the throng careful to change vectors frequently since kachikachi was already sensitive to security at the land end of tsukiji the small man paused looking around they were in the east end of tokyo kachikachi turned right hurrying up the street jake followed crossing and recrossing the street several times using shop windows and where he could mirrors to keep the small man in sight at the same time he kept an eye out for ticks who might have picked either him or kachikachi up at the market he saw no one kachikachi went into asashicho he was heading directly for jisaku a wellknown restaurant where one could still see geisha performing with lunch or dinner though the woman was more likely to be sixty than twenty nowadays all the young ones were selling their bodies along the ginza this tradition at least was dying out the place looked like a temple structure with its long sloping tiled roofs and ancient appearance kachikachi passed into shadow under the eaves jake paused on the street and took a hard look around there were a number of cars parked along the curb one of them he recognized as mikios company mercedes it was impossible to tell if anyone was inside because of the tinted glass but in the cool morning air jake could see the soft swirl of exhaust emanating from the cars tailpipe the engine was on the mercedes ready to roll keeping one eye on jisaku into which kachikachi had disappeared jake went out into the street and hailed a cab at this time of the day with people streaming in from nearby tsujiki it was not difficult to find one the automatic door opened and jake ducked his head inside he spoke to the driver in rapid idiomatic japanese unfurling several bills of highyen denomination as he did so the man nodded pocketing the bills and jake stood up he was about to return to the restaurant when he saw the front door open kachikachi came out along with a large yakuza they stood in the mist watching the street jake turned away leaning on the open door of the taxi reflected in the window of the car he could see another man emerge from the shadowed doorway of the restaurant now the three were on the move they were definitely on their way to the mercedes jake climbed into the taxi and the door sighed shut there was a miniature tv that the last passenger had left on jake switched it off and watched the three hurry down the walk jake studied the third man it was difficult to get even a partial view of his face because of the intervening bulk of the big yakuza but jake recognized the wide shoulders and narrow waist the close stubble of his shorn hair mikio so he had been here after all something about his walkhad he been hurt jake was about to climb out of the taxi when he heard an engine cough to life across the street he turned his head saw smoke coming from the tailpipe of a blue nissan the mercedes jake told the driver and the man nodded mikio and his crew were already in the car and now the mercedes was pulling away from the curb wait jake told the driver for the blue nissan to pass he saw the quick flick of the drivers eyes in the rearview mirror then they were all in motion wending their way through tokyos thickening traffic mikio jake and the unknown enemy who had somehow known about this meeting in jakes mind kachikachis words echoing there is talk of an escalation of the war when tony simbal drove his saab up the long snaking drive leading to greystoke he did so at slow speed he had the windows and the sunroof open golden light poured into the velour interior with unaccustomed warmth though a breeze whispered through the tall sycamore and pine it contained not a trace of winters biting chill all around him it seemed birds twittered and sprang from twig to branch as if delighted to be home again fleecy clouds hung in the sky given a glow by the sunlight striking them and every so often he sported a rabbit or a pheasant scurrying away from his passage along the verge of the graveled driveway once he was certain he caught a quick glimpse of the rear end of a deer bolting from his line of sight simbal inhaled deeply abruptly aware that perhaps strictly out of defense he had been breathing shallowly all winter long in a sense he thought one barely lived in winter at all bundled and packed in layer upon layer of overclothes one plodded through bleak days short on light and warmth and even color while ones nose slowly turned red and ones extremities became numb simbal was thinking of burma of the shan states and the mysterious murders of peter curran and alan thune when he pulled up to the great nineteenthcentury mansion owned by the quarry and occupied by its director the gabled turreted house sat within fifty acres or so that encompassed rolling emerald hills and a spacious valley in great falls virginia the place still bore the stamp of antony beridien the quarrys former director so lately assassinated in the end phase of a plot or so it had been rumored devised by general daniella vorkuta and her mole inside the quarry chimera aka henry wunderman beridien had been an inveterate collector of antiques and the rooms and hallways of greystoke were still filled with a rainbow of period pieces ranging from federal to chippendale to louis xv to god only knew what as he cut the saabs engine and the deep throb of the turbo died simbal saw donovan hunched over his corvette the car was donovans rather manic hobby every week it seemed that he was working to improve this or that aspect of the engine donovan picked his head out of the automobiles maw and smiled waved a hand holding a wrench it was sunday and donovan was dressed casually in a pair of old faded chinos a similarly hued ralph lauren polo shirt and worn topsiders without socks a green metal toolbox was at his side along with a tray filled with a pitcher of lemonade an ice bucket into which had been poked several bottles of lite beer and a variety of glasses help yourself tony donovan said ducking his head back beneath the raised hood of the vette simbal went across the gravel and popped the cap off a beer he took a swig watching the directors work without much interest he knew almost all there was to know about automotive engines of all sorts so much time in the jungle made that a necessity but it was hardly a love he had other things to occupy his thoughts he looked around someone was working in the rose garden carefully pruning on bended knee soon the bushes would be in bloom and that side of the mansion would be suffused with a scent as delicious as ardor so donovan said his head and shoulders out of sight what have you been up to simbal put the empty bottle aside and leaned against the warm fender of the car you remember a woman named monica starr mmm sounds familiar girlfriend or business both actually simbal crossed his arms over his chest we had an affair while i was at the dea i ran into her the other evening oh really where a party that wouldntve been max threnodys bash as a matter of fact it was simbal said why no particular reason i just like to know which hole my operatives are poking their noses into you dont like max do you rodger like him hmm i never considered that alternative lets just say that i dont approve of the dea period its too much of a bureaucratic boondoggle for my taste tied to congresss apron strings i dont think having to suck up to those idiots on capitol hill ever did anyone any good especially people in our profession we need to be left alone by politicians autonomy is the only effective means of doing business that way instead of having to cut through red tape one avoids it entirely there was a clanking from inside the corvette and donovan grunted dont really understand how you managed to stay there so long compared to us its a very bourgeois operation maybe so but their computer is the key weve been looking for against the diqui donovan at last reemerged from his place of refuge is that so he wiped his greasy hands on a rag and poured himself some lemonade tell all simbal told donovan about his talk with monica about her unease regarding peter curran when it came to currans death simbal did not leave out anything but strangelyor so it seemed to himhe made it seem as if the dea computer and not max threnody had divulged the classified information howd you get access to the computer donovan asked shrewdly the girl simbal nodded chasing after skirts donovan said ruminatively we did an awful lot of that together in college simbal smiled we were terrors no responsibilities then no power either donovan looked at him his clear blue eyes and handsome features made it appear as if he had just stepped out of a calvin klein ad but we did have power tony a very real kind of power over women they all wanted to be with us remember yeah simbal shrugged but to tell you the truth now im not sure how much of that was real and how much we made up what do you mean donovan asked sharply we had them all anyone we wanted we bedded except leslie donovan put down his glass and pointed get behind the wheel and start her up when i give you the signal he did some tinkering and then said okay simbal turned the ignition and the thing began to purr like a great cat superb donovan made one lastminute adjustment and closed the hood lets take a spin simbal got out and donovan took his place behind the wheel as soon as simbal was in the passengers seat donovan took off sending a great spray of gravel upward in a graceful arc as he slewed them around do they know about this simbal said hanging on for dear life as the corvette thrummed along who the government firm that pays our insurance simbal said over the mounting noise he stole a glance at the dashboard saw that they were closing in on mph donovan laughed and simbal shouted how fast does this mother go were going to find out right now donovan said pushing the accelerator to the floorboards he whipped around a curve with such force that simbal felt his neck crack uncomfortably the road straightened out the needle trembled at the mph mark hows that donovan shouted grinning simbal who was more at home in a juryrigged world war ii jeep or on a donkeys back heading down an asian mountainside said nothing he was concentrating on keeping his stomach in place after what seemed an eternity donovan slowed to a more reasonable pace sunlight spun off the hood refracting colors the hills on either side of them were already lush as if they were eager for summer to begin they seemed haloed with the first misty buddings of springtime ethereal almost divine why did you bring up leslie donovan said after a time simbal shrugged i dont know really except that it seemed appropriate we were waxing nostalgic werent we i dont know about you but i cant think about college without leslie coming to mind unobtainable leslie donovan slowed even more now they were merely cruising like any other sightseers out for an afternoons spin she was probably gay gay jesus simbal laughed what in gods name makes you say that she wasnt interested in us right she was the only one buddy i didnt say she wasnt interested in us simbal said a bit more soberly i said that she was unobtainable same thing donovan observed when you come down to it simbal gave the director a quick look i guess id forgotten what an ego you have when it comes to women face it rodger they didnt all fall for the lousy lines we were handing out in those days anyway all we wanted then was to fuck two studs out to rut our intellectual pursuits we reserved for the classroom if memory serves he shrugged maybe thats why leslie wasnt interested christ but ive never forgotten her donovan said all of a sudden it came out with such intensity that simbal felt compelled to remain silent she seems like a dream now almost donovan had slowed pulling over to the shoulder now he stopped the car and turned off the ignition the sudden cessation of noise was quite shocking i remember her long blond hair streaming out behind her as she walked across the campus it was as thick as honey and her gray eyes could see right through you it often seemed to me donovan put his head back against the leather seat jesus i wanted her sure you wanted her because you knew you couldnt have her simbal said because without her pussy in your belt you werent batting one thousand no youre wrong donovan said thoughtfully i wanted her because of her i wanted leslie his eyes stared unseeing up at the underside of the roof outside the calling of the birds continued to wash the entire valley in soft arhythmic melody i never told you this tony donovan said i never told anyone this but one night just after wed graduated i went to leslies house you remember her folks lived quite near the campus i didnt call or anything i dont think i had the nerve i remember the look of the place so warm and inviting in the dusk i could imagine her with her folks and her younger sister sitting down to dinner and i felt this i dont know whata compulsionto join them i remember climbing those stucco stairs going past the huge yucca all blue and a green so deep at that time of the evening it was near to black it brushed my cheek i rang the doorbell i did it the instant i reached the top step i knew i had to or i wouldnt do it at all i suspected that her father or her mother would come to the door and i had rehearsed a kind of speech for either eventuality i wasnt prepared for what happened leslie opened the door leslie herself with that warm light burnishing her honey hair outlining her body it was a magical moment something straight out of every fantasy id conjured up about her then i heard someone say whos this it was a male voice a young voice certainly not her fathers then i saw that he had come up behind her his arm slipped around her waist his body pressed against hers from behind whos this honey i had no answer to that no explanation so i turned and ran a block away i stopped long enough to vomit into the bushes donovan closed his eyes and let enough air out so that simbal knew he had been holding it in for the space of several breaths im sorry i brought her up rodger dont be donovan said i think about her all the time he shook his head as if clearing mental cobwebs now leslies taken on the aspect of the unicorn or the holy grail perhaps shes not out there at all perhaps we both made her up in a moment donovan started the engine the afternoons growing old and we havent finished our business he made a broken uturn and headed back to greystoke what about this woman monica whatever starr simbal said monica starr what about her she still got a thing for you she was having an affair with peter curran curran is dead so you have informed me donovan said was she also in love with him i dont know is she in love with you i dont think that matters for the first time this afternoon donovan laughed good old tony youre still loving them and leaving them well in this case its no doubt for the best who knows what uncle max has up his sleeve i dont care that you once worked for him you dont now i dont believe hed care for you doing your spook number in his territory what does monica have to do with that donovan did not like that question and he showed it everybodys got a blind spot tony yours is max didnt it ever occur to you that he put this monica woman onto you deliberately the little chill that had begun to coagulate in his lower belly when he saw monica walk into max threnodys house the night before blossomed into allout nausea whats the matter tony donovan said you dont look so well simbal thought hed better get it over with i never thought id say this but max is playing games with me first he plays footsie getting as close again as the dutch uncle i thought he had been then he sics monica starr onto me and we reignite flames then he says go use her buddy shell be your guide in the purgatory of the linked governmental computer files so far so good donovan said youve got your lead edward martin bennett what more do you want simbal told him of the accident by which he ended up following monica to maxs house donovan grunted now you see that threnodys no better than the rest of the spook community he said overhauling an elderly couple in a datsun hes got you covered six ways from sunday tony i wouldnt make the mistake of letting down your guard with him again what i cant figure is what he wants out of all this dont be dense it annoys me donovan said shortly he wants you to go after edward martin bennett if bennetts involved with peter curran its a sure bet he knows who snuffed him in any case this ones a bitch all right too many dea pieces have gone belly up which is precisely why your friend max has gone to such lengths to rope you in youre perfect for the purpose tony dont you see exdea operative whos smart and seasoned you know the ropes yet youre not tied to the dea now youre clean as a whistle you can slide down the hole into this hellpit someones created and it wont cost uncle max the skin off his nose but this is our ops the quarrys donovan gave simbal a quick look use your head tony youre going to be monitored every step of the way who do you think will show up just as you get to the kill uncle max to mop up and get the glory and in the process gain a measure of revenge for his fallen pieces donovan had the disconcerting habit of calling other organizations operatives pieces simbal nodded unhappily thinking this has turned into one helluva afternoon okay donovan went on now that ive prepared you for the joust go out and get bennett and whoever else may be mixed up in this if you need help ask i work alone simbal said in the field id rather be responsible for my own life yes i know donovan accelerated again the last of the sun spinning off the windscreen in a semblance of a rainbow they were almost back at greystoke what do i do about max simbal said donovan turned into the gates handed his and simbals lasercoded id cards to the guard at the gates in a moment the way was clear and he took them down the winding drive nothing the wind whispered in the maples and poplars somewhere a power mower was droning let threnody hang by his own rope now that you know what a liar he is youll know the proper time to set him to swinging tony after all youve got plenty of experience with him toshimaku mikio was heading back to his house leading his enemiessurely his assassinsright to the killing ground kanamecho a subdistrict within the ku jake was familiar with this area of tokyoas familiar as he was with mikio komotos house jake had once cased it thoroughly in order to break in and gain secret information concerning the whereabouts of his halfbrother nichiren the mists of early morning had dissipated leaving the skies clear and bright hurtling just under the speed of sound lowering into narita airport fifteen thousand feet aloft one would no doubt be aware of the haze that almost perpetually enwreathed tokyo but here on the ground the air seemed clear sunlight showered the ancient boxwood and thin soldierly cryptomeria which stood silent guard around mikios compound jake saw the familiar iron gate in the twelvefoot bamboo fence he could see the sloping rooftops of mikios house and beyond the barren sprawl of rikkyo universitys baseball grounds practice was beginning and every once in a while jake could discern the solid sound of ash bats connecting with horsehide baseballs he had the taxi stop just at the top of a rise that overlooked mikios house the mercedes slid through the open iron gates and disappeared jake paid his fare and got out the taxi made a uturn and departed jake was studying the blue nissan it had drawn to a halt at a point directly outside the spot along the wall where jake knew mikios study was secreted the enemy was well informed from out of his pocket he produced a pair of zeiss binoculars they were tiny and foldable he put them to his eyes and took a good look at the nissan sunlight shattered into ten thousand shards against the nissans windows he could not see inside he took the binoculars away as he had been trained to do one was never to peer through magnifying lenses for too long a period during surveillance because one was all too apt to miss some crucial occurrence across the larger field of play thisas it was with many things jake had learned through wei qi one could not concentrate on one section of the board alone now he saw a shadowed figure hurrying out from a side gate it clung to the long dark spaces along the bamboo wall before running full tilt toward the blue nissan the figure bent down and the side window scrolled down jake peered through the zeiss lenses and sucked in his breath kachikachi mikios righthand man was selling him out pointing to the spot most vulnerable in the compounds defenses now the diminutive yakuza was sprinting back toward the house leaving the gate unlatched deliberately kachikachi a traitor jake found it difficult to believe but the twists of warespecially an internecine war such as thiswere hard to fathom perhaps mikio was losing perhaps kachikachi wished to be on the winning side in any event jake knew what he was witness to using the binoculars at intervals he made his way around so that he was at once closer to the house and had a better angle through the still open side window of the blue nissan he caught movement inside and adjusted the lenses to maximum power there was one man plus the driver he saw the man on the passengers side working on a piece of hardware dew neh loh moh on all enemies he thought in a moment he recognized it a riverton bison a miniaturized handheld launcher that fired a specially made fragmentation grenade at approximately three hundred feet per second that was how they were going to do it everything would go up in a big bang and mikio would be plastered all over the walls jake was about to make a move for the car when he saw the driver pull out a gion and take off the safety he began to check quadrants radiating out from their immediate vicinity he was very good he missed nothing jake shrank back behind a boxwood and took a look at the environment they had parked the nissan well there was no immediate cover and that left jake out in the cold there was no way to approach the vehicle clandestinely that left the house jake knew that he had little time he pocketed the zeiss lenses and making his way carefully away from the lines of sight afforded those inside the nissan he approached the bamboo fence he pulled a nylon cord out of his pocket it was anchored with a clawed iron weight this he threw over the top of the bamboo and pulled down hard immediately there was no give then he went up he went over very fast leaping down onto the grass with knees deeply bent to cushion the landing he heard birds calling and somewhere a squirrel or other small animal scurrying otherwise it was still the muted sounds of traffic were a background wash once he even heard the crack of the bat from the nearby diamond where in buddhas name was everyone what had happened to mikios vaunted security he went quickly along the side of the house skirting the long narrow kyujutsu practice lane where he and mikio had engaged in a monumental battle of wits and prowess in the ancient samurais art of archery jake checked his watch he had been too long in getting here he went up on the engawa tried the fusuma to the room adjacent to mikios study it was locked no time to pick the lock used the calloused edges of his hands the flat of his right heel to crash through now he was fully committed and could not turn back the danger of the bison was ever present in his mind but it was no deterrent he had to pull mikio out of harms way the house was eerily unnaturally quiet there should have been the pounding of running feet shouts raised by the noise of his abrupt entry there was nothing jake went hurriedly through the dark closedup room pushed aside the inner fusuma out into the hallway saw kachikachi coming from the opposite direction someone at least had been alerted by his breakin amida marocsan muhonnin jake cried traitor they grappled for a moment in the narrow hall before jake threw the other aside turned pulling the fusuma to mikios study open get away from there he heard kachikachis frenzied cry but he had spotted his friend deep in meditation kneeling on the tatami how did you get here you fool do not go in there do not disturb mikio in his kimono with the clan kamon the crest printed in a great threelobed wheel across the back the oyabun began to turn his head mikio jake shouted grabbed a handful of kimono and began to pull his friend upward when the window shattered with explosive force the bison jake thought and then oh buddha im too late whiteandyellow light screaming in nova all sound sight smell coalescing into one elemental bellow that echoed on and on as the room collapsed in upon itself with a thunderous howl then the fire began running like a river of death winter spring peking it had been generalissimo chiang who had taught mao that whoever commanded the army would in the end be victorious war chiang believed decided conflicts of all nature extrapolating from this mao had said political power grows out of the barrel of a gun this of course had been of much concern to the americans but what they feared most about mao was that his strategies were hidden from them as they were from the multitudes and outsiders found this opacity both dangerous and unpredictable certainly the americans harbored no illusions that they could use mao as they had used chiang to further their own political ends in china only mao sitting atop the ungainly pyramid of power that he and his inner core had created knew that this was due principally to two men sun tzu had shown him the way to keep his strategy secret zilin had told him in politics it is the threat of violence that is an end in itself the truth is that mao and to a good degree zilin were ready and willing to listen to american ideas concerning a coalition government in postworld war ii china mao above all others believed that american intervention could be importantindeed even crucialto his countrys future that was zilin believed principally because mao had been stung to the quick by stalins and molotovs unkind insult calling him a margarine communist zilin had been the first to understand moscows unease regarding the direction of chinese communism stalin especially the ironfisted commander was able to discern strength in a leader it was zilins firm belief that moscow was terrified of mao it was not only what mao stood forthat is a form of communism divergent from that of moscowsbut also mao himself stalin was a genius of that zilin was certain his understated manipulation of roosevelt at wars end was proof enough of that even if one had not already been convinced by how stalin had handled his troops during the war it was zilins theory that stalin had taken the measure of mao himself and had seen in him perhaps many of the qualities that made himself so powerful stalin and molotov had called mao and his followers margarine communists because their revolution had come via the peasants and not the proletariat as was strict karl marx scripture mao had taken this jibe to heart though zilin saw the insult as ridiculous he could not convince mao china is unique zilin would say it is an agrarian country a land whose interior marx could not have imagined let alone conceived of how to tame yet we have done just that mao tong zhi is that not proof enough of stalins lies mao would shake his head no you are wrong shi tong zhi much as it pains me to admit it stalin and molotov are right our revolutionthe true communist revolutionmust come about through the proletariat moscow is baiting us zilin would say that is all no we are an agrarian nation it is true now but in order to survive the coming decades we cannot afford to remain so for our decimated economy to revive and prosper after the war we must industrialize when that happens we will be creating our own proletariat do you not think shi tong zhi that we will be forced to move our economy through a capitalist phase in order to reach a profitable standard of industrial productivity well then we must be certain that we reach this new emerging class it is theynot the dwindling peasant populationwho must carry our cause forward into the nineteen fifties toward this end the americans can be of enormous assistance only they have the capital and the industrial knowhow to set us on course after the war do you think that moscow will be in any financial shape to send us the amount of aid we will require not likely no shi tong zhi the americans are our only hope in this mao was quite correct it was at that timeduring the height of the warwhen a fairly balanced american foreign policy in china would have opened many doors as well as creating a firm power base for the country in one of asias most important nations but the great capitalists of the time would not brook any form of what they referred to as communist handholding on the contrary they saw a bit of themselves in generalissimo chiang and they were to a man dead certain that chiang would be americas strongman bulwark against the spread of communism they were blind to the political and worse for them the sociological upheavals wracking china they could not seeas zilin had early onthat communism was the only logical method of unifying a country as vast andgenerally speakingas poor as china thus during the war america poured aid only into the coffers of generalissimo chiang during the outbreak of the chinese civil war when american policy makers still had a chance to deal with the situation objectively they provided aid only to the nationalist forces by airlift and sea transport alike even while the american embargo of military materiel to china was still in effect from august to may thousands of tons of ammunition held by us forces stationed in china were clandestinely transferred to the generalissimos garrisons the americans then left mao no choice in december of mao embarked on a trip to moscow where he and stalin hammered out the sinosoviet treaty of alliance thus was the fate of modern china sealed from that time on america was shut out of the formation of chinese policy obliged to watch the progress of asian politics molded and remolded by russia and china without chance to inflict its own predilections on the dynamics of change thus had america lost the one precious possibility of real western involvementrather than coercive interventionin far eastern affairs because of his role in chungking and afterward it was perhaps not surprising that zilin should have taken huaishan han to see lo juiching lo was the head of the ministry of public security his responsibilities were many and extended throughout the country huaishan hans expertise in securityin spying to put a fine point on itwas already manifest to zilin and certain other members of maos inner circle now was the time to put it to good use from inside the country this interview occurred near the time when mao was returning from his sojourn to moscow and the timing was to prove quite important even though huaishan han was quartered next door to zilin the two friends saw little of each other during the next several months mao had returned with mixed resultsat least as far as zilin was concerned and that mao said is precisely why i declined to take you along to russia if you have a blind spot my friend it is with the soviets i had mine with the americans but that is all over with now you were correct on that score but as for the russians now that america has abandoned us utterly we must take our infusion of capital from whatever source makes itself available however maos infusion of capital was not quite what he had been hoping for stalin agreed to supply china with the equivalent of three hundred million dollars the catch was that it was in the form of credits rather than by the grant of a simple loan this meant that china was now quite literally tied to the soviet union it was not free to form the source of its new industry and rebuilding but rather must depend wholly on soviet technology technicians and material this a depressed mao told zilin privately was the best he could come up with stalin still distrusts us how many times he invoked the name of tito and his mockeryi use stalins own wordsof a communist state i cannot begin to count he was like a broken record on that score i had no power base from which to bargain the dispirited mao said after all it was the russians as well as the americans who were agitating for the coalition government we went directly against moscows wishes when we plunged into civil war how do you expect me to trust you after that stalin said like an aggrieved elder uncle zilin was not surprised as mao had been but he said nothing his antisoviet bias would get him nowhere with mao on this matter he knew full well that even if mao had been able to produce hard evidence that it was chiang who had begun the civil war stalin would have found another excuse to offer only credits this was moscows way of gaining a semblance of control over what it viewed as its wayward and potentially lethalstepchild after a long leisurely dinner at maos residence during which nothing at all was said mao took zilin out into the houses inner garden it was cold snow was falling lightly dusting straight down all around them muting all sound there seemed no wind mao pulled his coat closer around him when i was in moscow there was a blizzard to the north of the city fifteen feet of snow can you imagine shi tong zhi zilin said nothing there was no reason for them to be out here in the frigid night but security his heart beat fast what was it mao wanted no one else to know there is another problem mao said now he was facing out into the night the back wall of the garden was overgrown with ivy the zeal of the revolution precluded at least for the moment the tending of such items of luxury stalin spoke to me of another issue that of korea mao waited a moment before continuing with moscows backing the north korean communists will invade the south how soon next june zilin knew what was coming that means war surely mao nodded mutely his face was very sad our poor people they have just finished with a war that went on far too long then stalin gave you no choice mao turned to zilin none at all then he went inside i have found her zilin looked up from the paperwork he had been poring through he saw huaishan han dressed in a uniform rush into the offices i have found her my friend his lean face was alive and animated zilin peered around him to see another figure enter hesitantly through the doorway huaishan han gestured impatiently come in senlin hao jia huo come in she was a woman whoso it seemed to zilinmust always have been slim now she was thin to the point of emaciation her face which still held a certain pellucid beauty was gaunt and haggard her color was poor and judging by her skin alone she appeared to be in poor health her eyeslarge luminous and wide apartwere filled with fright she blinked constantly perhaps a physical manifestation of her intense anxiety huaishan han put his hands on her back propelling her forward zilin saw the wince she tried to hide shi tong zhi huaishan han said with an odd kind of pride this is my wife soong senlin your wife zilin was so astonished that for an instant he forgot his composure and allowed his shock to show he covered by giving a little bow this gesture at once familiar and polite brought a flicker of a wan smile to the young womans stricken face are you all right senlin he asked of course shes all right huaishan han said a trifle too loudly or at least she will be as soon as i take her to hospital just routine you understand zilin offered the young womanshe must have been twenty years huaishan hans junior she was not yet thirtyhis chair she sat gratefully some of the hard lines of tension etching her face eased immediately taking up his teapot he served her she gripped the small handleless cup with both hands as if determined to absorb all of its warmth into herself her head bobbed she murmured her thanks and drank greedily as if she had not tasted proper tea in some months zilin looked up at his friend huaishan han shrugged she was captured by the communists captured you say their commander knew of me a wellknown nationalist neh that is what i was to everyone but you and mao tong zhi huaishan han gestured in the end she was their enemy because she was my wife the wife of huaishan han the nationalist so they captured her tortured her too i think though i cannot get her to talk about it in fact i cannot get her to talk much at all i did not know that you were married zilin was appalled at the barbarism of his own people but then he should not have been surprised he had been witness to plenty of the aftermath of the bloody and bitter civil war somehow though this one pathetic creature caught between two warring sides through none of her own doing affected him more deeply than the rest perhaps it was because the gross injustice of his situation served as a powerful metaphor for the madness that drove countrymen against their brothers of a sudden he was aware of just how monstrous was this game in which he had chosen to play if you had only told me he said weakly i would have dispatched men to see to her safety huaishan han turned away it was not a time when i could think of her shi tong zhi i had my job to do it was dangerous this double game and i found all my mind concentrated on placing one foot in front of the other in the dark making my way in the tunnel down which you and mao tong zhi sent me he turned back to zilin considering your own personal circumstances i think you of all people can understand that it had not been meant as anything other than a compliment a show of the degree of intimacy of their friendship but this statement cut zilin to the core it was true he had abandoned athena and the baby jake as well as his mistress sheng li and their child who would in adult life take the name nichiren all for the sake of protecting china of carving out for it the proper future he had sacrificed everything for his devotion to his country zilin looked at his friend and said i do not recognize that uniform it is of the public security forces huaishan han said the pride returning to his voice lo juiqing has put me in charge of the peking district bureau the secret police zilin said that is how i came to find senlin my friend our internal forces are powerful now our strength is growing every day i sent my people out to find her and find her they did he turned and his voice changed senlin we must go now zilin watched her as she rose she handed him the empty cup then bowed to him quite formally after they had gone zilin sat at his desk the lines of calligraphy swam in front of his eyes he tried to concentrate on them but could not instead he saw senlins hands as they gripped the white porcelain cup her long palm the slender fingers so delicate and white as powder only their nails cracked and bitten to the quick marred their transcendent beauty when he next saw her her nails had grown out and they had been worked on by an expert they were glossy with lacquer and as gently curved as a swans neck i dont know what to do with her huaishan han said they had come to zilins for dinner leaving the womenzilin had invited a female acquaintance over as well as another couple in order to get away from four an evil number in chinese numerology the two men had made themselves comfortable in zilins study the third couple who had a newborn infant at home made an early departure what is the problem huaishan han smoked a thin black cigarette of russian manufacture he had a habit of flicking it even when there was no excess ash but then huaishan han in zilins opinion was a rather highstrung individual who rid himself of excess energy through his work when he was between assignments and merely doing the drudgery of paperwork he was difficult to be around for long as now he rose and began to pace back and forth across the deep winecolored carpet the problem is senlin frankly shes not the woman whom i left when i went to war she has been through a lot zilin advised why dont you give her some time time huaishan han snorted i dont have time there is far too much to do already my head is filled with my work important work mind you i cannot have these constant interruptions at home mmmm what kind of problems the doctors tests reports interviews buddha alone knows what else huaishan han delivered this last in quick staccato bursts as if his anger and frustration was making him tonguetied through all of this he continued to prowl the room like a caged tiger what precisely is senlins problem zilin asked i dont know well is it medical or emotional what huaishan han blew out a long cloud of smoke his breath hissed like that of a great dragons no one knows buddha the doctors can tell me nothing theyve tried acupuncture acupressure herbs it would take all night to list them and senlin you saw it yourself tonight at the table she ate nothing at all didnt you think that odd she wasnt hungry huaishan han threw up his arms buddha shes never hungry she drinks tea but that is all she consumes she is losing weight what huaishan han puffed away like an engine yes of course she is what creature wouldnt she was already dangerously thin when you found her way below normal then from what youve been telling me zilin said she should be dead by now his friend stopped his pacing long enough to stare at him and yet she is not perhaps that is what the doctors seek an answer to whatever the question huaishan han said resuming his prowling they have found no answers and time is running out why i have been given an assignment of the utmost political importance by lo tong zhi it entails my leaving peking huaishan han ceased his pacing at last perching on the arm of a carved wood chair i am going south my friend to hong kong and thence perhaps even to taiwan guomindang agents emanating from the nationalist regime in exile in taiwan have been found to be infiltrating our military units perhapsand this is lo tong zhis theoryeven our political bureaus huaishan hans face was dark there may come a time when a purge will become a political necessity when we will have to weed out the traitors from within our midst and when that time comes it will be our people who will find these vile traitors this was the second time that zilin could recall his friend using the phrase our people huaishan han was referring to the public security forces there was zilin thought no more fervid ideologue than the converted one huaishan han once having made the jump from nationalism to communism was now its most ardentand rigidenthusiast i cannot leave senlin at home alone a nurse perhaps or a female companion huaishan han shook his head neither will do i have no intention of making my wife into an invalid i want no nurses around as for a female companion there is none that i know or trust sufficiently for the task but surely she must have family naturally she does but senlin is a soong descended from the soongs so she tells me there is not a soong or a kung of note left even on the island of taiwan they have all fled to america with their lives and their wealth he shook his head there is no one he stubbed out his butt in an iron ashtray that is why i must ask you my friend if you will look after senlin i know that you are wise if anyone can find out what is wrong with her i trust it is you zilin said nothing he had dreaded this moment from the time he became aware that huaishan han might ask this of him the thought of having senlin around the house but there was no question of his answer he could not refuse his friend it would be impolite and worse a slap in the face of their friendship zilin at last nodded all right he said huaishan han stood he possessed a military bearing now that was unmistakable to a politician such as zilin this was a disturbing sign politicians learned to use the soldier but never to trust him what a great pleasure it is to look at this lake mao said he and zilin strolled side by side along the bank of kunming lake they were within the impressive precincts of yiheyuan the summer palace this series of buildings temples pavilions gardens walkways and mounded islets eleven kilometers northwest of peking had been built for the successive generations of chinese emperors who felt the need to abandon the heat and high humidity of the imperial city during the high summer even you shi tong zhi cannot know how many times kunming has changed shape and size each dynasty had its complement of architectlandscapers who saw fit to redesign this lake over and over mao put his hands behind his thick back yet here it still stands its waters unchanged there is i think a lesson to be learned from this spot on earth he breathed deeply i often come here and gaze out upon the water i let my mind wander as if that way i may be able to discern all its previous shapes all its previous lives he shook his head yet i find myself reluctant to absorb its message china must change shi tong zhi and i have no illusions about that change it will be painful and it will be bloody it has already been bloody enough for me mao gave one of his tiny enigmatic smiles hush that is not in the spirit of the true revolutionary shi tong zhi you have a heart that i find impenetrable death is part of change in all upheavals in all true revolutions shi tong zhiblood must be shed the old must give way to the new it is the blood of the old regime that enriches the earth that the revolutionary tills our revolutionaries wield guns not plowshares mao nodded for the time being that is so and perhaps it will always be thus our enemiesnot ourselveswill determine that china has been insulted enough by the unwanted presence of the imperialist barbarians we will never again allow ourselves to become weak a target for invasion the americans themselves have seen to it that i have an iron fist they pour aid into taiwan they train guomindang agents to infiltrate our mainland society in an attempt to destroy us i tell you they will not succeed this interested zilin since it paralleled his conversation with huaishan han you have been talking with lo juiqing with lo tong zhi yes mao acknowledged and with huaishan han they paused at the apex of mirror bridge across the shimmering water they could see south lake isle with its pagodalike dragon kings temple the islet was connected with the shore by the stunning seventeenarch bridge the buildings vermilion turquoise orange and verdigris green rose up from the still blue waters across which white herons and egrets swooped in long arcing dives the birds skimmed the translucent surface of the lake plucking thrashing fish shining silver and gold in the sunlight from just beneath there mao said you see how the birds feed there that is how the imperialists have treated china they have plucked from us our natural resources for decades they have grown rich off our land caring nothing for the suffering and poverty of our people zilin thought of the succession of chinese dynastic rulers who had done the same thing but it was not his place to say such a thing besides his mind was filled with what mao had said just before it is my belief that huaishan han received his orders from lo tong zhi not for some months mao said what a find that man is i really must congratulate you zilin i have kept my eye on him ever since you brought him to the ministry of public security the man is fearlesshe proved as much to me during several missions i knew nothing of these of course you didnt mao commenced to walk again and zilin was at his side internal security is not your province besides i know that the firm hand i am forced to keep at home displeases you why then should i burden you with the details of such er unpleasant operations what has huaishan han been doing for you oh he is part of the state machine mao said easily and you have heard me say more than once that the state machine is often an instrument for oppression that is what concerns me why mao asked are you not also part of the state machine zilin made no reply he was thinking of huaishan hans repeated references to our people since lo juiqing had created the public security forces within his ministry they had grown in size and power far beyond zilins expectations he said so now nonsense mao replied our revolutionas all revolutions has spawned radical changes in our society of course there must be pockets of those who believe in the old ways of course there must be pockets of those who do not believe in the sweeping changes we have made and are continuing to make and the tasks of regaining control of an economy destroyed by war and of establishing a nationwide administrative hierarchy sensitive to pekings desires only add to our burden and then there is the external threat of the nationalistamerican alliance authoritarian methods are sometimes the only alternatives without them a country would collapse during periods of rapid social and economic change tell me shi tong zhi how else am i able to stabilize a country this vast under these circumstances zilin walked in silence his head down lost to view were the magnificent pagodas and temples shaded walks and whispering trees he saw with his minds eye that a cord linking modern china with her past had now been severed he saw too what no one else did that this separation was irreversible china could never go back there might be gainwould have to bein order to justify all that would be irrevocably lost the old skills will wither and die away beneath the banner of the revolution he thought when at length he looked up again he saw that these magnificent structures had been built by a people already alien to him his heart broke in unutterable sadness there is unhappiness in your eyes she said and pain in your heart senlin her name meant great forest and in a very strange and compelling way it was apt for zilin felt lost when he was near her he was a man who had spent almost all his life developing a strategy adapted from that used by his childhood mentor the jian the jian had lived in suzhou a town of the most renowned and spectacular gardens these yuan lin which were in fact villas surrounded by gardens were carefully tended painstakingly built the jian lived in one such and slowly he revealed to the young zilin the secrets of the yuan how hills ponds and the like could be fashioned by the hand of man to seem as confluent to the environment as if created by nature this art of remarkable artifice zilin eventually discovered could be translated to the world outside the yuan one could become whatever one chose to be so long as one knew how to create the artifice appropriate to the circumstance thus zilin had eventually joined the chinese communist party in order to fulfill his destiny as celestial guardian of china his commitment to communism was purely a pragmatic one he had seen very early on that it was the concept behind which all of his countrymenso long wrapped up in petty internecine warfarecould unite in order to return control of china to the hands of its native sons to this endeven to have developed this strategy in the first place his qi was extremely powerful and well developed it was his qi which allowed him to see into the very hearts of those around him in order to don his many disguises and thus get that which he wished senlinthe great forestwas the one person with whom he had contact whose internal riddle he could not solve this was at once a subject of concern and attraction to him compounding the enigma was the fact that he knew her own qi to be strong he could in fact feel that hers was almost as powerful as his yet he was at a loss as to how it manifested itself few indeed would be the people who would see her as strong certainly it was clear that her husband did not then there were the incidentsincreasing in frequencywhen she was able to see through this meticulously constructed artifice no one not athena or mai had been able to do that now as they sat within his villa on a dark still evening she had done it again zilin had given up denying her insights the first time he had done so she had looked at him with her wideapart ebon eyes and had said is there a reason why you are lying to me he had been astounded but there was nothing but the simplest honesty in her voice and on her face like a child yet to be sophisticated by the adolescent and adult worlds she had opened her mouth and said what was in her heart zilin was to recall that imagery with great clarity in the weeks to come for now he said it saddens me to see what has become of us i do not understand she had the most endearing habit of canting her head to one side her thick black hair gleaming richly in the lamplight slid across her shoulder repression appears to be the only way in which to keep china functioning at the moment the internal and external pressures are far too great for us to long tolerate we have already gone through immense and painful political and social upheavals my sense is that the agony for us is far from over many lives are yet to be lost there is not yet enough blood spilled how can the future dictate such cruelty when the present is so brutal senlin watching him in the pool of soft light said ask buddha in him we must seek our refuge unfortunately zilin said buddha has no place in modernday society is that what mao tong zhi writes if so you would be well rid of him my husband as well abruptly she turned her head away shadows fell across her cheek spilling downward like a river at night zilin wondered what had made her break off so precipitously was it the realization of her antirevolutionary words or something else he wondered what else huaishan han had not told him his friend had lied to him about the source of his assignment he had mentioned lo juiqing by name when he had not had to why perhaps it was only for security reasons that would be acceptable and in all probability the notion would have successfully pacified zilin had huaishan hans recent behavior remained the same but the fact was that he was rapidly becoming unrecognizable as the man with whom zilin had formed a bond on the slopes of jinyun shan like the new china itself huaishan han was hardening his heart donning the colors of the revolution he was striking out with maos gun in his curled fist maos philosophy filling his head to perform buddha only knew what unspeakable tasks he is part of the state machine maos answer to his question offhand and evasive stuck in zilins mind like a warning flag huaishan han believed that what he was doing was making china a safer place in which to live he might even be right which was even more frightening because zilin suspected that when mao sent his friend abroad in the land people died silently swiftly without even a ripple of comment the instrument of oppression carried out his appointed commissions does senlin know what he does zilin wondered does she suspect what he has become he rose and went to the window outside he could hear a nightingales iterative call he inhaled deeply scenting rain it was still some distance away but it was coming as he watched the darkness came alive with the forked flicker of lightning when the second outburst licked downward he judged the distance the rain will not last long he said even as the first rumble of thunder echoed in the hills tomorrow will be a fine day perhaps you will venture out except to see one doctor or another senlin never went outside the villa when she made no reply he turned from the window to contemplate her you cannot remain in here forever was what he should have said but he could not bring himself to do so it was something perhaps with which huaishan han would have scolded her that zilin would not do she was so frail looking it seemed to him watching her now in the soft lamplight that her skin was as fragile as eggshell her luminous eyes regarded him without apparent emotion and not for the first time he found himself wondering by what magical art she was able to conceal the nature of her spirit from his probing powers huaishan han told me several times before he left that you would not speak zilin said he feared there might be something wrong with you senlin held out her hands palms up her crimson nails glittered there is a world here she said softly raising her right hand slightly and herenow the leftanother the doctors the doctors enjoy enigmas she said when they can find none to occupy their minds they create them zilin came away from the window and sat down next to her do you mean then that there is nothing wrong with you senlin stared at him wordlessly would you go outside tomorrow if i went with you i do not care for the world outside emotion electric and fleeting transformed her face it is harsh and ugly it is evil i long only for the days before the war we will never return to that you can be most cruel there were tears trembling at the corners of her eyes i speak only the truth those enormous eyes dropped from his and when she spoke next it was in a tiny whisper you asked before why i spoke with you and not with my husband now you have answered your own question zilin thought about that for a moment he has lied to you her head came up only because he lies to himself the confirmation of his own suspicions came like an electric shock he saw the tiny tremor in her temple and decided to change the subject you cannot stay inside the villa for the rest of your life that is a kind of death what does it matter i am already dead her eyes held in their depths the green burning flames of a land wholly alien to zilin he did not know what to do for her he only knew that he must try to end her strange innerdirected torment outside a crack of thunder reverberated nearby senlin started her head jerking around on her neck her eyes were open wide as the first burst of rain slapped against the windowpanes it is nothing zilin said only the rain it is everything but she seemed not to be talking to him senlin she gave a great shudder and her eyes fluttered closed he reached out and she slid against him his arms went around her to hold her up then just to hold her her face was but a breath from his he felt her warmth and more the pulse of her he felt as if he had downed a bottle of whiskey in one thirsty gulp lightheaded unable to catch his breath fully he drew her closer to him senlin her lips were halfopen and her sweet breath fell upon his cheek like spring rain the heavy cascade of her hair fanned out it seemed to caress him as if with a life of its own it was part of some mythical creaturea qilin perhaps then he realized that she was swaying her long pentup emotions breaking through the barriers of icy iron she had erected so that now the two of them linked by the warmth of their bodies were tossed as if on a tide closer and closer so that zilin felt the softness of her cheek a peonys petal against him no with an inarticulate cry senlin broke away from him and staggering to her feet ran across the length of the study senlin please thunder booming rain beating its rapid tattoo please he took a quick step toward her not knowing what she would do or even what she meant by that single strangled word the reflection of the rain ran obliquely across her pained face as she wrenched open the glass door out to the garden and the weather came rushing in with the fierce whip of a tigers tail the shades rattled an eerie unsettling sound and senlin rushed out into the rain zilin followed her calling her name the deluge had turned night into the pitch blackness of a well branches like a spirits withered arms shuddered and shook in the wind which caught between the side of the villa and the high garden wall swirled around upon itself picking up strength the sound of its passage through the trees moaned in their ears zilin caught up with her just as a violent streak of lightning forked downward overhead by the flutter of its acid illumination he saw her abruptly reverse herself flying into his arms burying her head in his shoulders molding her body to his he moved to bring her inside but she refused to be budged she brought her face up to his her lips opened rain danced off her face flew through her hair as if they were both part of the wind zilin felt as he had atop the horse riding bareback with ross davies up the slopes of the red silk mountain together they dropped to the sopping ground he pulled aside her clothes as she frantically opened his never had he felt such urgency not with either of his wives not with his mistress or all the women who had followed them into his bed the physical the emotional were both supplanted at this moment but by what he could not say his flesh tingled at her touch her lips when he enclosed them in his tasted of the most exquisite nectar the rain drumming on them all around them pressing leaves and twigs to their bare flesh felt to them like an extension of their own molten passion the rumbling of the thunder sounded in their ears like the growling of some great primitive cat rampant and eager when zilin bared her breasts he nearly wept with longing his fingertips traced her skin drinking in its superb smoothness free of blemishes or wrinkles his lips soon followed as he moved down her in the shadowed dell between her thighs he discovered the heat and he made her cry out her lithe body undulating upward her head back mouth open drinking in the downpour while her neck arched in a moment she had taken him in her two hands guiding him through portals flowering open like an anemone instantly he felt in the midst of a dream in china it was this way as one slept ones hunspiritemerged through the top of ones head at the spot where the bone was the last to harden at the beginning of ones life what one dreamed one experienced it was as simple as that dreams therefore were no less real than waking life now as zilin penetrated to senlins soft clinging core his spirit rose out of his body in the midst of the kinetic storm it mingled with that of his partners upward they flew in an endless helix of motion sound color scent the sweet smell of wet grass the cant of a curious pair of plovers huddled within the shivering branches of a pine the color of the wind turned mauve and electric blue by the raging tempest motion force qi as their cries of pleasure mingled with the long moaning cries of the wind zilin was at last made witness to senlins unleashed qi and understood everything war as zilin had predicted the following day had turned out fine but mao was in a foul mood even the exceptionally clear weather had failed to soften his attitude war he fumed is all around us our economy can ill afford another warespecially one in the foreign land of korea our people cry out for peace they look to us for leadership and support not for a further effort which will leave chinese blood soaking into the ground of another country perhaps zilin said we should be looking for a way to turn war to our advantage you do not understand mao said impatiently the americans the nationalists are like hungry sharks lurking in the waters just offshore if we go to war they will wait until the military expenditures have further weakened us then they will strike as of now the counterrevolutionists are relatively few and weak a renewal of war will give them fuel like pouring kerosene on a fire their cause abetted by the nationalist agents will begin to pose a serious threat do you suppose i can allow that to occur not at all zilin said mao stood quite still they were still in quarters that had been turned into a suite of offices from hotel rooms out the window was tienanmen square the whirring of the clouds of bicycles through the wide avenues was a constant sound through the open windows i want you to understand this clearly so that at a later time when perhaps you have a different taste in your mouth you will not come to me with your conscience bleeding and petition me for surcease what are you asking me from another office zilin could hear the clackclack of a barrage of antiquated typewriters upon which propaganda leaflets were being banged out by a squadron of efficient clerks just this mao said war with korea will bring disaster here no matter what advantage you may cook up for us internationally the economy will collapse yet again and worse there is the distinct possibility that our actions will create our own political nemesis in order to forestall such a catastrophe we will be forced to depend more and more on the ministry of public security the secret police if you would call them that yes i cannot condone a reign of terror for an instant zilin feared that he had gone too far there was some color to maos cheeks unnatural as womens rouge there was silence between them so taut that zilin could imagine biting through it with one snap of his jaws mao sat down he closed his eyes massaging the lids with his thumbs when he was sufficiently calm he said i do not believe that either of us have a choice you believe that war with korea is inevitable inevitable zilin said and desirable intermittently there were bells ringing tiny sounds as the typewriters came to the end of their lines some minister stopped in to ask mao a question and was quickly dismissed after a time mao said you had better make yourself clear shi tong zhi i am in no mood for jests you know me better than that mao zhu xi hearing the formal address mao turned let us be rid of this tension between us my friend it serves both of us ill i have no wish to be at odds with my most trusted minister zilin bowed pressed the palms of his hands together in front of him moving them up and down in the honorific as a physical manifestation of his words mao set about making tea and nothing more of a business nature was said until it had been brewed served in the traditional manner and savored by both men by that time they had talked about many other topics of a personal and sometimes trivial nature following the natural pause at the end of the easy dialogue mao said please be good enough to explain to me your theory concerning war with korea zilin nodded poured himself more tea you have already told me that stalin is adamant about acting should the americans cross the yalu and invade north korea i have said that he is of two minds about this mao corrected he is committed to seeing that all of korea is eventually ruled by the communists to this end he sees no alternative but to dispatch russian troops to the site of the conflict if the americans come to the aid of the south koreans such a decision would spell disaster for both sides perhaps the entire world zilin shook his head no mao tong zhi it is china which holds the key to stalins dilemma and with it we may open the door to our own salvation how we inform stalin that should macarthur advance across the yalu we will send troops into korea we are in a much better position than he to do this since we can say to the world at large that we have merely sent volunteers to aid a neighboring fraternal communist regime will any westerner not believe that the koreans are our brothers in that way we may join the battle even if the united states intervenes they will be on as tentative ground as will we they could not afford a direct attack on us world opinion would be against them yes i see mao said and stalin would be put into our debt i could get out of him more aidperhaps even unencumbered aid this time but there is the matter of troops to be sent transport the remnants of the guomindang armies stranded here let them shed their blood for our cause let them be the first chinese to join the koreans in expelling the americans from the north zilin put his teacup down and we both know that will happen mao long zhi we have made it our business to study general macarthur he will cross the yalu so this is to be our fate mao said we must serve as moscows catspaw in order to earn their trust and their capital aid it is always thus with the weak zilin said but history is mutable we must endeavor to make our own so that one day we will be strong enough that moscow will fear us not the other way around the first thing they saw was fazhans spirit screen in its center was the symbol of the creation of the world which as every chinese knew came about as the result of the union of a tortoise and a serpent surrounding the central symbol were arrayed the eight trigrams these consisted of a series of combinations of continuous and broken lines symbolizing male and female respectively the possibly mythical emperor fu hsi claimed that the trigrams were the basis for mathematics every possible combination and juxtaposition were to be found within the trigrams from power to submission to representations of all the important animals in the chinese mythology to the points of the compass the spirit screen was a sign in accordance with the precepts of feng shui the ancient art of geomancy screens such as this were set at a site filled with evil spirits in order to get past this screen evil demons were obliged to make a right turn which every chinese knew that they could not do in fazhans foyer was an enormous mirror it was painted in the same manner as the spirit screen outside had been carved this was a further sign of the virulence of the evil influences that must be deflected in order to make this place safe senlin balked when she saw the mirror the spirit screen and its obvious significance had disturbed her enough the mirror seemed to unnerve her completely she turned away from it and zilin felt her trembling like a doe against him it is all right he said staring at their reflection in the interstices of unpainted mirror there is nothing here to fear why have you brought me to this place her voice was small wavery as water because you must be helped zilin said gently your husband was correct on one count no physical doctor can cure your malady that is why we have come here but it is an evil place no he said it is merely a place where evil dwells fazhan the feng shui man picked this spot specifically in order to draw the evil spirits inward to confine them chain them down and thus render them powerless but the spirit screen this mirror both will repel them zilin nodded the evil is not within this house within fazhans garden is a well a spirit well it is he says a well without bottom it is within the spirit wells depths that he imprisons the evil spirits something in his voice caused her to look up into his face you do not believe any of this do you i believe there is a xin jing in fazhans garden zilin said slowly but as to what dwells within its depths i am not at all certain senlin gave a great shudder and drawing in her breath said well i am im very sure fazhan had a fierce mongols face his skin where it appeared from out of the voluminous folds of his black robes was as parched and leathery as an elephants skin his head was long and narrow his body followed suit he was also tall which added immeasurably to the sense of power he exuded fazhan was a black hat feng shui man there were many forms of geomancy this was the most ancient and the most mystical the origins of black hat feng shui were said to have been in india the birthplace of buddha from there it traveled northward into tibet when at last it migrated from out of the land of great mountains it drifted south into china by then it had gained power and influence from each country and culture where it had been practiced over the centuries zilin bowed in front of the feng shui man and senlin did the same she was plainly terrified of him greetings great lion fazhan said using a play on zilins name it is good to see you again his voice was a vast rumbling seeming to fill the room like faraway thunder the good fortune is mine silver burtons zilin said to be here with that he handed over a slim red envelope for just the space of a heartbeat it appeared then it had disappeared within the folds of the feng shui mans robes senlin observed these exchanges silently but with a great deal of interest neither of these men used the modern honorific tong zhi comrade further they used nicknames that connoted a deep and abiding personal friendship zilin turned and speaking softly presented senlin and a capsule summation of her recent history even before he was done fazhan had begun to move zilin stood off to one side of the room leaving senlin on her own in the center the feng shui mans gaze so much like black fire was intolerable for her so she kept her mind occupied by staring at her surroundings they were in a room nine meters by nine meters the ceiling was painted a stark white but the walls were overhung by a series of calligraphic scrolls while senlin could not read them since the style of writing was ornate and the language archaic she was certain that these were surras or perhaps extracts since one complete sutra she knew could fill an entire book oddly she did not question how she knew such an arcane thing by the time zilin had finished recounting senlins history the feng shui man had made three complete circuits around her at length he stopped in front of her he said she has the aspect of the phoenix that is good the phoenix has its roots in royalty with the dragon it rules the capital of china he turned and lit three joss sticks he placed them one at a time before a small applegreen figurine that crouched by the side of a gilt buddha please speak to me fazhan said and senlin trembled at his voice it was dark as woodsmoke and seemed to her to be as aromatic surely it was the joss sticks she was smelling had voices a scent you were tortured it was not a question yes she whispered how were you tortured silver buttons but the feng shui mans upheld hand cut zilin off senlin stared into that long mongol face and thought she saw someone else a countenance she knew yet did not know if it is painful fazhan said think of how a wound aches even as it is healing consider that it must do so in order to heal there were shadows she began i remember there were shadows all around perhaps they came from the men moving beyond the fires there were fires burning all around did i mention that her voice held an odd echoey quality as if she were speaking to them from some distance away the men came at me with the fires at their backs i could never see them see their faces the absence of light and heat gave me clues as to their movement but always firelight was in my eyes there was an overpowering stench that made me want to gag there were piles of broken bones those were all black and scorched as if they had been roasted in the fires they were the bones of the japanese the shadows told me and bones of the nationalists a shadow bent down and i felt the passage of something it must have been a weapon because i saw the shadow hold up the severed arm of a chinese soldier see he said see what we do to nationalist scum and he thrust the hand into the flames there was a great crackling and hissing as the dripping blood sizzled and the fingers the fingers began to move i began to scream and the shadows began to laugh i screamed and screamed as i watched the fingers moving even as the fire ate through the skin even after i realized that the movement came from the fire itself the heat the inner combustion i saw that hand blackening writhing still as if in the most intense agony when the hand was gone and nothing remained of even the bones the shadow threw the stump into the night i heard dogs barking panting and padding just outside the circle of the firelight then the shadow grabbed me and untied me it took me toward the flames now i knew the origin of the cloying stench it was the burning of human flesh i saw how the soldiers were defiling the ming corpses cutting off their manhood and pressing the sides of their jaws so their mouths gaped open it was hideous unspeakable senlins breast was heaving uncontrollably and her words were gasped out almost as if she was being choked by them she was shivering as if with the ague but by a commanding gesture the feng shui man held zilin back from her you said ming corpses just now fazhan said senlin started as if he had put a branding iron to her flesh i did she blinked heavily i dont remember of course i meant the japanese corpses it was the japanese corpses there was a hollow look in her eyes why would i say ming the ming dynasty was overthrown three hundred years ago fazhan turned and lit three more joss sticks he placed them beside the first three already halfburned in sixteen fortyfour to be precise he said by the end of the fifteenth century the end the ming dynasty was in sight remorseless mongols from the north barbarous japanese pirates along the east coast were constant threats chronic poverty caused by the ever increasing popularity of large servanttended estates lower and lower bowed the back of the pitiful peasant until at length these inhuman injustices brought on a groundswell of protests and then strikes by the workers in the major mercantile sectors despite the intervention of a newly formed secret police the people cried out for justice banding together and all the while the power of the ming emperors was waning until by the time of wanli at the close of the century much of the dynastys power had devolved into the hands of the court eunuchs in sixteen twentyone shortly after the time of wanlis death those who opposed the mings rule overran peking this internal war was the signal the manchus had been waiting for down from the north they swept when they reached the capital there was tremendous bloodshed eventually the victorious manchus proclaimed the qing dynasty the room was filled up with the curling scent of the joss sticks there was heat as if somewhere out of sight a fire had been lit what do the ming and the manchus have to do with senlin zilin asked in feng shui one deals with many aspects of the world fazhan said some are obvious others are hidden in dark corners ordinarily however one deals in rushr that which is within the scope of our experience in these cases cures are often simply effected since humans have within them the five elements earth fire water metal wood all people possess these five to one degree or another measured upon a scale of one to seventytwo imbalances in one or more of these elements are most often the cause of an individuals feng shui problem fazhan took up three more joss sticks and lit them now there were nine grouped around the jade figurine and the gold buddha nine the full figure in numerology the most fortuitous of numbers occasionally fazhan went on very infrequently one comes upon a subject for which rushr is inadequate when one has exhausted all the known quantities at ones disposal one is obliged to seek answers elsewhere in chushr areas outside ones experience zilin could see through the smoke that senlin was trembling she turned to him and said please take me back to the villa zilin i implore you zilin looked from her pained face to the feng shui man who stood silent as a statue the tips of his long fingers touching for the first time in his life he did not know which course was the correct one his mind told him to stay but his heart torn by what his eyes saw urged him to take senlin and flee zilin please there is evil here her eyes were wide and staring she was clearly terrified i fear the evil will consume me and so it shall fazhan said if you leave here now no the one word was torn out of her throat fazhan spread his hands i cannot stop you from leaving neither can zilin no one has that right senlin you must understand that if you do not stay of your own free will there is nothing i can do to save you save her zilin said save her from what from whatever is consuming her from the inside what is it zilin asked chushr the feng shui man said senlin gave a little cry so strangled and full of despair that zilin took her by the wrist and led her out of there down the long dark corridor he heard sobbing an eerie echoing sound as if like the voice senlin had used to recount the horror that had befallen her it came from far away at the entryway they passed by the spirit mirror senlin turned to glance at it and stopped so abruptly that for an instant zilin was thrown off balance no senlin said in another voice entirely i cannot leave not yet not yet the evil they both started as fazhan appeared from out of which shadow he had stepped zilin could not say nor would he wish to try it is time the feng shui man said earth fire water metal wood none of the five will avail us an answer chushr he began to lead them in another direction where are we going zilin said to the edge fazhan replied of the xin jing the garden at night it was filled with white mulberry trees the same species cultivated by the weavers and off which the precious silkworm fed there was an odd spicy scent about them that was unfamiliar to zilin there was a cold silver sliver of moon the horns of the dragon so it was said the height of the feeding cycle for nocturnal predators they made nine circuits around the small garden nine in mandarin meant long life much of chinese numerology stemmed from the fact that chinese in all its varied dialects was a homonymous language often numbers sounded like other words and therefore took on the significance associated with those words the nine is important tonight the feng shui man said perhaps even crucial this is the twentyfourth day of the fourth month four twentyfour the most inauspicious day of the calendar zilin who knew cantonese as well as fazhan did understood why the number four in cantonese sounded like the word die thus four twentyfour was die and die again a number to be shunned at all costs why zilin wondered had he decided to bring senlin here this night still you are here fazhan said echoing zilins thought and that is significant in and of itself if the four twentyfour is the proper time then so be it the tao of perpetual change tells us that only at the apex of the darkness can the first light appear fazhan then led them to the center of the garden here there were vines all around and the luscious scent of roses though surely it was too early in the year for such blossoms when they were completely enclosed within the bower formed by the overarching white mulberries the feng shui man placed them as he saw fit senlin he said face this way toward the slopes of the black tortoise mountain zilin here this is where you must stand near the rock formation of the crimson phoenix and i here at the mouth of the green dragon he nodded his long head now the qi will rise bubbling like lava from where it swirls endlessly at the core of the planet senlin was aware of a great darkness before her what is this she said pointing the spirit well fazhan said there was no wind at all and no clouds to speak of the dragons horn moon rode in the firmament as the final enigmatic punctuation on an otherwise blank page now fazhan began to speak in a kind of rhythmic litany his words were of no chinese dialect zilin had ever heard perhaps they were not chinese at all he thought but rather some ancient tibetan or indie tongue it seemed that the heat that had suffused the room of surras had followed them out into what had once been a cool spring evening now it was as hot as high summer the budding mulberry leaves seemed to droop and sweat sprang out on all of them zilin looked at senlin her eyes were fixed and staring into what invisible space he could not guess as if in some trance she took a step forward then another until she was at the lip of the spirit well her hands came up and by the cold light of the horned moon he saw her grasp the stones at the wells top she began to lean over until her face was hanging suspended over the great maw whose inky blackness was beyond color senlin could not breathe she tried to inhale but it was as if she had entered an airless space where her lungs refused to work she no longer heard fazhans arcane incantations rather she felt it his words cloaked her and at the same time began to pull her out of herself she felt again the sensation she had experienced with zilin when they had joined their flesh in the storm of the previous night the top of her skull seemed to dissolve and somethinga part of herbegan to emerge then she felt the pain and knewknewthat there was someone else inside her this was the source of the evil not fazhans house or garden or xin jing it had been this malevolent presence inside her who had sensed a danger herefor itself not for senlin senlins jaws were clenched her eyes were tearing and there was an agony inside her beyond all understanding curved talons raked against her insides weals of pain sprouted and she tried to cry out she could do nothing inside the airless space over the spirit wells mouth she swayed and would have collapsed into those infinite depths had not fazhan woven his invisible web around her now a blinding light shone inside her head and for an instant senlin was transported back in time to the sacking of peking by the enemies of the ming she relived the atrocities inflicted by the conquerors upon the vanquished she was witness to the death of the dynasty the bloody terrorfilled ending she was the emperors consort and she recognized the face of li zi cheng the general who had once been her lover and was now her mortal enemy li zi cheng ended her emperors life with one appalling blow then he took her up and threw her across the room she withdrew a dagger from its sheath against her breast and tried to kill him but he only laughed and struck her so hard across the face that she let go the weapon then he was upon her he raped her taking his time about it his member hard as jade all over again thrusting viciously into her a second time when he was through he ordered all the soldiers in the room to take her by ones twos even threes they eagerly complied she was a long time in dying at least her physical body had perished but not her spirit it had survived and even now it craved revenge it sought only to destroy was there any intelligence within it beyond that one elemental desire zilin knew none of this of course until later but he did see senlin bent over the wells mouth he saw her convulsed by awful spasms he saw her mouth come open far wider than he thought possible in human anatomy and he saw the flash of light bluewhite corrosive enough so that it seemed to sear his eyes his vision blurred painfully and after that he was never certain whether he saw or merely imagined he saw the smoke of centuries curling like that of the nine joss sticks in the room of the sutras from out of senlins gaping mouth it seemed to him that it streamed and floated at the same time and that simultaneously his nostrils caught a heavy whiff of that same sickly sweet stench that senlin had described and which zilin had himself smelled so often during the war flesh was burning and now the smoke began to curl forming itself into a shape the apparition of a young woman made itself manifest its eyes were large around its nose a skeletons fleshless socket there were arms as well ending in fingersor perhaps knowing the predilection of the mings nailsnearly half a meter long but the torso was as thin and undefined as a serpents body as an astounded zilin continued to watch that reptilian form commenced to entwine itself first around senlins shoulders and then around her neck and head he cried out but in that instant fazhan stepped aside so that the feng shui man no longer stood in front of the mouth of the rock known as the green dragon zilin was aware of a rising wind and looked around for its source for the tops of the high mulberry trees were as still and droopy as ever they had been since the trio emerged into the garden it was then that he saw that the unnatural wind as cold as an icy stream in winter seemed to have its origin within one of the horizontal crevices that indented the green dragon the horrific apparition that was part of senlin and was also trying to kill her turned its head as it felt the first gust of wind then the water came another rainstorm one might have said except that the water was running horizontally into the face of the apparition the icy water flew smoke spinning water spitting the rush of a heavy wind and the burning in the trembling shimmering air a howling a gusting and in a silence wholly unnatural in its completeness the apparition was gone the heat was gone the garden still and utterly serene shone peacefully in the moonlight fazhan picked zilin up off the ground zilin looked the feng shui man in the eye what happened fazhan smiled opening his cloak slightly he said you see great lion i still have the row of silver buttons sewn inside my clothes nothing has changed did i see nothing has changed fazhan reiterated and senlin the garden is yours do with it what you will the spirit well sleeps now alone within the bower of the mulberry trees zilin went to where senlin stood trembling she was still gripping the lip of the stone well but as she sensed his presence she turned and he saw that her eyes were clear she is gone zilin said nothing he wondered if this had all been a dream the consort of the last ming emperor hu chao zilin knew it was nonsense of course it was a dream she was swaying like a drunkard at the end of a long evening perhaps she did not even know what she was saying he took her up into his arms her lover became her enemy she whispered reedily he was a general named li zi cheng her head rested against his chest and he felt her words like the rumbling of faraway thunder he carried her along the circuitous path out of the garden her eyelids were heavy it was not until they had returned to the villa and he had put her to bed that zilin went into his study searching along the rows of books he plucked a history down and leafed through until he came to the period of the decline of the ming dynasty in during the sacking of peking that brought the manchus to power in china a rebel army was indeed led by a general named li zi cheng there was likewise a reference to the last emperors consort but since a good deal of his power had already been usurped by the imperial eunuchs and he was thus considered by many chinese scholars to be unimportant her name was not mentioned zilin went from history to history but no matter how detailed they otherwise were he could find no trace of the consorts name but all of peking was at his disposal and at length an obscure library tome delivered up to him her name hu chao iii formation vivarta spring present jiao hong kong miami kyoto moscow beijing washington karuizawa amid the storm with the pain that enwrapped her this is what qi lin thought i am an animal i have been an animal for months without end if i am to survive now i must become civilized easier said than done qi lin raised one filthy hand to the wide purple bruise the enflamed vampires kiss where colonel hus spatulate thumb had dug in and in desperation had snapped her collarbone pain throbbed through her but that was something she was used to pain was her friend her only constant companion while colonel hu convinced her that black was white love was hate pain was feeling and comfort nonfeeling that death was life using pranadeep breathingshe assigned the pain to a specific compartment of her mind while she tested the use of her arm it was all right as long as she kept it below shoulder height beyond that point she could feel the broken ends abrading and from shoulder to fingertip her arm went numb which meant there was a nerve involved she knew enough to understand that she needed to get to a doctor that she suspected would not be the problem it was silencing the questions she would have to worry about but first the forest she needed to rest but she was all too aware that she was a fugitive on foot in this weather there was a finite distance she could travel before she passed out her pursuers would know that and certainly they would already have calculated a circle using the compound from which she had come as its central point no matter where she went they would eventually find her so the trick was not to fall into the trap of trying to outrun them better by far to outthink them she looked up and the rain beat against her fluttering eyelids she grasped what she had to do it meant using both her hands her arms lifting them up over her head the alternative was death gritted her teeth and reaching up grasped at a jutting branch went off the forest floor high up into the arboreal foliage on a limb perhaps one hundred fifty meters off the ground she stretched out and holding her aching arm fell into a deep and dreamless sleep when she awoke it was almost dawn scenting the air she came down from the tree swinging and halfsliding she heard voices and froze clinging to the bole until they faded away then she put her feet on the forest floor and got out of there as quickly as she could just over two kilometers away she broke into a farmhouse and stole clothing and some food staples she knew that it was as good as leaving her spoor for the dogs but she had no choice insinuating herself into a group of women working an enormous stretch of paddy fields qi lin worked all day pulling up the tender shoots of rice and at days end received a ride on a belching rusted truck she made friends with a woman and on learning her name moved off to another part of the field after lunch introducing herself around as the womans fourth cousin no one seemed curious and she was required to answer few questions it was after dark when she reached town where bleak unadorned housing reminiscent of barracks stood brooding in militarylike rows on the way they passed a series of mills sprawling factories sparking ironworks and the like she found the physicians residence and knocked on the door because of the lateness of the hour she was obliged to wait several minutes at last a small window on the second story opened and a head peered out streetlight flashed on round steelrimmed spectacles in a moment a hand beckoned her around the corner qi lin followed the directions and was admitted through a small doorway hidden in the shadows of an alley younger sister he was a homely man bandylegged and potbellied he wore an oldstyle coat and pajamalike trousers his long mustache quivered when he spoke his mouth was small as if echoing his soft voice his spectacles shone in the lamplight sending reflections batting off the walls like frightened moths she kowtowed in the old manner intuiting that would impress him elder uncle a thousand pardons for my appearance early this morning i slipped on a root in entering the paddy fields her fingertip gingerly touched the bruise just below the hollow of her neck i think i broke a bone the stoopshouldered doctor clucked his tongue you should have come right here then qi lin made her eyes go big and round oh i could not elder uncle i could not afford to miss even an hours wages you see my boyhes only threeis quite ill in hospital i must travel constantly to see him he cries for his mother isnt it right that i should be by his side bringing tears to her eyes but i have other children i must feed elder uncle and no man to provide for the family but surely the state the state the state she cried working herself up i would not be an orphan of the state nor suffer my children that fate either ah little one the doctor said you know what confucius said about pride but he was obviously moved he shuffled forward now let me see how badly you have injured yourself qi lin watched as he parted her blouse and began his work tell me if you will exactly where i am elder uncle you are just past the shen dao the way of the spirit the sacred way down which the ming emperors rode during their funerals on their way to the tombs his touch was light and deft nevertheless she made herself gasp when he was probing and he clucked his tongue again this village is known as jiao zhuang hu perhaps you have heard of it it has an important place in our modern history during the war the peasants here built a network of underground passages in order to hide from and spy on the invading japanese they stand to this day a monument to the ingenuity and courage of the chinese mind he paused a moment then turned and swabbing the area with chill alcohol inserting two long needles into her flesh the pain was instantly gone qi lin looked at him as he said i must now set the break little one perhaps you will want to look away qi lin laughed so hard to herself that she almost began to cry again oh old man she thought if you only knew the blood i had seen more in my short time on earth than even you she averted her gaze because it was his wish there he said after some time it is done he began to apply an herb poultice wrapping it with adhesive bandage a true blending of the old and new then he went over to a small gas stove and began to heat water she watched as he unscrewed bottles jars flagons flasks pouring first this liquid then that powder into the pot on the stove out of one container he produced a solid object from which he cut a piece and using a mortar and pestle ground it up that too went into the pot he hummed a little as he worked it wasnt until after he had obliged her to down the foultasting concoction that he went across to his small shabby desk he took up a quill pen and produced an officiallooking sheet of paper now little sister i must have your name address and work number the first two would not be an immediate problem qi lin knew but the third would be impossible he would require that she present her documents this of course she could not do other than the setting of her collarbone this was the reason she had come here now that she was on the verge of civilization again she needed the proper documents to move about at will that was not easy for a fugitive in communist china the tunnels she said slipping down off the examining table i beg your pardon this famous underground labyrinth you spoke of she approached him carefully so ingenious i would like to see it will you take me when now but of course now pumping enthusiasm into her voice what better time isnt this when our ancestors took to the tunnels in order to spy on the japanese well yes but then what good would it be to see them in the light of day she smiled besides right now i need something to take my mind off my shoulder after a slight hesitation he nodded all right she had hit all the right buttons colonel hu would be gratified to know that a significant part of him lived on within her the doctor led the way he lit a magnesium torch as basement stairs turned a corner into a blank wall he pressed somethingan irregularity in the rock formationand they went through in the flickering semidarkness she said i want you to show me the way to beijing he paused his old rheumy eyes looked into hers you will need papers in the capital he said then you will provide me with themhe shrugged i am no forger little sister she smiled i saw the photograph of her on your desk i saw her dress shoes in a corner of the room her eyes were steely your daughter he held the torch higher so that the shadows danced like madmen along the seeping walls who are you i am chinese she said i am not chinese he heard the defiance in her voice you are not from anywhere around here no not from the mainland she watched him taiwan she laughed i am not the enemy not the guomindang but you would not hesitate to kill me elder uncle she said you would not want to have lived my life the heaven cannot help being high the earth cannot help being wide the sun and the moon cannot help going around and all things of the creation cannot help but live and grow he said quoting from laotse then you will give me your daughters papers it is futile to contend the doctor squinted into her face i see that you have yet to learn that lesson and he nodded you are older than i little sister yes i see that i yield to your desires thus he took her back up to his office and conferred upon her all the identification she required to move about in the world outside back down in the labyrinth he took her to the western edge of the warren of tunnels here he said pointing up at a rickety wooden staircase through the copse of firs you will come upon a road it is well traveled by vehicular traffic no doubt you will get a ride to your destination qi lin said i might still kill you yes you have seen my face you know in which direction i travel i have seen also the face of the fox outside my window he said i know in which direction the wind blows others actively seek what i already know but they are defeated why his gaze was penetrating and with a little shiver of recognition qi lin saw that there was more to him than she had imagined they do not follow the tao he said they contend therefore others contend against them like me you have killed before little sister i see death in your eyes i have killed to survive and in so doing you have killed yourself he said softly she snorted despite a growing pain gripping her heart you wish me to believe that you want to help me i have no such power little sister but you do not believe me she insisted i killed out of necessity is that so the pain was strong within her the blackness seeking to overwhelm her it was the blacknessor more precisely the fear of itthat drove her to kill colonel hu he was my creator her voice had dropped to a whisper reedy and ghostly and i destroyed him the old man watched her with black beady eyes his face betrayed no emotion her inner agony was evident he built me over took the essential clay and he transformed me now he is gone now i am free you yourself can see the folly of those words he said qi lin said nothing she knew that she should strike him down where he stood and be done with it leaving him alive was risking a clear trail behind her in the moonlight perhaps this is what your creator did the old man said turned you into this soldier i see before me must i tell you that soldiers are the instruments of evil the tao knows the way one who controls others possesses muscular resources the strength that endures comes from controlling ones own nature she put a hand to her aching head i do not even remember what it was he was training me for something comes and goes a shadow on the wall something passed across his face what has been done to you perhaps even the tao cannot change shadows chasing after shadows the pain in her head and coming after the shadows the blackness qi lin gave a soft cry hit the side of her head with her balled fist you are dangerous she gasped through you they can catch me then you must see that never happens he said it with such openness that qi lin was taken aback your death means nothing to you oh yes he said it means something to me but it is insignificant compared to the rivers that flow in the sea meaning he was so calm those who are able to cease action as well as initiate it will long endure all others are doomed to die young qi lin looked at him for the longest time she was aware of her heart beating the blood coursing through her veins the flick and pop of the magnesium torch close to guttering shadows extending themselves along all sides sliding up the dank curving walls meeting at the arch of the ceiling all others are doomed to die young took one last look drinking him in as she shoved the papers into her waistband up the rickety stairs ascending out of the inconstant light she would not kill him was that a victory or a defeat from out of the darkness she said goodbye elder uncle remember the rivers he said into the space she had just vacated that flow to the sea when bliss closed her eyes she saw the gem its fire shone out across the bosom of the ocean red gold a flash of bronze and she thought why is this opal so important on board her fathers junk she arose from sleep and hearing voices pulled clothes around her body and went out of her cabin on bare feet she moved down the corridor it seemed to her that she had heard these voices in her sleep that they in fact had been the reason that she had woken but they were so soft that she could scarcely believe such a thing still was it any odder than the episodes she had been having ever since zilin had died putting the soft down over his sunken face pressing down while some other voicehis voicein her mind commanded her to do what she herself could never have faced doing buddha will forgive you bousehk he said as i forgive you but could she ever forgive herself that was still a question with which she grappled voices in her head like time elapsing a week a month a year the eons spoke to her while her conscious mind slept she felt sometimes as if an entire host resided within the recesses of her mind she was not alone and she was not afraid zilinthe jianwas with her he had died yes and she had been his executioner what had transpired between them at the moment his mortal self had ceased to function she could not say perhaps she thought now they had both somehow passed through the resonant membrane into dahei the great darkness in that magic arcane space who knew what transformation had been worked of one thing bliss was certain thiswhatever this waswas part of zilins plan he knew of his death had wanted her with him at that moment hadnt he trained her for it hadnt he brought her to dahei times before in preparation she was sure of that now in preparation for what is as you can see of exceptional quality heard her father close now speaking in hushed tones great red fire a superb example australian isnt it danny number three son it was very late four in the morning almost i want you to find out where this was bought bliss at the cabin door fingertips pressed against the wood picking up the vibrations of conversation still half immersed in dahei aware that her place was inside the cabin rather than in the corridor father three oaths looking up dannys round face so similar to that of his fathers swinging around bousehk are you all right a constant query these days the look of concern on his face an agony inside her but how to explain to him what was taking place inside her when she herself was unsure yes she said im fine i was dreaming of a great jewel a fire opal filled with crimson flame glancing down and seeing in the center of the table the object of her dream the opal the very one and before either of the men could say or do a thing she reached between them and scooped up the stone bousehk father a thousand pardons for interrupting you but it seems that i have seen this opal before with an effort she lifted her gaze from its heavy fire i overheard you asking danny to find out where this was bought is it important for a moment three oaths considered lying to her for her own good he was worried about her but felt unable to come to a decision as to how to help her now seeing the look in her eyes he knew so well he did the only thing he could told her the truth jake gave it to me before he left for japan he was followed by an operative who delayed him from reaching the junk when he had planned to the night zilin was murdered did zilin know of his arrival i think so yes bliss staring into the face of the opal turning it over and over at the slender tips of her fingers the fire broke apart and coalesced in its aqueous glimmering she thought she could see the countenance of the jian bousehk father i would like to it is out of the question he snapped afraid for her it is for danny to do he would you keep me here like a prisoner what nonsense three oaths protested you are free to go when and where you wish as long as my sister ling accompanies me bliss said and when he made no reply like a patient then i do not he broke off turned to his number three son danny please leave us the young man nodded and when the door had closed on his back three oaths said bousehk bousehk what would you have me do send you into known danger when i am uncertain of your physical state the only danger she said angrily is that i will die of inaction and worry over jake this is what you have consigned me to three oaths shook his head i do not think that you yourself are aware of what is wrong with you nothing is wrong with me roar of dahei inchoate power but you are right i am not the same as i was before my godfather died she sat down on the chair that danny had vacated ran a hand through her hair shi zilin was my last link with my past his mentor the first jian was my greatgrandfather it was to shi zilin that my mother came in her time of greatest need without him i might never have been born certainly i never would have come to hong kong never had you as my father yes i am different and i dont deny it there is a void where before there was energy a connection i accept his death father buddha willed it joss but i cannot be unaffected i am not the same and i cannot pretend that i am no one is asking you to be he said softly well then three oaths contemplated this young woman whom he had raised and wondered at the boundlessness of his love for her i will not sacrifice you to the service of the yuhnhyun it has already been done she said you made that decision long ago father you have trained me now please allow me to do what i was molded for i regret too late for regrets father and three oaths knew the wisdom of her words thus he capitulated and gave her all the information jake had passed on to him regarding the fire opal when he was done bliss smiled and leaning over kissed him on the cheek at the same time she closed her fingers over the stone jake heard voices the dead were shouting in his ear their bones rattled setting his teeth on edge their naked jaws clashed together with an alligators snap their bony fingers pointed clicking like insects mandibles their message seemed important which was why he supposed they continued to shout jake said nothing their tirade persisted unabated he wondered what it was that could be so damned vital the cacophony was beginning to annoy him if he was dead nothing was that urgent if he was not dead blackness mutated into charcoal a whiff of grit blown into his face he began to choke on the smoke as the gray began to swirl coalescing light blood and skin flecks of flesh made bright by the quick gush of crimson the result of the bisons invasion of mikios house the percussion opened his eyes throwing mikios body into him ribbons of skin in gaudy gauzy patterns with the kimono the great threelobed wheel kamon the komoto crest bursting apart the percussion opened his eyes and saw that he was lying in a room made all of polished cedar mangling mikios body tangled up in his the heat already forming a sheet of screaming fire and in the end just before consciousness was extinguished the horrendous sight of what was left of mikios face only blood and bloody bone pink and shiny a grinning death mask saw a line of shoji partly openthe green of trees beyondand on the other side of the room a closed fusuma a wooden door with an opaque center panel of brocaded silk as he watched it slid silently open on its track heard a bird begin trillingfrom the trees outside he could be sure of nothing senses still filled to overflowing with the percussion the weight of mikio hard against him a human body coming apart beneath the strain of forces too great to bear mikio my friend a corridor of shadows opening up in front of him and jake squinted as a figure entered the room on silent tabid feet it approached and bent over him jake looked up willing the ghosts of cordite and smoke away the white noise of the percussion from his burning ears up into the face that he knew so well mikiosan the first thing andrew sawyer thought of when it began was ive got to find the zhuan then knowing that was impossible since he had no idea where the zhuan was he grabbed the phone in his cubicle and dialed three oaths number far below him the floor of the hang seng hong kongs stock market was a maze of activity like a pit of writhing snakes the motion was nonstop and frenetic sawyer reached inside his suit jacket peeled his expensive silk shirt from his clammy skin it was stained soaked through with sweat damn it he thought anxiously as the phone rang at the other end of the line where the hell are you his nervous gaze swung like a pendulum from the numbers on the high board to the hive of activity surrounding peabody smithers and tung ping an two of the largest investment brokerage firms the signs were unmistakable from both quarters at last the burring stopped and sawyer gasped in a breath weyyyy its begun he said the worst is happening where are you the hang seng the hong kong stock exchange its bad worse than bad today id gladly take bad home to bed with me ill be right over three oaths said dear god sawyer said into the already dead line he replaced the receiver with a hand already numbed by shock and fear next to him his assistant was continually passing slips of paper over to him with fifteenminute updates on stock transfers and movements they all pointed to the same thing and had done so since the opening of the trading day blocks of ten thousand shares of interasia stock were being bought up at sporadic intervals by the two brokerage firms peabody smithers and tung ping an what was odd about that was that the blocks were not being disbursed because interasia was a relatively new issue and because of the volatility of the hang seng great fluctuations in price and selling and buying patterns were not uncommon during the course of the days trading it was also usual for sawyer who was nominal market caretaker for interasia to monitor all purchases of blocks of over one thousand shares his network ran checks of who the trading firms were buying for even if that often led back to nothing more than dummy corporations disbursements as much as buy and sell orders gave sawyer and the other senior members of the yuhnhyun the pulse of the market kept the multiarmed corporation running smoothly today though between them the two brokerage firms had bought up close to seventyfive thousand shares of interasia stock yet there was no record of any disbursement whatsoever this fact more than any other had set sawyers nerves to twanging uncomfortably interasia was under corporate attack but by whom he heard a disturbance behind him loud enough to bring him out of his nervous musing he turned around and his jaws clicked shut with a painful resound three oaths was hurrying up the elderly chinese was pastyfaced beads of sweat stood out along his wide forehead bad news he said gasping as he entered the cubicle sawyers assistant had to give way in order to make room for him in the tiny space more than this sawyers hand spread out to take in the crowded floor below i dont think you grasp the gravity of southasia three oaths interrupted the news of the scandal is all over the colony oh mother sawyer collapsed back into his chair in a moment he had begun to shake the bank the run is on three oaths said and unless it can be stemmed right away were not going to have sufficient funds to cover it godbleedingdamn it sawyer had visions of his entire life going to waste all the work sweat and dedication to building sawyer sons into one of the preeminent trading houses in the far east and what for he asked himself to have it all end in disaster christ no his blazing eyes locked with the other mans we just may lose southasia and interasia in the same week fornicate unnaturally all our enemies three oaths rumbled that means well lose control of pak han min and kam sang just what my elder brother warned we could not allow kam sang sawyer cried who in the name of the holy trinity cares a poxridden dog about a project six hundred miles away that we know nothing about anyway its our own trading firms thatre on the block now if interasia is successfully raided well have worked all our lives for nothing do you understand honorable tsun nothing at all you gave us quite a start yumitori the holder of the bow it was an honored title given to a warrior of rank a master archer who was calling him yumitori mikiosan who would know that he was a kyujutsu sensei other than is it really you he started upward in order to see the face more clearly in the rooms filtered light and a shaft of pain seared through him easy jakesan mikios soothing voice yes it is i but please you must take it easy youve had a bad time of it but how he felt a pressure on his shoulders holding him down and turning his head saw a young woman in a persimmoncolored kimono beneath she showed just a line of underkimono the color of flame he turned his attention back to mikio his head was reeling how he whispered i saw you die in your study i was there when your enemies fired the bison i felt the explosion tear your body apart that body is what saved your life mikio komoto smiled down at jake but behind it there was a great deal of strain i tried to warn you jakesan i tried to keep you away it had to be done in an oblique way since i suspected that all my communications were being monitored by my enemies i deliberately did not answer your calls i thought perhaps youd understand and accept the difficult circumstances i bade kachikachi send you back to hong kong when i received news of your arrival here hong kong is where you belong neh not here in the midst of my war but it was my error my friend i forgot just how persistent you can be i am eternally grateful to the amida that you were not seriously injured tell me jake said what happened it was a ruse mikio said he wiped the flat of his hand through the short bristles of his saltandpepper hair it fooled you well then it fooled my enemies as well as you may have already surmised that was not me who you tracked from jisaku back to my house kachikachi jake suddenly remembered the diminutive yakuzas treachery all part of the ruse jakesan do not fear my kachikachi is still loyal to me still and always my friend but his roleplaying seduced the kisan clan into believing they could make one preemptive strike against me and end this bloody battle once and for all without an oyabun who will command the respect and allegiance of all the clan a war cannot be carried out then who died in your study a brave man mikio said a hero of the clan he volunteered it was a samurais death and while i mourn his passing i rejoice in his good fortune his kami will be exalted and now i have my edge over kisan in their eyes i am dead the position of my clan is untenable it is the end for us they believe i almost screwed the whole bloody brilliant scheme up jake said i should have understood your desires more completely i should have anticipated this you could not have anticipated my fathers murder shi zilin dead amida but do you know who yes jake said and mikio noticed that his voice turned bitter a dantai assassinated him mikiosan a yakuza dantai but that is absurd mikio said quickly his utter dismay was evident on his face i fought them jake said they killed my father and seriously injured bliss whos in hospital now there can be no mistake i saw their tattoos myself irezumi irezumi mikio breathed he sat back on his haunches but who would send yakuza to hong kong no oyabun i know of would dare risk so open a strike on foreign territory yet yakuza only take their orders from oyabun jake said that is one reason i had to come here mikiosan one reason why i did not use the ticket kachikachi gave me it is imperative that i find out who is behind my fathers murder his entire ring is under attack and there is no defense i can take without first knowing who my enemies are mikio nodded i see you did the wise thing jakesan the only thing possible his eyes were far away filled with thought but the amida watches over us he has protected you and for that we should all be grateful now but at that moment the kimonod woman touched his arm directing his gaze back down to jake whose eyelids were fluttering closed i see that it is best to let you rest mikio said gently when you awake there will be food and something to drink if you wish it time enough then to talk no jake said i want to talk now but it was only in his mind he was already asleep falling fast through the layers into restful delta tony simbal had been in miami beach a little over three hours when he spotted the cuban it was in a splashy joint called la toucana pastel bluegreen walls mirrors and a long bar built out of translucent glass blocks lit from inside by neon strips rattan chairs glasstopped tables the place was some zonkedout south americans dream palace it made simbal want to throw up dressed in a lightweight white suit beneath which he wore a royalblue tshirt he sat at the bar and had to keep his sunglasses on because of all the neon he ordered an absolut on the rocks he had pushed the sleeves of the jacket up his arms mainly because that was the style and he needed to look like he belonged here the cuban came in a little while later and his presence surprised simbal the cubans name was martine juanito gato de rosa with a name like that it was no wonder he was simply known around the campus as the cuban the campus was snit headquarters the cuban was one of snits expert operatives so it should have been no surprise for simbal to find him here the fact that edward martin bennett was also in miami was what caused the alarm to go off in simbals head there were plenty of other places around the world for the cuban to be at this momentin fact the cia was always sounding off about him and his effectiveness in the subcontinent as they so quaintly called south america this was a coincidence of large enough proportions for simbal to question it immediately bennett and the cuban how many scores had they been on together how many times had bennett claimed the cuban saved his life and vice versa plenty on all counts simbal had memorized bennetts snit file filched via the dea computer with monicas help monica when he thought of her now it was with an uncomfortable tightening in his lower belly what were monica and max threnody up to what was it max wanted from him simbal wondered for the hundredth time since he flew out of dulles whether or not he should inform donovan of his own suspicions he had opted not to it seemed enough for the moment that donovan harbored his own doubts about maxs immediate maneuverings he did not want things to get out of control while he was away from washington better he felt to play along with his former boss until he got deeper into the situation there was always time to make his report to donovan and bring in the cavalry or was it just that deep inside him he could not bring himself to believe that max could be working against him if he were working against simbal then who was he working for that was another question that simbal preferred not to have answered finally on the plane after going through bennetts file for the third and last time he had decided fuck it if he was procrastinating in making a decision regarding max so be it hed just have to take the consequences of his actionor inactionwhen the time came martine juanito gato de rosa cut a dapper figure in a pale peach suit that set his coffeecolored skin glowing his wavy hair was slicked back from his wide forehead shiny and formfitting as lycra there was a dusting of freckles on his cheeks that gave him a deceptively boyish air simbal knew that he was far from boyish in fact simbal had crossed paths with the cuban twice during his tenure in the dea once was on assignment in colombia and he had seen this slim handsome man with eyes the color of topaz slit open the throat of a cocaine smuggler with the ease and precision of a master surgeon it had been the cubans attitude while performing the act that had stuck in simbals mind if he wasnt exactly enjoying the task he certainly showed no repugnance simbal was always suspicious of peopleeven the ones in his line of workwho showed no adverse reaction to killing it wasnt natural and it was dangerous so he had marked the cuban down and some months later when they had met at a party on campus he was stunned to see how urbane witty relaxed how utterly civilized the man was he bore no resemblance to the bloody killing machine simbal had witnessed in south america there was some kind of voodoo going down something very odd indeed about the cuban these thoughts had reignited when he had come across the name so prominently in bennetts file now that he saw him here the flames were burning it was no accident that simbal had come to la toucana on his first night in miami according to both dea and snit files this was one of the new hotbeds of diqui and drug movement in the area he had been to the other two earlier in the evening lots of deals went down under its spangled roof all highlevel heavy money that allegedly ran all the way up to the mayors office kept the place clean of narcs and adversary types the monsters all seemed comfortable here eating long voluminous dinners laced with the kind of overpowering california wines that were all the rage and while they ate and drank they built their individual empires in this manner the wholesalers kept themselves in shiny imported sports cars luxury yachts terrazzofloored villas and deepcleavaged women whose only real interest was in staring at their own painted faces in the column mirrors the cuban fit right in he was flashy in the way only miami understands and appreciates a mixture of the hip the latin and the gaudy it was an interesting and potentially deadly mix he sat at a table at which a couple were already having drinks simbal searched the catalogue in his mind and came up with a name for the man mako martinez a heavy hitter on the cocaine wholesaling circuit the most interesting thing about mako what set him apart from the majority of his colleagues was that he was also an arms dealer simbal thought it curious that the cuban should be sitting down to dinner with this particular monster now he had two questions to answer why was the cuban in miami why was he making contact with mako martinez to his knowledge arms smuggling was right out of martine juanito gato de rosas bailiwick of course arms could have no place in their discussion tonight but it seemed like another coincidence and simbal didnt like that he finished his absolut ordered another and signaled the maitre d he was ready for a table in a moment he was being led right by their table simbal looked into the womans face and smiled her gaze was icy incurious he thought that in a fight with monica she could have knocked monica out with her makeup case the maitre d sat him two tables away and simbal chose a seat with an oblique view the second vodka on ice was brought and he ordered softshell crabs a caesar salad and asparagus vinaigrette despite the fact that the maitre d extolled the virtues of the charbroiled steak brazilian music was blaring through loudspeakers and to one side there was a dance floor made out of lucite water seemed to be running in colored rivulets beneath it the meal was mediocre but then miami was not noted for its culinary level it didnt matter much anyway since he had his eye on the cubans table the men were deep in discussion the woman was staring fixedly at something in tight pants reflected in the mirrored columns the men spoke in desultory bursts simbal could just make out the language spanish it happened in the way simbal wanted mako dismissing his woman as the conversation got around to business the cuban had to shift his position in order to facilitate her egress and he caught sight of simbal pinlights rotated above the dance floor and now there were several couples moving sinuously to the latin beat there was something here that reminded simbal of the jungle or perhaps more accurately of something that put aside civilization there was more than a bit of the ritualistic splendor of cultures more primitive and therefore in his opinion more valid than this one simbal called for the check he was aware of the cubans eyes on him but he would not look up he took his time paying the bill then sauntered out of the restaurant plenty of time for the cuban to follow him the valet brought his rented corvette around and simbal had no choice but to get in there were others in line the place was just heating up but no cuban simbal looked from the main entrance to the street beyond neon spangled the pavement the enormous lighted bird above la toucanas name moving its head up and down in a mindless cycle no cuban the beeping of horns became more insistent behind him he put the car in gear was it his imagination or had he seen one of the valets hurrying inside as he drove off there are approximately twentyfive million shares outstanding of interasia andrew sawyer said he wiped the sweat from his forehead with a linen handkerchief peabody smithers has in their possession four million unassigned shares tung ping an has oneandahalf million including what they bought in todays session dew neh loh moh on going public three oaths fumed its usually the best way to raise great sums of capital sawyer said by the spirit of the white tiger i sometimes think i would have been better off staying in the opium trade surely you dont mean that by the poxridden dungeating offspring of our enemies i do three oaths thundered there at least you know who your enemies are theres no chance at dummy corporations and liceinfested whores sons investment brokers acting as shields the two tai pan were still in sawyers cubicle though the hang seng had closed for the day hours ago they had remained in their command post awaiting confirmation sawyer knew the chinese was merely venting his rage at the thought that they might lose control of interasia virtually all of their own personal fortunes were tied up in the yuhnhyun corporation shi zilin had insisted that they give the zhuan power of attorney over all assets liquid and otherwise now there was precious little left with which to fight off this takeover bid if he had not owed such a debt to shi zilin if they had not gone public if if if bile rose in his throat at the thought that all his years of hard work would collapse about him in a weeks time weve had to close southasia bancorps doors sawyer said morosely there was no way we could keep up with the demand for withdrawals once the word got out about the fiscal shortfall southasia was doomed he slammed his fist onto the paperlittered table damn it all i dont know how it leaked out we were so careful three oaths spat i have spies at tung ping an many of the other trading houses why do you think that we are free of informers the hyeung yau the fragrant grease works wonders in the crown colony it always has money passes hands in return for information not readily available it is the way of life not in my company sawyer said you are above all the rest then ill find the informer better by far to concentrate on solving the problem he has created for us sawyer turned to the other and the next time we will be caught in the trap again three oaths was silent at that where is he sawyer said looking at his watch he was supposed to be here an hour ago are you worried that he wont come three oaths said he will be here when he can there is no point in arousing suspicions at tung ping an at this late date heya give bentnose time he is a good man an honest spy three oaths had a good laugh at that if there is such a thing i didnt think there was sawyer said sourly bentnose is my brotherinlaw three oaths said his loyalty is beyond question he laughed again besides i pay him more than enough to keep him happy the silence of the space below them was awesome in contrast to the bubbling babble when the hang seng was open for business in that vast echoey space now unnaturally quiet the footfalls though soft rose clear to their ears hes here sawyer said three oaths turned as a middleaged man appeared he was unprepossessing in appearance and would have been altogether forgettable had it not been for a nose that had been broken several times early in life what news sawyer said three oaths poured his brotherinlaw tea it was by this time tepid but the man accepted it thankfully he drained the cup and said i have the information it took a lot of work and i did not obtain it until just moments ago the office has been inundated with paperwork from the transactions on all the buy orders for interasia who has tung ping an been buying the blocks for three oaths asked sir john bluestone bentnose said bluestone sawyer said shocked but that is impossible three oaths said there must be some mistake when we baited five star pacific with pak han min nine months ago we made certain that its shortterm capital was depleted that was shi zilins plan in implicating his enemies in beijing who bought up five stars notes he shook his head no no sir john has too much debt to be behind all this buying but it is him bentnose assured them he thrust out a handful of xerox copies take a look the two tai pan read the flimsies they confirmed what bentnose had said wheres he getting the money to sink into interasia sawyer said i wondered about that myself bentnose su said so i rang a friend of mine at peabody smithers a consortium has been formed brotherinlaw i checked our own recent records tung ping an has been selling large chunks of illiquid holdingsreal estate businesses and the likefor these people here are the names three oaths read them over handed them on to sawyer we know them all he said bluestones mates business associates men who owe him favors hes called in all his markers the proceeds from the sales are being used to finance the interasia purchases bentnose su said jake and shi zilin never could have anticipated such a thing three oaths said stunned sawyer crumpled the paper in his fist that tears it despair was evident in his voice bluestone means to get control of interasia and because of how jake and shi zilin set up the firm i dont think theres a whole hell of a lot we can do about it his balled fist slammed down onto the polished desktop god damn his eyes bliss took the opal to the monkey man his name was chanshe knew of no one who could tell her his first name in any case to her knowledge no one called him anything but the monkey man he had a shop on yat fu lane in kennedy town it was a dusty ramshackle affair from which he sold just about anything one could imagine on one side was an apothecary dispensing mandrake root whole ginseng and powdered tigers teeth to an avid chinese following on the other side was a large rug factory as she passed bliss could see the young womenlittle more than girls reallyhanging the patterns for the men on bamboo scaffolding who wielded electric shears to perform what was euphemistically called hand cutting by dealers anxious to fleece the gwai loh tourists chan was called the monkey man for good reason he had a face like an orangutan it was part of a head too large for the small stooped body this posture perhaps was what caused him to seem to have arms longer than any human should the monkey mans physical oddities never bothered bliss as they had many children of her acquaintance when she was growing up now he was old venerable in a way that transcended even the manner in which most elderly chinese arc treated he was of course delighted to see her the skin around his button eyes crinkled all the more as his strange face broke into a wide smile he called her tihn gaijai little frog because when she was a child he used to take her to a pond in the new territories to listen to the tree frogs singing their song of summer when he was finished with his customer he locked the front door and took her into the back of the shop this was where he lived and its contrast to the dismaying plethora of stacked items in the store was remarkable here every thing had its place free of dust sparkling like cut crystal he puttered around making tea for them bringing out sweet cakes bliss did not deter him he had always liked to make a fuss over her she watched him as he worked overcome with emotion in time they came to the reason for her visit the monkey man knew from the moment she walked into his shop that it was for a specific purpose but it would have been bad manners to inquire what it was right away bliss pulled out the opal and the old man hefted it in his leathery palm he produced a jewelers loup dragged over a table lamp and switched it on took a look excellent he said softly exceptional fire furthermore it is thick and has been cut by a master he looked at her swept the loup off his face how much did you pay for this nothing bliss said and told him how it came to be in her possession what she was searching for uhm not so easy the monkey man said ruminatively but you said that it was cut by a master isnt there a way to tell from that he shrugged i suppose yes but whoever cut it might not have been the one to sell it for all i know this was cut in australia where it was dug out of the earth bliss felt her heart sink there must be a way the monkey man weighed the opal in the center of his palm nodded perhaps he got up and went to a phone dialed a local number and for several minutes spoke into the receiver in low enough tones so that bliss could not hear what he was saying thoughtfully he put down the phone and came back to the table where she was sitting there is a way he said good maybe he shook his head im not an expert in opals i dont sell them you see as a rule if one comes my way well he shrugged again rubbed his fingertips over the smooth face of the opal i called an acquaintance bliss knew better than to ask who it was the monkey man was connected with a strange and varied assortment of types throughout the colony it was why she chose him to begin her search i was given a name but i hesitate to give it to you why have you ever heard of fung the skeleton the smuggler the monkey man nodded most of the opium that flows through here is handled in one way or another by fung he looked at her as it happens hes also interested in gemstones something of a personal hobby got a collection im told that would make any national treasury weep with envy then fungs my man bliss reached for the opal but the old man closed his fingers over it hes a dangerous man bliss laughed look at me im not a little girl anymore tihn gaijai this is not a joking matter a man who trades in the tears of the poppy has no scruples no morals no soul he might just as soon kill you as look at you is he the man i must see when the monkey man said nothing bliss took this for assent then tell me where i can find him she paused i have other ways you cannot stop me by not talking at last the old mans fingers uncurled and bliss took the opal from his palm it was warm from his heat do you know where the container terminal is he said along hoi bun road at kai tak kwun tong a mainly industrial district near the airport in kowloon the monkey man nodded the best times just before dawn im told he looked so morose that bliss reached out and stroked his unlovely cheek if youre hurt your father will kill me bliss laughed again you were always a worrier i am my fathers daughter what will fung the skeleton dare do to me the monkey man said nothing but as she left bliss noticed that he had switched from tea to johnnie walker red mikhail carelin lay in his bed and stared at the ceiling it was an unlovely sight being as it was waterstained uneven the paint so old it was patinaed plaster peeled in abstract patterns when he contemplated this ceiling what he saw was a landscape the abstract patterns of peeling plaster became continents rising up from a sea of spiderweb cracks and whorls though the bed was comfortable though there was a wellsupplied bath through a partially opened door not five meters away he was not in his apartment rather he was within the crenellated walls of the kremlin in a suite adjacent to his office a steamy noisewracked space in winter in the summer it was stifling it was next to the great corner office in which fyodor leninin genachev conducted much of his business genachev liked the night in darkness he would say is peace the peaceful times mikhail are for working even in the middle of the most atrocious cacophony one has time to dream carelin too preferred the night but for other reasons nights were a time for listening in the semidarkness of the kremlins labyrinthine corridors one could hear the cipher machines the pockets of night crews manning the worldwide networks of power genachev who was unusally not fond of cliches was guilty of using one somewhere in the world he would say it is always daytime therefore there is work to be done the night carelin knew was the time for clandestine assignations suborning of apparatchiki bribetaking venality was spawning in the darkness and there it fed like a city rat gorging itself on garbage and excrement selene always he was brought back to selene his activation code he had required nothing more of his source his mission had been preset the contingencies outlined the objective absolutely clear and yet so many things had changed since he had been given the missions parameters so many years in the darkness he had a fondness for the nighttime looking out windows so many different windows but mainly the one in his pink stone house on gorky street there in another room his wife dreamed while his world was just awakening treachery deceit the calm face of the ferret sniffing down holes filled at their far ends with sensitive secrets the lights of moscow at night winking and glittering as far off as stars like the ceiling at his kremlin office he created out of those lights his own landscape no man he had found was content without a country he had been deprived of one almost all his life so he played a game with himself a game of deadly seriousness he had built his own land out of the darkness and the strings of lights arcing across the moskva or along kuznetsov prospekt muscovites snug in their beds exhaling the fumes of vodka and cabbage creating fat laughing women out of dreamstuff while carelin returned to the land of his own creation like dracula rising each night to live again a certain kind of life so it was with mikhail carelin until his source had beamed him the one word code selene and everything had changed he had been trained to lie in the darkness and wait to take in the night that which did not belong to him and to transmit it far across the sea he had been trained to kill as well with a grunt carelin levered himself off the bed in bare feet he padded across the cold floor in the bath he ran the coldwater tap and put his head under the gushing water snorted as he dried off slung the towel across his bare shoulders he glanced at his watch three thirtyfive in the morning genachev was still on the phone with washington carelin knew this because genachev would buzz him as soon as he broke the connection at the window he looked out at the onion domes of st basils pale and golden in the illumination from the floods it was not enough he thought to say that everything changed when he received the selene code it had altered drastically afterward too when he had discovered that his source had been killed carelin had only been under discipline to one man when he was gone carelin found that he was in limbo who could he contact there was a mole in the organization to which he reported a mole in such a position at central that he could not take the chance of contacting anyone else there he thought fleetingly about getting out letting selene crumble into dust alongside its creator but he held no abiding love for russia though he had been born there it was only his work that made life bearable he had understood then that he had no choice that he must continue as a ferret or he would dry up and blow away like a paper bag but a ferret without a control was nothing who then to contact jake maroc had been the logical choice the only choice open to carelin as an exoperative jake knew the quarry inside and out based in hong kong no longer connected to central he was safe from chimera the only man in the world carelin could trust and there was one more thing maroc had been henry wundermans best friend more wunderman had been his mentor maroc deserved to know the truth so carelin had made contact and that had been that until of course he realized that he had fallen in love with daniella now he was god to destroy or to create that was the question and until this very moment he had not understood how agonizing the decisions god must make could be from the open door to his office not far away he heard the strident sound of the buzzer genachevs call to washington was over he was wanted took one last look at the nighttime lights of moscow if the answer was not there where would he find it the buzzer sounded again and he got out of there but his mind would not let him be jin kanzhe was on his way through the portals of heaven when it hit him he was with the acrobat she had a name of course but it was more exciting in his mind to think of her as the acrobat he had met her backstage after a particularly compelling performance of the dazhalen acrobatic troupe to which huaishan han had dragged him the old man had fallen asleep in his seat almost before the lights had dimmed a not uncommon occurrence and one which jin kanzhe could predict with frightening accuracy nevertheless he had quite enjoyed himself the troupe was nothing short of spectacular they liked rather artily he thought to title each routine during one called straw houses he noticed the suppleness of body the feline face that spoke of northern climes one woman among many darting about the stage yet something about her cut him to the quick she had in retrospect a way of moving over the stage that transcended grace she moved from her hips this excited him immensely he found in fact at the end of straw houses that he had a rather painful erection at intermission he had the car take the somnolent huaishan han home at performances end he used his official id to get backstage that made him something of an instant celebrity which he liked he did not see the acrobat right away lights and sweat rounds of tea and champagnewhich someone tried to keep him from seeing he laughed inside at that a sea of faces halfshadowed in the odd overhead theatrical spots turned into corners nothing of much interest really he had just about made up his mind that she had beat a hasty retreat when he found her his heart rolled over and he could not catch his breath news of his presence had already spread throughout the backstage area she seemed prepared for him flashing that smile he had seen from the other side of the footlights and he was lost now as he entered the soft moist portals of heaven he heard her groan beneath him she liked to be vocal and jin kanzhe unused to such a thing in anyone let alone a female could not stop himself from coming when she let go like that the acrobat was in the most extraordinary position beneath him her oiled flesh so firm and smooth rippled like the sea he watched her ankles part as she moved again her long legs high in the air near her shoulders this did something to the contours of her jade gate raised presented to him like a sacred offering that increased their pleasure tenfold the sides of her calves grazed his neck his loins began to melt he was all the way inside her her heat was incredible he felt as if he had walked into a furnace he was engulfed in a pool of liquid fire her depths too were prodigious she took him in and in and in jin kanzhe felt so inside her hips were dazzling in their movements she was a human rubber band he could not believe what his eyes told him was real he gasped air out of his lungs and she groaned he began to shoot heavily inside her and this increased her vocalizing she heaved like the ocean the sounds of ecstasy were like the wind in his ears the smell of their mingled musk was overpowering they had been making love for a long time to jin kanzhe it was like walking across rooftops delicate dangerous terribly exciting in the air above the hurried stream of everyday life apart beyond spurted and spurted into her and thought of huaishan han well not exactly the old man it was so odd he shivered abruptly he felt the strain of their contorted position on his arms his biceps began to jump and quiver sweat ran down the center of his forehead dripped from the end of his nose onto the burnished flesh between her small firm breasts the acrobat herself in the midst of the clouds and the rain was oblivious her face was contorted she ground up against him sealing her jade gate onto the base of his still rigid member flipped her hips once twice three times and gave a little yelp jin kanzhe was unmoved the image that had risen to the surface of his mind expanded by pleasure clamored for his attention he could see the study in huaishan hans villa it was nightprecisely which night he could not remember they had gotten drunk together talking about old timesthe old man running on about shi zilin jin kanzhe immersing both of them in the hell that was cambodia he must have dozed off in his dreams he heard the sonorous ticking of the old mans clock heavy lids grainy with alcohol opened to slits enough to see the old man staring at him a shaded lamp caused the hard glitter of those eyes to strike jin kanzhe like a physical blow then the old man reached out and pinched jin kanzhe are you awake he whispered when jin kanzhe made no move huaishan han nodded and moved away into the semidarkness of his study jin kanzhe was very tired the surfeit of alcohol still pulsed through his veins throbbing like venom his eyes closed and he slept at least that is what he had thought until just this moment then the image had surfaced brought to consciousness by his orgasm the ejaculation to be more precise image of huaishan han urinating in the bath adjacent to the study he squatted so old that he needed support the door ajar the old man reaching for the niche where the toilet paper lay toilet paper to urinate perhaps he was semiincontinent not unheard of in old people but why then was he reading it instead of using it jin kanzhe disentangled himself from the acrobats limbs in the process he slipped out of her jade gate and she gave a little cry of disappointment she wanted him in until the last possible moment he rolled away and began to dress it was very late she said arent you going to stay the night ill be back he said holding his hand out for the key she curled her amazing body into a ball and lifted her face toward him between her lips was a glint of metal the key to her apartment kiss me she said having no trouble enunciating with her mouth full jin kanzhe bent down closed his lips over hers slowly her tongue pushed the key past his teeth then it swabbed the inside of his mouth she smiled as he straightened up thats how houdini did it she said she was proud of her knowledge of arcane things his assistant passed him the key to his chains when she kissed him just before he was lowered into the water or the sealed coffin it was no good asking her where she obtained such odd bits of information hers was a mind jin kanzhe could not fathom the car outside her apartment took him out of beijing into the northern suburbs where huaishan han lived there was no traffic to speak of just the rumbling of truck convoys foodstuff instead of soldiers being delivered but it sounded the same jin kanzhe lowered his head he missed colonel hu the war in cambodia had linked them closer perhaps than brothers what they had endured together when two men are in desperate danger each day when with their bare bloody hands they kill an enemy in alien territory their bond is immutable jin tong zhi he started he had the feeling this was not the first time the driver had spoken his name yes voice thick as if he just wakened from a dream he could smell the acrobats musk upon him his flesh felt sticky coated with their lust we have arrived jin tong zhi he could see the driver looking at him in the rearview mirror go relieve yourself jin said im fine comrade do as youre told and take a piss jin barked he sat alone in the car for some time heard the engine ticking over as it cooled his tongue moved in his mouth tasting the odd metallic tang of the acrobats key he thought of houdini with some admiration slipped out of the car and did not close the door all the way the night was exceptionally mild a taste of better days to come the brief respite between the bitter winter and the broiling summer a nightbird twittered for a moment just above his head jin kanzhe went from tree to tree the old man always left a light burning in his study he was at an age when his sleeping habits were erratic he could sleep all day and be up most of the night cautiously jin kanzhe stepped up onto the wooden porch and fitting his laminated id card into the narrow space between the study door and its ancient frame he worked a trick houdini would be proud of the acrobat as well he peered in saw the study was deserted took off his shoes leaving them just outside the door crept soundlessly across the deco carpet swirls of silver slate gray amethyst on a sapphire field stumbled over something and went down on one knee cursing under his breath a slipper he pushed it out of the way remained motionless for a long time listened to the clock ticking away the seconds wiped sweat off his brow went on across the study pulled open the door to the bath here he knelt beside the niche and examined the paper it was a normal roll it was dark in here and he dared not turn on a light stuck his hand into the niche fumbled a bit found with accelerated pulse that there was a false back took out what was secreted behind it back in the study he hunkered down by the one lamp with a sheaf of papers they looked like contracts but they were all handwritten these must have been what huaishan han had been reading while he thought jin kanzhe was asleep jin kanzhe began to read soon the hackles at the back of his neck began to stir he felt a sickening lurch in the pit of his stomach the more he read the more the terror built the faster he read the more feverish he became to reach the end it was unbelievable beyond reason he had suspected that huaishan han was halfmad now he had proof now he knew what lay behind the old mans seemingly limitless power he remembered what huaishan han had said money is no problem it flows through my hands like an endless river now jin kanzhe knew why his wealth must be staggering almost limitless but at what a price to china have you read your fill jin kanzhe started his eyes rising as frightened as a deer caught in the spike of an automobiles headlights huaishan han stood in the black doorway to the corridor by his side was the great guard dog and jin kanzhes driver in the young mans hand was a pistol jin kanzhe rose what have you done to us his voice was clotted with rage and disbelief he waved the damning documents you will destroy us all hardly huaishan han said but i mean to gain my vengeance over shi zilin and his entire family this was the only way the only way jin kanzhe was incredulous your obsession has put this entire country at risk do you understand what you are doing huaishan han laughed oh yes he said i am killing you as if in a dream jin kanzhe watched hans ancient crabs claw reach out and pinch the great dogs brindled neck the dog growled deep in its throat and leapt unhesitatingly into jin kanzhes face the metallic taste was back in jin kanzhes mouth he felt the alien presence of the key between his teeth the sexual probing of the acrobats hot tongue that came after as he felt the fangs sink into his neck he wondered in a gray haze how houdini would have gotten out of this huaishan han blinked he held out his withered hand for the weapon and the driver deposited it make sure hes dead the old man said whistling the creature back at his side when the driver had carried out the command huaishan han shot him once through the heart with the kind of accuracy that once learned never fades at the appointed time three oaths sat down at the old shortwave radio and checking the series of codes jake had given him in order to reach apollo began the long complex process of call and recognition if the truth be known he was immensely excited this transceiver held many poignant memories for him it was with this set salvaged from his previous junk that he had kept in touch with shi zilin in beijing during many of the long years of their difficult but necessary separation for decades then this piece of wellrun machinery was all that kept the two loving brothers in touch with one another now all those memories swept over three oaths with the force of waves his eyes were wet with tears he missed his eldest brother fiercely all his life shi zilin had been there for seventy years they had beenfiguratively and literallyputting their heads together scheming for the future piecing together the great ten the harvest that china was now on the verge of reaping three oaths loss was immense his heart shuddered with the pain as he confronted the emptiness that shi zilins death left inside him he was unused to such deep introspection and nostalgia perhaps that was why he did not hear neon chow come up behind him and why when she put her arms around him put her face alongside his kissing him he did not give her presence much thought strictly speaking she should not be belowdecks when he was at the shortwave it was an ironclad rule of the junk so to speak and it extended to all of three oaths family i see the sadness in your face she said using her softest tone i see the heaviness of grief in your gait she hugged him gently here is what little i can do to help i know that it is inadequate compared to your grief no no three oaths said far from insignificant he was grateful for her warmth it eased the emptiness that gnawed at him he did not think of why she was here where it was forbidden to be close behind him neon chow opened her eyes on the shallow table that swung down by two brass chains from the bulkhead she saw a sheet of unfolded paper on it she recognized the writing of the zhuan who else have you now to comfort you to throw their arms around you to love you all through the night she whispered while reading what was on the sheet her pulse rose up into her throat and she felt the onset of a blinding headache she fought for control as the words jake maroc had written for his uncle began to make sense to her dear god in heaven she thought as she read the identity of apollo the quarrys mole inside the kremlin i must ask for an emergency rendezvous with bluestone she did not of course know that apollo was a quarry molethat fact had been communicated to three oaths verbally but she did know that this was the man who three oaths was contacting for jake hadnt he boasted to her just yesterday of the great honor the zhuan had accorded him hadnt he made certain she knew that she had been wrong about the zhuans motives hadnt he needed to show her that he still possessed as much power within the yuhnhyun as he had when shi zilin was alive yes yes yes a contact in russia he had told her inside the very kremlin now she had more than enough to piece it all together you he said now only you it took neon chow a moment to realize that he was responding to her own words so enthralled was she by the import of this fantastic piece of intelligence this evening she whispered licking his ear come to bed early i feel that you are in need of nightlong comfort her hand snaked down between his legs squeezed inward she felt him give a little shiver and she laughed leaving him then forgetting him immediately her mind filled with the accolades she would receive from bluestone when she delivered to him this fantastic prize the young woman her head bowed to watch her tiny feet in traditional tabi and geta came silently toward them she wore a kimono of pure white embroidered with pale peach peonies clutched to her breast was a small wrapped package as they watched she knelt before a vault where the image of kannon reposed an object of such extreme sacredness that it was displayed to the penitents only once every thirtythree years the sadfaced young woman bowed in obeisance to the goddess of mercy around her dishes of food and flowers spread color and scent in profusion her lips moved in silent prayer to what kami they did not know until she slowly unwrapped the small package and reverentially placed the tiny girl doll amidst the white and yellow camellias arranged on a fired clay plate then her sadness became as clear to them as the sunlight that spread itself over the valley below them this womans young daughter had recently died and the doll she had brought to the goddess of mercy was the little girls most prized possession jake and mikio komoto sat side by side their eyes filled with the womans delicate features her dark eyes brimming with pain and then as she rose and took one last look at the perfect features of the doll a solitary tear slipped down her cheek this is where they all come mikio said the women of kyoto to kiyomizudera the two of them were here alone without yakuza soldiers because of the attention the added men would bring besides mikio was supposed to be dead oh they come from all over really to petition kannon for a safe childbirth or in the case of this one to protect the kami of their dead child jake said nothing instead he savored the seemingly limitless view from this mountain buddhist temple of all of kyoto the verdant forest slopes up the mountain thick with burgeoning greenery and beyond the precisely ordered geometries of farmland through which tiny figures black with distance made their way my wife used to come here quite often jake listened carefully he had not known mikios wife and in any case for a japanese to embark upon such a personal topic commanded respect and a special attention he closed his mind to his aches and pains concentrate he demanded of himself she came mikio went on to petition the compassionate one to allow her to have a child it was difficult for her the doctors said that her uterus was tilted in such a way that it made conception unlikely mikio put his hands together almost as if he were praying they recommended artificial insemination but we found that somehow distasteful so she came here and prayed to kannon on this exquisite promontory where this temple was dedicated in seven ninetyeight she felt the goddess resided she felt that here the goddess would hear her they were on the temples vast cantilevered veranda which had been designed and built to view sacred dances nearby was melodious otawa one of the most renowned waterfalls in all of japan abruptly mikio rose and went to the edge of the veranda closest to otawa jake followed him and they both looked down upon the whiteclothed pilgrims their mittened hands raised as drawn within the protective barrier of the water spray they prayed to fudomyoo to guard against the deeds of their enemies we should be down there jake said we both need a lot of protection these days after a time he said without looking at his friend did kannon answer your wifes prayers you see me as i have always been jakesan sadly childless it was not enough to say he was sorry so jake said nothing perhaps jake said after a time indicating the supplicants within the rain of the waterfall they know something that we do not if so mikio said then well never know it out of the corner of his eye he saw a single tear sliding down his friends cheek and he thought of the young woman and her parting from her childs cherished doll he knew now why mikio had brought him here he still felt that he was responsible for jakes almost having been killed in tokyo it did not matter to him jake knew that it had been jakes pigheadedness that had been responsible jake knew that mikio had done all in his power to remove jake from the red sector jake had simply not paid any attention to the repeated warnings in mikios mind when jake was in japan he was the oyabunsthe yakuza bosssresponsibility period it was that simple and that complex now mikio owed jake a debt that he could never realistically repay gin as much as friendshipgiri entangled in friendshipwas what bound them so intimately giri was what obliged mikio to open up a most personal and undoubtedly painful part of his past to jake that had been an extraordinary moment and it was not lost on jake but love endures mikiosan jake said like the mountains and the seas love never dies he watched the pilgrims purifying themselves in otawas shower covering themselves with the glory of god perhaps that is all that keeps us going at times neh mikio never taking his eyes from the falls nodded wordlessly he understood silencethe silence of natural soundcovered them as completely as if they were standing at the bottom of otawa immersed in water within that camouflage jake saw a gray plover lift off from one branch to another without thinking his eyes followed the graceful line of the birds flight as it lifted and fell across the weight of the dark green forest rising ever upward until it crossed over their heads and disappeared behind the burnished facade of the bell pavilion the plovers motion remained transmitted to the two men in dark suits who came down the wide steps on the east side of the pavilion both had closely cropped hair angular faces they wore wraparound sunglasses with mirrored lenses they made no secret of the objects of their interest mikiosan jake said softly but urgently i fear the war has found us speeding down miamis intracoastal highway in his rented black corvette tony simbal did not hear the noise until it was almost too late doing eightyfive with the windows down the rush of the wind almost drowning out the rock beat of the stones coming over am turned up to deafening volume it was perhaps natural natural but inexcusable because it was the cuban calling to him martine juanito gato de rosa in a firered ferrari coming up alongside the vette screaming his lungs out one hand was on the wheel the other held straight out the open passengers window a magnum that could blow a mans head open like a ripe melon the gun was aimed at simbals left ear pull over you goddamned sonofabitch i said pull the fuck over snapping back the magnums hammer the valet at la toucana had done his work reported to the cuban the make model and license number of tonys rented corvette pastel highrises pink powder blue seafoam flashing by interspersed with clawed marinas where glossy whiteandblue yachts and fishing boats swung in lazy arcs sending bubbling wakes little clouds of diesel running after them girls in string bikinis cool sun visors over their pulledback hair nivea cream massaged into their sunburnt shoulders laughing with silverhaired millionaires hawaiian shirts open to the navel to display carat chains white ducks glossy white shoes anyone in new york city or washington would sneer at they hadnt a care in the world but tony simbal was being forced off the road by an animal ferrari and the black hollow muzzle of a hand cannon the quiet of the landscape seeped into the open windows of the vette the engine ticking over and to his left the traffic whizzing by at hummingbirds speed the red ferrari sun spinning off its long hood crouched just behind him as if it were manned by a traffic cop heard a car door slam and the crunch of shoe soles over the com position of the verge then the sun was blotted out as the figure of martine juanito gato de rosa leaned into the corvette simbal felt the cool muzzle of the magnum pressed against his temple you little piece of wormshit the cuban said in his clipped slightly skewed english i ought to blow your motherfucking brains out but i got too much respect for the interior of this automobile down boy simbal said he was careful not to move his head toward the cuban lets have a chat and i wouldnt shat with you on a bet wormshit cool down you got some fucking nerve uh coming down here putting your nose up my business i dont even know your business magnum jammed painfully against this temple he could smell the cubans musky cologne a bit of his sweat was he frightened of something of simbal you think youre gonna scare the shit out of me hijo de puta til have you know my mother was quite a lady martine simbal said the only whore i ever knew was your sister the cuban ripped open the corvettes low door he growled low in his throat get the fuck out of there simbal did as he was told what are you going to do he said shoot me with a score of witnesses passing by every thirty seconds listen we can trade insults all day if you want me ive got more important things to do like poach on my property makos all yours buddy simbal raised his hands hell i couldve walked up to you in la toucana i knew if i did that id blow everything what kind of everything come on martine this heavy shit thats going down with mako and eddie the cubans hazel eyes narrowed what the fuck do you know about it and what the fuck are you doing here anyway quarry sent me down simbal said there was no point in bringing the dea into it at this stage there was a diqui hit in chinatown last month big one their main man alan thune got blown away by party or parties unknown then one of the dea hounds by the name of peter curran gets his limbs separated from his torso in paraguay and the nazi subculture is blameless diqui again now im interested sos my boss the head honcho the big kahuna so here i am why here lets go somewhere nice and quiet and discuss this like men over a stiff drink the cuban lifted the so that the muzzle was aimed straight at simbals face why here simbal sighed because this is where edward martin bennett is isnt that right the cuban directed them to a little place on key biscayne with a spectacular view of downtown miami if one was fond of watching the decay that follows greed setting in great granite marble and smokedglass towers rose up in the same profusion that hens teeth sowed into the ground produced an invincible army hotels built almost overnight during the feverish years when it was thought gambling would be legalized in miami multimillions sunk into lumbering leviathans that now stood nearly empty silence filling up their cavernous interiors all in receivership functioning like limping men old before their time but beneath the shade of a faded striped umbrella the bay was bright and sparkling the powerboats streaking its surface like water spiders setting a low background rumble the cuban sipping at his rum and coke and saying you know i think they were insane man to change this thing this great american thing what thing cocacola dude the cuban looked at simbal as if he were an idiot an american tradition uh what the fuck they have to go and mess with that tell me now none of that shit tastes right no matter what they call it i mean whats tradition for anyway simbal went at his vodka tonic judiciously murder has a habit of making me a little testy martine he said they both wore dark glasses because of the sun and the glare off the bay that was bad for a negotiation but thought simbal it was a damn sight better than having a magnum pressed against the side of your head he counted his blessings and was grateful for progress murder happens every day in our line of work dont give me any bullshit here uh it doesnt always trace itself back to a snit simbal said a member of one agency wiping out a member of another is very likely to get me bent simbal leaned forward see martine currans demise has gotten me a little pissed off so go kick a trashcan around the block i tried that with your sister the cuban got red in the face you fucking piece of wormshit i shouldve smeared you all over the highway while i had the chance maybe you shouldve simbal said but thats all over and done with im sitting here with you now and weve got some business to get done anyway killing mes not going to do you a whole helluva lot of good im not with dea anymore the quarrys got its teeth into the diqui right now im the rabid dog thats chomping away but theres plenty more where i came from my kahuna answers to only one man and thats the president of the united states buddy the quarrys got power the snits only dream of i dont think its to your advantage to get your bowels in an uproar with me not when i could be your friend the cuban said nothing for some time the maitre d led a family of three past their table and nothing was said until there was empty space around them then youd best tell me more about it dude i dont think im ready to believe youre down here because of a murder got the fat boys institute for that man the fbi couldnt solve this one if i handed them a map and said professor peacock in the drawing room with the knife but the cuban was already shaking his head you a heavy hitter dude you get sent in when things is all fallin to shit he had ceased to drink simbal noticed merely rolled his glass around on the table that whats happening here you and mako simbal said the cuban shrugged he and bennettve hooked up together thats what id heard so i needed to get it firsthand and what did mako tell you the cuban turned his attention back to simbal he and i we moving boatloads of shit in and outta coves all around miami what more dyou want i want to know what he and bennett are up to the cuban grunted why dont you ask him right out then im sure hed oblige you he shook his head simbal took a conversation pace backward what do you suggest the cuban feigned astonishment you askin me his eyes got big around madre de dios what could us po folk stuck in the trenches with our noses in the mud these guys rake up tell you the great white hunter cut the comedy martine jesus you really got a nice pair of cojones on you dude simbal ignored him whatre bennett and mako up to the cuban shrugged i dont know you tell me youd better let me in on it simbal said after a time the cuban said shit took a swallow of his drink hes got a party going later tonight after midnight real exclusive bash im supposed to hook up with the two of them there dealing with makos been strictly dust city bennett simbal said reflectively i suppose if youre in id better brief you the cuban said a bit sourly ive already read eddies file simbal told him that means theres a lot about eddie bennett you dont know oh you dont know this hombre personally you dont know shit about him meaning edward martin bennetts one mean motherfucker tell me something i dont know im tryin to dude the cuban reached for his drink took another healthy swallow before he said it was this way eddie and peter curran had a falling out you mean they were on a joint deasnit mission together no man nothin like that simbal tried to discern from the cubans expression what he did mean whatever it was wasnt good that much was clear dont tell me they were in business together no business the cuban said downing the rest of his rum and coke pleasure oh jesus simbal thought for a minute youre not telling me that all of thisshithappened over a lovers spat the cuban fiddled with his empty bottle he seemed to want another i believe it began that way yes see they couldnt live together be seen in public together none of that shit man it was very bad for them once that kind of thing gets into your file madonna theres nothing more you can do in our line of work the fields out and forget about handling any classified shit they send you off to the leper colony thats what eddie used to call it learn to be a clerk pushing papers real important stuff like promotions raises requisitions shit like that you said nobody knew about them simbal said you know sure i know eddie and i worked together more than a couple of times you know that much from his file but like i said before that file at least in eddies case aint worth piss to know eddie bennett is to love him simbal said that it the cuban screwed up his face you think youre pretty cute uh work for the quarry you got power up the yinyang look down your nose at us country folk now that it it was my only way in martine simbal said this was a closed shop i was quick enough to spot that i didnt have time to finesse my way to see you dont get your nose out of joint its nothing personal thats where youre wrong hombre this whole boatload of fish is personal from the bottom to the top then youd best tell me about it the cuban nodded for eddie there was nobody else on the beach besides peter curran they were in school together yeah i know yale same frat same club hellfire club the cuban said some heavy shit going down there same drunken night eddie told me about curran he told me about the initiation into the hellfire club he and curran pledged together the cuban shrugged i guess men can fall in love too he signaled the waitress for another round can fall outta love just the same is that what happened to them it was like any marriage that falls apart the cuban said thats the funny part one of them changed the other didnt that mustve been curran simbal said currand been floating around with a female operative at the dea yeah that seemed to piss eddie off all right the cuban admitted but the cut came because of eddie he was sent out into deep water that was snitspeak for longduration undercover work let me guess simbal said diqui right the cuban took his drink off the girls tray he seemed inordinately thirsty and simbal remembered that feeling of fear he exuded hes been out a long time a very long time simbal picked up the undercurrent meaning the cuban made a face see thats the reason im here thats the reason i got so bent when you showed up on my doorstep eddies not coming back hes gone over to the other side and in the shocked silence simbal thought dear god what were dealing with is a voodoo spook sun tzu said that the most effective manner for a general to deploy his troops was to ensure that they had no identifiable shape to the enemy in that way no defense against them was possible even from the most brilliant military tactician that was written in bc but such was the incisiveness of sun tzus strategy it was as true today this is what flitted through jakes mind as he and mikio turned the corner of the scriptures hall they had begun their run along the temples vast veranda the two sunglassed yakuza had guns there was no point in heading toward them or even in holding their ground jake and mikio were unarmed any form of weapon was strictly forbidden within the temples grounds besides mikio had died the day before in tokyo there was no reason to expect any form of pursuit here but they had their superbly trained bodies and sun tzu had counseled to find the proper battleground so jake and mikio took off along the edge of the veranda they hurried down a flight of stone steps brushing past a long line of women supplicants passing the open doorway to the scriptures hall they could hear the rhythmic pok pok pok of the hollow wooden fish being struck to keep the tempo of the priests chanting they skidded to a halt oh buddha jake said softly sun tzus strategy became uppermost in his mind as he saw four more yakuza making their way toward them then he knew the first two with the guns had been stalking horses cursed himself mightily he should have suspected something of the sort when he saw the pair draw their guns in a place like this where much of the structure had been designated a national treasure by the government of japan there would be no question of gunplay other more silentand discreet methods would have to be used into the garden mikio hissed and bent almost double they scuttled into the large forested area between the scriptures hall and the bell pagoda they stepped off the wooden walkway onto a large flat river rock stepping stones led a way through pebbles haircap moss moss bamboo on their right they passed a gigantic rock rounded by centuries of rushing water it was the benevolence stone one of five such enormous rocks that studded the garden each one represented one of the five confucian virtues aspidistra and ostrich fern floated in the breeze of their passage jake already felt a shortness of breath a pounding behind his eyes it was very still they could hear the whisper of water somewhere close at hand hidden by the bands of meticulously barbered greenery even now and again the chanting the pok pok pok invoking the rhythm from the scriptures hall they both became aware of the men at the same time mikio touched the edge of jakes sleeve and the two of them moved off deeper into the garden moving along a narrow serpentine path of mossencrusted stepping stones artfully arranged to suggest to the stroller a rushing stream they crouched down beneath a cryptomeria whispering ancient secrets of the timeless place to their left twined the redgold leaves of a dwarf cutleaf maple directly ahead reared the justice stone its enormous body a series of roughly concentric plateaus built one upon the other like the rings of a rent redwood confronting it one was thus inexorably reminded of the passing eons slabs of time that dwarfed any humans lifetime this was the stunning effect of the stonesaid to have taken the gardens designer ten years to findto place the viewer in perspective to remind him or her of the timelessness of this place the immutability transmitted to and from the confucian virtue of justice itself an extension of nature i do not understand this mikio said in a whisper to the kisan clan i am dead yet they have picked up my trail so quickly a traitor mikio shrugged his heavily muscled shoulders anything is possible my friend but i prefer to look for another explanation a whistling brought jakes head around just in time to see the beginnings of shohatsu he kicked out reflexively deflecting the weighted end of the yakuzas chain the manrikigusariwhich meant literally chain with the strength of ten thousandrattled as the sunglassed man brought it back toward him jake extended his hand in a feint this brought the expected response the uchiotoshi a striking drop attack which missed as he drew back his wrist at the last instant grabbed hold of the chain and twisted they both lost their footing and crashed into a carefully manicured bed of spidery ferns the man was not big but he was unusually powerful as he sprang back to the balls of his feet jake saw that he seemed to have all his energy concentrated in his upper arms and torso which was unusual in a japanese who prized big hara so highlythe centralization of intrinsic energies in the lower belly that was why sumo wrestlers were so heavy used a tenkan bringing both their bodies around to his left making it the low turn because the yakuzas hands were reaching for his wrist to free the manrikigusari and jake thought this is what happens when your mind relies on weapons they become more important than your own body by grabbing for jakes wrist the yakuza had sacrificed position in order to regain full control of his chain this allowed jake to flow his own body with the yakuzas momentum bringing both his arms up and out while jakes free hand pulled downward at his neck in a moment the yakuza had arched backward crashing onto the mossy stones flicked the manrikigusari and it curled around jakes extended left ankle the yakuza pulled hard and jake lost his balance the breath went out of him as he hit on his side turned in time to see mikio apply a liver kite with vicious accuracy the yakuzas lips pulled back from his teeth in a grimace of agony he let go the chain clutching at himself as mikio repeated the blow jake smashed the heel of his hand flush on into the yakuzas face and his sunglasses burst apart he went limp jake took a deep breath and mikio extended a hand grunted heavily the whites of his eyes showed all around and his mouth opened silently he collapsed onto one knee and jake leapt to catch him pulled out the shuriken the honed steel throwing spike blood gushed and mikio put a palm over the wound jake heard a whirring and simultaneously felt mikio crash into him a second shuriken embedded itself with a thwok in the trunk of the cryptomeria jake crawled on his elbows and knees through a low copse of boxwood pulled up behind a swaying mass of azalea he glanced back saw mikio ripping his shirt with his teeth applying a tourniquet to his arm grunting with the effort in a moment the white cotton was dark and wet with blood jake returned his attention to the shuriken thrower tried to ignore the bees moving busily through the field of flowers beside his head he kept himself very still when he decided to move he did so with extreme caution and slowness the garden had about it a certain tempo as the light breeze took leaves certain small branches and set them to moving any deviation in that tempo would he knew bring instant attention to himself the idea was to sink in to his surroundings chahm hai as fo saan had taught him yet all his training revolved around bamahk if jake could no longer reach out and be in touch with the eternal cosmic pulse of things then all avenues were closed to him still he did what he could to blend in with his surroundings it wasnt enough the slither of the chain caused him to turn his head but the manrikigusari was already around his neck in makiotoshi the terminal strangle attack the first thing was to keep the hands down away from his neck the organisms first jibbering response would be to get its hands up to free the neck this would be a mistake because there was no way for bare hands to break the dropforged steel chain precious seconds would be wasted while the attacker applied even more pressure death would surely follow took a deep breath used the boar a rib atemi an edgeofthehand percussion blow that required him to perform a quarterturn twist to his left this severely restricted his windpipe but the breath was already inside him and he used his full strength aided by the organisms knowledge that death was near used the animal fear rearing its head like a spur as he had been taught letting it pump excessive amounts of adrenaline into the system twisted now to his right delivering a boar to that side and quickly again feeling three ribs give as the heat on his face became almost unbearable the chain beginning to stop the blood flow to the brain and jake knew that this was strictly shuntended very little time before the sparkling lights sprang up before his eyes and the lack of oxygen clouded his judgment or worse affected his coordination the yakuza slipped to his knees bringing jake down with him but his training was extraordinary and even with three ribs shattered he would not let go he was still positioned directly behind jake where it was very difficult to get anything done against him time was critical now lungs burning and he was experiencing consciousness slippage aware of the sunlight filtered onto one leaf suprareal the sighing of the breeze like the chattering of animated spirits playing hide and seek amid the trees cloud bluegray in the shape of a samurai at the charge and im not getting any air stop daydreaming and get on with it he berated himself tried four different types of leg atemi but the yakuza slipped away each time doggedly keeping his strength in the tautness of the manrikigusari jake suspected that he was slowly drowning in his own blood but that would be little consolation if he was able to hold on long enough to keep the air out of jakes bursting lungs seconds now rather than minutes and jake did the only thing he could arching backward putting all his weight excruciatingly on his neck for the instant when it became the fulcrum for the back somersault used an elbow atemi with both fists clenched together consciousness wavering in and out of focus jamming down down in a sharp motion that shattered the yakuzas sternum the man arched up his fingers white as bone as they slid along the wet links of the chain and jake slamming his left elbow at the side of his neck smashed the flat of his right hand against his adversarys cheek heard the sharp snap of the cervical vertibrae as they gave way beneath the enormous pressure a nacreous blackness and he saw the ant making its laborious way through a field of stalks then he became aware that the field of stalks was the hairs on the back of his hand head hanging down the manrikigusari hanging around his shoulders like the weight held aloft by atlas jakesan mikio by his side are you all right it hurt too much to nod his head and his tongue was so dry it felt swollen enough to fill his mouth at mikios silent urging they moved off edging around to the far side of the justice stone surrounded by box tree and silver juniper there are four more mikio said he kept looking at his watch as if he were late for an appointment we must hold them off jake noticed that he had taken the manrikigusari how good are you with that he was testing the raw flesh around his neck mikio gave a grim laugh it depends on whom you speak to he gave jake a look dont worry kyujutsu ka well be drinking kirins at my favorite bar in the old quarter of kyoto an hour from now jake said nothing but he wondered if that was going to be so he badly needed some rest and there was no telling how badly mikio was wounded he watched their immediate environment he listened he heard a sharp clack and jump slightly mikio put a hand on his knee it is only the shishi odoshi jake looked around saw the bamboo and stone deer scare not twenty meters away originally created by farmers to keep their crops from being eaten by animals the shishi odoshi was now a common element in the modern japanese garden a wide length of bamboo filled part way with water and as the liquids weight tipped it over its end would strike a stone making the loud clacking noise emptied of water it would rise back up again to be refilled and strike the stone once more in the changeless harmony of the eternal garden the shishi odoshis metronomic sound might be the only outward manifestation of the passage of time to jake every clack that reverberated through the foliage brought them that much closer to the end of the overwhelming peace of the garden here beneath the willowy branches of the evergreens the chinese judas amid the aspidistra and plantain lily the lacy ostrich fern the okame bamboo grass he was never more acutely aware of the beauty of the world wiping the sweat from his face he was determined that they would not die here not today not for a long while clack clack the shishi odoshi spewing out the water on the back of the striking stone the changeless western face of the justice stone bulging out toward them then running away in a wide arc down toward the japanese maple and the cryptomeria glimpse of black pin stripe a suit sleeve and jake saying brace yourself mikiosan here they come mikio used the manrikigusari on the leading man tumbling him so that the shuriken he was about to release clattered to the stone path at the same time jake was up and running toward the breadth of the justice stone it was imperative to split these four up in a bunch jake knew theyd have little chance against a massed assault took three with himobviously with mikio wounded they figured jake was the most dangerous they came at him from three different directions at once expected him to run but he stood his ground deliberately made himself appear confused he was careful not to move so that when he did it would come as a shock gaining him a fraction more time and when the one on the left was close enough he began his attack a flathanded atemi that jake watched come at his face at the last instant he dropped to one knee swiveling his body to his left as he did so with his right hand he reached up caught the cuff on the mans extended right sleeve and using his own forward momentum pulled hard across his own body and down throwing the yakuza into his companion rushing jake from the right now as jake rose to his feet the man in the center grabbed him from behind over jakes shoulders jake kept his body moving to his right jamming his left hand upward under the yakuzas armpit and threw him off the first man was on him again and jake seeing the shuriken in his hand allowed him to stab forward with it his left hand flashed out to meet the blade bypassed it locked around the yakuzas wrist pulling toward him using his own momentum combined with his strength to pitch him forward as the yakuza stretched out bending jakes right hand came up slashed down onto the back of the mans exposed neck he collapsed into a heap jake kicked out at the third man rocking him back while eying the short sword the second man had unsheathed he rushed at jake the sword extended in front of him he began to kiai shout but jake slammed the heel of his hand into the yakuzas chin his other hand blurred up deflecting the blade away and down but the yakuza had kicked out and jake felt a searing pain along his hip his left leg went numb and he collapsed against the curving face of the justice stone the yakuza slashed down and jake rolled heard the scraping crash as blade encountered rock saw the bright blue sparks jake reached out curling his fingers into the front of his adversarys jacket in close quarters the sword was no good at all neither would be the mans potentially lethal foot atemi surprising jake the yakuza immediately dropped his weapon landed a double kite just above jakes heart jake doubled over had the presence of mind to roll out of the way of the atemi he knew would be aimed at the back of his neck the yakuza followed closely sensing victory the edges of his hand were extended and jake could see that his karate training had been extensive he struck and jake used a tenkan jamming the heel of his hand against the yakuzas elbow at the same time jake twisted his torso giving him the added leverage swinging himself and the other man around slamming him to the ground the yakuza halfstunned nevertheless grabbed up the hilt of the short sword and in the same motion slashed upward the blade came within a hairsbreadth of severing jakes neck used his feet to take the yakuza down but his position was bad and the man was wielding the sword with deadly force so jake did the only thing he could using irimi to bring the man toward him down and at just the right angle smashed the top of his head against the immutable face of the justice stone he was staring at the limp form when the blow landed on the side of his face jake reeled sliding down the side of the stone he blinked several times trying to clear his vision but nothing would quite come into focus his depth perception was gone his arms felt weighed down with lead his leg was burning with the pain inflicted by the foot atemi the last of the yakuza stood over him with his fallen compatriots sword in his hand he lifted the gleaming blade and jake knew there was nothing he could do to stop him he saw his own death reflected in the shining perfect blade of the wakizashi felt the cold pressage of the flat arcing blow that would sever his head from his neck the blade began to blur picking up momentum at the moment it struck through his skin flesh and bone he knew it would be at the height of its speed it was so close now that jake could see the meeting of the two planes of the blade or thought he coulda hairline so intensely white as to be blinding it was like looking into the face of god then something funny happened to the yakuzas body it ballooned outward at its center perhaps six centimeters above the heart and jake was covered with a heavy wet heat a stench like that of a charnel house suffused him so that he began to gag then the full weight of the yakuza crashed into him into the justice stone smearing its face with blood guts and shards of shattered bone i he stink or steaming feces was overpowering and jake without conscious thought began the difficult process of crawling away from it he felt buried in filth it was difficult to breathe and he began to pant he felt someone begin to pull him away and he rolled face upward a cloth passed across his face wiping away the flecks of blood and flesh jake looked at the dead yakuza saw the rear end of a black anodized steel bolt stuck through what remained of the man he raised his gaze saw the beautiful woman in the exquisite persimmoncolored kimono who had helped tend to him at mikios house kneeling beside him a bloody cloth in one hand it was only after a stunned and silent moment that he realized she carried in her other hand a mitsui jujika compressedgas powered crossbow bliss knew what it was like to be in the arms of buddha as she approached the container terminal at kwun tong she saw that fung the skeleton was not present she saw this not with her eyes but with her mind her qi part of which was now always within dahei the great darkness made her aware of this fact spread upon the sea of quickening night her spirit tapped into the vibrations of the universe who was that crying in the street she was forever aware of the wailing of the dead massed an army that took up a continent who were they her countrymen the dead of china calling to be free how did she know this what was it like to be in contact with a spirit bliss in the bow of the wallawalla she had hired closed her eyes listened to the voice of shi zilin it was in the whisper of the wind fluttering the tendrils of her hair in the lapping of the waves against the small crafts sides the bubbling of its wake it was in the cries of the sea gulls greedily circling a fishing trawler the earth moved and shi zilin spoke they were one and the same interchangeable the qi of the planet rose and fell as it inhaled and exhaled she felt this as she heard him speak there were no words but rather impulses akin to the way ones brain automatically sent messages to ones extremities to move one was never aware of the process only the end result it was mysterious magical awesome even therefore it was not something one could share with another human being often bliss wondered what she would do when jake returned to hong kong what would she tell him how would he perceive the changes in her how would they affect him she gave a little shiver in the predawn darkness already in the east a line of palest pink had begun to color the oyster gray as night paled tell me where miss the boatman said exactly bliss pointed and when there was no reply turned around caught him staring at her with a kind of fright what is it that he sees she wondered perhaps i am branded a scar struck along my cheek and unconsciously she put fingertips to flesh ran them along the smooth surface she laughed at herself but it was an uneasy sound itself making her shiver all over again she wished jake were here beside her not to tell her what to do or even to reassure her for the first time since their reuniting doubts about the two of them lay like clouds across the horizon his history haunted her she knew of his first wifes suicide the death of lan at the sumchun river knew too of jakes second wife mariana her murder in the japanese alps had brought jake back to bliss for good but neither of his marriages had been particularly happy ones jake was married to his work whether that be with the quarry in the past or the yuhnhyun in the present his was a wholly obsessive personality and this very obsession had caused his closest friends felt his estrangement with those he loved most in the world bliss knew this to be only part of the story she thought of jakes specialness she had trained with the same martial arts and philosophical master fo saan who had trained jake she therefore knew with great intimacy the extraordinary talents jake possessed it was his heightened qi his ability to enter into a semimystical state known as bamahk she believed that set him apart from most people it was this she believed that was most responsible for estranging him from his family now bliss wondered how their relationship would be affected her own qi was expanded within dahei it was here that zilin spoke to her she wondered if she were the guardian of the jians spirit or if his qi had become hers she wondered if he were guiding her in some way and if so to what purpose here miss the boatman said as they touched the pier but he would not take the money they had agreed on before setting out he would not even meet her eyes nor answer her questions clearly all he wanted was for her to get off his boat this bliss did gaining access to the dockside via a rusted metal staircase that ran up the concrete bulkhead from the lower quay she could smell the diesel fumes from the airport to her left was the container terminal itself and beyond a seemingly endless line of godownswarehouses filled with all manner of licit and illicit goods awaiting transshipment to virtually every country on the globe fung the skeletons boat lay at anchor perhaps three hundred meters down the quay it was a slim sleeklooking craft with enough horsepower to outrun the most modern of the police launches it was painted the color of deep water at night and was almost invisible its captain she learned by questioning a crew member was known only as the malaysian she had been there less than twenty minutes when he appeared he was a darkskinned man with an athletic build running to fat he had a great curling mustache shining with wax he was young no more than his midthirties bliss judged he wore a pair of knockoff guess jeans a muscle tshirt that looked ludicrous on a man of his bulk the same man whom bliss had questioned stopped the malaysian spoke to him for a minute the malaysian nodded dismissing the man he came across the pier to where bliss was waiting he squinted into the sunrise said you looking for the captain of this boat im looking for fung the skeleton the malaysian took a handrolled cigarette out of a pocket of his jeans it was halfcrushed he spent some time trying to straighten it out somewhat more lighting it he sucked in some smoke then said we have nothing to talk about as he exhaled ive got something to sell she said you he gave a laugh and shook his head youve got nothing id be interested in buying unless his eyes swept over her body opals bliss said youre wasting my time he began to turn away fire opals from australia she said are you familiar with them he took another drag on the cigarette sure everythings got a price and i know em all she noted his attitude he liked to feel superior familiar enough to know what thiss worth she handed over the opal the malaysian grunted took a look at it turned it over held it up to the light then he turned his head and spat dropped it back into her palm that all he said go on get outta here not just this one she said unfazed one hundred more just like it same quality she noticed that he wasnt so eager to leave now she nodded you got a price in mind bliss looked at him saw what she needed in his face if he saw even a tiny chink in her front now hed roll right over her ive got a price put an edge into her voice lets hear it if its but she was already shaking her head not you she said ill tell it to fung the skeleton who are you interested in the opals only if the price is right what are you going to tell fung when i sell these to his competition the malaysian said nothing opals are fungs specialty the malaysian contemplated the dying end of his cigarette i dont know you his icy eyes met hers bliss held the opal out to him take this to fung she said maybe that will ease your mind the malaysian flicked his butt into the water he seemed to have made up his mind get on board he said ignoring the jewel we sail in three minutes when they were on their way he took her arm youre either very smart or very stupid he said i wonder which one it is daniella had never been to zvenigorod but it was no surprise to her that it lay nestled on the banks of malutas beloved moskva great fir forests rose upward through steep ravines on either side of the rolling hills upon which the town was set but she had heard of the sobor na gorodke the cathedral of the assumption built of gray stone almost five hundred years ago what seemed odd to her as the heated chaika took her past its gates was its slit windows its single austere central dome so much more like a medieval keep its appearance was less like an edifice of god than of war sometimes she thought they were one and the same at least in the hands of imperfect and often venal mortals daniella had thought that she would be safe from maluta over the weekend after all he was away at his dacha in zvenigorod and she was in moscow it had been early morning and she had thrown the windows open in her office so that she could hear the first birds of spring as they flitted from branch to branch in the firs outside traffic on the ring road was minimal and the forest dominated she had been poring over the latest intelligence from mitre her heart surging with the news that they were now so close to taking the whole thing interasia the yuhnhyun kam sang more than anything daniella wished to penetrate to the hidden core of that communist chinese project she did not believe that its real secret had been revealed to her via zhang hua shi zilins assistant in beijing perhaps part of kam sang revolved around the newdesign nuclear desalinization plant to alleviate hong kongs perpetual water shortage problems but only part the chinese army was heavily involved their top minds invested in kam sang why she suspected now as mitre amassed for her more and more data that zhang hua had either been incompletely informed about the project orand this possibility chilled herhe had been a double agent ostensibly her mole inside shi zilins office but in reality relaying to her just what shi zilin wanted her to know well shed never know now since both zhang hua and shi zilin were dead but jake maroc shi shi zilins son survived and it disturbed her that mitre had no idea where he was maroc should have been in the center of yuhnhyun operations in hong kong yet he was nowhere to be found in the crown colony daniella sent a cipher to mitre instructing him to begin a fullscale trace of jake marocs whereabouts she was sending it when the phone rang assuming that it was carelin calling to confirm their date for lunch she answered immediately i tried you first at home comrade general maluta a womans work is never done she had said and he laughed which is why i called he paused i want an update on your progress monday morning first not monday he interrupted now but i have lunch with carelin break it i need you here and while youre at it you can give your report on your liaison with him you make it sound like filth she said abruptly angryat being intruded upon ordered around like a windup doll at being pulled away from carelin and perhaps it is he said shortly but its not for me to judge youre a prick do you know that you bandy western curses about as if they were your first language i find that somewhat suspect daniella alexandrova he had that capacity to turn just about any insult around like a boomerang she began again to burn why are we suddenly speaking of loyalty is that what you think comrade general loyalty his voice was mocking how interesting i wonder what a sluzhba psychologist would make of that comment uhm perhaps we should schedule you for a session at the serbsky institute what an idiotic notion but she knew he had the power to implement even such an absurd suggestion are you beginning your menses he asked your attitude is so antagonistic daniella shut up she knew why she was doing this and it only raised her anxiety level in zvenigorod at the dacha there could be no escaping him the black hole of oleg maluta would be staring her in the face and she was terrified therefore part of her was attempting to run away she heard carelin telling her youll find a way i know it a way to bring oleg maluta down wasnt it maluta himself who had said termination is not the only way to remove obstacles from ones path yes yes she thought of her wei qi board a string of strategies springboard to to what she so wanted to dispel this debilitating terror that malutas power produced in her opened her mouth and said what time do you want me at the dacha my chaika will be downstairs to take you home within a halfhour did she detect some disappointment in his voice that she had not risen to his baiting dont take too long packing i want you here for lunch now several hours later she was here oleg malutas dacha was at the foot of one of the farther hills it was elevated above most of the town so that from almost every spot in it one had some kind of view of the moskva the place had an aspect about it of a hunting lodge daniella could not think that this was the same design as the one that had burnt down no female she knew would be comfortable for long in this wholly masculine environment inside it was seemingly all woodfloors walls ceiling the heaviness was oppressive the furniture at least could do with some floral chintz she decided maluta in smokegray mohair slacks handstitched loafers and a cashmere pullover greeted her at the door the driver went past them with her bags maluta looked at the attache case daniella carried and nodded approvingly only then did he move aside for her to enter a rather oldfashioned squarish vestibule gave out on one side to a library on the other to the living room the bedrooms and his study he told her were up the wide mahoganybanistered staircase to a second floor which dominated the rear half of the villa the kitchen and dining areas were in the rear on the first floor all the rooms seemed vast to her even cluttered with the thick legged furniture most of which was layered with the accumulated mementos of half a lifetime too much from one man or even a couple as daniella went around the living room she saw pictures frames medals commendations even grisly souvenirs of the war that had to have belonged to malutas father maluta had moved all of this from his moscow apartment after the first dacha had burned he poured them both drinks and without asking her what she wanted handed her a glass of white rhine wine it was a bit too sweet to suit her taste but she smiled and after the first sip made a complimentary remark what do you have for me it was typical of him this total lack of courtesy but daniella was beginning to see his strategy it was as if he felt that he must shape entirely his immediate personal environment he liked disconcerting those in his presence believing perhaps rightly that this gave him a certain tactical advantage with an inner start daniella perceived just how well it worked in her case that was why she thought of him as a dark star maluta worked at having his own laws in his personal universe and this he carried around with him wherever he went she was consequently never herself when she was with him for daniella especially this was a great hardship it was why she was never able to face him equally she was never sure of her footing with a deliberate gesture significant only to herself she snapped open the attache case it was of handtanned wild ostrich hide one of many extravagant presents yuri lantin had bought her from the beryozka she produced several pages of pink flimsies proof that they were kremlin departmental originals here is what my asset in hong kong has accomplished redfaced maluta came across the oriental carpet toward her daniella though she felt the rage inside him as a physical force held her ground what shit is this he batted the flimsies away so that they fluttered to the carpet jake maroc is still alive and kam sang is still as much a mystery to me as it first was my asset is very close to gaining complete control over kam sang comrade daniella said calmly this is the way a long blue vein pulsed at the side of malutas forehead his great knuckled fingers curled and clutched at air making hairy fists is that so he gasped in such a strangled voice that daniella knew he was having difficulty controlling his emotions perhaps we should just overfly the kam sang project and accidentally drop a bomb on it daniella watched him as if he were some poisonous creature that is foolish talk and you know it she said maluta glared at her in silence for a long time then he turned on his heel and stalked to the bar with a clatter he threw ice into a widemouthed cutcrystal glass slopped vodka almost to the brim he downed half of it in one gulp you know what this means he said with his back still to her when daniella said nothing he barked at her tell me im not sure what youre getting at comrade he swung around and his gaze was baleful stupid bitch he shouted you cretinous cunt ill have to spell it out for you then fucking idiot i have nothing but fucking idiots around me he gulped the last of his vodka threw the glass onto the bartop took some gratification at its shattering he came close to her and said it means one of two things comrade general either you are incompetent or you have been lying to me he glared at her now which one is it you do not know maroc she said restraining herself from hitting him he is my nemesis he is not so easily destroyed one does not snap ones fingers and make him disappear her calm tone perhaps had some effect on him she realized that he enjoyed baiting her to get her visibly upset in this way he could continue to throw up to her her inherent weakness as a female of the species all right all right he said in a more normal tone of voice i concede that jake maroc is not the normal objective but on the other hand he is not invincible comrade general no one is he must have a vulnerable spot and it is up to you to find it exploit it and terminate him with all due dispatch is this clear perfectly daniella said despising him more than she had despised anyone in her life mckenna drew his magnum and shot them each once through the center of their foreheads they pitched forward covering the steer they had so recently slit open that was how he thought about the incident now even how he dreamed it sometimes but that was not how it had happened bundooma the northern territories of australia mckenna and deak jones on the trail of the trio of abos who had stolen six head of steer the trail had led into the simpson desert the simpson in january it was a bleak godforsaken place at the best of times but in the height of summer it was something else again it was true that deak had argued against going after them not in there mate let the buggers go they ii fry anyway in there squinting against the unrelenting sunlight reflecting in intense waves off the desert floor they were starving they stole in order to live but mckenna was the senior in rank and time of service if he said go they would its our job deak mlad if we dont have that we dont have a bloody thing and afterward deak jones had asked for a transfer he could no longer bear to look at mckennas face because mckenna had shot three thieving abos not bloody likely sometimes when mckenna dreamed of the incident he dreamt the truth it took them two days to get the scent and overtake the abos near dusk they topped a rise and found the trio and what was left of the cattle by then they had been in the simpson for close to fifty hours and it had taken its toll toiling mile after mile of scrub and thornbush drybacked lizards piles of rocks like cairns marking the resting places of those unfortunates who had traveled this path before lets take them deak said through crusted lips mckenna had headed down the slope silent as a dog the aborigines looked up at the policemans approach as mckenna had predicted they had slaughtered a steer its blood was pooled at its open belly nothing was said the aborigines made no move there was no animosity on their faces no remorse even this inflamed mckenna if they had sinnedand he was convinced that they hadthey should be made to feel remorse for their crime their absolute placidity filled him with unspeakable rage at other times in other dreams the trio was composed of three men this was a function of mckennas superego imposing itself on his id the fact was that the trio was a family unit a father a mother and their elevenyearold boy it was the boy who was holding the knife the steers blood dripped from its keen edge to the thirsty ground the father mckenna supposed had been teaching his son how to survive in times of drought all right deak said he had pulled out his pistol and was aiming in the direction of the family of abos they said nothing none of them looked directly at the weapon it was as if it did not exist for them he crouched in the universal marksmans stance both hands were white around the magnums grip but he did not move it was as if he were waiting for the abos to move first or that he was afraid to get closer to them for mckennas part he saw only the boy he crept closer his hand on his bolstered magnum he blinked the rolling sweat away from his eyes his gaze swept the face of the boy certain now that this was the one mckenna had seen him in bundooma several times but ever since the first glimpse that face had haunted him until eventually sleep was but a memory for mckenna this was what had brought him into the simpson in january the criminal act was but a secondary thought what was one more criminal act among many it wasnt until mckenna touched the boy that any emotion registered on the fathers face the man leapt up cocking his arm to strike mckenna that was what mckenna had been waiting for he drew his magnum and shot the father once through the center of his forehead the abos mouth made an odd clacking sound reflexive motion caused him to bite off the tip of his tongue though he was beyond pain beyond knowing his body leapt into the air dancing a jig in the air crashed to earth head first onto the carcass of the steer his wife screamed her eyes opened wide with horror and fear but mckenna showed her the working end of the magnum and she shut up her hands trembled in her lap it seemed as if deak were shouting directly into his ear christ jesus we were meant to take them back alive mate ableedinglive shut up mckenna said without turning around just shut up if you cant take it you shouldntve come into the simpson in the first place i didnt bleeding want to come if you remember now youre here make the best of it who knows maybe youll get a medal out of it mckenna had laughed at that he had not taken his eyes off the boy and in the process he had grown hard keep your gun trained on the woman he said with a thick voice christ why deak said what dyou think shes gonna do jump two policemen with drawn magnums just do as youre fucking told mate mckenna said swinging around and training the muzzle of his gun on deak then he swung back bolstered the gun his hold on the boy tightened he halfwalked halfdragged him away from the fires flickering circle of light where you taking him mckenna ignored deak in the semidarkness he could hear the chittering of the desert insects there was nothing else in the world the bowl of the sky was enormous containing all things and nothing at all mckenna felt liberated free of the fires churning inside him he began to laugh then he opened the buckle of his belt unzipped his pants they fell away from him pooling around his ankles with a fierce jerk he turned the boy until he was facing away from him takedown your pants mckenna said in english when he repeated it in dialect the boy complied his heart bursting mckenna stared down at the bare buttocks they seemed white virginal full of promise whati his flesh lurched forward as if of its own volition in the name of bleedin christ are you doing he closed his eyes the desert breeze fanning his cheeks he began to pant something slammed into him he took one stumbling step his big hand on the boys shoulder halfturned and lifted the magnum shot the boys screaming clawing mother once through the center of her forehead when he was done the shudders going on and on like echoes through his body he pushed the boy roughly away from him he felt nothing but revulsion for the elevenyearold he was dirty polluted the boy sat where he had landed he stared up at mckenna and stillstillnothing registered on his face it was as placid as it had been when mckenna had come upon it react mckenna screamed and shot the boy once through the center of his forehead have you gone stark staring bonkers deak cried mckenna said nothing pulled up his trousers buckled his belt answer me you bloody pig deak screamed we got what we came for mckenna said as he went past him to where the rest of the steers were waiting with bovine patience was it any wonder that deak jones had asked for a transfer the moment they got back to civilization that he did not want to look at mckennas face ever again but that was hardly the worst of it though the incident itself would be enough for a haunting there was more there was the image of the great greenheaded fly bloated with blood crawling across the boys open eye there were the nights in bundooma when he could see the fires flung like giant eyes across the face of the simpson skyscrapers of sparks shooting upward into the black starless sky and the chanting of the tribes he could hear the chanting even in his bed even with the curtains pulled the covers over his head the chanting had a power that could not be interfered with because mckenna knew the chanting was directed at him for what he had done on the bleak back of the simpson the aborigines possessed a kind of primitive magic mckenna had seen it at work though he had never believed in it not really he had thought of it rather as clever illusion a prestidigitators trickery until the chanting had come infiltrating his nights making him start gasp sit up in bed covered in sweat thinking of that fly with the metallic green head crawling over the milky arc what right had creatures little more than animals to do this to him rage and terror battled for supremacy within him he wanted to commandeer a jeep and race out into the simpson pump them all full of lead he had seen the mad max films he would do no such thing and in the end he left his command left bundooma the edge of the brooding horrorfilled simpson the northern territories australia itself came to hong kong to make a new life for himself but here he was amid the bloody wogs again and the chanting had followed him all this way he had to stop the chanting he had to do something or go completely mad mckenna rose pale as a corpse and hunted through his beaten footlocker dressed in the clothes he had worn in the outback neatly folded stowed away for perhaps just such a time picked up his magnum and checked the action slowly methodically he loaded the chambers then he went out the door of his apartment he was looking to kill or be killed he did not know which imagine they would have gone to the ends of the earth for you they sold their souls for you daniella before the mirror that was part of a massive oak armoire that dominated the bedroom assigned to her at malutas dacha it had a beautifully beveled edge but here and there dark patches like oil stains on limpid water bespoke the wear to which it had been subjected the black dior gown that yuri lantin had bought her dropped to the carpet daniella stood watching herself immobile in the mirror it was almost as if for this interminable instant she were gazing at a sepiatoned photograph her own daughter or granddaughter perhaps flipping through the family album coming upon the image of daniella alexandrova vorkuta it was at this instant that in the same manner a flash of lightning will illuminate a nightscape she saw how distorted and unpleasant her life had become why she realized there is nothing at all normal about it perhaps it was the thought of a daughtera child she might never bearor the granddaughter who would never exist she had in fact no personal life whatsoever she belonged to the sluzhba body and soul even the small pleasure she derived from being with carelin was illicit forever consigned to clandestine shadows laced with the bitter taste of fear that maluta would expose them or that someone else within the sluzhba or the politburo would find out and use the information to suborn or destroy them for years she had been far too busy constructing a career on the back of her stretching ambition to think about what it was she was sacrificing on this terrible altar mother of god she thought if someone had mentioned children to me even three years ago i would have laughed in her face children for someone whose ambition was limitless for the first time in her life daniella contemplated the hollowness of power locked within her hideous psychological struggle with oleg maluta she felt nothing but fear and loathing should she by some miracle defeat him she knew that she would feel no sense of triumph bowed their heads before you conferred to you on bended knee all that made them powerful it was true what maluta had told her that frigid night by the bank of the moskva she had been greedy for power like a vampire she had feasted off it and then killed them all all the men in her life who had tried to use her and had in return been used by her they trooped through her mind like beloved actors asked to take a curtain call by their admiring audience now staring into her own cool gray eyes those same eyes that had bewitched so many powerful men she stumbled upon an astounding notion she found what would make her happy it was not the defeat of oleg maluta it was not an elevation to head of the kgb or even to the head of her country it was simply to feel mikhail carelins seed flower inside her she wanted his baby more than she wanted anything she lost her balance for a moment falling into her own image their lips meeting in cold gesture when she pushed back there was a dead spot on the mirror where her perspiration occluded the reflection in a moment daniella bent to pick up her dior gown it was all wrong for this evening putting aside the dress she looked at herself in the mirror one more time her uniform with the blue shoulderboards was holding its press well there was nothing wrong with her she decided the way she was there was even the possibility that this was the correct way to go about it she had never seen maluta drinkthat is seriously drink in moscow he drank an occasional shot of zubrovka at dinner that was all but here in the dacha he swallowed ryabinovkathe vodka flavored with ashberriesas if he owned a piece of the business he was already well into the vodka when she came downstairs where caviar and hot blini were waiting piled on a chased silver salver before going in to dinner he opened another bottle bringing it in with them someone had obviously spent a great deal of time in the kitchen but it was maluta himself who served the meal if anyone else was in the dacha daniella failed to see him the meal began with kulebiakabaked salmon surrounded by a multilayered wrapping of flaky pastry then rassolnika steaming rich soup made with a variety of pickled vegetables many not readily available in the beginning of spring the main course was an excellent chicken kiev that shot a geyser of melted butter across its golden flank when daniella pierced it with her knife for dessert they feasted on vareniky sweet dumplings filled with a delectable cherry conserve over chai daniella said do you always eat this well comrade maluta who was busy sugaring his tea said nothing he placed three cubes in his glass at once using the curved end of his spoon to tap at them until they broke apart hed stir the tea a bit then add three more lumps and repeat the process at length he said my wife was an exceptional cook but his tone told her that he was speaking more to himself at home i am used to eating in a certain manner some things should never change abruptly he got up and went out of the dining room daniella spent a moment stirring her tea until she saw the sugar dissolve then she rose and followed him out he stood by one of the great paned windows in the living room that looked out on the moskva far below he sipped his tea absently his free hand behind his back he seemed uncommonly melancholy tonight a side of him daniella had never before witnessed she had seen him calm and almost hysterically angry but never withdrawn and brooding the moskva survives he said and again she had the eerie sensation that he was not talking to her at all perhaps not even to himself but to some unseen presence the mountains endure but life must ebb and flow he turned around to face her isnt that so daniella alexandrova she nodded it is a law of nature is it not his dark eyes watched her from the shadows cast by the heavy brocaded curtains perhaps yes and we should know eh we who concern ourselves during each waking moment with the law is it man who makes the laws in this world daniella alexandrova or is it as you have said nature he lifted his glass of chai sipped at it without taking his eyes from hers is nature i wonder another name for god the short hairs at the nape of daniellas neck began to stir oleg maluta talking of god it seemed an impossibility for such a rigidly pragmatic believer in the party she did not understand the territory to which he had brought them so she said nothing who made the world daniella alexandrova was it created in a burst of incendiary starmatter a trillionyear swirl of cosmic detritus or can you observe a divine hand in the molding of virgin clay are you asking my opinion daniella asked or merely listing options he came away from the shadows of the brocaded curtains i am curious about what you believe in they stood not a meter apart i am curious to know if you see a what shall we say a higher intelligence at workat the beginning of all things yes she said without hesitation and god was a communist he did not laugh as she expected he would instead he frowned i am serious daniella alexandrova she wondered what he was getting at what new trap he was about to spring on her i want to know if you believe you know what i mean i want to knowif you do whether this belief affords you any measure of solace i was lying before she said god doesnt understand communism he moved closer then you do believe i am a communist she said god doesnt understand me either now he did laugh if he exists which i doubt i cant imagine that hed understand any of us in a moment his gaze broke away from hers he stared down at the russet surface of his tea the melancholy had returned shrouding him daniella alexandrova i must ask you this did anything happen in your life that you could not explain that you did not fully understand im not certain that i follow you comrade maluta lifted his head and his eyes grabbed hers again i am speaking now about tragedy and in a flash daniella knew what he was alluding to his wifes appalling death and because she knew he wanted a certain answer from her she lied yes and yes and did you he broke off perhaps embarrassed did you witness the hand of god in thistragedy if you believe comrade then the hand of god touches everything and everyone then how is the inexplicable the tragedy of a lifetime explained it is never explained daniella said thinking now of something uncle vadim told her when her mother had died that is an impossibility it is rather resolved resolved he said it as if he had never heard of the word before yes daniella said in ones own mind a kind of inner peace an ending to the hurt maluta closed his eyes for a moment his lips seemed to move as if he were murmuring a prayer or perhaps it was only a momentary trembling i see he said at last an inner peace this last was said in the peculiar tone of voice reserved for uttering such concepts as a hundred billion rubles that were both personally unobtainable and difficult to grasp then you sleep at night what do you sleep at night maluta asked yes and do you dream sometimes only sometimes he said wistfully i dream all the time he turned away put on music tchaikovsky swan lake clouds had broken apart and there was moonlight on the moskva daniella could almost imagine the alchemical transformation of animal into human that had so bewitched tchaikovskys hunter they sold their souls to you daniella crossed to the sideboard the record player an outdated affair so different from the one lantin had bought to play his blackmarket foreign pressings was crowded along its top with framed photographs of maluta as a young man as a boy with his mother and father with his mother alone lifted onto her broad shoulder as she laughed into his startled face behind them two rows of wellbound books foreign editions in a sterlingsilver frame a young woman who might have been his sister except for the obvious age of the photograph looked at the camera wideeyed unafraid even with a bit of aggression to which daniella could relate beside this studied portrait was a snapshot in a similar silver frame it was of a darkhaired georgian beauty with the typically wide flatplaned face with powerful cheekbones and jawline her coalblack eyes dominated an already strong almost haunting face daniella had never seen a picture of oleg malutas wife but she was certain that this was the woman oreanda she said quite without thinking maluta snatched the photograph out of her hand tilted it away as if even by looking at it she would sully its pristine nature she was quite a handsome woman daniella said wondering how far she could take this maluta grunted he put the photo face down beside the bar as if it meant nothing to him it is late time we were saying our good nights but he did not move and daniella remained where she was all she need do was reach out and pick up the snapshot of oreanda maluta burnt to a crisp in a conflagration of mysterious origin that ravaged the first dacha built on this parcel of land daniella saw in her mind the womans countenance so full of strength and an almost regal bearing one saw that rarely in russian women she wondered again whether oreanda was the key to oleg maluta im not tired she said if you dont mind id prefer to stay here and read for a while do you wish a book i have an extensive library of russian authors i brought my own thank you daniella said the marquis de sade she put aside her tea do you know his creation justine she watched his face carefully this was one of the volumes she had seen on the shelf here she could hardly believe it was his kind of reading crime and punishment was more his style had it been oreandas malutas eyes had narrowed what do you know about me they have conferred to you on bended knee you picked that title i do not believe in coincidence all that made them powerful who have you been talking to there is no one who knows about oreanda no one but myself then that answers the question daniella kept her voice light a small smile on her face she was on the right path she saw it in his breathing i have spoken to no one about your wife yet you know grabbing her wrist as if by this gesture he could wrench the knowledge out of her i know how beautiful oreanda was how strong strong yes strong so unlike a female personality she had only meant her face but had allowed him to finish the thought she had begun this was turning into a psychological interrogation it was a matter now of feeding him the right cues of fanning the fire that had already begun there could never be another woman like her daniella said softly she was very close they key was to remain near him proximity equaling intimacy in this equation she was special so special special his eyes opened wide oh yes she was special she was a world unto herself she was like justine a fierce cold light emanating from his face that daniella struggled to decipher everything changes when i return to moscow i can breathe again after her tears flow after the moonlight disappears from the moskva after the air clears and the rain settles the dust onto the pavement she recalled his earlier questions concerning faith god your love for her will never die no no no he was suddenly wild his grip on her wrist painful oreanda calling her name not in love and remembrance but rather in anger and in fear it is she who will never die never never never but she is dead comrade oreanda is nine years dead those eyes fevered even in the brightest light burnt up black as night i saw the corpse even as they pulled it out of the wreckage the skeletal arm falling away at the socket the eyeless skull staring up at me mocking was it her was it oreanda the coroners office must have checked there had to be a positive id for the death certificate to be issued dental records his head bobbed dental records yes that was how it was done it was oreanda the coroner had no doubt then she is dead comrade what no maluta shouted her down she is here i built this for her she made me build it for her on the same spot then daniella knew it all fell into place malutas almost schizophrenic behavior the uncontrollable bouts of rage the malicious hatred of women of her his torturing her his saying they sold their souls to you bowed their heads before you how wrong she had been this was the magic he had conferred upon her the power that had resided in oreanda the power that made him hate her fully as much as he must have loved her the power that had chained him everything changes when i return to moscow i can breathe again had he set the fire that had killed her had oleg maluta murdered his beloved wife she was determined to find out took his hand saying youre wrong oleg the first time that she had used his given name oreanda is gone gone gone drew his hand inward to the juncture of her thighs this is what remains then to the bulge in his groin and this felt it growing and put her thumb and forefinger around its tip twisted her wrist and his hand fell away freeing her slipped to her knees deftly undid his trousers took him out slipped her lips over the semihard member bathing him in warmth until she felt his own heat rising then she began to use her tongue swiping it along the length curling it as she went fluttering it against the underside of the head until she felt the powerful muscles along the insides of his thighs begin to jump and convulse then she stopped stood up in front of him what he said almost gasping what are you doing starting she said or stopping her halfopen lips were wet shiny with saliva and his own precoital fluids he gave a shiver of anticipation or of fear stopping he said in a shaky voice she put the flat of her hand over his heart could feel the thunder of its beat i cant go on she said oreanda wouldnt like it youre her husband her lover youre hers alone he shivered once more his eyelids fluttering closed i can breathe again he whispered the moonlight on the moskva daniella said in his ear then licked it with the tip of her tongue all the while the tip of his penis was grinding into the palm of her hand grazed her fingernails at its base i can breathe again he coughed oreanda he put his hand on her shoulder pushing her down daniella had clandestinely unbuttoned the uniforms skirt now as she began again to kneel it slithered off her and she stepped out of it she was naked beneath oreanda his mind screamed she had enslaved him with her sexual demands something inside of him had offered her the power and she had swept it from his opened palm it was cruel and vicious this cycle of oleg and oreanda the more power he obtained in his professional life the more he granted her in his private lifeor the more she took from him he did not know which gave him the most pleasure the specter of her sex moving him from place to place within the dacha haunted him still so much so that now he felt his insides melting helplessly in the furnace of daniellas sexual aggression he had not felt such pleasure since maluta gave a sharp cry his fingers clutching at her jacket uh uh uh as her hot mouth engulfed him again all his insults his sneering at her sex had masked this hunger he burned for her hated her for what oreanda had done to him feared her as well terrified that the enslavement that had haunted him for nine years would begin anew everything changes when i return to moscow i can breathe again in the end he worshiped her as he had worshiped oreanda before her daniella took all of him inside her opening her throat and relaxing the reflexive impulses above her maluta gurgled deep in his throat the tip of his penis expanded and began to pulse daniella withdrew her heavily sucking mouth and pulled him down until he was lying on the carpet she knelt over him holding his quivering member in the palm of her hand her knees were on either side of him she guided him to her this is what you want dont you he groaned but youve told me that you never want it she bent over him never ever so now you cant have it she pushed his penis away from between her thighs maluta reached up to grab her but daniella used the edge of her hand to slap him away no no she said not that way not any way perhaps he could have overpowered her perhaps not in any case that was not his desire there must be daniella took the tip of him and again brushed it along the silken flesh between her thighs immediately it began to pulse and throb and she released it she did not touch it would not allow him to either what it was an almost strangled cry i want it what say it she coaxed say i want it i want it maluta said i want to know that you mean it i do mean it i want it here she said lifting him up and settling herself down its yours he let out a long ecstatic groan as she slid all the way down him she rocked back and forth when only the base of him remained unsheathed and he gasped arching his buttocks off the carpet his penis began to convulse shooting heavily deep inside her at the same time his hands reached up cupping her breasts through the thick cloth of the uniform pulled her down against him while he emptied himself inside her when sometime later he slipped out of her she was still astride him her breasts were against his chest his breathing was becoming deep and regular he was nearing sleep she put her fingers around his neck put her lips against his ear until she felt him stir i should kill you now he gave a tiny indrawn breath and she reached down grabbing his flaccid penis gave it a painful twist thats what oreanda would want isnt it what do you mean you killed her oleg what thats right you set the blaze you were clever doing it so that there would be no suspicion of arson but you murdered oreanda just the same no no dont lie to me oleg i know when youre lying im not lying now he cried i had nothing to do with the fire here nothing i swear daniella took her hand away from his penis but not from around his throat i want you to know something oleg she said putting all the contempt she felt into her voice when you were inside me i felt nothing and when i had you in my mouth it was all i could do not to vomit for the thought of it why do you tell me this he said his face averted from hers because its important that you know the truth maluta pushed her off him and clutching his trousers frenziedly pulled them up over his nakedness his face was filled with shame and this gladdened daniellas heart now she thought i have gained a measure of power over him perhaps at last we face each other as equals we are almost there kazamuki said jake sitting beside her in the mitsubishi sports car watched the play of her persimmoncolored kimono as she drove there was not one spot of blood on the lovingly woven silk mikio lay on the back seat holding his wounded arm it is nothing he said into the air in the back of the mitsubishi the blood has already coagulated there is almost no pain please kazamuki said softly as she fired them into a turn an oyabun should conserve his energy jake closed his eyes dizzy with exhaustion he thought of the scene back at kiyomizudera mikio komoto sat with his white fists still wrapped around the chain of the manrikigusari the yakuza who lay sprawled at his feet his white face at an unnatural angle had the end of a black anodized steel bolt protruding through the center of his chest the wicked tripleserrated barbed point had come out the other side the force of the missiles impact had broken his spine kazamuki had made sure her oyabuns life was not in danger before felling jakes last adversary waves of vertigo assailed him as the mitsubishi hurtled out of kyoto heading northeast back to tokyo abruptly he was swept by a blackness that could not be denied he asked kazamuki to stop the car and at the side of the road he got quickly out and vomited without bamahk he was just an ordinary man wearily he climbed back into the car kazamuki had the good manners to be watching her side mirror so as not to be witness to his shame they continued their highspeed journey psychological fatigue as well as physical fatigue brought about by extreme fear mikio komoto sitting with the manrikigusari wound around the young yakuza the wraparound sunglasses shattered the face though grotesque in death apparently recognizable to the oyabun jakesan mikio had said warily i am afraid there is some extremely disturbing news these yakuza are not part of the kisan clan his keen ebon eyes looked up at jake do you understand what that means my security is still intact these men were not after me they were not part of the yakuza war at all woodenly jake had said who are they members of the moro clan have you heard of them jakesan shook his head no are you certain no dealing with them at all when you were working at the quarry not that i am aware of why because my friend this attack was not directed at me you were the objective the mitsubishi hit a bump in the road and at kph it was enough to make jake groan are you unwell jakesan mikios voice from the back seat jake said nothing squeezed his eyes tighter shut they had stopped in kyoto long enough to see a doctor of mikios acquaintance yakuza the damage was minimal now we go to karuizawa mikio had said that is where the moro clan is headquartered jakesan opened his eyes caught the flick of kazamukis eyes is the oyabun awake jake listened to the softness of her voice turned carefully around mikios eyes were closed his breathing deep and regular asleep he said is there a problem that depends she said glancing again in her side mirror for the last twenty kilometers or so the same toyota truck has been two cars behind us are we being followed i think we must find that out neh she turned the wheel hard over and the mitsubishi slewed into the far left lane she stepped on the accelerator until they were doing upwards of kph jake glanced in his side mirror saw the black toyota immediately it was one of the futuristiclooking vans the windows were completely blacked out so that it was impossible to see inside he watched for some kind of movement on the part of the toyota an acceleration to match their own or a change in lane there was nothing the van was now four cars behind now well see kazamuki said accelerated again and now with a high squeal pushed them back through the lanes horns blared the screeching of brakes behind them and then they were onto the offramp jake took another look in the mirror saw the black vans ballooning image here they come he said kazamuki downshifted weaving in and out around two slowing cars and a truck the moment she was beyond them she stamped down on the accelerator running a light three blocks later she slowed until they were almost drifting the toyota blew out of the traffic pattern they had left behind it slowed as soon as its driver picked up their change in speed with a shriek of tires kazamuki brought the mitsubishi back up to fourth gear the toyota came on now it was not directly behind the mitsubishi but rather off to one side it blared its horn at an oncoming car which slewed out of the way running up on the sidewalk the black van closed the distance between them jake could see that the offside window had scrolled down he saw the machinepistol muzzle poke itself out like the snout of an ugly dog out of the way he shouted as he pulled heavily on the wheel what kazamuki cried in alarm as the mitsubishi went hurtling toward a wall heard a series of explosions behind them and kazamuki straightened their run she looked at him briefly theyve got more than katana in that van he said kazamuki concentrated on her driving the toyota had lost some ground during jakes impromtu evasive maneuver but it was gaining on them they had obviously done something to the engine because it was performing like a rocket theyre very close he said and she nodded took the mitsubishi into an acute left turn the speed so great that the two right side tires went off the macadam almost hit a trio of pedestrians who scattered screaming three blocks later she made another left they could hear the squeal of the black vans breaks behind them but could not see it she had them at an unsound speed but that could hardly be helped it was the rush of wind now or the steeljacketed bullets from the machine pistol twisting the mitsubishi into junk one more left and they were almost home now kazamuki accelerated and jakes teeth began to chatter outside was just a blur and he prayed no one would get in their way the wheel hard over and they had completed the circuit the mitsubishi righted itself and took off now they were directly behind the black van not a maneuver for the fainthearted jake thought she ran up their tailpipe and just before a light turning off the green she tramped heavily on the accelerator the mitsubishi obediently shot forward and with a thunderous lurch slammed into the black van the speed was sufficient that the collision sent the toyota careening into the intersection the light had already changed there were cars moving the black van hit two of them broadside and flipped upward it began to roll like an acrobat performing the last electrifying stunt at the climax of the circus the toyota came down hard onto the macadam rear first the gas tank ripped open along with the left side sparks from dragging exposed metal caught the fumes and there was an oddly muffled whump kazamuki cut a hard left and began to accelerate he was known as fung the skeleton because of the tattoo a dancing man composed all of bones that was animated by the rippling of his muscles usually he went shirtless on the job so that everyone could see the tattoo embedded in the layers of skin across his right shoulder blade here it was important that he keep the name alive this was mong kok the northern end of the massive typhoon shelter at yau ma tei on the western side of the kowloon peninsula a veritable sea of boats were moored here encompassing almost every size and shape a city of people lived and worked in this space an extension of the land itself it was easy to get lost here to secrete a treasure even when others were searching for it fung the skeleton possessed such a treasure and certainly there were many who would gladly give up a years salary to discover its whereabouts many had tried with little or no success not because fung the skeleton could not be foundanyone in hong kong could be found for a price not because he was a criminal of such stellar magnitude to command sufficient muscle the fact was that fung the skeleton was a legitimate businessman not on board any of his drugrunning fleet of boats which he visited in the early morning or late at night from nine to five dressed and acted like all the other upwardly mobile tai pan he did not show off his tattoo neither was he known as fung the skeleton ian mckenna would have recognized him immediately as big oysters pok that he was able to lead this rather dangerous double life in the claustrophobic and rumorhungry crown colony was a tribute to his skill and ingenuity the very fact that special branch inspector ian mckenna knew him only by his legitimate identity bespoke fung the skeletons inordinate cleverness legitimate was an approximate word considering that fung the skeleton had gone out of his way to build this third identity for himself as a trader in flesh it amused him to hang out in wan chai one gorgeous woman after another by his side he liked to see the policemens eyes bug out their mouths water for a taste of what he obviously dealt in in a way it was a real joy to play the sleazoid to whom everyone came for information in another life perhaps fung the skeleton would have been an actorand a damn fine one at that but he was alas chinese and the market for chinese actors was as it had always been at a standstill there was of course an extensive police file on fung the skeleton but like many such dossiers it was thick with a hodgepodge of unsubstantiated rumor and useless hearsay there was not one solid fact about the subject certainly no photograph or any such piece of evidence that could lead the special branch to an arrest the simple fact was that too many people got rich off fung the skeletons business for the police ever to hope to rope in an informer besides which it was common knowledge that anyone hindering his affairs would be a dead man within twentyfour hours such was the mans power in a land where modern legends were commonplace he was talked about in the most reverential tones when the malaysian brought bliss to him he was going over backup trade routes with one of his captains ah his boats had primary routes and backup should they run across police interference all the routes changed daily and were known only by fung himself and the captains that way there was no chance of a leak responsibility weighed most heavily fung the skeleton often said when it was borne alone and he was quite correct his security was one hundred percent as it always had been the malaysian held bliss aside while fung the skeleton finished his business with the captain he stood partially between her and his boss so that even if she could read lips she would have no opportunity to do so at length the captain departed shouting to his crew fung the skeleton nodded and the malaysian brought bliss over i know you fung the skeleton said immediately youre jake marocs woman bliss said nothing she wondered whether she had met this man before she had never had anything to do with drugs so she knew only the name but she knew about her fathers past and suspected that the two had met at one time or another fung the skeleton was younger than three oaths by at least two decades but his contacts were so extensive that she could not believe the two had lived their entire lives without their paths crossing on the contrary she said taking a chance i believe you know my father three oaths tsun fung the skeleton lounged against the taffrail of the boat is that so was it he who sent you here no it was the monkey man fung the skeleton grunted held out his hand lets see what you have bliss dug out the fire opal dropped it into his hand fung the skeleton took an inordinately long time examining the jewel at last he looked at her and said where did you get this by his tone alone bliss might have guessed it but the part of her qi that resided in dahei warned her quite clearly that she should not lie to this man so she told him what her father had been told by jake now i know why you are here fung the skeleton said it has nothing to do with selling me australian fire opals it has to do with this particular stone do you know the young woman in question fung the skeleton stood up from the rail moved forward along the side of the boat until he was at the bow bliss went after him the typhoon shelter was live in the early morning with cooking fires children scampering up ratlines wallawallas moving slowly down sea lanes junks putting out to sea or returning laden with unknown cargo far out at the western edge of the shelter she could make out the sleek predatory outline of a police launch lazily patrolling like a shark along a reef somewhere fung the skeleton said out there is the dream of riches beyond comprehension everyone thinks about it cashing in on the one great deal of a lifetime sometimes i think peoplesome peopleare willing to take any risk no matter how dire for the prospect of such riches what do you think i think theres a sucker born every minute bliss said there was silence for a time then abruptly fung the skeleton roared with laughter his captain alerted for bright sharp sounds lifted his head from his charts saw that everything was all right and went back to work i used to believe that the loh faan the foreign devil were the only suckers in this world he turned the opal over in his fingers so that the sun struck the crimson fire dazzling them momentarily now of course i am older wiser i know different to answer your question yes i know the young woman from whom jake took this stone it is my stone she appropriated it from me under let us say delicate circumstances i hope she was worth it bliss said fung the skeleton smiled no single woman is worth the price of this jewel if you knew anything about opals you would understand that why was she following jake fung the skeleton looked out to sea she knew he was following the progress of the police launch it was habit with him perhaps for the same reason she stole this from me meaning she was crazy to do that she knew what would happen to her the only reason i did not have her killed was that jake beat me to it she wasnt crazy bliss said jake would have known that he turned to her then do you have an explanation she wasnt stupid bliss said she was very smart smart enough to keep jake away from his appointment with his father to keep the path clear for those who assassinated shi zilin fung the skeleton looked from blisss face to the flash of intense color between his fingertips why do i have the feeling you know why she stole this i have a feeling about it bliss admitted dahei shi zilin i think she saw the stone knew its value and decided to take the chance but she knew id have her killed within the day then obviously she knew that she would be out of hong kong within hours jake stopped that yes fung the skeleton studied this woman more carefully she was very sharp he wondered just how sharp she was i know she was seeing someone else while she wasat my house do you know who he glanced at his watch im late for an appointment i cannot postpone will you meet me later for dinner where i usually go to star house do you know it in the causeway bay yes eight oclock all right he signed to the malaysian bliss wondered whether he knew anything more she had seen his face read his mind as the malaysian had brought her over she knew when she was being mentally undressed but what choice did she have he was her bestand onlylead to the mysterious woman who had followed jake she had no choice she shrugged eight oclock the storm caught up with qi lin just after she had crossed the southern frontier it might have gotten to her sooner but she had in her mind something the old doctor at jiao zhuang hu had said to her remember the rivers that flow to the sea and she used the great trees that grew by the plateaus wide muddy river for protection now high above sea level qi lin knew that she was at last out of danger she was in the mountains of northern burma the shan states where there was no law and even the chinese army lived in fear she knew that she was within the golden triangle an area that encompassed not only a section of the shan states but areas of laos thailand and her own countrys yunnan province as well she knew that the business here was opium or as it was locally known the tears of the poppy the communist chinese government had been trying for years to stamp out the illegal but enormously profitable opium trade as had the rather ineffectual socialist regime in power in burma but the shan states were a universe unto themselves these mountains were riddled with ancient tribes commanded by ferocious and imposing warlords wellarmed and trained private armies that along with the terrible terrain assured a permanent continuance of the lucrative trade america and russia the most powerful of the world powers qi lin knew had accepted this fact and for years had tried to infiltrate these mountains with the intention of gaining control over the opium trade and its billionsofdollarsayear profits both the cia and the kgb had had so many setbacks in these mountains that qi lin had heard a rumor that there were separate appropriations set aside by both governments to handle the losses the moment she crossed the frontier into burma qi lin became more cautious this was no longer china her documentation was useless here in fact she had stuffed the papers into a pouch and buried it on the yunnan side in the shan states the chinese government was active in trying to destroy the trade thus a chinese citizen there would be subject to hard scrutiny and heavy suspicion but a fugitive newly escaped from prison that was another matter entirely especially if her story was that she was looking for her sister who had fled china just days before her shan means free people this same basic meaning can be applied to the words siam and assam the names of peoples who have settled over a wide area of southeast asia from perhaps the fifteenth century to the shan were ruled by thirtyfour sawbwas lineal princes whose individual fiefdoms were passed down in true feudal hereditary manner nowadays the shan warlords who ruled the golden triangle were often hybrid offshoots of those original ruling families but there were otherand no doubt to herfar more dangerous warlords these few were rogue generals who had defected from the chinese communist army greed avarice the lure of power beyond most mens wildest dreams these warped ideals were what drove them these few even more than the shan princes would be more suspicious of any chinese crossing the border more than anything else qi lin did not want to run into one of these quite near the frontier she was picked up by shan soldiers they wore the red headbands floppy white trousers fatigue blouses and peculiarly heavy quilted jackets traditional of the shan people she did not know their dialect but when prompted one of them spoke an atrociously accented form of pidgin mandarin qi lin allowed herself to be searched and questioned at length she produced the photograph of the old doctors daughter sister she said pointing to her my sister mok the one man who spoke the vile chinese passed the photograph around there was a conference among all the soldiers then mok turned to qi lin said you wait here his face grew fierce if you move orders shoot kill qi lin nodded docilely mok left her surrounded by the others behind them was a concrete bunkerlike structure qi lin could scent a peculiar odor sweet and at the same time sharp at the back of her throat she coughed raising her hand to her mouth and one of the soldiers leveled his ak at her qi lin lifted both hands palms toward the soldier its all right you motherless turdsucking poxridden dog she said in her most servile tone of voice ive got nothing up my sleeves she smiled and the young soldier bared his teeth in response they were as black as night qi lin could see more soldiers trudging with backs bowed by burlap sacks in single file through a door to the concrete building other soldiers guarded them with aks qi lin had not seen such a massed display of firepower in her life even when she was a member of the gong loufu the steel tiger triad in the distance she could see the mule train from which soldiers were offloading the burlap sacks now she recognized the smell it was opium cooking this was a factory where the raw opium was refined into number four or double ouglobe a form of heroin that was so concentrated it took up about onetenth the space of a pound of the raw product in that way it was far easier to transport over difficult terrain and to smuggle into civilization mok was coming back and qi lin redirected her attention none see her the soldier said it was all qi lin could do not to wince as the man singlehandedly destroyed the language i want to see the head man anyway qi lin said careful not to move she was all too aware of the akys trained in her direction uh the head man head man the puzzled look remained on moks face for a moment then he brightened ah ko gyi he said go see him yes she said that is what i want now mok nodded go now mok signed to the other soldiers and they closed ranks around her qi lin watched moks eyes they were flat and wholly opaque something had happened while he was away what by sunset qi lin and her escort had traveled perhaps seven kilometers in distance also they had ascended just over four thousand meters by then she was shivering with the cold no one offered her a jacket on a narrow plain high in the mountains they came upon a village composed of bamboo latticework houses grouped around a central clearing is this where the ah ko gyi is qi lin asked mok ignored her he had said nothing during the entire trek qi lin felt a shiver of a dark premonition but it was too late to turn back and in any case where would she go within the shan village the other members of the escort melted into the twilight mok took qi lin by the arm directing her to a bambooandmud house somewhat larger than the rest the local warlords residence qi lin reckoned someone must have passed on the news of their arrival because as they approached the beatendown staircase to the wide veranda several figures emerged from the house as if this were a prearranged signal mok pushed qi lin forward the intruder mok said in quite excellent mandarin qi lin gaped at him as mok repeated the story of who she was and why she was looking for the woman your name the warlord barked qi lin lied without thinking an instinct for selfpreservation she took her first good look at the man who was exceptionally short as round as a vat with the most powerful arms and shoulders qi lin had ever seen he was wearing army fatigues a sleeveless shirt of a dark indeterminate color to which were affixed several gold and silver pins as if they were medals around his waist was a webbed ammo belt with a black leather holster containing what appeared to be a us army colt he wore soft leather boots all the way up to his knees he seemed totally immune to the biting cold of these high altitudes is this the one qi lin did not understand the question and was about to say so when she realized that the warlord was speaking to a shadowy figure behind him the figure moved slowly almost qi lin believed painfully forward yes the old man said that is she qi lin goggled buddha she had seen that old man before her heart sank all the miles since her incarceration at the hands of colonel hu raced in upon her she felt as if she had been traveling in a circle huaishan han she said bewilderedly is that you you were nothing in miami unless you lived overlooking the ocean mako martinez lived in a condo duplex so vast simbal figured the whole top floor of the quarry offices could have fit nicely into its layout with room to spare it was on the thirtythird and thirtyfourth floors accessed by an elevator that rose fast enough to give you a nosebleed the hallway was wide and plush as a thousanddollaranight whore it was decorated in modern miami pastel padded wallpaper in a ribbon pattern reminiscent of water there were real paintings scattered here and there and expensivelooking rattan furniture flanking the bronze doors of the elevators as if the designers thought this might be a comfy place for a latenight chat every few feet brassedged translucent glass wall sconces drifted light up at the pale salmoncolored ceiling this place reeks from money simbal said martine juanito gato de rosa grunted there are three more towers like this scheduled to be built if it werent for the cash mako and his pals poured into this place to keep it afloat it wouldve been just a rusting skeleton by now the condo business down here stinks we got so many theyre coming outve our asses you sure bennettll be here simbal asked nothings ever for sure in miami dude the cuban said dont need me to remind you of that double doors at the end of the hall opened and they were in simbal had seen many a palace before but really he thought this takes the cake the whole of the south face of the living room which simbal estimated at no less than sixtyfive feet long was a wall of glass which looked out over the intracoastal waterway islands spangled with night lights off to the right rose the distant highrise hotels of the beach as it was locally known near the eastern end of the room a great floating spiral staircase made up of lucite wedges lit along their front edges with tiny sparkling lights wound its way up to the second floor otherwise the expanse was filled with lengths of sleek slate sofas oversized curved chairs of supple umber leather that had that maneating look indigenous to so much ultramodern furniture taupe sandpainted walls upon which enormous eerily amorphous abstracts in smears of mauves and pinks floated potted fiddlehead ferns sprouting corn plants feathery horsetail palms strewn about there was even a natural hemp hammock strung between architectural columns a model of grotesquely inhuman proportions was stretched out on it exhibiting her bone structure the place simbal decided would have given the shah of iran the willies he edged away from the cuban and went through the crowded living room rock music was blaring the police simbal was amused there were so many men wearing unconstructed linen and silk jackets sleeves pushed up their hairy arms to call all the more attention to the tshirts they wore underneath that simbal thought good christ are they filming miami vice anywhere near he went up the spiral staircase which was narrow enough so that when he had to pass a woman in a crepe gown and a martini coming down things got interesting for a moment simbal thought she was going to ask him to do it right there but she only licked her lips and said ill be sure to see you later upstairs the polished honey parquet floor gave way to thick pile walltowall the color of clotted cream it made you want to take off your shoes and run through it barefoot which was just what a young woman with long red hair was doing she had lifted her full mexican peasant skirt up with both hands so high not only her sleek thighs gleamed in the lights but the smallest pair of panties simbal had ever seen the sea of hair in which the minuscule swatch of fabric was buried was the object of everyones attention simbal looked around found the portable bar he asked for an absolut on the rocks and took a sip wandered off there was a balcony up here as well not as wide perhaps as the one on the first floor but it was adequate enough simbal peered out through the glass at the motor launches moving lazily along the intracoastal a tiny uninhabited island had been festooned with colored lights so the lush unspoiled foliage could be admired at any hour his eye caught a movement and the multicolored illumination revealed the flat planes of a face with which he was familiar runrun yi new yorks diqui honcho and by all reports alan thunes strongest supporter into the organizations higher echelons who was he talking with simbal drifted some more darkness and then the light bennett the voodoo spook himself simbal took a long look and then as bennett suddenly turned in his direction as an eruption of noise came through the open windowdoors stepped quickly back when simbal looked again yi was alone cursing he put his drink aside and went out along the terrace movement shadows and light blending couples swaying to the rich soaring voice of nona hendryx funky jazzily complex pushed his way through the throng passed right by runrun yi who was leaning on the rail staring down simbal paused did the same saw bennett on the floor below inside the woman with the long red hair had lifted her peasant skirt all the way over her head already three latino types dripping grease and ninehundreddollar armani suits were beginning to close in the hungry look of the predator on their shiny faces an eggshaped cocktail table had been cleared of its carefully arranged array of crystal bowls thick verbenascented candles a stark japanesestyle arrangement of bird of paradise and now four kneeling couples were taking turns slurping lines of white powder off the glass top with a golden straw jesus simbal thought as he brushed hurriedly past them all this scene needs now is lots wife his progress down the shimmering spiral staircase was impeded momentarily by a macho man with too much hair and gold on his chest who was drunk or high or both simbal finally pushed him in the direction of the eggshaped table as he raced the rest of the way down to the lower floor he wondered what had happened to spook bennett had he caught sight of simbal if so the recognition factor had been instantaneous then simbal remembered a note from bennetts accessed u file that was the confidential shrink personalityevaluation section bennett had an eidetic memory his recall of visual data was absolute then it was a sure bet he had caught a glimpse of simbal talking heads were singing about a psycho killer as simbal got a visual fix on bennett the cuban had picked him up as well knew from the look in bennetts eyes that a wheel had come loose somewhere he and a young mexican woman were standing between bennett and the front door simbal headed their way there was some heated talk but david bowie singing something about templars and saracens made it impossible to make out what even though the two of them seemed to be shouting bennett raised his fists first and the cuban tramped hard on his instep bennett used his elbow ramming it into the cubans ribs then his ham fist already cocked struck down at the side of the cubans face gato de rosa was reeling as bennett grabbed at the mexican woman spun both of them out the door simbal caught the cuban as he was about to fall lifted him up his head came around his eyes uncrossing slowly martine that you dude yeah bennetts a little highstrung these days wouldnt you say hes got maria shes a local contact ive been working the cuban hawked into a linen handkerchief stared at it as if hed never seen his own blood before goddamn it lets get the sonofabitch simbal said you watch that dirty temper of yours dude the cuban said thats my corazon hes got with him the sconces of light seemed like empty smiles mocking them gato de rosa swabbed at the side of his mouth with the bloody handkerchief as the descending elevator tried its best to burst their eardrums no ones ever done that to me the cuban said he seemed more concerned with the loss to his peculiar brand of personal honor hijo de puta whatd he say he said to me whats that goddamned fucking pig tony simbal doing trying to shove his snout up my ass i told him he must be hallucinating and he said simbals fucking here and youd better believe that i know who hes looking for hes a goddamned oneman terminator i resent that simbal said hotly dont knock your rep dude the doors slid open on the ground floor and they stepped out simbal took a step toward the lobby but the cuban said hey man this way they went out the back down a wide bluestone path lit by brass ground lights with a vaguely nautical motif palm fiddlehead swayed and insects buzzed flinging themselves suicidally against the hot lights ahead of them simbal could see the boat slips that along with the famous but faded australian tennis pro was one of the condos main selling points he didnt come in a car the cuban said as they began to sprint down the path cars make bennett nervous he doesnt go anywhere he cant get to by boat he pointed as they turned along the quayside thats his cigarette there the black one with white trim cigarettes were common in miami slim power launches that were almost all engine they were manufactured primarily as racing craft in miami they had been adapted for use by the drug smugglers who plied the ten thousand waterways covelets and tiny beachfronts that beribboned the coastline dont come any closer bennetts shout brought them up short they were not more than one boats length away from the stern of the black cigarette thiss the end of the line for the two of you eddie i dont know whats gotten into you i shut your fucking lying mouth you cuban cocksucker now look no you look pimpface bennett emerged from the shadows of the cigarettes cowling with a figure held tight to his front simbal could see the magnum pointed at marias temple you look at this wanta see her brains splattered all over the dock hotshots simbal and gato de rosa said nothing bennett laughed and his heavy face twisted in a sneer look at you i wish i could play you a video tape of your faces jesus you look stupid what a couple of fucking boy scouts let her go eddie the cuban said shes only a skirt you dont want to do nothin to her bennett sneered you better pray i dont dude i dont know what youre up to eddie the cuban said i know simbal said hes joined the lunatic fringe watch your mouth boy scout bennett pushed the muzzle of the magnum so hard against marias temple her head canted over at an angle you think i wont waste her youre fucking jerks they sent me up to new york to do a number on alan thune you heard about that one i know everyfuckingbody heard about it that was the point of it what the fuckre you doin gato de rosa said to simbal under his breath i warned you about this the thing was simbal knew to break the deadlock this was not a siege situation where time was almost always on the side of those who waited longest this was what simbal called a flashburn a shortfuse situation that was going to be resolved quickly one way or another the person who thought the fastest would come out the winner he looked for a minute into marias liquid eyes saw to his surprise no fear or panic that was good perhaps there was a chance after all you know what youve become bennett simbal deliberately raised his voice youre a pariah martine bennett said whats he talkin about you aint got a home buddy simbal continued youre a rolling stone nobody wants youre fucking out of your mind bennett called back looney tunes but simbal had his attention youve been put on the hit list fuck the dea bennett said laughing again i got myself a better home i make more money than you poor dumb shits could ever dream of im here to put you out of your misery bennett yeah i figured the company hitman no no youve got it wrong bennett the diqui hired me what reaction time was everything under normal circumstances one had only ones training to rely on and one had to hope ones own training was the better but there were times of extreme peril when that kind of thinking was inadequate when one needed an edge it had been simbals experience that the only advantage to be sought in such times was that of surprise the body responded instinctively to motion so this had to be discounted the mind was the target the mind had to be frozen that infinitesimal instant so that the impulses to the nerves and muscles were delayed the fraction needed to gain the advantage the words were not entirely out of simbals mouth when he was already pushing his body on its way one two three strides and then leap you bloody bastard leap into poor marias torso knocking her and bennett backward the three of them tumbling to the deck everything happening in a blur bad luck handcuffing him the edge of bennetts cowboy boot rising in reflex catching simbal over the right eye the magnum discharging marias chest exploding bennett charging while simbal was still recovering the muzzle of the magnum landing alongside simbals nose making breathing impossible the nerves in his face going numb simbal fighting back now out of pure instinct the organism in terror for its own life cared nothing but to wrest control of the gun from bennett it had seen what one hollownosed bullet had done to a human being and it wanted nothing more to do with the working end of the magnum still on the dock the cuban had his pistol out he could see maria but he did not know how badly she had been hit the shots had stayed him from leaping onto the cigarette the three of them were so entangled that he feared his intervention would get maria or simbal shot a knee in bennetts groin brought the pistol down far enough for simbals bloody fingers to slip over its slick metal surface simbal chopped blindly down made another grab for the magnum it flipped over the side making a heavy splash bennett used his ham fists locking the fingers together bringing the combination down like a cudgel on the back of simbals neck that was the end of it simbal had absorbed too much in too little time to recover he went down in a heap and bennett kicked him savagely once twice fumbled in a locker drew out a mack trained the mini machine pistol on the cuban who had started forward with the sound of the magnum going into the water sorry about the skirt brother bennett said but youve only to blame this shitforbrains for that he let off a quick burst as the cuban made an abortive move youre not as stupid as this one here bennett said so throw down the gun with one eye on gato de rosa bennett undid the mooring lines then started the engines a rumbling liquid roar and he guided the black cigarette out of the dock when he deemed it far enough he put the boat into neutral went back along the deck to where simbal and maria lay unmoving bennett reached out and lifted simbal onto his shoulder with an animal grunt he threw him overboard said to no one in particular dont pollute this ratinfested place too much he spat into the place where the body had sunk back at the helm he turned the wheel hard over and in a thick plume of phosphorescent spray was gone the star house in causeway bay was the kind of restaurant bliss usually avoided great multifaceted crystal chandeliers floated above circular tables for eight or ten people ornate carved dragons rippled in lurid basrelief along the giltflecked walls and columns in the form of crimsonandemerald phoenixes studded the interior in all it was the kind of outoftheway place that tourists flocked to simply because it wasnt in the hong kong tourist association guidebook and because of its rather awesome decor was believed to be frequented by the locals who really know good food the two or three times bliss had come here the food had been solidly mediocre but this time was different each dish put before them was sparklingly fresh and absolutely delicious when she commented on this big oysters pok laughed and said they all say that everyone i take here i like to see the looks on their faces when they walk in and when they take their first bite of faahn the answers quite uncomplicated the chef is my brotherinlaw he cherishes my sister like no one else in the world therefore he says he owes me everything how is that my parents are dead big oyster pok said i see as the head of the family it was up to him to approve of the marriage obviously he had tonight he was big oysters pok not fung the skeleton pale oystergray linen suit pinstriped shirt with a pastel blue background midnightblue raw silk tie he was very dapper difficult to recognize as the muscular barebacked smuggler she had met earlier in the day he said something amusing and bliss laughed he nodded his head smiling almost shyly he found himself liking her she was unlike any woman he had ever met she had the mind of a man and that intrigued him he saw no weakness in her only a shrewdness that made her flexible occasionally big oysters pok had run across the new breed of westem woman tough as steel and about as appetizing in pushing themselves into what was essentially a male arena they had hardened their souls male strengththe pattern which they followed with slavish devotionhad made them inflexible because they had mistaken an essential quality of this nature one learned strength in business by watching the work of the ocean against the rocks along the beach the sea endured while the stones over time became smaller and smaller bliss was so unlike these new western mistresses of corporate entities it was startling it was unlike himso untraditionalto find such strength in a female attractive yet he did across the table bliss was not unaware of his change in attitude but she was unable to address herself fully to the shift part of her had slipped into dahei her qi strung out across the bosom of the south china sea moonlight dappled the waves the whine of powerful diesels far off yet carried in the water along with the long drawnout notes of the whales conversing pack to pack annoyed at being drawn away from her mission she made an effort to turn her back on dahei if she was to get the name of the woman who followed jake who knew of his appointment with zilin she knew she would need all her concentration big oysters pok was not just another smuggler of the tears of the poppy he was a complex man she needed to know what his quid pro quo was going to be for the information she soughtbefore he asked his price that was the only way to deal with such a shrewd businessman you seem to change personalities as easily as you change clothes she said big oysters pok smiled it is only a modest quality not even a talent really if i live many lives i can have many loves so that is what he wants bliss thought me i imagine it can be dangerous as well she said being so many people brings complications doesnt it he shrugged perhaps that is one of the reasons i pursue such lives like smuggling there is a high degree of risk i find that life has no meaning without such an element like sichuan peppers risk imparts an undeniable piquancy that is instantly identifiable you could put a revolver to your head and play russian roulette bliss said big oysters pok laughed ive done that as well on a bet or a dare i got one of my boats that way very easy he laughed again about the woman who stole this opal bliss said big oysters pok looked at her do i get it back she slid it across the table big oysters pok said she was my mistress until i found out that she was meeting a communist agent from the mainland she was a communist spy yes her eyes losing focus night turning to day the moonlight shimmering a pathway leading her on dahei engulfing her not now im almost there the strange calling of the sea creatures blending into the pathway of light intensifying the illumination until it transmogrified into a voice calling to her coming hes coming whos coming hes coming coming now big oysters pok turning his head chopsticks clattering off the edge of the plate as he let them go big oysters pok trying to rise as bliss sat enraptured by the ethereal voices in dahei big oysters pok opening his mouth saying dew neh loh moh on y then the explosions one two three four five six as the bullets landed out in the night the fires were burning in the outback behind ian mckennas eyes the greenheaded fly taptaptapping on the convex surface of the buggered boys milky eye staring blindly up at the winking stars in the desert in the death of innocence in time out of mind when ian mckenna went mad the string had been pulled then but his mind refused to believe it to accept any responsibility for its own agonizing predicament rather it was the magic the magic of the sparking fires ringing the outback the runic chanting that had ensorcelled him the wogs mckenna had decided it was the bloody wogs who wanted him dead who insisted that he pay for his sin his crime against nature aborigine or chinese it no longer mattered to mckenna one and the other was blended in his mind in a kind of hideous amalgam a largerthanlife figure that sought to humble him to take from him his superiority his very manhood the mind twisted by such torment sought the nearest target the one who had most recently humbled it big oysters pok ian mckenna had been searching for big oysters pok in every dive in wan chai then someone in the pink teacup had reminded him that pok invariably ate dinner at the star house in causeway bay mckenna had walked in his redbrimmed eyes staring wildly he was quite mad but since they considered all gwai loh mad the chinese scurrying back and forth along the crowded aisles with foodladen trays held high paid him no attention even when he approached big oysters poks table at full speed until he pulled out the magnum and squeezing the trigger six times emptied it and all hell broke loose i have made all the necessary calls eyes closed his mind was floating in darkness in nothingness jakesan did you hear me hai mikiosan he said wearily i heard you mikio settled himself across from jake on the tatami across the room kazamuki standing by the window waited for mikios sign he gave it just a slight flick of his hand she bowed slightly and left the room in such utter silence that jake tired to the bone was not aware that she had gone i have spent some time speaking to my contacts in the prefecture police mikio went on as if nothing had transpired you have nothing to fear from them believe me how did you manage that jake said without humor weve left rather a mess in our wake mikio ignored the impolite question he was more concerned to see his friend in such emotional anguish jakes tone made it clear that he was immersed in selfpity mikio thought that was quite unlike him mikio grunted its been nothing compared to the war ive been waging the last few weeks do not concern yourself clandestinely he peered at his friend wondering whether the death of jakes father was the cause of this despair they were in a large room by japanese standards in a large house by japanese standards but this was karuizawa the elegant resort so dear to the hearts of tokyos upper crust here amid wide larchlined streets within estate villas set back by exquisitely groomed lawns the traditional elite of tokyo came to relax and have fun karuizawa was a resort with a split personality here in the old section the imperial family stayed along with poets and artists the older corporate heads not a kilometer away was the other side of the coin where the new richthe sons and daughters of the old monied classstrolled dressed in the latest fila and ellesse tennis togs swinging prince graphite racquets over their shoulders splurging between sets at the trendiest boutiques here the lifestyle revolved around the concept of see and be seen only two hours north by car from the center of tokyo karuizawa sat cool clean and beautiful along the ridge of the japanese alps the central spine of honshu we are close to the core of the moro clan jakesan mikio said now concern darkened his face jakes eyes remained closed his lips unmoving jakesan have you any saki mikio considered a moment then rose and fetched a bottle from the cedar sideboard he returned with two tiny cups on a red lacquered tray only when he heard the trickle of the rice wine did jake open his eyes mikio handed him the cup i regret it is not hot jake downed the saki in one convulsive gulp mikio thoughtful sipped at his pain mikio said carefully always seems hardest to bear when it dwells solely in the mind i have been injured many times in my life some badly some not so but the pain of all my wounds was nothing in the face of the pain i suffered when my wife kaziko died he had never said how it had happened and jake had had the good manners not to ask as jake refilled his cup mikio said i think because she died in childbirth because both of us had labored so long to have a child because in the end neither of them could be saved their passing would not let me be for a very long time jake was silent his respect was more eloquent than a hundred thankyous in a moment mikio resumed i tell you all this jakesan so you will understand that i have had much experience in the matters of pain so you will not take offense when i say that i see a similar kind of pain binding you jake looked away into the distance the immutability of the wooded hills was a comfort you may have come here to find out who killed your father jakesan mikio said but it seems clear to me that you had another reasonjust as personal and perhaps even more urgent jake finished off the rice wine and put his cup onto the lacquered tray he did not reach for more his hands folded in his lap were quite still i have lost more than my father mikiosan i have lost the center of myself i can no longer enter bamahk i cannot feel the pulse as i have been taught to without bamahk my entire life has changed when the oceans tide turns mikio said the world is altered this occurs twice a day many many times in a lifetime it is not the same on the contrary jakesan it is just the same the tide is mighty even boats dare not sail against it but as the tide changes so do circumstances whatever changes must change back again i do not think that my ability to enter bamahk will return that may very well be jakesan if so it is your karma joss neh you must accept whatever has befallen you you must accept it and go on because strength of spirit unlike the strength of the tide must not be allowed to ebb strength of spirit is all that makes a man it is all that differentiates him from the animals it is by this alone that man may consider himself civilized this solely must be the focus of your thoughts even though the pain you feel hinders youespecially because of that because the spirit must remain strong always he put down his cup always jakesan or all is lost jake was thinking of the mountain his father had spoken of a lifetime ago or so it seemed when they had sat on the shore of the south china sea zilin had said that it was on the mountain that he would be tested there it was dark and jake was alone jake knew that mikio was right jake might have arrived in japan in order to ferret out the identity of his fathers murderer to prefect the inner circle to help mikio his friend but these were practical matters there was the spritual side as well this really was why he had been so determined to return to japan the place where he had been educated the baffling loss of bamahk had caused a crisis within him he had needed a renewal of spirit and sought it in the ancient mystic hillsides of japan where the true essence of his youth resided when he looked up he saw kazamuki standing just inside the door she wore an oversize black blouse loose black trousers what appeared to be black thinsoled dancers shoes her thick black hair had disappeared within a tight black cotton headband her face was streaked with lampblack we are ready oyabun good mikio komoto rose and took the canvas bag from kazamuki he bent opened the zip top pulled out several items he turned back to jake and said no matter what has happened you are still yumitori the holder of the bow he stretched out his arm jake saw that he held an ouruma wood war bow it is time that you took up your weapon their eyes met gratefully his heart filled up again jake took it from him the burmese rain forest at five thousand meters closed over their heads like a vast cathedral the triple canopy was brilliant with life a teeming flow as rich as that of the ocean sir john bluestone said we have them now his red face was aglow with good humor weve broken the yuhnhyun he sat behind a battered bamboo desk it was a far cry from his own intricately carved bangkok rosewood desk at five star pacific but that did not matter to him this moment was special to be savored like a wine of the finest vintage the knowledge that he was close to controlling his enemies business interests made him tremble so that he was obliged to press his hands hard against one another beneath the desk now we have begun our run on interasia trading he was speaking of the yuhnhyuns umbrella corporation with the disaster of southasia bancorp nagging at our enemies our move on the hang seng has had its maximum effect whiteeye kao was not impressed he went across the faded blueandgold hereka rug and fixed himself a drink from one of several bottles scattered atop a halfopen crate the view out the dusty windows partly covered by tattered yellowed newspaper was full of shan soldiers carrying aks and burlap bags of opium the sickly sweet stench of the refining of the tears of the poppy hung heavily in the air whiteeye kao downed some scotch poured more amber liquid he was waiting for the word the idea is to gain fiftyone percent of interasia trading before they have a chance to know whats happening said a voice from the shadows it had come whiteeye kao turned into the recesses of the room he watched the small figure with the kind of avidity the other man could neither pick up nor understand if sawyer or three oaths tsun get an inkling of whats going on before we have bought up a sufficient number of shares tai pan they could cause us discomfort though he spoke only in the most deferential tones bluestone listened intently to the third man he was chinese his age could be anywhere from fifty to seventyfive his skin was smooth except at one corner of his mouth where a pale puckered scar turned it down into a perpetual frown yet despite this he was a handsome man he had the eyes of a twentyyearold undimmed by either time or ennui he possessed as well a singular kind of electricity he was not a man to cross one disagreed with him only at great peril or when absolutely certain of the correctness of ones position chen ju was a most implacable enemy we are at a critical stage he went on and i must reiterate there is no room for a mistake the cards we hold are fragile at best at this moment they give us a tremendous advantage over the yuhnhyun that is certainly undeniable we must be vigilant to ensure that we maintain the advantage bluestone unfolded himself from the scarred wooden chair he felt obliged to show off every inch of his height in front of this particular chinese bluestone who was among the most pragmatic of men nevertheless felt acutely uncomfortable in the presence of chen ju bluestone thrived on control and control was the one thing he was unsure of with this man chen ju possessed more power than any other man bluestone had met in fact for a man who clung to secrecy with such tenacity chen jus influence was staggering not one ounce of opium bluestone had learned on linking up with him moved in or out of hong kong without his knowledge consent and assistance what i could do with such an awesome shadow network bluestone thought greedily how can i turn this partnership to my own advantage i want what chen ju has now i must see how best to wrest his power from him with an effort bluestone grinned broadly there is no reason to be so gloomy my friend we are almost home he clenched his fist i can feel the noose tightening around that bastard sawyers neck have no fear chen ju whiteeye kao smiled but he was enmeshed within bars of shadow and therefore quite safe it was a most secret smile it was chen ju who had trained him set him on sir john bluestone as a spy i have no fear the scarred chinese said have a care he stared at the tall englishman and thought never in my wildest imagination would i have believed that i would be in league with a gwai loh it was hatred that bound these two men togetherhatred for andrew sawyer once chen ju had been barton sawyers most trusted comprador andrews father had been an extremely talented businessman it was his expertise as tai pan of sawyer sons that had made the trading company flourish his expertise and shi zilins chen ju clenched his teeth at the memory if not for shi zilins intervention chen ju himself would have eventually become tai pan of sawyer sons shi zilin and andrew sawyer had taken from him that which had been rightfully his before shi zilins coming andrew sawyer had been totally unfit to become tai pan the sawyer sons name was a total misnomer though bartons tai tai had birthed him three sons before she had died the eldest had died in a boating accident the youngest had been born an idiot and had mercifully failed to live beyond his fifth birthday that left only andrew despite his fathers great dream of founding a dynasty of sawyers seeing that andrew was obviously unfit to carry the burden of the trading house on his shoulders chen ju had gone to his tai pan to suggest an alternative if i had no sons at all barton sawyer had said you know that you would have to carry on after im gone i am only thinking of the house tai pan chen ju had said i know that but chen ju had also been thinking of himself he wanted to be tai pan after years so close to the power source after all that time whispering advice in barton sawyers ear he craved status above that of comprador he craved too to turn sawyer sons into an asian trading house it was only in this way he believed that the company could compete effectively for the spot of the emperors housethe name traditionally given hong kongs most respected trading company in chen jus mind andrew sawyer as tai pan would take sawyer sons from the running for all time therefore he set out to prove to his tai pan that he had been correct about andrews unfitness he conceived a plan to introduce andrew to the daughter of jiu ximin this was very amusing to chen ju since the girls father was a labor organizer and fully seventy percent of sawyer v sons labor force came under his jurisdiction he was not a man with whom barton sawyer could afford to be at odds yet that was surely what would happen if andrew were foolish enough to start seeing her it was one thing for the son of a tai pan to visit a brothel and there have his needs assuaged by women of the pillow world they might even be chinese but to see a chinese girl in the open without having an intention of marrying her was unthinkable it was andrew sawyers ultimate test and he failed the eldest daughter of jiu ximin was an exquisite flower indeed chen ju had chosen well she had a face that would have set a blind man on fire all went as the comprador had planned until shi zilin had once again stepped in unbeknownst to chen ju andrew had gone to shi zilin seeking aid and shi zilin had provided it he had mediated with the girls father and had gotten andrew off the hook before chen ju had been able to go to barton sawyer with the sad news about his wayward son suddenly there was no news to bring and to boot shi zilin was tutoring the young man in the ways of the tai pan chen ju never found out what precisely shi zilin had exacted as payment but it must have been substantial for the debt was large in any case that was the end of the road for chen ju at sawyer sons he would never be tai pan now and increasingly shi zilin was usurping what power remained to him he left have a care bluestone echoed now he grunted you sound like my grandmother i know enough to take a scarf when i go out in winter yes chen ju said but do you wrap it around your throat he clasped his hands on his rounded stomach i have waited a long time to exact my revenge do you suppose that i will allow someone else to assure me that everything is all right what could go wrong now bluestone wanted to know the old man shi zilin is dead his son jake maroc is god only knows where three oaths tsun is busy with the mares nest of the takeover threat weve given him with neon chow we have a direct pipeline into the yuhnhyun and the only other tai pan we need fear t y chung has just negotiated a partnership with me he spread his hands as if to say what more could you want yes chen ju thought t y chung you seek to subvert him just as you will seek to subvert my own power but you are nothing next to me tai pan i have contrived to reveal to you only a fraction of my power it would dazzle you if you ever caught a glimpse of its real extent maroc may be out of our sight chen ju said but i for one do not see that as a cause for celebration just the opposite in fact have a care bluestone said mockingly precisely tai pan chen ju said as if he were too dense to have caught the others tone but inwardly he thought this arrogant gwai loh needs to be shown his place in the world jake maroc is shi zilins son he went on he is the zhuan the chosen one do you think that means nothing bluestone shrugged it is a name only in china tai pan i need not remind you that there is power in a name chen ju said evenly reining in his temper jake was given that name by shi zilin do you think the old man was a fool if so you have already embarked upon a dangerous course i have nothing to fear from jake maroc bluestone said thinking of neon chow at the center of shi zilins yuhnhyun chen ju was out of the chair and at bluestones side in a blur of motion the look in those black predators eyes made bluestones mouth go dry you are in partnership with me now chen jus whisper was like a serrated blade at the tai pans neck so much menace did it hold i will not tolerate stupidity you have underestimated jake maroc in the past if you cannot learn by your mistakes you are of no use to me the rage bluestone now feltthat of the civilized westerner against the primitive easternerthreatened to overwhelm him whiteeye kao felt it and tensed rising on the balls of his feet ready to spring into action one blow would be sufficient to fell the tall englishman chen ju aware as well of how deeply his words had cut into blue stone waited a moment then made a clandestine hand signal whiteeye kao relaxed you control your emotions almost as well as a chinese chen ju said to bluestone that is one lesson you have learned well his eyes bored into bluestones can you learn this one as well i wonder maroc there was a thickness to bluestones voice i will not underestimate him chen ju cocked his head remember what you have pledged here tai pan when you walk out this door there will be no one to remind you interasia will soon be mine to run this is your pledge to me bluestone said pulling himself together with an effort that knowledge alone will break jake maroc yes chen ju agreed interasia for you kam sang for me oh but he is greedy he thought and that greed blinds him to the truth he is too stupid to see where the true power lies like all gwai loh he is attracted to that which glitters not that which abides equal partners eh a fair split of the spoils bluestone said thinking i can afford to be generous ive got the better of this deal exactly tai pan chen ju said without me he would be no closer to control of interasia than the man in the streets of hong kong he thought it was i who maneuvered southasias comptroller into embezzling the corporations assets the man gambled incessantly he was a chronic loser it was easy to direct him to people in my employ easier still to threaten his wife and children so that he would see that he had no choice at all he did what i wished i gave the information to bluestone and now after he gains his fiftyone percent control of interasia trading he will be content the fool the world is in the palm of his hand and he is not aware of it as long as i know what kam sang is all about bluestone reminded him this is what general vorkuta is dying to learn he thought what a coup for me to get it for her chen ju knows nothing of my connection with moscow center and i must ensure that he never does knowing the chinese he would turn on me instantly were he to find out that i am the kgbs top operative in hong kong chen ju smiled rest assured when i know kam sangs secrets you will as well we both desire the destruction of andrew sawyer bluestone said without sawyer and sons five star pacific will become preeminent among westerndirected trading houses in hong kong but i desire much more chen ju thought already i look beyond hong kong beyond all of asia even my mind encompasses more than any other chinese before me and kam sang will deliver it all to me i wonder what this gwai loh would think if he knew who i really was and what i have been doing all these years since the war he laughed inwardly in a way it was the war which shaped my direction ironic isnt it that the war which brought so much destruction upon china and chinese should have provided me with the basis for my future but then i wasnt in china at all in those days bluestones desire to see andrew sawyer toppled precluded his looking carefully at my own motives my joss is good in that he wanted to believe in mein what i could provide himand so he did better for the both of us in the long run at least as far as i am concerned well chen ju said now all the wheels have been set in motion tomorrow or the next day perhaps southasia will collapse our buying of interasia shares will continue as the price falls on the hang seng then the entire yuhnhyun will be ours he stood for now there is nothing more to do he smiled amiably would you care to join me for dinner tai pan of course bluestone said it will be a delight shadows in twilight three black ravens caught up in the darkling lane past two long mercedes limousines that mikio whispered had been especially manufactured for hige moro the oyabun with halfinch armor plate and builtin tear gas dispensers quite illegal of course mikio whispered raven to raven but who was to stop him not the police surely three swaying cryptomeria one for each raven the shadows beneath deep enough to shield them in their black garb from even the most vigilant eyes hige moro runs the clan mikio had said but he has three brothers all younger than he to whom he has parceled out sections of the moro territory this was the express wish of their father who it is said before he died detailed this unorthodox method of organizational design so that like the legendary hydra the moro clan will have many heads many lives so that it cannot be destroyed by willful enemies three black ravens creeping through the shadows of the underbrush that surrounded the huge tiered villa of the moros but it is hige moro whom we must confront only he will know the truth of why you are being hunted here the others are useless to us i think it would be better if i went myself jake said i am affiliated with no clan and therefore my attack can engender no retaliation you already have enough to think about with your war with the kisan clan on the contrary mikio replied hige moro has broken faith with the yakuza code several times he has attacked you my friend on my territory he has also tried to kill kazamuki and myself in the bargain hige has only himself to blame for what may befall him now none of the other clans will lift a hand against me or even you night enveloped the villa like the hand of buddha fireflies darted here and there bobbing above the vast manicured lawn like tiny fishing boats upon the ocean the ravens moved through them like gargantuan wraiths silent as gods mikio held his katana before him its scrollworked sheath had been left behind in their car tucked within the crook of her elbow kazamuki carried a hado miniaturized machine pistol it was capable of spewing out a hundred rounds per second and was aircooled with a boron muzzle to prevent overheating this must be done very fast mikio had said as he spread out the floor plan of the moro villa if we are to get at hige the longer it takes us the higher the odds become he will be here in the center of the house which was constructed for his father and is something like a maze are we certain of higes exact location jake had asked mikio had nodded kazamuki has seen to it the first line of defense was the dogs jake saw the gleaming black backs of the dobermans as they came bounding over a copse of azalea pruned into a massive hedge he drew back on the war bow and let fly allowing his mind free reign moving effortlessly through kata the phases of kyujutsu ashibumi the balanced archers stance dozukuri the centralizing breathing the raising and lowering of the bow with the draw of the arrow uchiokoshi hikiwake kai the sighting of the target hanare the release and the final zanshin the most critical aspect as the archers spirit follows the arrows humming flight the lead doberman went down without a sound and mikio stepped forward as the second one growling deep in its throat leapt upward the katana flashed its fearful shades of steel cleaving through the neck of the careering animal in one clean stroke they moved on past the hedge of azalea the heady scent of roses and jasmine laced the air mikio signed to kazamuki who moved off toward the rear entrance ninety seconds later he glanced at his watch a night bird called then again and he said it is time sheis in place jake removed a steeltipped arrow known as tsubbekine because of the odd chiselshaped head he notched it now mikio said softly and jake released the tension the arrow struck the front door splintering wood shattering the oldstyle iron lock mikio was already running up the front steps crashing through the broken door jake was just behind him his hand reaching back notching another arrow letting fly in almost the same motion the rinzetsu the dragons tongue piercing the heart of an oncoming yakuza guard there were three more mikio felled two with upward downward strokes of the razoredged sword another dragons tongue punctured the neck of the third yakuza they heard the unmistakable burtburtburt of the hado and knew that kazamuki was in she would not penetrate to the heart of the villa but stand guard to assure that hige could not escape out the back jake and mikio went quickly through the rooms it was imperative that all the yakuza in the villa be accounted for and dispatched none left alive would tolerate an attack on their oyabun so there was no choice the click of a safety being thrown off and mikio whirled slashed up and out a young man halfdressed screamed as his extended arm was cut in two mikio struck again and the yakuza collapsed two barechested men their irezumitattoosrippling in the low light rushed from the right side jake loosed two arrows in a blur and the men were flung sideways katana clattering away they rushed through the villa the burtburtburt came again this time in a longer burst mikio had shown them the best route to higes quarters but it was essential that they check every room there was one arrow in jakes quiver kept apart this looked like none of the others its tip was three times the size it was known as watakushi the fleshtearer such was the destruction its tip caused even an inexpert marksman could kill his foe with it in the hands of a kyujutsu sensei such as jake the watakushi was a weapon of appalling proportions this terrifying missile was for hige moro they found him in his quarters along with four of his guards mikio using the seven stones cut struck two of them down immediately the third convulsed in the attack stance with a dragons tongue through his belly the fourth man struck at mikio parried mikios blows in expert fashion he began his own counterattack and with every blow it seemed the tip of his katana came closer and closer to piercing mikios flesh in this manner his confidence grew fed by his success this confidence grew into aggression and then the beginning of triumph as he saw his blade flick against his foes skin drawing blood he redoubled his attack which was precisely what mikio had been waiting for mikio performed the airsea change abandoning one strategy for another in that breathless moment when mikios strategy was hidden from him the yakuza was made vulnerable using the red leaf cut mikio penetrated his defense and deflecting his katana away with a clang stabbed forward with his entire spirit the man was dead before he hit the floor now there was only hige moro a bulletheaded man with saltandpepper hair in a crewcut so short his scalp shone through and the tip of the fleshtearer drawn to the edge of the ouruma wood war bow mikio komoto said this is the man who you have been set to kill i think he wants an explanation morosan an explanation for why you seek his death for why a dantai of your clan murdered his father shi zilin moro looked from mikios face to the shining tip of the watakushi he is iteki a barbarian he is nothing moro said this man is kyujutsu sensei morosan mikio said with an edge to his voice he is yumitori a warrior of rank i urge you to reconsider moro spat you must be prepared to kill hige moro mikio had said to fake torture humiliation will mean nothing to him if we invade his home kill his men but leave him alive he will laugh in our faces and spend the rest of his life hunting us down jake loosed the fleshtearer and hige moro screamed he jumped or rather his body flew backward he was literally lifted off his feet as his breastbone cracked impaled on the spike of the arrows haft moro was slammed against the back wall jake threw down the bow crossed the room to where hige hung suspended in agony he grabbed his jaw slapped his cheeks to get the blood back into the white white face why did you kill my father tell me why hige coughed there was blood in his mouth i was paid he whispered who who paid you to kill my father a man a man named huaishan han jake thought a chinese who is he i dont hige coughed again and this time blood fountained from between his lips someone on the mainland a minister of the first rank a communist chinese both jake and mikio were incredulous you were in the employ of the communist chinese but why i toldtold you higes head lolled his eyelids fluttered closed so that jake was obliged to pinch his earlobes to get him to regain consciousness jake repeated his question money hige said the money they paid made my clan the wealthiest in japan for our deaths jake was shouting now he felt the texture of the mountainside sliding away from him darkness rose up on all sides an unearthly chill rode down his spine i know the communists they wouldnt pay that much for our deaths oh no hige said and now he was making a peculiar kind of sound that seemed like that of a barking dog in a moment jake was appalled to discover that it was laughter no not that at all they paid us more money than you could ever imagine for what jake screamed into his face covered in the yakuzas blood he grabbed higes shirtfront butting their heads together so close to lifting the darkness from the mountainside his father had told him it was his joss as zhuan to climb the shan was shaking from the impact of what hige had revealed jake thought of his father of the time they had spent together so little time death and the end of that contentment to sit beside the old man to absorb his genius his love his humanity it was a grief too much to bear tears in his eyes of rage frustration and despair tell me for what only the mountain the mountain knows what jakes hair stood on end the mountain what did this yakuza oyabun know of the mountain what mountain what do you mean but now even that hairraising laughter had ceased hige moros eyes stared unblinking at jake the spirit already released from the cooling flesh held greedily to its last enigmatic secret summer peking huaishan han returned from hong kong a hero at least hong kong is where he told zilin he had been if he had been as he had intimated before his departure as far as taiwan he gave no indication of it though he had seemed intensely concerned with senlins health before he left he did not ask how she had been when he arrived home neither did he thank zilin for taking care of her in fact he seemed to have forgotten that he had asked a favor of zilin at all he had been in peking some hours already having reported first to lo juiching and then to mao he showed them the medal that mao himself had presented in what huaishan han called a small elite ceremony privately zilin wondered why he had not been summoned to the ministry to be present at this small elite ceremony senlin wanted to know what her husband had done to deserve this signal honor huaishan han replied that he was not at liberty to say but after dinner when the two men took a stroll in the garden he told zilin i saved mao tong zhis life he was bursting with it he fairly shouted it out to zilin it was like getting slapped in the face confucius said that pride was held dear only by the wicked it was antithetical to his five virtues justice benevolence politeness fidelity and wisdom this is not a matter to be trumpeting in public zilin said why not huaishan han said how many men can say they performed such a deed eh precious few zilin had noticed that over the past six months huaishan han had begun to answer his own questions that is an even better reason to keep such knowledge to oneself no no that is precisely the attitude we must do away with the atmosphere is filled with patriotism we are marching on korea you know resist america and aid korea is our new national campaign it is sure to catch the spirit of the people dont you think zilin said nothing he knew when he was being asked a rhetorical question he thought of the people of china tired sick still nursing their wounds burying their dead from the long arduous years of war there wasnt one of them hed wager who wanted this war but he reminded himself he himself had argued for it it had become a political necessity but that did not mean that he liked what he had to do he saw the overriding need for it how the future good of china would be served by it but that did not negate the deaths and suffering that would be engendered by it he shuddered inwardly and not for the first time wondered how long his conscience could bear the weight of the wailing spirits already the dead rose up in his dreams wrapping their skeletal arms around athena and mai keeping them from him he was used to speaking to the spirits of his wives in his dreams like a balm smoothed on the wounds inflicted during his long days these conversations served to at least temporarily soothe his own tortured spirit but for some time even that little surcease had been denied him babbling wraiths and cackling demons conspired to haunt his nighttimes until sleep itself began to fill him with dread and when at last exhausted beyond endurance he did fall asleep sitting up an open book in his lap he dreamt of the spring night four twentyfour at the lip of the spirit well die and die again to awake with a start a heavy lurch of his heart his eyes wide and staring about as if to pin some intruder to the wall but there was no one in the villa no one but himself the people need direction a renewed energy huaishan han was saying they need to put their hearts and minds into winning this war in korea the war here at home there is much to do shi tong zhi we are out to change the world after all that can be no easy task we require unswerving dedication from every comrade we need money as well zilin said soberly all the good intentions in the world will avail us nothing unless we find the capital somewhere to fund maos reforms it will not come from our economy as of now we have none we are barely able to feed our own people let alone finance the industry we must have in order to survive he was wondering if they were successful in korea how stalin would choose to pay the enormous debt he would owe them it occurred to him that perhaps they would get less than they anticipated money yes huaishan han said meditatively there is much talk of money at the ministries so much zilin said one might almost think we were turning into capitalists he laughed but his friend did not follow suit there is nothing amusing about such a thought huaishan han said somberly there are powerful enemies who seek to infiltrate our new power structure they are all capitalistreaders or are you so unaware of recent developments oh i still keep in touch zilin said somewhat ironically i have not retired in your absence but he was thinking of the soviets in the future he believed that moscow not washington would stand as chinas implacable enemy for stalinas for the soviet leaders who would follow his iron fistthere could only be one form of communism he saw how any deviation from the moscow line would be viewed as heresy a potential threat to its design of world hegemony in moscows view there could be only one eventual winner in world ideologies and in a way maos road was more dangerous to the soviets than capitalism at least with washington they could point the finger at the rich mans exploitation of the working class the poor but the same could not be said in china here the differences were more subtle and therefore more difficult to dismiss or deal with and the soviets strong suit zilin well knew was not subtlety in the stifling night a cuckoo sang and then was still strings of lights could be seen over the top of the wall that enclosed the garden the cicadas droned an all metallic symphony the thick bed of peonies that senlin happily tended each day perfumed the thick air it is good to be a hero huaishan han said it is important to have heroes in a country in transition he sounded as if he were trying to convince himself selfimportance had become more and more precious to him ever since he had joined the state security forces zilin remembered the conversation with mao we will be forced to depend more and more on the ministry of public security mao had said the secret police zilin had corrected if you would call them that yes and zilin had said i cannot condone a reign of terror was that why he had been excluded from that small elite ceremony abruptly he said how did you save maos life huaishan han took a cigarette out of a chased silver case tamped its end on the burnished top the case was not chinese zilin saw but rather of western manufacture where did you get that huaishan han either did not hear the question or preferred to ignore it he pocketed the case and lit up he smoked for a while when he had assured himself that he was in control of the conversations pace he said in hong kong i discovered a plot on maos life that in fact was why lo juiching dispatched me on this mission you are the only one he said who we judge capable of successfully carrying out such a difficult assignment zilin was not impressed he knew huaishan han was lying since mao had already told him that it had been mao himself who had been sending huaishan han on his last several missions including this one zilin wondered why his friend was standing here lying to him when he could have been inside with his wife whom he had not seen in almost two months huaishan han continued to puff on his cigarette the smoke drifting from his halfopen lips our intelligence was correct he went on after a time and so you returned home the triumphant warrior zilin said with an edge to his voice to claim your prize but not alone huaishan han said with a little smile i brought with me the enemy the enemy the capitalist who was masterminding the operation to assassinate mao tong zhi he is my prisoner can you see it the ocean i can see the whole expanse of it the moonlight shining on the surface the motion making tiny pinpoint spotlights that i can feel as well as see theyre hot as an open fire senlin opened her eyes stared into zilins face very close to hers do you see it the ocean i mean no why i wonder she peered down through the shadows the stand of moso bamboo cast them in she turned their hands over i thought if we touched if we were linked in some way you would be able to see it too but i cant zilin said this is your talent senlin not mine no she said firmly it is ours she recalled the opening of her spirit at the moment of the clouds and the rain when he was deep inside her she wondered if she was wrong if indeed a more intimate connection of the flesh was required i am certain of it i had no sightat least a sight of this kindbefore i met you you mean before i took you to fazhan her eyes fluttered closed at the mention of the black hat feng shui man she was so exquisite he thought so frail of body so strong of will the combination recalled to mind the translucent vases from out of his countrys past and he thought beauty is its own strength no senlin said now and that was another thing she knew her own mind i would not try to deny what happened to me that night i know better than anyone what was pulled out of me by fazhans incantations the spirit of hu chao consort to the last of the ming emperors evil may be called by many names you think hu chao was only evil senlin sighed her spirit was a twisted hideous thing made so by the evil that had been done to her evil entered her and she was consumed by it evil destroyed her body but it also corroded her spirit and how came this evil spirit into you zilin said half mocking the soongs have a long history senlin said steadily perhaps hu chao was my greatgreatgreatgreat grandmother it is not even certain whether she had any children zilin said then she was reborn in me this talk of spirits and possible reincarnation disturbed him he was a buddhist he was in tune with the land with the rise and fall of qi these were no mysteries to him neither were they magic they merely were feng shuigeomancywas one matter this was another entirely either way he said the evil is gone senlin hidden within the bower made by the rustling of the high bamboo was struck by slivers of dark and light the evil yes they moved across the exquisite planes of her face but something remains like moonlight across the face of the ocean something calls brilliant pinpoints sparking like lightning play in the crests of the endless waves can you tell me what he could feel their heat upon his flesh ten thousand minuscule fires burning appearing disappearing reappearing the sprinkle of stardust calling opened his mouth but no sound coming out vibrations that carried from him to her and thence outward onto the spangled bosom of the ocean where are we beneath the rushing water the deep cool currents running scissoring each other whirling carrying along the universe of diverse life that breathed water instead of air the songs of the whales calling calling the echoes reverberating upon them rippling flesh that was no longer flesh playing upon skin that was invisible and then senlin and zilin came together in a way that was wholly different from the way they had merged before and far more intimate in that moment of ultimate fusion he knew that she was right somehow this was not she not he but a result of both the music they heard saw scented felt was the harmony of their qi playing one upon the other twining becoming whole the war in korea ground on the first fantastic swell of early chinese victories brought a kind of euphoria elevating the internal morale of a country that had taken a beating in the war and now suddenly found for itself a kind of worldwide prestige where before the chinese soldier was an object of ridicule after suffering one defeat after another suddenly the nations of the world were tendering a measure of respect for chinas newfound military prowess as chinas fortunes in korea blossomed so did the young career of maos elder son mao anying whether it was the boys talent or perhaps some canny commanders subtle plot to advance his own career mao anying was promoted to serve at the field headquarters of the second chinese army american bombers overflying the perimeter unloaded on the encampment like squatting beasts destroying all who plotted their defeat there mao anying was no exception the news was brought to mao as quickly as possible but as one may imagine there was some delay as soldiers under frantic orders combed the stinking smoking debris for signs of life a general at last made the identification of maos elder son war mao would tell zilin sometime later is like bitter tea the fortification it brings is tempered by the taste of ashes it leaves in ones mouth this is evil what we do does it seem so to you yes then we must end it she let out a deep groan her forehead pressed against his chest i cannot zilin stroked the ravenswing cascade of her hair in the moonlight it appeared as if silver thread were laced through it he thought of the boundless energy of the sea your husband he said does he ask questions about your health he never used huaishan hans name when he was with senlin he sees me eat he sees me go outside she whispered that is sufficient for him do you talk sometimes yes and touch now it was his turn to whisper do you mean are we intimate he nodded wordless senlin put the palms of her hands on his chest pushed her head away from contact with him her black almond eyes peered at his as if they could pierce the shadows of their enfolding bower my answer i think is more important than the question neh women zilin thought are so much wiser than men in ways their male counterparts do not even know exist would you believe me if i told you that whether i tell the truth or lie to you it is the same no but it is she put her palm along his cheek there is no difference the truth he said differentiates itself from all else there is no ideal in this imperfect world but that the truth senlin spread her arms wide but the truth does not reside here in the world around us it is in dahei in the great darkness within which all spirits reside the only truth is what occurs when we are together in dahei then you are intimate with him you have no right to ask the question no right he is my husband not you cruel to say but it is the truth she looked at him the truth is your god not mine her fingers stroked his face i do not want to hurt you instead you have hurt yourself zilin closed his eyes it could not be avoided no she said not if you were determined to unearth the truth the truth zilin thought she was quite right it was his god it was no good blaming her for his own frailty he searched inside himself cleansing himself of his anger when he opened his eyes he thought of huaishan hans cigarette case not for the first time he had only been afforded a glimpse but he was certain there was something about it that was familiar he took hold of senlins hand and thinking of the truth his master he said i want you to do something for me more than a week passed before she was able to bring it to him for one thing huaishan han was out of the city for part of the time and he took it with him for another he was covetous of it even at home it took some doing then for senlin to spirit it away and then it was only for a couple of minutes the cigarette case of western manufacture of course zilin had had to convince her he is my husband she said you are asking me to plot against him you are already involved in a plot against him he pointed out he is your best friend she said why are you doing this friends do not plot against one another zilin looked out at the larch and pines beyond the perimeter of their stand of bamboo a crescent moon much like the one that had risen that night on the four twentyfour rode thin cumulus breaking them apart upon its sharp horns like gossamer he thought about what the communists had done to senlin he wondered if huaishan han knew what had happened to her at his former masters hands he thought not why would she have told him and huaishan han would never have asked it is not friends i think of now he said he spoke as much to himself as he did to her it is china you told me some time ago that you thought the truth was my god well perhaps that is so but it is china for which i toil i would gladly give my life to ensure its future why do you fear for chinas future how to explain it all to her how to make her see that he was a celestial guardian of his country who controls china he said may one day control all of asia if china makes a mistake if it falls into the wrong hands or comes under evil influence there may well be no turning back china is so massive its peoples so multitudinous that once policy is set it is difficult to change china has its own momentum and it is the momentum of a behemoth china needs a guardian someone to ensure that it first survives then prospers and finally becomes powerful a jian senlin stared at him for a moment before she said you i do only what must be done but how can you she asked you cannot see the future no he said mostly i work in the dark then you must make mistakes you must regret some actions some yes perhaps he conceded it is regrettable but i fear unavoidable her fingers stole along the inside of his wrist until they wrapped themselves around his forearm but no more her voice was only a whisper no more what her face was very close to his he could smell the sweet scent of her like jasmine and honey you have dahei now we have dahei now the great dark what are you saying that it is possible to see the future there perhaps yes she said softly echoing him he gave a little laugh then surely dahei has foretold that you must bring me your husbands new silver cigarette case yes she said seriously it has that is preposterous senlin suddenly her grip upon him tightened listen to me her low voice was urgent i ask you not to do this i plead with you not to ask me i dont see why you can always refuse i cannot he contrived to laugh again you can resist me nothing but it had a hollow ring to it only partly she said she pressed herself against him so that he could feel the triphammer beating of her heart instinctively he put his arms around her as if to protect her from what you seek the truth she said in his ear i must bring it to you and if you do it would be betterfar far betterif you would leave the truth unearthed this time why what do you know about that case nothing she cried suddenly and clung to him i see what he said what do you see she was weeping openly now her tiny white teeth biting into the flesh of his shoulder senlin he said what is it you see she gave a great shudder and said the end but true to her word she obeyed him and once again betrayed huaishan han she brought zilin the cigarette case there is little time she said as she hurried up to where he was waiting within the bower of bamboo huaishan han has just returned from buddha only knows where he sleeps now before dinner but soon he will awake by her tone as well as her words she made zilin feel that he was enmeshed in a childrens fairy tale he could remember such an american story he had read in english class at the university in shanghai jack and the beanstalk hadnt there been a character in the tale like huaishan han the ogre zilin took the case from her looked at it carefully its chased silver filigree caught the watery light of the waning day it was familiar he was certain but why he turned it over saw the silversmiths frankings saw that it was made in the united states ripple of shock like ice water in his face he had suspected it of being english turned it back right side up and opened it a tiny workedsilver spring lever kept huaishan hans vile black russian cigarettes in place something on the inside of the lid caught zilins eye and he angled the case away from him to pick up what light was left in the umber sky saw initials carved into the silver in masculine serifed english letters rmd andperhaps it was daheiknew it all why huaishan han had lied to him from the first about his mission why he had refused to answer zilins question about where he had gotten the cigarette case most terrifying of all he knew who huaishan han had brought home trussed like a pig to the slaughter the mastermind behind the plot to assassinate mao zilin felt the pain in his heart and slowly slowly brought his forehead down until it touched the shining chased top of the cigarette case of western manufacture in the streets of peking shanghai the communities of canton and hunan in the endless paddy fields bamboo forests along the banks of the twisting yangtsethroughout all of chinathe tramp of uniformed booted feet could be heard the nights became a time for listening for the scrape of the metaled heel on hallway boards the sharp rap on the front door the shouted commands confusion and the trickle of fear as ones neighbors were pulled from their beds and without explanation were spirited away into the heavy mist the rumble of the engines fading slowly held in the air by the fog without its inhabitants ever having felt the transition china had become a land of repression in which a reign of terror swept across its length and breadth in an allencompassing net in every city huaishan han had devised the creation of urban residence committees consisting of groups of perhaps one hundred households the same was true in the countryside where each hsiang or agrarian administrative committee oversaw the daily control of paddies and farms these units huaishan han argued were essential for controlling the vast population further they were easily infiltrated by members of the state security forces apparatus thus in every level of chinese society dwelled spies for the ministry of public security and thus the tramp of the booted foot at night the sharp orders the unexplained disappearances we have only to look at the french revolution mao said to zilin or if your prefer a more eastern reference the marxist revolution in russia to find your historical antecedents we are in a period of infancy we have torn down the old the corrupt the degenerated in its place we are building a new country from the roots up our first order is to build the power of the state machine because it is the engine without which china will lie dormant the traditional enemies of the forces of restoration are historically civil war from within and foreign invasion from without it is the americans we have to fear the most shi tong zhi it is the americans who we oppose in korea the americans who continue to pour money and war materiel into nationalist coffers the americans who have made a protectorate of taiwan they do all this shi tong zhi because they fear me and because they know that their protectionism binds the nationalists to them without american aid the nationalists are nothing yet they fail to see that either way they are nothing for now with the american aid they are merely capitalist puppets they do the american presidents bidding in every way or they are threatened with a cessation of aid mao paced the small room like a caged tiger the counterrevolutionary foment has already begun fueled by the nationalists and the americans if the americans can invade korea the next step could very well be china this we must ensure never happens and repression is the only way zilin asked read your history shi tong zhi mao said shortly it is the only sure way he grunted no one takes kindly to reeducation people often do not know what is best for them that is for leaders to decide it is for leaders to impose yes indeed mao agreed apparently oblivious to the sarcasm in his advisers voice zilin called for tea to be brought in and when it had been served sipped at it meditatively what is being done with the prisoner huaishan han brought back from hong kong what for a moment mao appeared confused to cover he made an elaborate show of pouring himself tea staring into the swirl of tiny leaves at the cups bottom uh oh yes i forgot for a moment that you and huaishan han were so close yes well he downed some tea frowned as if he did not care for the taste nevertheless he poured himself some more nothing has been officially decided as yet i am considering how best to use the spy we must make an example of him of course what was most odd zilin thought was not so much maos uncharacteristic beating around the bush but that his eyes had not lifted to meet zilins once since the topic had begun mao who had a most direct manner about him who used his piercing gaze as a weapon to disarm those who sought to oppose him even in the most incidental of matters why are you so interested in this man mao asked i want to interview him i dont think that would be wise mao said something in his cup had his undivided attention he is the property of the state security forces this is not your province it would be if you gave the order that would not make lo jinching happy it would further come under review by kang sheng mao was speaking of the chinese communist partys chief of secret police how would i explain such a thing to them since when did these people wield such power zilin felt anger rising within him i am your personal adviser i have always gone where i wanted when i wanted times have changed my friend mao said then i too am under scrutiny mao shrugged acceding the point zilin was appalled times have changed my friend how had they changed so far so fast without him being aware then with a great sadness he understood that none of these changes had happened without his being aware of them they had been incremental yes but he had been there at their inception he could have opened his mouth to protest could even have insisted that there was another way besides the institution of the vast network of informers harshminded policemen who ventured out at night like spirit demons to pull in unsuspecting citizens because they were too well educated or had the wrong family name or perhaps spent one solitary hour beyond the prying eyes of the ministry of public security zilin was all too familiar with beria and the nkvd he abhorred the russians devotion to iron discipline and repression an apparatus that went beyond interfering with ones choice of religion way of life to the very thoughts one had locked inside oneself he was to blame for this fully as much as mao or lo or huaishan han so much suffering for a people who had suffered for so many years first at the hands of its own emperors then its secret societies and lastly the long invasion by the foreign devil by now one would think that the people of china were well used to being exploited perhaps it was their joss no no how could he think such a thing but the future was bleak indeed he felt as if he were on a vast mountainside struggling up its face in the cold and the dark it seemed that he no longer could remember what lay for him upon its snowrimmed summit i must interview the prisoner he said why are you insistent on wanting something that i cannot grant mao wanted to know he looked wounded i ask out of our longstanding friendship zilin said i do not ask that you remember what i have sacrificed for china or even how i have helped you over the years this is not a matter of politics or of power i stand before you only as your friend in this light i beseech you to allow me one hour with the prisoner mao turned away and as he went across the room zilin noticed for the first time how bowed his shoulders had become mao stood looking out at tienanmen square where the machines of war sat idling prepared for the dreaded counterrevolution that rode above all their heads like a barbarians sword soon mao said it will rain he watched the fat black clouds scrolling across the low sky and closed the window a little even through the heat tonight he said the sky will open and then without a change in tone youll have half that time they picked me up in the mountains ross davies said a tiny encampment on a plateau a mileandahalf up in the shan states the shan states burma not hong kong as huaishan han had said i had been there six months or more it was the poppy fields that made us think of it us daviess cracked lips split in a smile you dont expect me to tell you that do you old friend why not zilin said im dead arent i they both laughed at that remembering the lengths all of them davies huaishan han and zilinhad gone to ensure shis death would be convincing to chiang and his lieutenants inwardly zilin was appalled when the pass that mao had written out for him had let him into the state security forces prison he had been expecting to find his old friendrmd ross marion davies with his long shock of curly reddishgold hair bright blue eyes boyish face what he confronted was instead a thin lanky leatherfaced man with eyes so bloodshot and swollen zilin could see only the barest sliver of washedout blue in their midst gone entirely was the open boyish grin and the nose that had been patrician straight was chopped and bruised so swollen it covered fully a quarter of his face i was in the shan states because of the poppy fields when he spoke zilin could see how many teeth he was missing the thought was to infiltrate and to gain control of the refining v yes what would that bring you money for one thing davies said great gobs of money he sat on a rude wooden stool that was bolted to the floor he gripped the bars that rose between them with fingers swollen by disease or torture it was impossible to say which for another we felt that eventually it would give us control of the entire area as well as a way to infiltrate further afield to assassinate mao what zilin watched daviess face very carefully without being fully conscious of what he was doing he dissolved a portion of himself into dahei in that nightblack space he found that he could distinguish truth from the lies there were colors attached to both separate and distinct colors that he could see that is what i have been told by huaishan han that you were preparing a plot to assassinate mao thats not true davies was telling the truth zilin nodded took out a pack of cigarettes passed them through he lit one for his friend watched as his face relaxed as he puffed christ i havent had a decent one of these since hector was a pup i am sorry theyre not the brand you are used to davies waved away the apology the smoke drifted through his scabbed lips seeping through the bars seeming to dissolve them in undifferentiated grayness i was there a long time davies went on as if they had not gotten off the topic a lifetime he exhaled slowly luxuriating in the tobacco got to know the local honchos real well well enough to know that wed never be able to take control the shan hate the americans the russians as well davies looked at zilin oddly lets cut the crap okay he said suddenly he dropped the butt ground it out under his horny heel he had to slip off the paper slippers he had been issued to do it we both know why its impossible for the americansor anyone else for that matterto get a toehold up there in the mountains tell me zilin said dont insult my intelligence davies said disgustedly i thought that you at least i could trust then humor me they stared at each other for what seemed an eternity please because old friend you control it all growing harvesting refining distribution me zilin was startled and showed it despite himself you mao huaishan han you goddamned chinese that is idiotic zilin said stunned i dont believe you but of course he did he had to in dahei he saw the color of truth then concern wrinkling his face i know nothing about this davies watched his face as before zilin had studied his yeah well he turned put the pack of cigarettes carefully away beneath the corner of his bare straw mattress you mean you dont know which one is behind it its not mao i do not know zilin said but he was hearing mao telling him we must make an example of him of course that would be huaishan han talking his power was growing daily with that of lo juiching and kang sheng was this the source of their power or was it maos buddha tell me he said now were you able to find out the name of the man who runs the poppy fields in the shan states he calls himself the naga you know the burmese mythological serpent his organization is known as the diqui the rest im afraid youll have to divine for yourself he gave a little rueful smile and a hint of his former self shone through the blackened skin of his recent travail zilin heard a rustling behind him the guards were coming his time was up he began to rise and davies reached out a hand there was some fear in the americans eyes as if he felt that with shi beside him nothing untoward could befall him what will become of me he asked i do not know my friend zilin replied but he did know we must make an example of him of course will i see you again zilin looked down at davies who was still seated on the wooden stool he seemed not to have strength left to get up and zilin thought what are they doing to him here he remembered what the communists had done to senlin and wondered whether these people those under huaishan hans command were any different tell me he said were you with the american secret service years ago when we first met davies put his head against the bars and zilin could see the patches of bald discolored scalp as if in these places his thick richly colored hair had been burned away does it matter zilin shook his head no he said truthfully not at all he knows she was like a frightened doe trembling in fear it is important that you be clear about this does your husband know or does he suspect he knows i think he knows sinuous stratus tinged with the pinkorangesienna of reflected light the sun sinking into the cool blue mountains to the west a pair of plovers winging their way across the dusty strands of sunlight their feathers burnished gold for a moment before they were gone the scent of almonds in the air reminding him of cyanide he had seen a man die of cyanide poisoning once a spy who had failed his operation compromised capture imminent not only capture but torture and finally a longedfor death bit through the capsule in his mouth zilin looked away to the cyan hills if you believe that then you must leave leave she seemed bewildered where shall i go i will protect you he is my husband i cannot leave him on the contrary senlin he said you left him long ago hold me she whispered will you hold me zilin put his arms around her and she ducked her head inside lay her cheek against his chest her hair swept down across her face so that she seemed lost to him he wondered now why he had begun this affair he had knownalways knownthat it would come to this one day such liaisons ended this way without fail but he knew that he did not want it to end with a tiny start he realized that he was not prepared to give senlin up he wanted to make her happy at this moment that wish was extraordinarily important to him it was as if by doing this he would be expiating all his sins he would ease a conscience made dull and heavy by the wailing of all the dead all the injustice all the terror and he might even atone for the necessity of leaving athena his second wifejakes motherand sheng li his mistress to fend for themselves during the war he knew he was putting much weight on one act the happiness of one human being perhaps too much but senlin was special was he the only one who saw that certainly huaishan han did not huaishan han this had to do with him as well zilins conscience was burdened by huaishan han without zilin the man would not be here now and perhaps this hideous reign of terror might not be happening but even as he thought it zilin knew it for a solipsistic thought this reign of terror had not been thought up by huaishan han and he knew deep in his heart that it would have occurred with or without the man still the evil that huaishan han perpetrated was plain enough and there was the matter of the shan perhaps only the mountain knew who was organizing the reaping and distribution of the tears of the poppy but zilin could not believe that mao was involved mao longed only to be out from under the thumb of moscow the war in korea as zilin had argued was a difficult but definite way out if mao was raking in such enormous amounts of capital from the sale of opium would he have needed to involve his country in a dangerous war zilin thought not on the other hand lo juiching kang sheng and huaishan han had most recently emerged in the power hierarchy of the new government with an appalling amount of influence how had it happened was the mountain the shan partly the cause zilin thought it reasonable to think so against him senlin was weeping it is ending she said just as i saw it would no zilin said this time youre wrong but the scent of almonds was still strong on the air he reached upward and snuffed out the moon now the velvet night enfolded him thick clouds rode across a wheatcolored moon that was almost full rain was in the air coming from the southeast the barometer was falling the indolent air becoming heavier still zilin used the pass mao had signed for him he had spent an hourandahalf reworking the date and the result he felt was more than adequate the state security forces prison loomed dark and forbidding it was off the square in a new building whose design and construction had been supervised by the russians consequently it squatted ugly already dilapidated old when it should have been young it was surrounded by a phalanx of newly planted plane trees there was an army tractor and two troop transports parked in front all the vehicles were empty at this time of night the square was deserted he pulled his official car over and parked he was passed through by three sets of guards without incident but it wasnt getting in that concerned him it was getting out at night the prison staff was cut by twothirds that was principally because the upper floors were currently being used for administrative purposes and highlevel staff meetings the prisoner was not in his cell he was told by the cellblock division leader he was being interrogated was this usual zilin wanted to know the division leader whose name was chu said yes it went on all night when does the prisoner sleep zilin asked he does not sleep chu said without much interest this is part of the interrogation process zilin shoved the paper signed by mao in chus face and said take me to him this is most irregular the division leader said perhaps i should check with huaishan tang zhi i come from chairman mao why dont you do it right and call him zilin said with heavy sarcasm im sure he would appreciate being woken up to answer such a pressing procedural question chu looked doubtfully from the slip of paper to zilins face then he nodded this way he said the hallway smelled chokingly of disinfectant it merely masked the stench of feces and urine bare light bulbs set in wire cages hung from the concrete ceiling providing mean illumination their shadows flickered in front and in back of them as they moved down the hall chu stopped and rapped on a metal door with a wire grille set into it at head height after a moment someone spoke to him through it they were let in the vile smells assaulted him three uniformed men were taking turns with ross davies who was squatting naked in the middle of the square room a battery of lights were trained on him there was an odd vitriolic buzzing in the room and zilin looked around one of the interrogators was holding an electric prod as zilin watched the man pressed the tip of the prod against ross daviess pale flesh there was a bluewhite arc a strangled gasp of pain and a whiff of smoke stinking from charred flesh that is enough zilin commanded i have come for the prisoner by whose authority the man with the electric prod said defensively mao zhu xi zilin said it is true chu said waving the paper with maos name affixed to it this minister is on the chairmans personal staff give him his clothes zilin said knowing that this had to move fast now very fast or they would spot the flaws get him dressed not in prison attire mao zhu xi wishes to interrogate the prisoner himself two of them had to help davies on with his clothes his hands trembled and he did not trust himself to look in zilins direction do you need any assistance comrade minister chu asked when davies was ready i can spare two of my men no zilin said thats quite all right chu tong zhi i can manage him are you quite certain comrade minister chu inquired holding the door to the interrogation room open as they passed through i do not want to think of what would happen should the prisoner escape look at him zilin said supporting davies the man can hardly walk a straight line let alone attempt to overpower me i take full responsibility as you wish comrade minister three checkpoints and they were passed through each one outside in the still night davies let out a tiny sigh his head rested on zilins shoulder just as senlins had earlier that night just a few steps farther old friend he whispered in daviess ear were at the car now can you get in davies nodded disentangled himself from zilins embrace slid himself painfully onto the passengers seat zilin went around and climbed in he started the engine and pulled away from the square even years later when the memories still haunted him he was unable to say just what it was that led him to xiang shan the huge park was nestled into that area of peking known as the fragrant hills it was only afterward that zilin remembered the old name for the place hunting park perhaps it was because zilin always loved this park it had a stream running through it which originated in a limpid pool high atop gui jian chou shan in the west in the twelfth century there was so much game in these forests that the emperors made it their personal hunting ground but by the middle of the eighteenth century the greedy emperors had depleted the stock so completely that manchurian ma lu had to be imported so that the hunting could continue the place within xiang shan where zilin brought ross davies was shuang jing the villa with two wells in the southern end of the park here there was both shelter and water though one of the wells the deeper one by far was covered over with a rusting corrugated iron cap zilin stopped the car at the entrance to the park and they got out with zilins assistance ross davies limped past the bronze lions guardians of xiang shan on what used to be known as mai mai jie tradesmens street there were still remnants of the shops that once proliferated here it seemed an inordinately long way to the villa with two wells but it was well screened even from within the park this was only a temporary resting place in the morning zilin would have to move davies on but where first things first we must make an example of him of course he could not let that happen spy or no spy davies was his friend his life meant more to zilin than a dress espionage trial ever could to the new china the present regime would soon forget that ross davies had ever existed zilin could not he set davies down gave him water made him as comfortable as was possible why have you done this davies said his face was streaked with dirt which had run in the runnels of his sweat and blood i was certain id never see you again you are a barbarian zilin said softly what do you know davies smiled and closed his eyes i thought the shan was bad he said it was worse in there he said much worse zilin said nothing as he squatted next to his friend perhaps he thought it is important for him to talk now because he could not before i thought that they had prepared us well for all eventualities but nownow i think that even they did not know what would happen to us if we were captured there was a deepthroated rumbling from the southeast the rain was on its way zilin looked up past the tiled roof overhang there was no illumination in the low sky save a dull electric reflection from the lights of the sleeping city he thought of the brilliant bluewhite electric arc of the prod the smell of cooking flesh ross daviess flesh and was glad at what he had done i dont know davies said as the first drops pattered onto the villas roof how i got here this is a long way from virginia a long way from home he put his head down between his drawnup knees i feel like im on another planet and i thinki think absolutely that is the worst part dying so far from anything familiar youre not going to die zilin said shifting a little to get out of the rain which was coming down harder now he remembered the wild ride they had taken along the jinyun shan he took out a cigarette lit it put it between daviess lips he thought it was good that daviess parents wouldnt see him this way i am afraid davies said not smoking at all i am afraid to die i would have tried to kill myself in my cell between interrogations but for that it is a mortal fear what will happen to me afterward will i drift in nothingness will i feel the cold will there be anything at all i am a buddhist zilin said there is no heaven no hell with an uncoordinated jerk davies turned his head then what a beginning zilin said lifeour lifeis only the beginning of a cosmic journey and who may say where it will end life is to be fought for every moment but death is not to be feared my friend he reached out took the faltering cigarette from between daviess lips sucked in some smoke he exhaled gave it back davies looked at him i am so far from home forget about america zilin said china is your home now davies put his head back took a long drag of the cigarette a noise a sharp sound from the shadows beyond the well and zilin lurched to his feet saw a figure staggering toward the villa took a step forward rain cascading over him then another and another until he was near the covered well senlin she hurled herself over the last few meters into his arms ah the lovers zilin knew that voice well huaishan han he appeared from out of the copse of trees the hunter bringing his prey into the killing ground the loyal chu called me after you left huaishan han called as he advanced on them he is a very thorough man chu tong zhi suspicious as well i told him to keep you under surveillance until i arrived he smiled but there was no humor in his face now i am here zilin looked down at senlin who was shivering uncontrollably against him it was very dark and the rain swept away what clear vision there might be a clap of thunder darkness and then a spit of lurid lightning illuminated her bruised and battered face senlin what i told you he knew she sobbed this is my punishment he hit only my face i think there are broken bones that is what he wanted everyone must know your shame he shouted as he beat me for the rest of your life you will be known by what you have done zilin speechless hugged her to him he kissed her face while she whimpered for this he said in time for this not only for my infidelity senlin said but also because i carry a child in my belly it is your child stunned zilin watched detached as huaishan han gripped senlins wrist give her up traitor his eyes blazed they had the flat opaque quality endemic to ideologues once zilin would have bet on huaishan hans conversion to communism that was what motivated him to change sides wasnt it no no now zilin saw huaishan han for the clever opportunist he was moving from nationalist to communist served huaishan han well and that was all he cared about that was why he had involved himself with the tears of the poppy money and a widening power base these comprised the ideology to which huaishan han subscribed huaishan han placed the blade of a knife at the side of senlins neck where the carotid artery pulsed give her up unless you want to see her die zilin unwound his arm from around senlin watching for that split instant of relaxation in huaishan han he ducked down and forward butting his head against the other mans stomach bulling him backward huaishan han grunted as his spine was jolted by the edge of the ironcapped well and the knife spun from his nerveless fingers zilin put his hands together slammed them down onto huaishan hans sternum so that the other doubled over in pain lifted him by crotch and hip the rage long held neatly in check boiling over in a fever threw him upward huaishan han landed heavily on the center of the iron lid already rusted through by the elements and decades of neglect the cap gave way huaishan han shouted and reaching desperately out regained his hold on senlin she went down with him shouting into the storm zilin scrambled atop the well shaving skin off his knees and shins the odor of the ages assaulted him he could see nothing only feel a hand fingers grasping for his reaching to his limit he held on to skin made slick with sweat and slimy condensation whose hand was it huaishan hans or senlins in the darkness and the storm he could not tell then the bosom of the moonlit ocean opened up to him and he was within dahei he heard the calling i will destroy him he felt the voice i must destroy him let go let go no he cried silently no there is no other way he is killing me hauling on the hand no i will not let him kill you as well let go i beg you senlin stars dancing in weir light off the bosom of the ocean i can save you and he reached out not with his hand or even his mind but with his qi his extraordinary qi until he found her grasped that essence of her with which he had merged so many times and merged with it one last time senlin it is the only way then he let go of the hand time out of mind minutesor was it yearslater he crawled down from atop the ruined well beneath the dripping villas overhang ross davies was sleeping zilin crawled inside out of the cold and the damp and the utter blackness he put his arms around his drawnup legs and shivered violently it was only then that he smelled the nauseating scent of bitter almonds and turning his head saw the top of the bittenthrough hollow tooth saw his friends torn breathless lips a deep unnatural shade of blue iv existence vivartasiddha springsummer present miami moscow hong kong shan washington hes ghosted what ghosted dude you know gone the motherfuckers gone bennett martine juanito gato de rosa cocked his head you think i got all the water out of your lungs dude maybe i missed some whoa any more mouthtomouth tony simbal said and i might fall in love with you it was dark down there and cold simbal had never been so cold in his life but thank christ for the cold that was what had revived him without the cold he would have dropped like a stone to depths that the cuban could not reach without a set of artificial lungs simbal shivered still feeling the effects of the cold and the dark the cubans topaz eyes opaqued what a fuckin waste he sat with the gray blanket emblazoned with miami metro police in black stenciled letters hed flashed his credentials at the cops who had come in response to some citizens irate phone call and after taking cursory statements they had left sirens screaming to the site of a real disaster a hotel fire downtown the paramedics had worked on simbals cuts and abrasions they had wanted to take him to the hospital for tests and observations but he had refused maria wasnt like the mean bitches you usually find down here holding on to the fringes like dogs to a bone she had a useful mind in the cold and the dark there was no breath that was the thing that gnawed at simbals mind still no air no life he imagined the lungs ceasing to work as the cold and the dark crept in trickling down the nostrils between the tightly clenched teeth until it became a tide drowning he shivered heavily again and pulled the rough police blanket around him more tightly look at my suit the cuban said there was real mourning in his voice now i might as well throw it in the incinerator all the use ill get out of it now you know how much this bastard set me back shut up what i said shut up the company paid for that item didnt it he meant the cia well yeah so stop bitching the cuban put his head down its not the motherfucking suit dude shit man simbal was trembling aftershocks following the quake that hijo de puta turned his gun on her and blitzed her out just like that it takes a cold cold heart to do it ill tell you a voodoo spook is right martine shut up but he was listening to the cuban very closely now trying to interpret a feeling why for you tell me to shut up man the cuban said in an aggrieved voice who dyou think dived in with all the sharks and shit and pulled you out no sharks that close in martine you never heard of poetic license dude madre de dios i save your unbelieving hide from a watery grave and i appreciate it martine really i do but will you kindly for christs sake keep your yap shut for a minute the cuban looked out at the lights bobbing across the marina thats no way to show your appreciation man you say bennetts disappeared gato de rosa was watching the water ghosted dude like the tide maybe not simbal said the cuban turned to look at him what do you know that i dont runrun yi the chinatown yi one of the three brothers who run the diqui in new york the same i spotted him at the party he and bennett were talking so the cuban shrugged aint that what partiesre all about not this one simbal said remember what bennett said he wasted alan thune runrun yi was thunes big booster within the diqui word i got was that yi was putting thune up for a big promotion gato de rosas topaz eyes opened wide and you think simbal nodded if something was wrong with thune chances are that same thing is wrong with yi who knows maybe the two of them were skimming or even planning to go into business for themselves if youre right the cuban said we find runrun yi and well find bennett as well because bennetts here to ice him my thought precisely the cuban rose shed his blanket let me make a couple of calls someones gotta know where yi is staying someone did the yak says runruns booked into the trilliant on the beach the yak listen hombre if you had as much hair as this dude theyd call you the yak as well his fine creamcolored silk suit was an unholy mess crinkled and bagged at knees and elbows lets get us some dry duds he held out his hand then find yi he pulled simbal to his feet they were standing very close wherever this bastard goes now im going with him bennetts my objective not anymore the cuban said not after this the trilliant lived up to its name a fiery jewel of a place so modern its triangular pyramidal shape was dizzying between its meloncolored sloping facade and the ocean an enormous triangular lagoonlike pool with a central island dotted with palm trees was lit up like an airport runway gato de rosa grunted as they pulled up and a uniformed attendant took over the firered ferrari waitll you get a load of their golf course he said the back nine packs quite a kick the trap on the seventeenth holes got more than water in it its got a fucking croc too he laughed shortly emormous pale pink flagstones led up to the glittering smokedglass and brushedbronze entrance plantings of palm azalea and bougainvillea flanked either side first class simbal said yeah the cuban said if you can stand this shit for more than an hour inside the air conditioning took their breath away jesus simbal said wheres my parka whassamatter gato de rosa said you got something against freezing to death he went over to an industrialsize marbletopped credenza upon which were sitting a line of pink dialless telephones he picked up a receiver asked for the number of runrun yis room the operator would not give it to him and he did not want her to ring the room he sauntered over to the reception desk waited for the swarthyskinned concierge to get off the phone gato de rosa called him softly over transferred a twenty into the mans waiting hand the bill passed between them with the kind of mysterious adroitness shown at a magicians convention they spoke in spanish for less than thirty seconds in a moment gato de rosa was back what dyou expect he said in a moment thirtysevenohoneandtwo topfloor suite thats five bills a night who said crime doesnt pay simbal said as they headed for the bank of burnishedbronze elevator doors each was emblazoned with the triangular pattern that was the hotels logo it was woven into the custom carpeting along the lobby floor your paisan say whether old yi was in sirnbal asked he thought yes any visitors the cuban looked at simbal with some skepticism come on hes the concierge not superman the trilliants a goddamned big place a truckload of marines could come in and he might not know it but at least you determined yours was the first bribe hed taken tonight gato de rosa laughed the sight of bennett stepping out of one of the elevators cut it short hijo de puta the lobby was jammed with guests in glittery outfits music was blaring from off to the left and the general flow of the people was in that direction a late floor show at the nightclub the amount of diamonds on display would have made even murph the surf salivate bennett was making his way against the flow of the crowd he seemed in no hurry and hadnt bothered to look behind him like most madmen he was very confident simbal and the cuban started after him shouldering their way through the nipon and ungaro dresses the after six tuxes clouds of norell and chanel no clung to them bennett disappeared through a side door and they picked up their pace through the doors they found themselves in a concrete corridor the floor was covered with astroturf affixed to one wall was a sign that said no swim suits allowed in the lobby and simbal said shit breaking into a sprint he remembered what the cuban had said that bennett never went anywhere not accessible by boat they went through glass doors that opened at their approach skirted the lighted swimming pool it was as large as a ballpark past the lip of the vast concrete apron on which over a hundred lounge chairs were neatly arrayed in precise rows were set a flight of wide stairs they were dusted with sand and they went down them three at a time in the glow from the pool lights they could see bennett already at the waters edge as simbal watched he plunged into the surf and came up with a twist of his head hard powerful strokes took him past the crash line the cuban went into the water after him moments later simbal caught sight of the sleek black cigarette bobbing at anchor goddamn it he said and began to run back toward the hotel the double mahogany doors to the suite were unlocked runrun yi lay on a seagreen sofa that wrapped around the living room his flat cantonese face was white as rice paper his chest fluttered inconstantly and his eyes were closed simbal knelt felt for a pulse elder uncle he said in cantonese youre going to be fine bennett did this to you edward martin bennett why runrun yis eyes opened but simbal knew that he wasnt seeing anything except what was in his mind bennett needed me dead he said slowly softly painfully like he needed alan thune dead yes why yi said nothing his eyes rolled in pain why elder uncle why did bennett need you and alan thune dead the chinese murmured something and simbal desperate said what very loudly and when he heard it it did not compute arms he said and then with more urgency elder uncle did you say arms yis eyelids fluttered im dying he said in a guttural voice thick with his own fluids you must inform my brothers yes yes all gods bear witness yi whispered i curse my murderer to sixteen generations bennett wanted you and alan thune dead because of arms simbal said he was very close to the other man now and could smell the peculiar odor of death stealing over him yes yis lips were trembling is it cold in here the arms elder uncle that is the province of the new generation it seems bennett mako the others what others consciousness was coming and going yis eyes fluttered closed he seemed to be marshaling his energy arms antipersonnel weapons blackman tswe are told are what we must now transship but there is no profit in these arms we are not selling them what then stockpiling in asia asia south america europe america all places but why a pink bubble formed between yis trembling lips thune was against it i was against it we should have known better but it is dangerous so dangerous for the world what kind of danger simbal urged his face close to the others the worst kind what do you these weaponswill have the power to destroy the world the cold sweat was rolling off yis flat face his skin had taken on an awful pallor when bennett simbal waited breathless he could hear his pulse hammering in his ears mother of god he thought what have i fallen into when bennett he repeated bennett is the jinn who opens the door what did that mean where has he gone to the shan yi said and shuddered the source elder uncle simbal reached out felt for a pulse that was not there in a moment he sat back the diqui into arms shipments he wondered antipersonnel weapons specifically blackman t oneman rocket launchers why and how could those small arms cause the destruction of the world simbal found himself shivering he felt as cold as the dead what was that all about man gato de rosa said coming into the room he was making puddles on the thick carpet simbal did not look at him bennett the cigarette the cuban said it was waiting for him simbal sighed im tired he said hey dont bullshit me dude the cuban insisted you were talking to the chink i heard you he was ranting simbal said he felt as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders bullshit damnfuckingright simbal flared he stood up you let me handle bennett fuck that youve got no choice its out of your hands now you think so something in his tone sent a warning bell through simbal he remembered the feeling he had tried to interpret from the cubans words while they were at the marina abruptly he began to walk across the room when he got to the front door the cuban said where you going dude see you around sometime martine gato de rosa jumped up hey hey you cant do that hey dude simbal turned around what are you going to do shadow me he gave a ghostly smile you know better than that there was silence for a time they stared at each other hey man this suites gonna begin stinking like a tuna boat any minute you going to tell me who it was you called from the marina martine i told you dude yeah right oh shit gato de rosa came across the room he told me to keep an eye on you he told me to go where you went i dont think he trusts you dude whos that but he already knew max the cuban said it was max max threnody simbal thought first he got to monica and now the cuban but gato de rosa was a snit and max was the head of the dea just what the hell is max up to simbal wondered you tell max that if he wants me shadowed he can goddamned do it himself i know where bennetts off to and thats where im going with each word getting closer to the cuban youre going to have company then hombre bullshit simbal said moving very fast he went beneath gato de rosas suit jacket pulled out the tiny snubnosed a womans weapon he said but you know better than i do the damage it can do this close in hey dude hey you crazy nothing personal martine simbal leveled the get over to the couch hey for christs sake man lighten up uh just do as i say simbal said low in his throat he used the belt from yis silk robe to tie the cubans hands behind his back i dont mind letting you walk around he said the police will be here before you can get out of that ill be long gone by then gone where dude where you off to the cubans eyes had turned the color of coffee simbal took the bullets out of the and threw them at gato de rosas feet tell max when he gets here tossed the gun after them tell him ive gone to the shan qi lin slept you see how marvelous the human brain is huaishan han stared down at the supine form with such hunger in his eyes that chen ju was momentarily appalled you see how fantastically complex a machine it is huaishan hans odd bowed gait was exaggerated by the barebulb lighting turning him into some truly grotesque figure colonel hu knew and appreciated that chen ju grunted colonel hu is dead huaishan han smiled and again chen ju felt a little thrill go through him that smile was the kind used by those more than a bit mad always the pragmatist my friend eh han nodded but i divine your message his hand moved out stroked qi lins unlined brow yes she killed colonel hu and she escaped his compound a heavily fortified military complex i might add it seems to me chen ju said that whatever it was hu did to her didnt take is that so huaishan han gave off that smile again as a lambent sun throws off heat the war in cambodia had marked colonel hu irrevocably he was a master at his trade true enough but he drank himself into a stupor almost every night the men had begun to question his commands his leadership you know what that meant his unit was handpicked to accept orders unthinkingly that was essential especially if they were going to march into kam sang disarm the members of the army guarding the installation imprison everyone withinincluding members of the intelligence serviceand take what we require huaishan han sighed in short my friend colonel hu had become a liability he reached out stroked qi lins brow once again my precious lizi my plum did just as i asked do you think it was joss that brought her within sight of general kuos soldiers no no she was programmed for all of this to kill hu to escape and come here chen ju looked doubtful but how with this huaishan han produced a bottle of alcohol a wad of cotton he took qi lins arm and turned it so that the inside of her elbow was facing him using the cotton he swabbed down an area of her skin in a moment he had a syringe in his hand he uncapped it squeezed a bit of the clear fluid out its tip then he inverted it plunged it into qi lins vein a steady supply of this drug it was hus own discovery it works directly on the central cortex inhibiting ego and superego in effect it stimulates the primitive emotions hate fear desire become matters of life and death in this unbalanced state the subject is akin to a piece of clay ready to be molded by the artisans fine hand he put the materials back in his pocket and she knows nothing of this there is a consciousnessblocker huaishan han said she is mine from the inside out mine forever by coming here by escaping she proved her skills to me now she has a most difficult task before her huaishan han looked up at chen ju many before her have tried to kill jake maroc shi all have failed joss eh but i have found that joss is like the tide of the ocean it flows it ebbs you see i want to control the world chen ju thought and this old broken man is concerned with nothing more than warping a young girls mind it is shameful he seeks only personal revenge a petty and foolish undertaking at best the fall down the well did more than disfigure his body it scarred his mind as well once he would have understood the grand design that i am weaving once he would have joined me chen ju shook his head perhaps his many years in the shan had changed him subtly there wealth meant nothingwarlords strolled their compounds with handfuls of rubies sapphires imperial jade in their pockets they guided the distribution of the tears of the poppy and thereby reaped enormous profits but their power was over people material wealth in the shan was secondary the reason that the americans and the russians had been locked out of the shan was that they had no mastery over the people their cia and kgb respectively had invaded the shan using basically the same methodology handing out money to everyone they met the shan laughed at the westerners their warlords sneered at them and turned them away power was distribution control of the farmers who grew their fields of poppies control of the armies who guarded the factories where the raw opium was refined and guided the mule trains down the steep sides of the shan to where greedy wholesalers waited and if chen ju had learned anything during his long exile from hong kong it was this that true power resided in mans mastery over his fellow man those who wielded only wealth possessed an illusion huaishan han so long deprived of true power had filled his villa with the accumulated archaeological wealth of the centuries but what meaning did it have when he died that wealth would be reapportioned broken up dispersed like so much sand what would be left nothing nothing at all to mark his passing but chen ju knew that what he himself had embarked upon would surely change the world for all time like the pharaoh cheops he was building an eternal monument to mark his brief time upon the earth greed i leave to lesser spirits he told himself and he recognized greed in hans face as he gazed down upon the slumbering countenance of the young girl who was so important to him he longs for what he can never have chen ju thought and that is an apt definition of greed he longs for a child it is from this loss that his burning hatred of shi zilin stems and perhaps that is the root of his obsession with this poor girl why he openly adores her so why he cannot understand how he tortures her looking at huaishan han chen ju was struck by the damage that time can do to mortal mind and body all the more reason he told himself to get on with what i have to do the world is about to enter a new age daniella vorkuta received her intelligence reports from mitresir john bluestones kgb code nameon thursday mornings they came coded by special courier and it was daniellas habit to set aside an hour just before lunch to pore through the progress her most active asset was making toward burrowing inside kam sang however this particular thursday was a nightmare she was woken out of sleep by the duty officer army intelligence required liaison with her people in the field in afghanistan that crisis was handled as she was dressing at the office she found wheels had come off no less than four separate operations two of which were in their final phases and therefore needed her undivided attention as she guided the respective case officers through harrowing twists and turns in order to keep their field agents alive and ticking lunch brought no respite since the frantic morning had required the administrative meetings be held in abeyance until the missions were past their crisis phases a dozen department heads were kept waiting for her appearance so an entire round of morning meetings had to be crammed into the lunch hour and the afternoon was even worse news was brought to her that despite her best efforts one of her agents in the field had been overrun by the opposition even worse he had been captured alive daniella was required to begin sensitive and humiliating negotiations to try to bring him home that night she and carelin did not go back to her place instead he took her to a small apartment on the top floor of a redbrick building on solyanka street just off pokrovsky one of the green boulevards socalled because of the grass and parklands that are part of their makeup from one of the tiny windows one could see the ustinsky bridge and lights glinting off the dark face of the moskva the view carelin told daniella had been better before the tractors and roadrippers had come in part of the municipal plan to turn this culdesac into the internatsionalskaya and the ulyanovskaya which would eventually link the boulevard to the south bank they were here because of carelin or more accurately because he could no longer suffer the vigil maluta had on her this was a place no one knew about i am tired of making love to you he had said while malutas soldier watches from the shadows too exhausted physically and emotionally to eat daniella had stripped off her clothes and had stood under a shower so long that carelin was obliged to hammer repeatedly on the door to ask her if she was ever coming out eventually she emerged unsmiling wrapped in a thick americanmade towel her gray eyes met carelins and he leaned forward kissing her tenderly on the cheek he went into the bathroom closed the door in a moment she heard the sound of the shower daniella on the bed listened to the drumming of the rain watched the lurid splashes of electricblue lightning pierce the shades like knives she closed her eyes and remembered the unread report from mitre she was so tired she thought fleetingly of leaving it for the morning but in the end her desire to read about any progress on kam sang broke through her lethargy she rolled over dug it out of her bag there was no danger in reading it here the code made it indecipherable to anyone but mitre and herself she propped herself up against the pillows slit open the envelope and began slowly to read in a moment she put down the sheets of flimsy and stared at the closed bathroom door just as if she had acquired xray vision she sat up fully and read through the report again it was absolutely revelatory it contained the intelligence neon chow had given to bluestone regarding the quarry asset apollo the last line contained apollos identity mikhail carelin when daniella came to his name written out in code her stomach gave a lurch and she gagged for an instant overwhelmed by nausea she put her head back against the pillows and did nothing but breathe deeply for a long time mikhail carelin was an agent working for a foreign powerfor her most powerful enemy now that she knew this she should begin devising ways to find out what his assignment was she should be thinking of ways to turn him or alternatively to bring him to justice he was a traitor after all but she was thinking about none of these things with a kind of jolt she realized that it did not matter to her traitor or patriot there was absolutely no difference carelin was still the man she loved and she knew that she was going to do nothing that would jeopardize her relationship with him daniella vorkuta trained and bred in the elite soviet underworld of the sluzhba was now nothing more or less than a human being her rank of general meant as little she realized as her elevation to the head of the first chief directorate or even god help her the politburo her career her life within the sluzhba meant nothing what mattered was this how could that possibly be she asked herself she put her fingertips against her lower belly and then further pushing them through the fur between her thighs she probed into the heat between her legs until she was certain of her previous findings the mucus was there that meant her time of the month was now her egg was ready and waiting her hands when she took them away were trembling had she gone mad there was no other rational explanation but she knew there was nothing rational about this decision it was purely emotional it was the true difference between a woman and a man in time carelin padded into the bedroom he saw that she was not reading was perhaps even asleep and she had turned off the lamps when he was next to her she stretched as if in sleep and turned her long naked body against him her fingers cupped him began to massage him after the longest time danushka he whispered are you awake she brushed her breasts against him trailing her nipples over his flesh when they reached his belly they were hard her lips opened enclosed him in exquisite heat her tongue rose up his stem lashing his expanding tip when he was hard and quivering she replaced her mouth with her mons she scrubbed him with it until he was groaning until his own hands guided her onto him he went in with a rush and when he arched up bringing her with him when he felt his hot seed jetting high into her he heard her crying mikhail mikhail mikhail and felt her face wet with tears bliss felt the bullets going inone two three four fivelike slices of silver a hungry civets slashing grin in the emerald jungle white on black their brief whirring journeys were broadcast to her through dahei the great darkness as they entered the man sitting at her left elbow the empathic flow caused her to cry out with the agony that he was sustaining big oysters pok jerked up and back with each hit as if he was a marionette whose strings were being pulled by a madman or a drunkard even before that however bliss had upended the table crashing dinnerware glasses the piled remains of their meal now three good inches of solid wood and iron braces were between her and the sixth shot that embedded itself into the center of the table instead of in her heart from her vantage point she could see the lower half of big oysters poks sprawled figure his legs tangled up in the overturned chair blood was running darkly along the floor she turned away from the assassin who had spun and was loping away shouldering roughly past the chinese waiters and the screaming cringing gwai loh patrons slipping in the muck as she scrambled on her knees to where big oysters pok lay five shots point blank and dahei showed her the ending of life but she put her fingertips against the side of his neck anyway because she needed the physical assurance there was no pulse she bent put her lips near his no breath either she had been so close bliss closed her eyes and sighed now she had nothing to go on her search for the murderers of the jian had hit a stone wall the only thing huaishan han could see when he looked into her face was the well he stared into qi lins face and saw madness the well was madness echoes wet echoes slime mold rust and mud the slide of viscous substances across his goosepimpled flesh the exquisite agony of being on the rack of ones numbed fingers supporting ones entire weight forhow long buddha how long an eternity not a moment less now as she looked upon qi lin and saw the madness he no longer knew whether it was hers or his own he thanked buddha for his great good fortune oh his joss must be powerful indeed colonel hus mind sculpting had done its work chen ju had advised him and he had passed the information on to hu the best place for a fugitive from the chinese government to cross over was this section of the chinaburma frontier the shan states were a wild and at best unfriendly place the ethnic tribes of the regionthe shan wa lahu akha lu lisu migrated here during the fifteenth century fiercely independent they had resisted all efforts by various burmese regimes to incorporate them into the nation as a whole today many of the warlords who ruled tribal armies and fiefdoms of medieval splendor are descendantsor claim to beof the original sawbwas the hereditary shan princes other warlords are renegade officers from the chinese army lured into the shan by the promise of power and riches beyond imagining and of all the warlords here in the shan states it was general kuo who was the most powerful he commanded by far the most men armed well enough to dissuade the chinese army from invading his territory how then could she fail to be stopped by one of his border patrols her beauty struck him like an arrow through his heart now that she had come back he was aware of how much he had missed her she was the granddaughter of his enemy shi zilin lived on through her as he did through jake maroc there was a certain exquisite irony in using shi jakes daughter to assassinate him that thought made laughter bubble up in huaishan hans throat general kuo disliked the sound of hans laughter it was unwholesome and peculiarly obscene like an old man peeping under a little girls skirts to catch a glimpse of something pure and pink general kuo said nothing of this however he was paid a kings ransom to supervise the harvesting and the refining of the tears of the poppy not to render his opinions on the personalities involved number four opium was his first priority his second priority was keeping the american cia the russian kgb the chinese and burmese armies at bay after that no one gave a damn what he did or did not do he had admired huaishan han more than any other man alive general kuo knew that he could line up twenty men right now and order them shot and huaishan han would not even turn his head in the direction of the shots the high shan plateau was general kuos territory pure and simple and huaishan han knew it but then it was general kuo who had saved huaishan han from the hideous depths of the stinking well in fragrant hills park so long ago kuo had been no general then but his quick shrewd mind had already set him apart from his contemporaries who seemed content to bury their heads in the sand blowing in off the gobi general kuo had disliked taking orders he was in the military because to him the army was synonymous with power he craved power in the same way that most people needed food and sleep kuo could never remember sleeping for more than three hours a night he had never needed to what he required was power he was no politician he had an incredibly ordered mind discipline he was born with a disciplined mind he was natural for the armyexcept that he resented taking orders from superiors who were that in rank only general kuo had discovered wei qi the board game of master strategy at an early age he learned to play by observing an old man who took on all challengers every day in the park kuo had been involved in wei qi now for close to sixty years and he had never encountered a better player in all that time than the old man in the park it was wei qior more accurately the strategy learned in its pursuit that allowed kuo to see an opportunity of a lifetime when he discovered the well and its contents by that time shi zilin had gone to mao revealing what he had learned regarding the personal use of funds from the nefarious opium smuggling a fullscale investigation was immediately launched in the course of which both lo juiching and kang sheng were exonerated huaishan han however presumed dead was discovered to have devised and run the scheme kuo had heard of all this of course by the time he was in xiang shan it was a week after the incident in the park and after dinner the weather being mild and comfortable kuo had taken his young lady for a stroll in the park in truth he had picked this park and even this spot shuang jing the villa with two wells quite deliberately he had been involved in parts of the investigation and therefore was privy to a great deal of information unavailable to the general public he had meant to describe in grisly detail the events of the week before and his part in the subsequent inquiry in order to impress his young lady as it turned out he never got the chance she screamed even before he had begun his carefully prepared recitation he turned moonlight glinted like metal off the two wells his ladyfriend pointed her hand over her mouth and kuo went to investigate what he had at first taken for shards of the ruined iron cap were on closer inspection clawlike fingers the flesh white with tension and a kind of semiparalysis kuo peering over the wide stone lip of the well could make out a pair of eyes brightly burning like those of a nocturnal animal glaring at him from the fetid murk it was huaishan han battered bruised and swollen almost beyond recognition his back was broken or at least vertebrae in the spine were cracked he was like a hunchback when kuo pulled him out of the private hell he had been clinging to for a full week kuo was astounded that any human being could live down there for any length of time with only rain water to ingest because of this he held huaishan han in a kind of awe as if he were somehow something more than human it was huaishan hans great good fortune to be rescued by kuo and kuos great good fortune as well virtually any other military man would have informed his superior and huaishan han would have been taken to the military hospital where after he had recovered he would have stood secret trial for his crimes his punishment would have been terrible indeed but kuo saw in this situation the seeds for his escape from the military he recognized in huaishan hans scheme a lifetime of power and riches beyond even his wildest dreams therefore the preservation of this man became paramount to him kuo knew that he not only had to keep huaishan han safe but also undiscovered by the government with his ladyfriends assistance he took the injured man to a military staff car he would have to take the girl with him he knew in order to keep security at one hundred percent that was all right with kuo but he was not so certain of the girl so he lied to her he was good at that part of the strategy in wei qi involved spurious forays into enemy territory in order to shield ones real strategy until it was too late to counteract kuo drove all night he needed to get as much distance between him and peking as he could before first light in the south there were people he could trust and others he was certain who would aid huaishan han in return for becoming a part of the opium network as it turned out kuo was right on target the injured man was admitted to a hospital under an alias he was one of many war casualties who were streaming in from the korean war it was easy to lose his identity and no one this far south would recognize huaishan hans face now general kuo standing on the front steps of his hut high on the shan plateau took in the triplecanopied forest the purple and white mountains of northern burma rose into the night sky all around him he thought of them as part of his army great natural sentinels which he had learned how to use that was the beginning he thought a young mans desire to impress his woman a wild ride south in a cloud of dust a dream he had turned into reality for this was the goal he was ultimate master over thousands of people his pockets were bulging with rubies sapphires as big as his knuckle he could buy the business of any tai pan in hong kong should he choose to do so he knew he never would however this was his home this was where he was emperor more he was god the shan only the mountain knows hige moros last words echoed in jakes mind all the way back to hong kong what mountain surely the yakuza oyabun couldnt know about the personal mountain upon which jake toiled the mountain of shi zilin jakes father the mountain of the jian of the zhuan what mountain could link a communist chinese minister and an overlord of the japanese underworld mikio komoto had not known and neither did jake mikio had been stunned by hige moros revelations and he said if moro hadnt been on the point of death he would have been inclined to dismiss them out of hand privately he might believe that hige moro had been making fools of them but jake was not so sure for one thing the story was just too improbable to be a last macabre joke for another jake had been looking in the oyabuns eyes when he said it jake was willing to bet that he had seen the truth there the jumbo hit the tarmac at kai tak without his having made any headway with the problem he had been hoping to get some sleep on the flight but he had been unable to tear his mind from its frenzy of thinking consequently he returned home tired his body aching over virtually every square inch he came out of the terminal into a day dark and rumbly with thunderheads their bruised purple dominated a fulminating sky victoria peak was wreathed in darkness and every now and again pale lightning flickered like an adders tongue his apartment at the cloud levels on the peak was as dark as night without bliss it seemed desolate and chill he dropped his bags and went straight into the bathroom fortyfive minutes later with a tiny cup of saki in his hands he felt halfway human for the first time in days staring out the windows at the billowing electrified clouds he picked up the phone and dialed his uncle the precipitation that slid down the panes of glass bore only a passing resemblance to rain the sky seemed to be weeping bitter tears said hello to a young voice one of his nephews and in a moment three oaths came on the line im back uncle he said i know who killed my father do you know why only partially the full answer was not in japan are you well nephew it depends on your definition jake said well enough how is bliss there was a slight pause she is out of the hospital nephew but i think you had better come down to the junk immediately jake felt a return of tension a knot of worry in his stomach is she all right uncle someone tried to kill her who someone three oaths said you know well great pool of piddle mckenna ian mckenna why jake knew that he was shouting he didnt care my daughter insisted on following up the lead of the opal nephew the trail led to big oysters pok she was having dinner with him when great pool of piddle shot him dead and almost bliss is she injured physically no three oaths said i ask you again nephew to come to the junk there is much more to nephew nephew jake are you there jake wasnt at seven thirty in the evening rodger donovan took the call on the powerful shortwave he had built and installed himself in a corner of the converted attic at greystoke he had just come back from a long exhilarating drive in his corvette donovan loved the car cherished it really as he had longed to cherish leslie as he longed to cherish daniella vorkuta he knew every square greasecoated inch of the vettes insides which was more than he could say for any woman he had ever known donovan who was such a genius with machines and men could never fathom the arcane workings of the feminine psyche this was a deficiency that had he thought about it he would have seen daniella had discovered and used with ruthless proficiency years ago during their months in paris she had been able to recruit him as much because he thought he understood her and did not as because she found in him a more general deep and abiding antipathy for the elitist class system that had spawned him threefourseveneight he said into the opened frequency im here daniella he said are you still hipdeep in snow she stopped his bantering tone when she said what do you know of apollo apollo his mind was like a computer and he reviewed the name quickly nothing are you certain absolutely are you going to clue me in what give who or what is apollo a mole she said inside the kremlin a quarry asset impossible i he was strictly henry wundermans brainchild oh christ he stared out the window the rolling hills were black against the setting sun do you know who he is mikhail carelin he blinked genachevs adviser just so there was an unnatural pause listen to me apollo was henry wundermans asset that means he knew wunderman wasnt chimera jesus donovan gritted his teeth pushing his anxiety aside he began to think furiously do you know who apollos new control is yes daniella said jake maroc maroc again the adrenaline was rushing through donovans veins the verdant virginia hills were fired along their tops now somehow i knew i hadnt heard the last of him i tried to recruit him just after he killed wunderman i thought psychologically it would be the advantageous time he wasnt interested in anything to do with the quarry hes going to be now daniella said as soon as apollo tells maroc that he was wrong about chimeras identity what do you think maroc will do to you once he figures out that it was our disinformation that gave him cause to kill henry wunderman wunderman was marocs mentor maroc loved him like a father christ you dont have to tell me that donovans eyes had gone blank as he thought the problem through he conjured up then discarded option after option i dont think we have any choice he said carefully well just have to take care of mr maroc once and for all frankly daniella said i dont think youve got an operative whos up to the job and this is not an assignment that can be given twice donovan thought about the long afternoon putting the corvette flat out for the sheer excitement of it dont worry about that the mind appreciated being on the precipice of danger even if there was there isnt anyone here id trust with this anyway it would give rise to too many awkward questions the mind liked to be fooled this way every now and again it gave the thought processes a jolt set them running full out again do you know where maroc is at this moment at the moment hong kong daniella said mitres people are monitoring his movements closely good donovan said just keep me updated he brought back the memory of the severe scurve how he had taken it at eightyfive and in front of him the hill an emerald blur looming ill take care of jake maroc myself ian mckenna lived in a battered peeling house along dragons back an area in the southeast of the island bounded on the north by mount collinson and on the south by the daguilar peak peninsula it was for the most part a desolate place quite unlike the rest of hong kong there was for instance more than a touch of australian topography there which was jake supposed why mckenna had chosen it jake pulled the jaguar over onto the rocky dirt verge and killed the engine he was still a thousand meters from the house he had been traveling for the last mileandahalf without lights the road had too many switchbacks that at night would send his cars headlights far ahead he had passed no other vehicles and he did not want to give great pool of piddle any warning got out of the car leaving the door open sounds as well as light traveled far here behind him the lights of the peak and to his right aberdeen were awash with rain everyone in hong kong rejoiced when it rained until kam sangs desalinization plant came on line the crown colony still had a chronic water shortage mckennas eyes bugged out when jake came through the door he was sitting in a corner with his back to the bare walls all the pictures and paintings had been torn down and now lay ragged as battle pennants in a welter of broken glass and shattered frames shards of mirror glittered at mckennas bare feet no lights were on and the shutters and blackout curtains were drawn across the windows mckenna steadfastly faced them as if manning the battlements at armageddon hello mckenna maroc what the fuckre you doing here came to pay a debt he was grinning like a hungry wolf huh jake looked around got any little boys here mckenna the big man started what dyou know about him who he saw mckennas eyes as big around as saucers youre not supposed to know no ones supposed to know there were beads of sweat trembling on mckennas face but its too late for that isnt it they know dont they they know this was getting interesting jake thought who knows dont play games with me maroc you know who you know they know his head whipped around and the sweat flew from him like rain i know it because i can hear the chanting the chanting jake said coming closer sure mckenna i hear it the big man nodded the abos think they can break me by keeping me awake at night he gave a little cackling laugh theyre underestimating me again sure they are mckenna jake said coming on what about big oysters pok why did you kill him kill him i did well then he deserved it jake could see now that mckenna was naked he held a blanket over part of him but his thick pale flesh shone here and there as jake watched mckenna took one hand from beneath the blanket it was filled with a magnum did him with this jake but then he deserved it he did huh it was important to be careful now very careful he fuck with you mckenna nah that cackling laugh again just this side of hysteria nobody bloody fucks with me jake you know that but he was a wog see a wog bloody wogsve been after me since well you know jake had no idea but he nodded just the same the thing was to keep mckenna talking he was obviously as mad as a march hare but somewhere in that confused mind of his jake suspected there was a sane reason why he had shot big oysters pok you killed pok because he was chinese that it the thing was to tune in to mckennas batty level you got it mckenna grinned savagely i always pegged you for a smart one jake he was waving that gun around im glad i was right about you the expression changed with appalling quickness the gun leveled at jakes midsection but dont come so bloody close mate you never know jake froze never know what mckenna the big man stared at him as if he had lost his mind he pointed the gun at the windows about the abos of course his tiny eyes got canny they could have got to you you know they have their ways they certainly do jake said fighting to keep his voice even he wanted to leap across the several meters still separating them and shake the truth out of mckenna but they havent contacted me yet mckennas eyes filled with fear yet what do you mean well jake shrugged ive heard the chanting of course it never stops never mckenna said it used to you know but now therere just too many of them abos they can keep the chanting up forever forever what sin jake wondered did mckenna commit in australia to have driven him this far over the edge is that why you wanted to kill the girl too girl mckennas face was filled with bewilderment what girl the one with big oysters pok when you shot him the big mans eyes were far away was there someone with him i dont remember you must remember the girl mckenna jake said he described bliss did i kill her too i dont think so no poks always with one mckenna said sorrowfully his oysters arent so big now huh bloody hell he liked to talk big like he wasnt a wog he didnt know his place what with his beautiful women his high living hes not living so high now bloody right hes not so it wasnt just that pok was chinese jake thought there was some personal connection you showed him he said you had the last laugh laugh mckenna said his voice was eerie skittish swinging through the emotions he laughed at me he looked down on me but he got me the information didnt he he sure did jake said knowing that he was close now what information oh you know mckenna said confirmation of the rumor that there was troublebig trouble huh jakeat southasia bancorp whered you hear that one mckenna that was top secret no one was supposed to know but the directors of interasia dont i know mckenna said happily i but the front door was swinging open and mckenna his head whipping around had returned with frightening swiftness to his hysterical state the muzzle of the magnum swung in a blurred arc and he screamed theyre coming theyre coming jake saw bliss in the brilliant illumination of her cars headlights coming through the halfopen front door and he leapt at mckenna the first shot went high as jake crashed into his outstretched arm mckenna grunted and rolled freeing one hand he lifted a ham fist slammed it down on the back of jakes head the blow made jakes head swim but he had no time to stop it and the successive ones that landed in the same spot his main concern was the magnum with that caliber size one shot was all it would take to put him down permanently but mckenna was not letting go he had the strength of madness about him and it was impossible to wrest the weapon from him then jake knew why he had been gripping it before jake even arrived he saw it as something magical his only protection from the abos jake used his foot pressing down on mckennas wrist to keep the magnum at bay at the same time he used a liver kite a purely percussion blow an atemi the big man grunted and jerked his knee up it smashed into the back of jakes head making him see stars he wavered and mckenna with superhuman strength pulled his wrist free pointed the magnum into jakes face byebye baby he said thickly and bliss kicked him hard in the side of his head he began to gag and jake recovering used his elbow in a series of atemi that would have put any normal man out not mckenna he came on flailing with the gun and his balledup free hand so that jake had no choice the magnum was very close and impossible to control used the juthara the killing blow the heel of the hand striking the fifth and sixth ribs at such an angle that the shards of bone pierced the heart mckenna screamed his eyes bugged and he arched upward like a speared fish the corpse already dead juddered reflexively jake still groggy lurched to his feet took bliss by the hand and went out on the patio the waves far below crashed and hissed against the black crags the last of the rain beat softly against them the night wind sought to cleanse them he tried to catch his breath couldnt and stood bent over while bliss held his thundering head after a long time he heard her whispering jake jake jake stupid of you to come here he said just plain stupid i could say the same for you she told him close beside him i begged my father not to tell you anything until you got to the junk i knew youd do something like this oh buddha i was so frightened for you she shouted this into the night then fell against him sobbing where were you she whispered why didnt you call i was so worried jake put his arms around her at last he wanted to tell her everything what he had found out in japan and why finally he had gone but he could not he felt as if he were in a dream where one cannot find ones voice why did he remain mute instead he kissed her thinking of them as a movie poster he the allpowerful hero embracing the softly vulnerable leading lady it gave him a measure of solace and briefly he wondered why he felt her heart beating hard against him her warmth seeping into him and he realized just how much he missed her and how worried about her he had been he had wanted to call her many different times when he was in japan each time he had stopped short why it wasnt for lack of caring perhaps then he cared too much the situation had been dire enough in tokyo and then in kyoto without his being distracted by his emotions during that compressed time it had been far better to keep her at arms length but he realized now how cruel he had been to her im sorry bliss he said it was a bad time for mikio there was death all around and i didnt want to share that with you he kissed her neck and i know you you would have picked it up the minute i said hello its all right jake she whispered as long as youre back safe she kissed him i found out about the woman with the opal she went on quickly she was big oysters poks mistress she was also a communist spy then i was right jake said she was tailing me to keep me away from the boat so i couldnt interfere with the dantais work but but he put a hand over her mouth made a silent sshing sound with his lips their faces were very close and he saw the puzzlement in her eyes car he mouthed silently to her then in her ear whispered go to your car and move it from out front dont forget to turn off the lights then come right back here but jake hurry now he said urgently and watched her disappear into the shadows wreathing the side of the house she made no noise and in a moment he was straining to discern where she had gone when she returned she seemed almost to materialize out of those same inky shadows she came toward him in a scuttling half crouch did you see anything jake whispered she nodded car coming i could see its headlights right he said lets find out whos visiting great pool of piddle at this time of the night it meant going back in there the stench was already overpowering and jake knew they would have to be quick so he set them up just inside the front door they waited uncomfortably even breathing through their mouths didnt help enough in time they heard the throaty rumble of exhaust the rain had ceased completely by then and it had grown very still they could hear the crunch of the gravel and the noise of someone walking up the steps there was a knock on the door and bliss opened it while jake lunged forward pulling the figure on the doorstep over the threshold inside bliss kicked the door shut and turned on the light the chinese looked at them from his one good eye the other milky white and unseeing glowered like an angry winters sun i dont want to see him sawyer told sei an under no circumstances but im already in sir john bluestone said opening the door into sawyers office im terribly sorry tai pan an apologetic sei an said peeking in around the tall gwai loh he took me by surprise thats all right sei an sawyer said ive sent for security sawyer saw the wide smirk on bluestones face and knew that he couldnt live with that no no sei an you tell them everythings all right ignoring the loss of face it caused him sei an looked at her tai pan saw his predicament and not wanting to lose him more face nodded wordlessly pulling the door shut behind her sit down tai pan sawyer said with a forced smile to what do i owe this honor it was late in the day the sun hung in the sky like a swollen bruise washing the city in dusty russet light victoria harbor was filled with vessels of every description from old seemingly decrepit junks their faded orange sails spread wide to sleek modern cruisers their diesel exhausts bubbling from stained cargo vessels registered in lands halfway around the world to crisp navalgray aircraft carriers in for r r the view from these windows bluestone said ignoring sawyer is quite extraordinary it makes one feel as if one owns all of hong kong he turned with a grin on his face and without asking went over to the granitetopped sideboard and poured two drinks into widemouthed cutcrystal glasses he put one on the desktop in front of andrew sawyer and sipped at his own ummm single malt excellent sawyer did not touch the glass of scotch he kept his hands folded together the fingers laced in order to conceal their trembling he did not know whether it was in rage or in fear not thirsty tai pan bluestone gave another wide grin he was wearing an impeccably cut tropicalweight chalkstripe suit pure white turnbull and asser shirt with a regimental tie gold nugget cuff links and tie tack polished oxblood wingtip shoes is this a social visit sawyer said finally exasperated bluestone smiled at another tiny victory he knew that they added up he looked down at the scotch swirling the amber liquid social ah no tai pan i dont believe i could spare the time for that of course not sawyer said archly youve been busy lately havent you and youd like nothing better than to swat me down tai pan bluestones head rose until he was looking directly at sawyer but youd better beware is that a threat do you think you can frighten me it would be an awfully stupid man bluestone said with some edge who was not frightened at the prospect of losing his entire empire i see why youve come here sawyer said he stood conceding another minor victory to bluestone he could no longer bear being physically looked down upon from bluestones regal height its to gloat you think that youve already won that all of interasia belongs to you doesnt it not by a fair margin sawyer said firmly bluestone came over to the desk leaned over it we own thirtyeight percent of interasia now today alone we picked up another eight percent the stock is plummeting and our brokers are flooded with offers to sell shares at the price we are offering which remains a full ten dollars over current value on the hang seng do you really think you can stop the takeover at this late date get out of my office sawyer shouted losing more face now but not caring his cheeks flushed with anger and resentment bluestone looked leisurely around the great room i always coveted this office this building its location is superb its mine sawyer thundered and as long as it is youre barred from the premises he picked up the phone and asked for security to come up on the double as long as its yours thats your privilege bluestone thumped his glass onto the center of a pile of papers but realistically we both know that wont be very long he tapped his forefinger against his lips and said meditatively you know i think i have just the right decorating scheme to maximize the drama of this view two armed uniformed men came into the room and he said well i see that youre busy tai pan and i have a great deal to do he lifted his arms all of this has to be replaced of course and thats rather a tall order so i know youll excuse me and went quickly out the door the senior of the uniformed guards said sir nothing andrew sawyer said his head in his hands theres nothing you can do when oleg maluta summoned her to his office she went willingly now that she was well into the game now that she had slipped the knife between the plates of his armor and found the soft spots she no longer feared him oleg maluta no longer seemed seven feet tall filled with an inexhaustible power possessed of an endlessly clever mind that could trap her at every turn she remembered the gun he had with her unsmudged prints embossed by her own oils into the grip the photographs he had of her weeping in the winter night when he had happily trapped her into murdering alexei the smutty photographs he had paraded before her that reduced the love she and mikhail carelin felt for each other to grasping a fluidfilled animal coupling photographs like that should not be allowed to exist she thought they were an affront to god as well as to the sanctity of emotion whores and screen actors could be caught thus in the intimacy of a celluloid moment since no real emotion passed from person to person in the reality of the scene the viewerthe voyeurwas required to participate by adding elements from his or her own imagination in order for it to take life but here the nakedness of daniella and carelin was appalling it was the capturing of what they felt for each other that was the true obscenity the ring road was filled with traffic and daniella was obliged to roll up her windows against the cement dust which rose so high it turned the watery sunlight into a pointillists brush she didnt mind any of it she was by this time thoroughly fed up with a day crammed to overflowing with meetings concerning budgets personnel ongoing project evaluation central staff evaluation expense record overviews and of course the chronic maintenance problems plaguing the new offices the weariness of inertia coated her like grime it was endemic to the soviet bureaucratic structure but that somehow today made it even harder to take her departmentthe entire sluzhba it seemed was mired in inefficiency boredom and stupidity the humdrum had claimed them all making of them nothing more than dullwitted slugs squirming blindly through rockstrewn soil after more than a decade and god alone knew how much money africa was turning further and further away from communism the coordinated protests throughout western europe were now no more than an insignificant trickle and russias hold over eastern europe though steadfast only served to make clear to her her own countrys lack of vision and global inspiration only the sovietbacked terrorist training centers were an unqualified success but while many of daniellas colleagues applauded their work and clamored for even more recruits from the middle east she saw what they did not that arming the arabs was one thing training them in this way was quite another the absolute danger of fanaticism had faded in russia as the government rewrote the histories of stalin and trotsky ideological fanaticism is bad enough daniella thought but religious fanaticism was a lethal bomb of quite terrifying proportions she wondered now as her chaika rolled through the borovitsky gate if any of them within the sluzhba knew just what it was they were helping to spawn oleg malutas office was actually a suite of three rooms inside the kremlin it was on the fourth floor of an unremarkable building near the theater its ancient windows affording an excellent view across touristladen cathedral square to tainitskaya bashnya the tower of silence built in and the oldest of the kremlins outstructures velvet drapes hung on either side of the casements and a massive desk of solid mahogany was set just in front of this in this way the light was always behind maluta and in the eyes of his visitors daniella closed the oak door behind her and went across the isfahan carpet threading her way between the two velvetcovered highbacked chairs portraits of lenin and stalin oversized definitely not standard issue hung on either side wall the end of a leather sofa peeked out from behind a partly open door maluta was on the telephone halfturned away as she delivered the two manila envelopes onto his desktop her latest report on carelin and genachev she looked out the window beyond the italianinspired crenellated wall beyond the tower of silence boats upon the moskva moved with the alacrity of snails crawling up a hill from this distance the water appeared as dense as lead it was the color of zinc the windows were closed against the stink of diesel fumes and the noise of constant construction still she noticed the seepage of grit along the sills maluta motioned her to a chair but she ignored him she went around the side of the desk and put one booted foot up on his chair with a shove she swiveled his leather chair around and flexed her knee the thick brown fabric of her uniform skirt drew back as if by accident revealing the flesh of her thigh startled and angry maluta lifted a hand to strike her but daniella caught it by the wrist in her two hands he opened his mouth but she put her face very close to his and slowly slowly drew his hand downward their eyes locked and this time daniella saw the vulnerability behind the carefully groomed facade he was a child just as all men were children deep down in their souls that was the essential difference in the sexes daniella thought men at their cores are children women are mothers daniella cursed into his face while she brought his reluctant hand within the hem of her skirt into the darkness this is what you want bastard she hissed at him this is what youre afraid oreanda will punish you for having isnt that right oleg dont call me that here his face was flushed and the hand holding the receiver was white put the phone down oleg i told you she gripped his hand hard guided his fingertips until they grazed the humid bush of her pubic hair as soon as she felt the tremors begin she pushed his hand away along her thigh malutas brain was on fire through the conflagration he saw the visage of oreanda her full sensual lips opened and she spoke to him he felt rather than heard her words they fell like drops of dew onto his imprisoned fingertips his tongue came out swiped at his dry lips he began to tremble in earnest it is what you want oleg her voice was silken whisper not here he rasped thickly not now oh yes she said her lips against his ear here now no he shouted beginning to rise up out of the chair but daniella drew his palm forward until it cupped her she pushed the fingertips inside her and she said there as she would to an infant whose constant crying she wished to end oh god god god maluta thought shivering he felt the sweat trickle from under his arms with a stifled groan he hung up without ending the conversation there was an odd sweet taste in his mouth are you crazy he said but he knew it was likely not she but he who was crazy knew that if he had to take his hand away now he could not why are you doing this he whispered he could not take his eyes off her hips as they made sharp little circles is it to humiliate me further to tell me how much you despise me how you hate making love to me how it disgusts you im going to come daniella said arching herself into his probing fingers the gaze from her gray eyes seemed to caress him right now and reached down to twist the bulge inside his trousers felt him lurch then spurt heavily and said there oh there the phone began to ring he was panting his face slick with running sweat that trickled down into the starched collar of his shirt he jerked a little as if with tiny electric shocks as she continued to rub him through his sopping trousers in a moment the ringing ceased i hope you have a change of clothes here she said laughing as she took his hand from her and put her leg down did you enjoy it malutas eyes never left her as she walked around the desk and sat finally on one of the velvetcovered chairs she sat with her back very straight her legs demurely crossed a soldiers posture her head was back a strand of her thick honeycolored hair curling down over one cool appraising gray eye i want to know maluta said it is important that i know he had not moved an inch since she had left him why is it important to you oleg because he said and stopped because you fancy yourself a great lover because oreanda never enjoyed it he had blurted it out and daniella suppressed a smile of triumph she had known that he could not fancy himself any kind of lover at all the celibate all these years since oreandas death but she had wanted to provoke a response in him knowing that if she stung him deep enough the truth would inevitably emerge and in this she had been successful now you must know whether i am like her in this she said yes oleg oreanda never came into your office and did that to you it never would have occurred to her he admitted what did she enjoy his eyes were closed his arched ringers massaging his forehead she read de sade you know that she had not she had only suspected it until he had told her at the dacha and she practiced what she read she watched him yes she went on eventually i imagine she was a cunt you know nothing about her maluta said but there was no conviction left in his voice on the contrary daniella said deliberately ending the thought there well he said you didnt answer my question i thought i had i dont understand oleg she said its all the answer youre going to get she stood up smiled i hope you dont have an imminent meeting youre all wet he looked down at his lap as if first becoming aware of the mess there look what youve done to me i want the photos of mikhail no maluta said what do you do she said contemptuously spill your seed all over them he was abruptly offended what are you thinking of you cannot shame me into giving them to you i have no need to oleg she said earnestly you have already shamed yourself how easily the lies fall from your mouth cunt no oleg she said oreanda was the cunt the controlling bitch who made your life a hell i loved her he shouted and she thought yes the wound is still as fresh as if it had been inflicted yesterday i loved her with all my heart you couldnt have daniella said assertively otherwise she would not have died his face was white what do you mean but he knew perfectly well what she meant you protest that you didnt set the fire she said why do you think that you can hide it from her do you think that you can escape her retribution maluta was gripping the arms of his chair and then in a softer voice shes listening now isnt she oleg his eyes were wide and staring you are crazy he was shaking now he knew that he must fill up the hissing silence or he would go mad this was what he had been fighting with since oreandas death now it was coming out leaking through the fine seal he had set up at the dark edge of his mind shes dead dead and gone daniella shook her head sensing victory his eyes with the whites showing all around had the aspect of a panicked animals shes inside your soul oleg you must know that she leaned over his desk her eyes glowing feral she knows who set the fire she knows who killed her then abruptly daniella came around the desk her aspect softened along with her voice but ill protect you oleg her hand rested on his crotch she felt the stirring there ill protect you from oreanda her power is mine isnt it oleg the magic has been transferred it is mine to use as i wish her voice had turned into a croon yes ill protect you maluta giving a great shudder dug frantically inside the collar of his shirt he produced a tiny oddlooking key on a gold chain and rattling it against the lock in the desks lower drawer finally inserted it he pulled out the drawer and fumbled there for some time out of daniellas line of sight there he said finally all right there daniella looked at the packet he had thrown on the desktop her heart beating fast she tried unsuccessfully to catch her breath you and mikhail carelin maluta said through tense lips in there like characters from a film a pornographic film he looked away as if he could not bear what he was doing the prints and the negatives everything is there a pulse beat erratically in his temple he appeared inordinately tired as if giving up the photos somehow robbed him of energy daniella lifted her hand mopped at his sopping brow poor darling she whispered rest now sleep oleg maluta nodded he closed his eyes slowly with the kind of reverence her mother had approached the image of christ on the cross daniella put her hand over the packet jake hit whiteeye kao very hard in the center of his nose the flesh rent the cartilage split and a torrent of blood gushed forth jake held the chineses hands preventing them from stanching the flow whiteeye kaos good eye was redrimmed and his cheap suit was stained red i know youre not here to be buggered jake said youre too old for mckenna for one thing he hauled on the chinese dragging him across the brightly lighted room for another youre a bloody wog thats what mckenna called you know that did he ever say that to your face i wonder no he didnt have the guts for it but he thought it every waking moment you were nothing but a running sore to him took whiteeye kao by the scruff of his neck and as if he were a pet who had soiled the carpet shoved his face into mckennas bloated one the stench was horrific grgreat pool of piddle whiteeye kao finally got out a mi tuo fo thats right jake said call on the buddha but he wont be merciful tonight not to you anyway he hauled back on the chinese kept him standing it was important to keep him as uncomfortable as possible water whiteeye kao said he turned his head in blisss direction buddhas mercy some water oh jake said you want her to take care of you instead of me all right its a mistake you wont make again i guarantee that whiteeye kaos bloodshot orb stared at him uncomprehendingly jake smiled into whiteeye kaos face and at the same moment his arm shot out and his clawed hand grabbed his sacred sac squeezing it so hard that whiteeye kaos good eye bulged in its socket with the exquisite agony making him tremble and jerk beads of sweat formed on his eyebrows his lips were pulled back in a rictus of pain his chest fluttered heaving as jake let go he groaned deep in his throat and his head sank down jake bliss took a step toward him but jake waved her back he ignored the concerned look on her face you see now how unwise youve been jake said softly in whiteeye kaos ear he waited until the chinese nodded before going on now tell me what youre doing here visvisiting jake used his hand again this time whiteeye kaos body arched his legs kicking uncontrollably ah buddha he hissed through gritted teeth he wont help you now jake said no ones going to help you now tell us what you were doing here he gave a tentative little squeeze and the chinese made a high keening in his throat trying to shrink away from him i know who you are jake said softly in his ear i know you work for sir john bluestone and i know who bluestone is now what does that make you whiteeye kao staring in terror into jakes face said a communist and what does a communist want with great pool of piddle mckenna he the chinese gulped swallowing his own blood he was a conduit a conduit through which bluestone was able to spread the news of trouble at southasia and you were bluestones messenger boy yes mckenna suspected nothing suspect what he thought i was from a triad green pang maybe who knows bluestone was behind teck yaus embezzlement of southasia funds yes of course who else was involved i dont know whirled him around pulled him erect with a hard jerk listen you poxinfested piece of dogshit jake said menacingly my fathers been murdered this ladys been shot at and someone has been trying to kill me down every street and back alley from here to kyoto jake hes had enough bliss said reasonably no jake said so fiercely it frightened her then to whiteeye kao tell me what you know ive told you ohhh he vomited retching dryly at the aftermath of jakes liver kite jake bliss put her hand on his shoulder maybe hes telling the truth listen to her the chinese gasped on his knees his forehead was pressed against the threadbare carpet buddha what do you want from me youve got a smart mouth jake said bending down over the chinese i want to know who trained you bluestone jake lifted his head looked at bliss hes got the same answer for every question saw that look on her face as she shook her head in a negative the chinese was lying a mi tuo fo its your questions not my answers a master jake said seriously i told you he had been taught by a master he left the chinese curled on the floor watched over by bliss and rummaged around the kitchen he returned with a small knife and bending over took whiteeye kaos sweatslick hair in his fist pulled back his head since youve got a smart mouth were going to do something about it whawhat dyou mean jake grinned down into his face youve got a lot of teeth the grin was fierce and utterly merciless theyre going to come out one by one dew neh loh moh are you crazy whiteeye kaos gaze was fixed hypnotically on the shining point of the blade he smiled then canny as a fox thats good very good you know what you almost made me shit my pants but i know you wouldnt jake for the love of buddha no whiteeye kao screamed as jake stabbed the knife downward digging into the soft pink gum beside a lower molar twisted the blade scraping against the enamel levering the tooth out jake whats gotten into you it popped with a gush of blood whiteeye kao gagged and gurgled his fists beat at his own head to stop the pain oh oh oh he moaned he didnt tell me it would be like this who didnt tell you jake was very close to him he said i wouldnt get hurt i wouldnt ah buddha it hurts imagine how much worse itll be when i go in on the other side of your mouth jake said getting the blade set a mi tuo fo no whiteeye kao tried to crawl away but fake held him fast tears were in his eyes and he spit out more blood its not worth it nothings worth it you werent trained by bluestone jake said who then daniella vorkuta a fornicating woman whiteeye kao said with some contempt buddha no it was the pride that stopped the flow of tears i was trained by chen ju jake laughed that old bastard has more legends about him than anyone else i know now youd better come up with the truth it is the truth buddha do you think i want any more of that easy to talk about chen ju jake said the old mans long dead dead now it was whiteeye kaos turn to laugh what do you think this is all about bluestone the chinese spat again the loh faan is the only one who believes himself so clever he wiped blood off his face with his sleeve who came to the tai pan with the thought of penetrating to the heart of southasia jake took the chinese up by the front of his jacket already stiff and stinking with dried blood his knuckles were white with tension because bliss able to intuit the truth had passed her knowledge silently on to him what are you saying if chen ju is dead whiteeye kao said then i have come face to face with a ghost mandalay the golden city was the center of the world at least the royal palace that the burmese king mindon had built all of solid teak in was its site the mystical mount meru so dear to the brahminbuddhist cosmology by burmese standards mandalay just over a mere century old was a recent city yet lying athwart the upper irrawaddy in the north it had quickly become the center of all trading being in the midst of the ricegrowing districts still its climate was often so dry that the sky was turned ochre by plumes of dust kicked up by ancient vehicles mandalay nevertheless held a magic incomparable in the burmese heart it was said that it was to mandalay that gautama buddha journeyed in order to announce that on the twentyfourhundredth anniversary of his death the worlds largest center of buddhist teaching would spring up at the foot of mandalay hill this legend was the kind of thing the british dismissed out of hand as so much asian mumbo jumbo when they took over the city in they renamed the royal palace fort dufferin and made barracks of the sacred chambers mustachioed batmen diligently polished their officers boots in lemonscented corridors where before holy voices had echoed the commandants unsheathed their wilkerson swords touching tips and shouting hallelujah another outpost of the empire had been secured in the early spring of the british shelled the fortressthen defended by a handful of japanese and burmese soldiers the gunners did such a thorough job that today only the outer walls and the moat remain this is what tony simbal was thinking of as he looked down upon the ruins of the royal palace a perfect square whose walls faced in the four cardinal directions he was studying the spot he knew to be the lions room the central throne room where the british general prendergast led his horse when king thibaw was forced into exile in the winter of the nervous animals steaming droppings soiled a carpet many hundreds of years old brought to mandalay from the ancient capital of amarapura the general thought it just as well the weavers detailed depiction of the theraveda arhats or saints made him uneasy and he had it burned without a pang of remorse if one faced the royal palace today simbal thought one could still catch a whiff of burning material to the east the umber sky withheld its promise of rain the achingly dry ground was cracked beneath a glaring sun so many mouths crying silently for moisture simbal in white seaisland cotton shirt bush shorts and sturdy hightopped leather hiking shoes waited while max threnody laboriously climbed the hill the heat was intense and by the time threnody made it up his khaki shirt was soaked through he wiped at his brow with an oversize handkerchief already darkened by many such moppings christ he said but this is a godforsaken place on the contrary simbal said still staring at the palace ruins it is quite near the place where god dwells and where might that be threnody said sarcastically there simbal pointed to the northwest where the purple mountains rose upward from the vast irrawaddy plain the shan threnody snorted shifting on his feet he wished desperately to get out of the sun christ the only thing worth anything up there kills people really simbal was in no mood for his former bosss monodirectional thinking theres power up there real power the kind people like you can only dream of the mountain knows that secret better than any of us i suppose threnody said that people like you dont covet such power simbal turned to look at him the heat somehow made his eyes seem to pop even more as a child simbal had once had a tropical fish tank his uncle had brought him a pair of beautiful velvetfinned goggleeyed goldfish simbal had loved them but one night he had gone out and inadvertently left the grow light on over the tank when he returned the goldfish were dead bloated grotesquely parboiled in the heat threnody reminded him of those fish now im surprised you came frankly you didnt leave me any choice threnody thrust his hands into his trousers pockets by the way the cubans pissed as hell at you ill try not to cry simbal said hell get over it threnody peered at him through his thick glasses do i detect a bit of hostility tony simbal reached into one oversize shirt pocket deposited three photographs into threnodys hand they were black and white with the kind of grain brought about by blowing up a section of a negative also they had the absolutely flat aspect produced by a long lens they were surveillance photos simbal had taken of a handsome man in his midthirties with clear intelligent eyes an allamerican nose a sensitive mouth the bit of slightly outoffocus background made it clear that the subject was photographed just outside the royal palace so this is where he is threnody said just like you max simbal said shortly not my hes still alive his eyes burned bright what earthly good would that serve threnody said the fact is peter curran is alive he glanced down at the photos simbal had handed him wed better put whatever surprise we may feel behind us i want him and youre going to get him for me just like that dont take that righteous tone with me threnody said sharply what kind of business do you think youre in tony do you suppose were all gentlemen here meticulously saying please and thank you and not getting in each others way you used me simbals tone was accusatory you used monica and martine to keep track of me congratulations threnody said youve deciphered the language of your trade better late than never tony yes i had a job to do i used all the resourcesyou monica the cubanat my disposal thats what the government pays me to do a fucking dirty job it is should i say but someones got to do it its true he put the photos of curran away you have no legitimate complaints you know its your job as well but youre dea max simbal said in case youve forgotten martine is a snit thats cia the company and the dea are always miles apart on everything youd better tell me what im missing all in good time threnody said now that were both here youll hear the whole nine yards simbal watched a line of saffronrobed monks moving slowly past one of the palaces twelve gates their shaven heads gleamed in the dusty sunlight he thought of what the british had done to the golden city shit all over the rug from amarapura the burmese he said after a time practice a certain form of buddhism in theraveda there is no allpowerful god one cannot even pray for the benevolence of buddha there can be no divine intervention salvation is entirely in the hands of the individual all life is suffering the theraveda buddhists believe life and death are opposite sides of samsara the rebirth there is only one way out of the perpetual cycle of misery and that is strict adherence to buddhas sacred teaching the dharma one must diligently follow the paths laid out by the arhats the saints and the boddhisatvas the buddhastobe only then may one reach nirvana today even here at the center of the world perhaps it is only the monks who practice such a pure form of theravada buddhism and you are one of them arent you tony threnody wiped at his face again youre high above the masses youre on the shan on the mountainside looking down at all the pathetic little ants crawling slowly along going about the daily routines by which they must live is that what you think of me oh come off it tony youre a goddamned elitist do yourself a favor and admit that much at least the monks were turning a corner they were all in step the many with one mind do you know who peter curran came here to meet at dawn simbal said surprise me edward martin bennett well well threnody said theres something the vetting department failed to turn up what does the diqui want with them are you kidding tony with what they stole from the dea computer the diqui will have clear drug runs for months until we rearrange all our asian networks i dont think this has anything to do with drugs max i dont care what it has to do with threnody said terminate them and be done with it he waited for simbals head to swing around the eyes to contemplate him one thing you had to say for the bastard simbal thought he had great timing its time for us to have a little talk tony heart to heart so to speak i dont think chen ju is our most immediate problem three oaths lumbered across the teak deck of his new junk delivering tea that neon chow had made as of this morning bluestone has increased his share of interasia to just over forty percent i wonder where hes getting all that capital jake said as he took a meditative sip of the steaming tea three oaths recited the list of investors given to him by bentnose su theres enough money in there to buy all of hong kong if necessary jake was aware of the anxiety in the others voice bobby chan sixtoe ping sir byron nolinkelly dark leong lau impressive still he mused there has got to be a limit to the amount of liquid assets even bluestones combine can sink into one project they only need nine percent more to gain control three oaths said that would make it thirteen million shares give or take whats the current price on the hang seng of interasia let me check three oaths went down the companionway jake took a look around he saw bliss talking with neon chow both were engrossed in their conversation but every now and again he saw neon chow glancing in his direction out of the corner of his eye it was impossible to decipher her expression he made a mental note to ask her what progress she had made with bluestone twentytwoandaquarter three oaths said returning we took a terrible beating when we were forced to close southasia theyve still got to put up what two hundred ninety million dollars jake said what have they anted up already three oaths did some fast calculating id say close to threequarters of a billion to do that theyve had to liquidate some holdings of course but whats the difference as soon as they take control of interasia theyll have effectively sewn up the entire crown colony a billion dollars is a cheap price to pay for all of hong kong cheap only if you can afford it jake said thoughtfully so what shall we do now zhuan how are we going to prevent the gwai loh tai pan from taking everything from us again jake was aware of the edge in the others voice he knew that he was being shut out of momentous business decisions and he resented it this had not been his relationship with zilin but jake was not the jian he was zhuan and these were different times trust no one with this jake his father had told him no one not until you find bluestones conduit into the yuhnhyun jake said i want you to tell sawyer to call our broker and float the du long bonds what three oaths cried those are junk high gaintriple the interest available on the marketfor high risk theyll increase interasias debt tremendously and for what yes theyll drive up the price of the stock but for now long and for the piddling amount of cash theyll add to our depleted supply of capital theyll make us liable to pay back sums that could break our backs if were still here well be glad to pay jake said evenly three oaths turned thoughtful a moment are you doing this for bluestones benefit that added debt would make interasia less desirable for a takeover as well but not enough jake thought not nearly enough how much do you think the stock will rise three oaths considered this seven points ten if were lucky will even that be sufficient jake wondered so close to the ultimate abyss now he could feel the edge of the sword bluestone daniella vorkuta and chen ju had manufactured hanging over him he wondered whether he had been right to trust so completely in his father zilin had been merely human after all he was prone to making mistakes trust sometimes could not withstand the rigors of time but he knew it had been he as zhuan who had made the final decision it was in the final analysis his judgment no good to blame the dead if it all fell apart now three oathss fist enclosed his tiny teacup zhuan i was against going public with the new company from the first i am aware of that elder uncle by the spirit of the white tiger if you had heeded my advice none of this would have been possible i would not be watching everything i have worked for since i journeyed here from shanghai being taken away from me by a fornicating loh faan do not forget elder uncle jake said how it was you came to hong kong in the first place my father sent you here in the employ of andrew sawyers father barton to begin your work for the yuhnhyun the decision to go public with interasia was made by me with my fathers blessing for a moment three oaths did nothing he peered into jakes hooded copper eyes i wonder where my nephew has gone to he said softly where is the young man who used to confide in me with whom i shared secrets i wonder that was a long time ago elder uncle the difference is day and night i can see as well as anyone three oaths said i am not yet that old please do as i have asked jake said gently but firmly i want those bonds on the market before days end he stood by the railing for a long time he preferred not to watch the old mans painful progress down the companionway beyond the junks berth wallawallas were busy taking wideeyed cameraladen tourists to and from jumbo the gargantuan multitiered floating restaurant that along with two others was permanently anchored in aberdeen harbor the riders took in the teeming waterfront with a mixture of fascination and apprehension as if they anticipated coming across a reallife smuggler or triad assassin he joined the women and they broke off their conversation dont stop on my account he said weve finished bliss said neon chow smiled are you done with your uncle now she asked it occurred to jake that she had missed her calling only an excellent actress could smile so winningly while being so verbally acerbic he chose not to answer her instead he said how are you proceeding with sir john bluestone hes urbane and witty hes also a communist spy jake said dryly did you expect him to come out and confess that to me already i expected some progress whores neon chow said do not make progress they merely sink deeper and deeper into an abyss that smile again now he could see its sharpness like a stilettos shining blade and thats what youve made me through your directive zhuan a whore well what do you know jake said i didnt think bluestone had it in him neon chow slapped him across the face saying bastard do you know how hard this is on your uncle jake did not move his copper eyes glistened go on she said you may terrify the rest of them zhuan she spit it out as if it burned her tongue im not afraid of you all i ask is that you do as you are told jake said reasonably if thats too much say so youre my uncles mistress not mine you have other things to occupy your time i imagine you really are a bastard arent you i think you ought to stop seeing bluestone he said abruptly her eyes widened why it was a mistake jake said lets call it quits i dont want to are you saying i cant do it i told you it was a mistake thats all besides you said yourself that its hurting three oaths i dont want to do that you want bluestones secrets dont you theres always another way he did not want her to know that there was no other path for him what would she demand of him then like what neon chow persisted i still think i have the best chance sooner or later hell drop something on my pillow or ill overhear a latenight conversation jake appeared lost in thought for a time all right he said at last im willing to give it another shot but he warned if you cant bring me results in one week that will be the end of it she seemed unsure thats very little time its all youre going to get he glanced at his watch if i were you id make the most of it neon chow nodded went quickly below and gathering up her things she went off the junk jake watched her leave it was easy to pick her out of the crowd she could stop traffic in a models convention bliss caught his eye jake she began but jake waved her to silence seeing three oaths emerging from belowdecks he went over to him its all done the old man said if anything he seemed in worse humor if it means anything sawyers reaction was the same as mine but hes done as you ordered the du long bonds are on the market good jake said and began to turn away zhuan yes elder uncle bliss told me about what happened at great pool of fiddles and i am concerned were all concerned elder uncle no i mean about you jake watched him silent she told me what you did to whiteeye kao i dont have to she admitted her own guilt the torture we did what was necessary jake said shortly nothing more i understand that there are great stakes involved greater than we know i fear three oaths fought hard to decipher his nephews words yes he thought he is greatly changed his spirit is so far away from all of us is this what it means to be zhuan if so then truly i do not wish it for my number one son or any of my sons for that matter is it true that chen ju is alive he said finally so it would seem elder uncle and that you and bliss will seek him out yes three oaths gave a great sigh it is exceedingly dangerous there in the shan i know it is his place now chen jus it is our enemys seat of power jake looked deeply into the old mans eyes elder uncle if i do not do this there will truly be nothing left for any of us of course you must go then zhuan i will take good care of her elder uncle she is most precious to me your bousehk my precious gem tears were glistening in the old mans eyes you were right times have changed more much more than i have realized shi zilin is gone you are zhuan now and my bousehk is no longer a child it is a difficult realization which one did he mean the first the last or all of them the madness was growing being in her proximity was akin to standing too close to an outofcontrol blaze no wonder huaishan han thought colonel hu was no longer among the living within general kuos kingly hut huaishan han sat like a misshapen lump of lard that one shoulder was higher than the other never bothered him more than it did now it was a constant reminder of the well or perhaps sheqi linwas that reminder her eyes were like burning coals once huaishan han had gone tiger hunting in the north far above beijing siberian tigers enormous savage beasts out of a prehistory he could only guess at it was the whiteness of the beast that had surprised him the most he supposed it was because of the snow there was a lot of snow that far north he could still see his own breath a living thing escaping from his lungs in silver sheets his hair had been rimed by ice so that he looked prematurely gray the cold penetrated even through his sheepskinlined parka huaishan han and the hunter had spent three days tracking the faint spoor of a massive male he was like a spirit they could hear him at times snuffling growling low in his throat once he was certain he even scented the beast but they never caught sight of him the last night in camp they had decided to call it quits the cold was bonechilling and the quest seemed fruitless all they spoke of around the sparking fire was returning to civilization where they could get warmth and real food huaishan han awoke into utter darkness the full moon had gone down a night wind flicked shards of ice and snow through the encampment like the remnants of a defeated army heard a quick sharp sound and turning his head he was aghast to see the massive shoulders of the shadowed beast not a halfameter away he held his breath fear was like a living being squirming in his belly his legs were water and he was certain that he had lost control of his bladder the neck muscles displayed so high above him were bunched in tension and as huaishan han stared in helpless fascination the tiger gave a sharp jerk of its powerful head he heard a distinct snap as if a mature tree had been rent by lightning and the pale face of his companion rolled in his direction huaishan han started despite himself and the great feline head came up a rough bestial snuffling and he was staring directly into the face of the creature for a moment there was absolute stillness then it snarled a little black lips curling back to reveal long bloodstreaked fangs those great mirrored eyes utterly round yellow and streaked as polished carnelians gave off their own light lurid and luminescent they lay encysted within the encompassing womb of the night glowing with power until huaishan han was quite certain that only he and the beast existed he knew that within the next sixty seconds he would either live or die knew as well that he had no say in the matter he knew if he moved at all the tiger would leap upon him without warning it was up to the beast then or buddha who dwelt within all living things joss huaishan han gave up a tiny sigh of resignation and looking into the face of death recognized it as being wholly familiar it had not surprised him when the beast turned away from him all illumination ceased the extraordinary world that those eyes had revealed to him winked out the raw power the indefatigable energy evaporated and that awesome engine of destruction was again part of the night for many years afterward huaishan han was to lie sleepless in his bed trying to decipher the message buddha had left for him in those eyes at last he had decided that it was this it was not that the tiger killed indiscriminately but rather that it did so without the slightest compunction now humped in the dusty wicker chair general kuo had provided for him huaishan han stared into qi lins coalblack eyes and knew that he was visited again by the terrifying engine of destruction out of his past compulsively he reached out and took her hand in his turning it over he stared down it seemed so fragile so pale and beautiful with its extraordinarily long slender fingers yet he knew that it must have been this hand that had killed colonel hu he recalled the hypnotic beauty of the beast that had exerted its pull over him it had made him ache to reach out and caress those velvet eyes it had made him long to crawl closer to the nexus of that heady power did not this female the granddaughter of his enemy possess the same disorienting quality it was madness to think so to believe in such power but madness had been huaishan hans constant companion a piece of the utter blackness of the well dwelling within him long after general kuo had come to the lip of his world and reaching down had pulled him out of that pit of terror huaishan han closed his eyes and shuddered heavily ah the well the world of the damned general kuo had saved him from that but huaishan han knew that he had never truly escaped his heart was encased in the utter anguish of that endless time and now looking into those feline eyes so close to his face he realized with a start that though general kuo might have pulled him from the depths of perdition he had died down there in the lightless trough of the well realized as well that he had never been so alive as at that moment when he stared into those hot agate eyes in the night now he knew just how much he had drawn from that engine of destruction and with trembling withered hands he brought qi lins exquisite head toward his own her cheeks were heated like a mysterious sun burning in the darkness and her skin had the velvet texture he had imagined in his dreams belonged to the white siberian she growled low in her throat as he brought her to her knees in front of him and he was keenly aware of the danger seeping from her as if a shining blade was at his throat he swallowed convulsively and bowed his head until his forehead pressed against hers the energy flowed into him and he knew that if she reached up now and broke his neck he would not stop her but she would not he was as certain of that as he had been of anything in his life no she would not harm him this grandchild of his enemy but she would kill for him she would kill jake maroc shi with an almost religious reverence huaishan han pressed his lips to her forehead and for just an instant the horror of the well faded from his consciousness the girandole rose into the black sky radiating light someone threnody said has a sure hand with the fireworks they could hear the popping and sparking associated with the display now up on the hill they were quite a ways away from the source when the boy comes simbal said til have to go threnody recognized a threat when he heard one they were at an outdoor cafe it was still so hot he was sweating doing nothing but sitting he found the climate intolerable and wondered how simbal could like it here i did not come here to tell you about peter curran i could have telexed that information or have sent monica there was a large buddha nearby as there almost always was wherever one happened to find oneself in burma the figure was seated with his left hand palm upward on his lap the right resting palm down on his right knee the fingertips touching the ground actually threnody went on im glad youre pissed off at me tony it shows youre right on form he took up his sweating glass of beer and downed some i wouldnt want to think id misjudged you at this late date threnody seemed very sure of himself and this interested simbal this was not his territory and it seemed to him threnody was not a good traveler he had a weak stomach a penchant for picking up the local parasite or something at least that was the story that was commonly batted around at the dea when simbal had been there tell me something max he said did you know that peter curran was alive now how would i know that threnody said do you see that buddha simbal said its many centuries old those are diamonds encrusting its base in many temples burmese work full time to restore the gold leaf that is worn away over the years by supplicants touching the image for luck he poured out a bottle of beer into his glass this one is in the bhumispara mudra hes calling on vasumdarhi the earth goddess i didnt know buddha needed help with anything threnody said dryly the legend has it simbal went on that mara the god of destruction sought first to destroy the buddhas power by unleashing an army of fierce demons against him and then when that failed dispatched his three daughters desire pleasure and passion to sway him the buddha touched the ground calling upon vasumdarhi to bear witness that he had found perfect knowledge with her assent the earth began to heave and shake apart with such violent force that mara and his daughters were driven away threnody had finished his beer he pushed the glass away to the center of the table where it stood a lone barrier between them is that how you see me tony as mara the god of destruction come to crush you simbal remained silent he was all too aware of rodger donovans warning about max today i am a messenger a bearer of bad tidings only will you listen to what i have to say all right threnody hunched forward the fireworks turned his face pink and gold the colors sliding off the side of his face like greasepaint i mean really listen tony to the bitter end even if some of it is not what you want to hear i was your case officer through some pretty hairy situations i always got you out with your skin whole i always got my executives out with their skins whole if not their minds simbal said but he knew that threnody was right with him his people always came first he took a great deal of heat from the chair jockeys higher up but he never allowed one iota of that to seep down to his executives that was unusual there were plenty of case officers out to make a name for themselves who would take all kinds of savage risks with their field people in order to get a job done you forget simbal went on that i work for rodger donovan now donovan right your own personal contact in the oldboy network simbal eyed him do you think thats why he offered me the job my god no but it does play a factor tony perhaps a crucial one i think that when it comes to the crunch donovan believes that you will remain loyal to him no matter what because we grew up together went through school together dont underestimate the network tony you performed the rites of youth together thats a bond that is difficult to break through all of this you havent said one word about curran and bennett simbal said im grateful to you tony because of you weve found them i gave you the motivation you see youre such a chivalrous type i knew what the news of currans death would do to you it didnt bother you what it did to monica believe me tony when i tell you monicas far better off thinking hes dead than knowing the truth about him is it up to you to play god threnody ignored that i knew once id given you sufficient motivation youd get your teeth into this mess you found bennett you were always my best bulldog tony i had a hell of a time now and again getting you to back off ive done more than find them max simbal said curran and bennett are up to something that is larger than the dea larger even than the quarry simbal said i have some facts but they dont add up to anything concrete before he died runrun yi managed to tell me several things that the diqui is moving arms all around the globe not for resale but rather for stockpiling yi said that these antipersonnel weapons will have the power to destroy the world he also called bennett the jinn who opens the door do you know what he meant by that max all i know is what ive given you threnody said the point is i had the devils own time getting you okayed for this briefing there was a lot of then this isnt about curran and bennett simbal cut in it never was oh yes it was bennett and curran are one issue rodger donovan is quite another who had to okay me for this briefing simbal said the president the president of what threnody sighed of the united states this is straight from the top tony simbal peered at his former boss what do you have to do with the president of the united states except pick up the medals for your executives at closed awards ceremonies now and again i work for him now part time thats how im able to run snits like martine im sort of semiretired from the dea since when simbal said skeptically since about a month after henry wunderman was killed do you think a thing like that would be let go so easily and the dea as far as any of my people are concerned threnody said im still there full time they know im grooming boxer as my eventual replacement david boxer yes you know him of course whats he been told that my doctors say i need to take it easy ease myself out of fulltime involvement hes most solicitous and very good i have no worries there simbal watched the colored light dripping from max threnodys face he had always wondered what it would be like to have his world turned upside down now that it was happening he knew it was nothing like the fantasy whats going on max why are you here in a moment tony first i feel i need explain something to you the president was not happy when i mentioned your name for this why as i said you and donovan come from the same club youre asshole buddies this is about donovan then i told the president that in this case i thought it might work in our favor i told him i was banking on you tony on your smarts your honesty your sense of justice youre a goddamned paladin tony you like nothing better than to get on your white horse and have at the man in black he paused significantly no matter their identity i see you won out i know you better than the president does threnody said besides this all rests on my shoulders below them lights were on in a square a bunch of teenagers naked to the waist were playing chinlon it was the burmese national sport and something of a mania among the young they passed a ball made of woven sugarcane leaves from one to another using complicated strokes that involved only the feet and the knees max what the hell is all this leading up to i think your bossrodger donovanis working for the other side in the square the kid with the ball had stepped outside the circle drawn in the dust it had a diameter of sixandahalf meters and he lost points for his misstep points were also subtracted if the ball hit the ground one gained points from the degree of difficulty of the strokes one performed while one had the ball simbal watching the chinlon game felt sorry for the kid it was a close game and now he was out of contention for the lead then he realized that it was really himself for whom he was feeling sorry i noticed threnody said evenly that you havent said youre out of your mind yet simbal said the kid rattled by his mistake let the ball slip off the side of his foot it bounced in the dirt and a hooting went up now hed have no chance at all what makes you suspect rodger quite simply it begins and ends with a painting threnody said except that its far from simple i dont understand do you recall the painting donovan put up in his office when he took over as director of the quarry sure its a seurat simbal said bringing to mind the conversation hed had with donovan but its only a copy says who donovan then hes a liar threnody said its the genuine article i hope to god you dont suspect him because its too expensive for a man on a governmental salary to have simbal said donovan comes from money threnody waved a hand in the air of course not money has nothing to do with it the thing is ive seen that painting before years ago i was stationed in paris even then i was hot on the impressionists i haunted the galleries museums and auctions my god idve sold my soul to go to just one more that was the only time i cheated on the service even in the middle of the business day id sneak off to any art auction i could get to thats where i saw this seurat it was sold at auction sold to a beautiful woman with stormy gray eyes and thick honeycolored hair i remember her well for a number of reasons i wanted that seurat but i am not like your friend donovan i did not come from a monied family i didnt go to the right schools he laughed a little but there was a tinge of something dark there as well perhaps regret i was born on the wrong side of the tracks i could only look longingly at the daughters of the boston brahmins and wonder what it was that made them superior to me and my old man of course in a law office on the hill you never came home with a face black with coal dust and hands so callused by manual labor they looked like rhinoceros horn but by the time i got out of college i knew my painters and by god i loved that seurat i coveted it even though there was no way i could have afforded it so instead i concentrated on the buyer the blonde the blonde threnody affirmed then i got interested in her for another reason i recognized the face id been doing some extracurricular research in regard to an operation that was getting somewhat strange the russians were apparently involved more specificially the kgb which is where threnody said id come across that face the seurat had been bought by a kgb lieutenant by the name of daniella vorkuta down below the moths were batting themselves to death in the lightedup square the kids should have been hoarse by now with all the shouting but the noise like the energies involved seemed indefatigable looking down there simbal saw that the kid who had made the two miscues had rebounded and was in the forefront of the pack again he wished that he was that young and resilient again thats the sum of what you have on rodger he asked after a time that he has a seurat that you saw purchased by a kgb lieutenant years ago in paris at the same time rodger donovan was there threnody said i did some subsequent checking lieutenant daniella vorkuta was in paris on recruitment assignment her official title then was second cultural attache so she moved in some highpowered circles and the seurat threnody shrugged recruits like to be romanced its part of the game they all want something tangible the first time out its like testing the water seeing how warm and inviting it is the seurat was most likely a gift some gift a measure of how important donovan could be to them threnody reached into a pocket withdrew a sweatdarkened envelope and believe me he lived up to his potential tony its all in there copies of blown operations crucial intelligence leaked its all very cleverly worked out of course simbal looked down at the envelope threnody had placed on the table why hasnt he been caught before this threnody shrugged what would you have me say tony were stupid all of us in every service we stumble blindly on we all bungle things as is true in every bureaucracy we fuck up more things than we get right i admit i stumbled into this without the seurat thered be no suspicion at least not in donovans direction what do you want me to do in the square the game was over the kid simbal had been following had pulled it out his last three strokes blowing away all competition good for you simbal thought hes killing us tony threnody said hes sucking our blood like a goddamned vampire bleeding us dry it cant go on he must be terminated quickly efficiently discreetly the boy for whom simbal had been waiting had come he quickly threaded his way around the tables he came up to simbal and grinned he was from one of the mountain tribes near mogok where they mined the gemstones for which burma was so justly famous he looked into simbals face and grinned embedded into his front teeth were a heartshaped ruby the color of pigeon blood and a diamondshaped piece of mogaung imperial jade theyre on the move simbal said rising the boy had been watching the place where curran and bennett were holed up i gotta go to the shan threnody said thats where theyre headed simbal said ive no doubt threnody looked up at him he scooped up the envelope held it out hes a bad one tony the worst simbal with the kid pulling at his sleeve took the envelope ill take a look at what youve got there isnt much time what do you mean go on tony threnody said the shan is calling the land where god dwells far from where rodger donovan is thats part of the briefing the last part threnody said my people who are keeping tabs on donovan tell me hell be here in a matter of hours but why simbal asked that i dont know in fact i really dont care the important thing tony is for you to take immediate action i havent agreed to anything simbal said im here to track bennett and curran down do i have to say it again i dont work for you anymore its all there threnodys forefinger tapped the manila envelope rodger donovans a traitor tony a lot of people have died because of him threnodys gaze was steady you bring bennett and curran down god knows they deserve it it was a look simbal had seen before but its donovan that the president and i are concerned about now we want him gone it was the look threnody got when he had decided to take the leash off his bulldog and give him his head the old man had skin like gold leaf the sun and winds racing along the shan plateau had burnished him in precisely the same manner he burnished the products of his labor he was an artisan of the old school a burmese fast disappearing from even this remote sector of the country he was a master lacquerware maker he had been born in pagan where it was said his art traveled into burma sometime during the first century ad via chinese of the nanchao empire whose greatgreatgreatgrandchildren now inhabited yunnan nowadays the pearlgray liquid tapped from the thitsi tree in similar fashion to the way latex is extracted from the rubber tree was wrapped around wooden or bamboo frames this man still did his work the way his grandfather had using twists of horsehair as his base so that the finished product possessed a marvelously flexible quality jake spent some time squatting beside the old man he had brought with him two bottles of johnnie walker black and four cartons of american cigarettes which lay between the old mans legs the old man did most of the talking jake nodding and occasionally asking a question while he watched the ancient hands deftly molding the lacquer black when it combined with the atmosphere around the horsehair above the sky was the color of catseye great masses of cloud dimming out all blue perhaps it was all the foliage which turned the sky yellow or perhaps the dust along the plateau great wings hanging like gauze turned by an artists hand after a time jake stood up and went a little distance away from the end of the openair market where traditional plaid silk scarves and opium weights were displayed for sale in the shade of an overhanging tree bliss waited he knows jake said hes heard of chen ju although hes not known by that name here hes known as the naga very goddamned melodramatic the great serpent out of asian myth jake uncle tommy knows where to find the naga jake went on all burmese had american names and were known by them were not far its just about jake bliss took his arm led him around to the other side of the tree where they were screened from the villagers what is it since that night on my fathers junk you havent said a word about anything besides chen ju you havent slept youve eaten next to nothing you have a look in your eyes that frightens me its nothing as nothing as what happened at mckennas what about that you were never so callous never so i dont know maybe sadistic is the word i didnt enjoy what i did no she said perhaps not but perhaps you could have considered another alternative there was none i told you whiteeye kao was trained by a master if that were truly the case he would have died rather than reveal anything jake watched her for a time he was aware of the women in longyi their faces roughly painted with pale yellow pigment they watted upon the old man as if he were the buddha himself what are you saying i am saying nothing bliss said steadfastly ever since they had come here she had gotten the impression that jake was spoiling for a fight what i am asking you to do is consider the possibility that whiteeye kao told you just what he was ordered to tell you chen ju wants me here perhaps yes but why jake asked it makes no sense to lead me to where he is far better for him to attempt to take over interasia by proxy as he is doing he is afraid of you she said here he can destroy you so much more easily than in hong kong and there is no one to make an inquiry its stupid jake insisted and chen ju is not stupid he had continued to watch her and now he caught something in her expression that he could not let go unless you know something that i dont bliss turned away how to tell him about what had happened with his father how to prepare him for dahei i and then she shut her mouth she knew with a terrible sinking feeling that there was no way to prepare him for what she had to tell him but why shouldnt he understand how many times had she seen him slip into bamahk wasnt dahei similar youve changed he said as have you i hope you still remember what it was like when we were together something she said pierced him like an arrow and he let go of her sliding until he was crouched down his back against the bole of the tree bliss knelt beside him jake she said what is it i dont know she knew it for a lie and foolishly told him so before she thought about it you know everything now dont you he flared you knew when whiteeye kao was lying and when he was telling the truth now you have divined a change in me what else do you know that you arent telling me bliss could have bitten her tongue for saying what she had dont you have it backward she said softly it is you who can divine the truth with bamahk you no what i no longer possess the ability to enter into bamahk his face was in shadow but she did not need to see his expression to hear the bitterness in his voice is that what its all about he turned to her is it so little she put her arm through his now you sound like a small boy who has lost his favorite teddy bear i feel like a man suddenly gone blind she said nothing for a time but took his hand in hers she made certain that their fingers twined together they watched the restless clouds piling up like dirty linen until the yellow sky beyond was entirely obscured in a moment there was a dull boom of faroff thunder but it seemed to go on forever did it ever frighten you jake what bamahk the power not so much that the insight the intimations she put both her hands around his the connection to another world i only ever saw it as power he said thats the difference between us she thought perhaps she said carefully that is why you miss it so he turned to her what do you mean bamahk it seems to me was a great deal more than power jake disentangled himself from her held out his hands look at this he said theyre shaking it was bamahk that kept me safe through it i could determine strategies i knew instinctively what was the right step to take and where there was danger and now now i have nothing jake said he ran his hands through his thick hair there is nothing between me and death bliss was glad that she had not told him what had happened with his father she had believed perhaps so much in shi zilin that she had convinced herself that the old man somehow knew of jakes loss of bamahk that his qi merging with hers was meant as an aid to his only remaining son in this moment of jakes agony she saw what it was jake had to do and she knew that she could not overtly help him he was like a child who carries his beloved teddy around with him for years and years even when it begins to wear out shred and fall apart the teddy bear the child believed kept him safe from harm especially when he ventured out into the frightening world away from home but eventually the bear was gone and the child had to adjust to believing in his own inner power to keep him psychically safe from harm this was the point at which jake now stood poised perhaps she thought fo saan had not done him a favor by teaching him bamahk one needed a full understanding of such an extension of qi in order to cope with it while it was available and to do the same when it was gone if you cannot trust in yourself jake she said how can you expect anyone else to you are the zhuan how much truly rests upon your shoulders i think only you know a young girl with the face of an angel stopped several meters away like her elders she was painted with powdered thanaka bark and her long hair was pinned back from her face with a red clip fashioned into a starshaped flower i dont think you understand jake said slowly and i suppose i only have myself to blame for that i feel as if i have lost something more than just bamahk bliss i feel as if i have lost a part of myself as well but wasnt bamahk a part of you the girl was staring openly at them she put a fingertip in her mouth and sucked on it as if it were a stalk of sugar cane there is a void inside me he said that is more than bamahk but what she wasnt staring at them jake saw now but at something quite close to them it was just beyond blisss right shoulder out of his sight now the girl began to cry if i knew that he said id know everything but his mind was on the girl and what was making her cry she took one step backward and on her face jake could see the desire to flee but she was caught somehow her eyes fascinated fascinated bliss jake said softly dont move he could feel the tension come into her body almost immediately what is it just do as i tell you he said in her ear all right he could see her face now only at the periphery of his vision jake what it is dont move i said he hissed he had to hold her tight because her head had begun that involuntary motion that the body required when it sensed it was in danger will you do as i tell you yes he could hear the fear edging close to the surface good now listen to me in a moment i am going to move when i do i want you to do nothing do you understand absolutely nothing you are not to move clear yes jake no time he said shortly im going and leapt over her kicking out and down hard his heel smashing the body of the serpent into the hard cracked earth it was this that had attracted and frightened the little girl nothing else in the countryside would have engendered such a response in a child of the hill tribes the adder whipped around and jake caught it just behind the head still holding it with his heel he reached down and gripped the body with his other hand it was a mweboai burmas deadliest viper it was so dangerous not only because of its lethal venom but because it was prone to unprovoked attacks on beast and man alike he heard blisss gasp and knew that she had turned at last the mweboai hissed and jake tramped heavily on its head there was the sound of bones breaking as jake crushed its skull the body perhaps five feet in length whipped back and forth and jake let it go the child crying in earnest now was rooted to the spot jake left the twitching snake and crouched down beside the girl he began to talk gently to her and then as she put her head into the hollow of his shoulder he picked her up took her over to where the mweboai lay now quite still jake still talking quietly to her took her tiny hand in his own together they reached out she gave a little yelp as she saw them nearing the dead serpent but jake forced her to touch it so that she could feel for herself that its power to hurt was gone forever bad thing she said in the accent of the hill tribes and jake laughed saying yes bad thing he took his hand away and the child kept hers on the snakes back her small fingers traced the slick cool scales but she kept clear of the mashed head that lay halfdriven into the compacted ground when at last he began to stand she crawled up him wrapping her arms around his neck he lifted her and walked back to the shade of the tree where bliss was waiting for him i hope you understand she said what you possess that keeps you safe from harm jake watched the child as she lay cradled in his lap those bright black eyes stared up at him unblinking now unafraid you did not become aware of the snake through bamahk bamahk did not allow you to kill it before it bit me no he said and she could hear the bitterness welling up from the depths of him but my father is dead becausebecause i lost the ability to see ahead i was lured away from the junk at just the time when the dantai was set to arrive bamahk would have revealed that to me instead emotion constricted his throat the burmese girl made a sound in her throat and reached upward with the tip of her finger she took the tear standing at the corner of jakes eye let it roll into her palm bad thing gone she said bad thing dead bliss wondered at the amount of human compassion in that young mind jake felt it too he leaned over and kissed the child on her forehead when he lifted his head his lips were coated with her thanaka bark makeup she giggled unselfconsciously and jake laughing too squeezed her tight i wish bliss thought with a touch of envy that i could make him laugh like that but the child cannot see how wrapped up in guilt he is so it cannot affect her the loss inside jake was not only that the lack of bamahk had made him in a very real sense blind but that having been reunited with his father only months ago he was now alone again jake his head back against the tree said maybe you and your father are right you both think im walking into a trap what difference has that made to you bliss asked it was a loaded question and they both knew it jake sighed in japan i discovered that the dantai sent to assassinate my father was composed of members of the moro clan mikios rivals no that was the interesting part mikios battle is with the kisan clan jake pulled his knees up making a more comfortable cradle for the child we penetrated to the core of the moro clan hige moro told me that my fathers death was requested and paid for by a chinese communist minister named huaishan han that seems improbable bliss said since when do the japanese underworld and the communist chinese make their beds together never jake admitted at least not that ive ever heard of then hige was lying perhaps but his tone suggested that he did not believe it and if not how would it make sense were here jake said in the shan were on the mountain by the way he spoke she knew that he was working it out as he went along i asked hige the question he said he had made a mint for his clan by dealing with this particular minister did your father ever mention his name no but hige mentioned the mountain i asked him why he was being paid all this money and he said only the mountain knows jakes head came down his hooded copper eyes searching her face i wonder if it was the shan that he meant you mean the tears of the poppy jake nodded maybe but the communist chinese are set foursquare against its growing harvesting and distribution a good part of the yearly disbursement to the army is to cover the shan through yunnan province the poppy generals encounter constant harassment from chinese communist army forays into the fields then it is a false lead jake watched the shadows creeping over her face the planes dells and hillocks of her physiognomy were turned by his minds eye into the topography of a strange and alien place he knew they were in enemy territory in more ways than one now whiteeye kao tells us that though he ostensibly works for sir john bluestone he has been trained by chen ju chen ju is behind the takeover raid on interasia and so is bluestone so we know that the two have formed a partnership yet chen ju has a spy in his partners employ interesting no what kind of a partnership could that be obviously not one filled with trust no jake agreed at least not on the part of chen ju but then he would hardly be likely to trust anyone where does all this lead us back to the shan jake said that is the interesting part the shan is the common denominator in all of this my fathers murder the run on interasia chen jus scheme of revenge who is this minister huaishan han bliss asked i wish i knew jake said that might go a long way toward solving this mystery i wonder what could bring together chen ju huaishan han hige moro sir john bluestone and daniella vorkuta there are a number of natural enemies there bliss pointed out thats what makes this so puzzling jake said and frightening what is their common goal it cant be the destruction of the yuhnhyun as i had originally thought these sharks would rip each other to shreds going for the spoils no it is something else entirely something of which we are not yet aware the sun so long obscured by the roiling clouds was gone beyond the mountains the shadowless light was gone too replaced by an odd illumination that was entirely reflected off the base of the cloud bank but the heat had not dissipated any and the insects buzzing was very loud what if it is you bliss said in an ominous tone what if that is their goal from the shan i hardly think so this is the one place where your death would go unnoticed she repeated and perhaps unavenged he watched her carefully youd like me to say okay lets get out of here lets go back to hong kong frankly yes bliss admitted but i know thats fruitless i know you wont turn back now youre right but i wonder why something crosses my mind but i hope im wrong which is that youve got a death wish jake looked down at the shan girl her eyes were half closed mariana used to say that about me my first wife as well does that mean theres something to it jake heard the tension in her voice i dont think so he said then why are you out here in the middle of a red sector is it to protect interasia the yuhnhyun your fathers dream theyre one and the same jake said yes no she said so vehemently she woke the girl its to assuage your guilty conscience your mind insists that you are to blame for your fathers death that somehow if you still possessed bamahk you could have deflected the dantais attack the fact is that with bamahk or without it the result would have been the same joss jake why dont you listen to your chinese side a little more often accept your fathers fate i know he did joss that he was killed joss that you were miles away when it happened do you think bamahk would have allowed you to dispatch the tick that was following you any quicker do you think you would have ignored her and allowed her to follow you back to the junk where you father was waiting for you jake said nothing but he knew what the answers were she was right bamahk would have altered nothing his father was dead joss he looked down at the small face in his lap the child was sleeping contentedly a little fist had grabbed hold of his shirt for security staring into that beautiful painted face he felt an exquisite pang of longing and grief funny what you think of at certain times he said softly i miss my daughter now more than i ever did when she was alive and living with that rogue triad up near the border he looked away from the childs sleeping face to blisss the most painful memory i have of her is also the truest it was she who had a death wish bliss lan my only child in a moment there were more tears than the burmese girl could ever hope to wipe away hes on his way chen ju was jubilant he had just taken off the earphones shut down the powerful transceiver huaishan han he said i have just heard from whiteeye kao shi jake is coming just as you planned he stopped at the open doorway to the room he could see the humped sprawl of the old minister in the dusty rattan chair at his feet the girl knelt they were holding hands perhaps they were asleep it was an odd symbiotic relationship the old man had with the girl did she love him hate him or fear him chen ju wondered perhaps it was a combination of all three certainly her brainwashing had turned her into another person but who knew really what she was capable of doing now she was the vehicle of huaishan hans revenge jake maroc shis daughter and what was his own vehicle no single human being but rather a shanthe implacable mountain an international organization that had taken decades to build into the most powerful smuggling network in the world chen ju would rather put his faith in the grinding jaws of his diqui than in the workings of one psyche that his dismissal from sawyer sons had become the single most fortuitous event in his life in no way mitigated his desire for justice to be done he had turned a devastating blow into something positive that was his genius but it did not excuse the wrong that had been done him it had in fact been three oaths tsun who had given him the idea before being brought to sawyer sons for employment by shi zilin three oaths tsun had been the finest runner of the tears of the poppy in the shanghai area the money he had made on the periphery of the business was astounding how much more could be made chen ju had thought at the very center of the opium trade all the world would be knocking on his door thus the diqui had been born and with huaishan hans aid had flourished yet even this was not enough for chen ju he wanted more he wanted the world and now with the help of the two americans bennett and curran he was going to get it it was amazing the difference it made daniella thought with the knowledge of carelins baby inside her nothing else seemed quite as important certainly not oleg malutas threats against her it astounded her how much power an unborn creature could possess the gun wrapped in its poly bag so as not to smudge her incriminating prints seemed as distant and unimportant to her as the far side of the sun with the future in mind she picked up the phone and made a date to pick maluta up after work a concert and then a late dinner she proposed he seemed delighted she dismissed both their chaikas telling the drivers to take a night off they were used to such things but were grateful nonetheless there was nothing so debilitating for a military man as to wait around doing nothing at days end daniella signed out for a departmental volga she had phoned down to reserve early that afternoon she had one of her people purchase tickets for the beethoven quartet they arrived at the hall of the gnesin music institute on vorovsky street five minutes before the concert was scheduled to begin if maluta was surprised at being driven by daniella in the volga he made no mention of it perhaps he was just as happy that they were alone the concert might have been played by four pigs for all the music that penetrated daniellas consciousness she stared at the vaulted groined ceiling and it was like peering into the convolutions of her own brain she felt as if she had lost all sense of herself as if her heart had stopped beating without her knowledge and now she stood breathless staring at the wreckage life had wrought she watched synapses spark and snap and on stage spotlights were brought to bear upon the musicians and that light reflecting off their precious instruments sent jeweled flashes upward onto the faceted ceiling the massive crystal chandelier that glowed like a star at intermission daniella felt that she was walking through her life like an automaton the dazed survivor of a ship dashed against hidden shoals her homeland always so dear to her now seemed nothing more than a cleverly rendered stage set upon which she had been playing out a bizarre and totally inexplicable role she wondered what it was that she had been doing all her days and how in the name of god it had ever made her happy in fact she realized dully she had no real conception of what true happiness was or how to do so basic a thing as live up until now she had been doing nothing but surviving her life had been a daytoday struggle for power an endless agon from which there could be no surcease how pitiful that seemed in the face of the kind of love she felt for mikhail carelin maluta spoke to her but she had no conception of what he was saying it was as if she had lost the ability to understand the language as if she were some cosmic cinder floating in the vastness the utter blackness of space cut off from everyone and everything daniella yes eyes closed against the bright light a sun blazing the chandelier lit up it must be intermission the concert is over yes it is time to go it is time to go his words echoed eerily in her mind as if he had spoken them in a cavern or perhaps from the recesses of a church it was not surprising that she should think of her mother at this time religion had played such a strong though clandestine part in daniellas formative years it was something that never left her though she could not as a member of the sluzhba go near a church still she could not help but worship in her mind and hold the precepts of her mothers religionand in a very real sense her owndear it is time to go she rose bidden by a voice inside her own mind in the giltandcream lobby she caught sight of a bleakfaced woman beautiful but drawn there was an expression in her clear gray eyes that daniella had seen many times before in the lubyanka always the interviews were completed and the prisoner was being sent down to level three the depths of the prison from which there was no escape with a start daniella realized that she was looking in a mirror the woman was herself with a little shake of her head she cleared her mind and pulling on her coat walked beside oleg maluta out into a night spangled with moscows streetlights the sky was clear and the breeze was freshening taking with it the choking diesel fumes and the plaster and cement dust when daniella suggested a stroll down by the moskva maluta was delighted they got into the volga and she drove to the spot where he had first taken her she remembered the cautionary tale he had told her about falling through the ice as a child and recognized it now for what it had been a warning he had survived that early disaster he could survive anything now in a way it had about it the aspect of a mystical experience almost as if there had been a kind of divine intervention on his behalf i am among the chosen he had been saying so be content to do my bidding it smacked of the almost supernatural quality he attributed to oreanda in a way he believed that she lived on after her death in the same way he was convinced that his being saved from drowning was fated they got out and went down the crusty scree to the glimmering river this time maluta reached back helping her past the several steep patches where shale was easily sheered off by the weight of a human body daniella he said but she already had hold of him and kicking out dislodged his footing from the mossy rocks along the bank he fell with a great exhalation of air and she quickly jammed an elbow into his solar plexus as his knees rose up in spasmodic response she shoved him out along the rocks and down until his head and shoulders were beneath the chill water her fingers closed around his neck and chin trapping him there without air moonlight glimmered along the moskva she could see traffic moving as slowly as molten lead across the expanse the sound of a klaxon littered the air for a time and with great reluctance died away he was struggling very hard and she climbed on him to keep his powerful legs from working himself upward into the cool night air she did not want that did not want him to get even one small breath she did not want him to be able to use his superior strength against her it was getting very difficult now and she kneed him in the groin she could imagine the airless dark which he was inhabiting could imagine his lungs desperate for oxygen the reflexes wanting to open the mouth to inhale through the nostrils only the brain holding out desperately seeking some way to be rid of the water but there was no way daniella made certain of that and after a time there was no movement at all she found herself wet with sweat her vision was blurry so perhaps she had been weeping without taking his head out of the moskva she felt with her hands for the chain and the key around his neck when she found it she pulled and it came away in her hands then she set about making quite sure oleg malutas body would never surface when she was through she pushed him in wading out until the water lapped at her thighs it was cold and she shivered heavily he sank like a stone which at this point was what mostly he was made of for just an instant the moonlight glistened off his still face then he was gone claimed at last perhaps by his oreanda and his guilt in the shadows of the night she let herself into the office she could smell him immediately his malign presence dominated the suite like the stench in a crematorium maluta she went immediately behind the desk and sat in his chair took the key she had ripped from his neck and opening the bottom drawer unlocked the steel case inside and there it was with a trembling hand she lifted out the poly bag she recognized the gun inside the oil had slicked the inside of the plastic beneath the gun was the packet of photos of her weeping in the night she pulled the steel case out of the drawer set fire to the negatives using the case to contain the flames putting the gun inside her purse she was about to leave when she saw the corner of an envelope wedged into the corner of the now empty drawer she pulled on it but it would not budge looking around the desk she seized on malutas brass letter opener and with some effort wedged it into the seams at the bottom of the drawer it took her several minutes of intense work but at last she freed the envelope from its hiding place she slit it open there were four sheets of flimsy upon which were typed in single space a detailed breakdown of profits expenses percentages and the like as if for some business but the figures were gargantuan when daniella got to the mandarin word diqui she knew she was on to something very big indeed with every sentence she read she felt her excitement building no longer were her thoughts filled with home and hearth with love and an idyllic future that deep down she had known could never happen now the old the true daniella perhaps reasserted itself she felt the power flowing from the few flimsy sheets of paper into her hands knew with a certainty that was undeniable what it meant it was as if fate had drawn her here causing her to make this astounding discovery it was as if fate had handed her back her power the power she was meant to wield so be it she knew what she must do she breathed in the darkness the aura of strength in the office that had at last delivered up to her its ultimate secret if there was a god then surely he hardened her heart now held within the silence of the night she braced herself for what was to come and found to her surprise that it was not that difficult to do the storm was at their backs when they plunged back into the triplecanopied jungle the shan states off the plateau it was enemy territory a full red sector it was the killing ground from which fo saan had taught jake there could be no retreat before them lay only victory or defeat it is determination which wins many battles fo saan had said and determination is strictly a matter of force of will often the outcome of a contest is not decided by the first strategy or even by the third rather endurance is involved force of will is endurance if you do not lose your sense of self you will endure and your power will not wane on the contrary it will endure even after your body has wasted away jake and bliss were following the directions given to them by uncle tommy the master lacquerware maker but even so it was most difficult for one thing the terrain was unknown to them and its density tiring to work through without a compass they would have been lost within a few hours for another the farther they penetrated up the mountain the more frequently they were obliged to hide from units of the poppy warlords independent armies patrols heavily armed supply trains and going in the opposite direction the mule trains loaded down with the tears of the poppy there were the patrols of the burmese and chinese armies to be on the lookout for as well this is not a country jake thought as they moved with almost painful slowness this is a war zone they had set out from the plateau village at first light by noon they had covered six hardwon kilometers and were forced to take a break they ate dried foods and washed the unpalatable stuff down with clear icy water from a swiftly running stream jake staring into the silvery depths of the river found himself envying the ease with which the water flowed down the mountainside father he thought i am finally nearing the top of the mountain i hope i know what to do when i get there just before one they broke camp and reviewing again uncle tommys directions pushed onward into the forbidding jungle the towering foliage engulfed them completely they might have been on the bottom of the sea the light was entirely green with an odd kind of luminosity aqueous and heavy so that they felt weighed down by it above their heads birds screamed and cried taking wing now and again with a noise that echoed through the jungle insects were everywhere of every description size and color but as they rose in elevation their profusion diminished uncle tommy had told them to look out for snakes and leopards twice they had caught sight of monkeys but soon they were too high for many of these primates who seemed to prefer the warmer weather on the plateau it was pouring so hard now that even the branches of the lowest trees were turned to a pale green haze they were soaked through their jackets and bliss began to shiver they crossed a crude rope bridge beneath which one of the many magnificent shan valleys spread out furry with rain just beyond they came upon a rough dirt track chopped into the jungle the troddendown ferns on either side attested to the constant use it got jake on the lookout for soldiers pressed them on he was seeking some kind of shelter now this was no weather for a prolonged trek perhaps a halfakilometer on they came upon a bamboo latticework shack two crude steps led up to a kind of overhang that could be called a veranda in only the loosest sense jake suspected that there must be more houses in the immediate vicinity but with the heavy weather it was impossible to see more than a meter in any direction he took bliss up the steps a young boy no more than eleven emerged from the gloom inside the hut he had a beautiful face with the typically blemishfree burmese skin this high up its golden hue had been burnished copper by sun and scouring winds his forearms and upper torso were covered with tattoos he smiled when he saw them started to chatter in a dialect neither of them understood jake spoke to him in mandarin and he pointed inside jake took bliss into the hut the overpowering sweet musk of opium pervaded the air and in the twilight they could make out an old man he was turbaned sitting crosslegged on a mat in one corner he was smoking and when he saw them he lifted a languid hand beckoning them forward he offered them opium a gesture of friendship and hospitality in this part of the world he took up a piece of sticky black substance rolled it between his thumb and forefinger until it formed a ball then he popped it into the small bowl of his longstemmed ivory pipe as he passed it around jake could see that despite the chill he wore only a loincloth his thighs and the backs of his hands were tattooed in the same repeating pattern as the boy it obviously had ancestral significance the boy was nowhere in the hut and jake rose moving silently to the open door he looked outside the world was a teeming mass of graygreen the rain hissed down running in muddy rivulets there was no other sound in the world he was turning back inside when a rift appeared at the periphery of his vision it darkened as it widened and before he could make another move more than a dozen shan tribesmen appeared through the mist and downpour they were armed with ak machine guns soviet weapons all were pointed in his direction standing in the doorway totally vulnerable he made no move at all in a moment the party of shan moved aside a tall lanky figure towered over them to such an extent that jake knew it was caucasian even before the face become visible a paleeyed man with the ruddy complexion of the true outdoorsman it was an american face not a russian well tony simbal said striding up the steps to where jake stood what do we have here maroc he said by christ jake maroc simbal leaned against the bamboo wall outside rain thundered against the ground like a military drumroll youre the guy who got the mole henry wunderman jake watched him from where he stood near the door bliss was still sitting next to the old man who blithely continued with his smoking as if nothing out of the ordinary were occurring one good sign none of the shan tribesmen had come inside but the boy was here jake assumed that it was he who had gone to fetch tony simbal with news of the strangers arrival secrets stole across the floor white wraiths as insubstantial and hallucinatory as the opium smoke the old man was inhaling rodger tried to recruit you again didnt he if you mean rodger donovan jake said the answer is yes why didnt you accept there it was jake thought the suspicion im done with that he said but youre here simbal pointed out you and i in the same spot on the globe i hardly think thats coincidence how long are you working for donovan jake asked months simbal said but he and i go way back we went through high school and college together stanford boys thats right hes going to be no help at all jake thought a company man and worse arent clubs thicker than blood in some circles you worked for donovan a long time worked with him jake corrected i worked for henry wunderman for a long time the mole simbal said daniella vorkutas swift sword bliss listening to the two of them as well as watching knew what was going on these were more than two males sparring for dominance of territorial rights the feint and jab of the questioning held reverberations far beyond the ordinary conversation both were trying to probe for certain answers without revealing their own secrets perhaps it was she who first realized that what each was concealing was the same so it seemed jake said meaning jake moved around the room it was getting damp so near the doorway it was also disconcerting to see the shan squatting in the storm eyes on the hut he knew the meaning of that display he knew who was ultimately in control of this situation there were too many aks for any one man henry was an old hand recruited by antony beridien himself the man who with john kennedys blessing created the quarry correct me if im wrong simbal said but beridien recruited rodger as well at another time jake said from another place the old guard always resents the presence of the new yes jake admitted thats true enough there was no love lost between henry and rodger did you take sides i was far away jake said from it all office politics never interested me i was always a field executive but yes henry recruited me he came to hong kong and took me off the streets i was running for the triads doing odd jobs none of them very savory jake looked at simbal through the smoke in a way henry wunderman saved my life killing him must have been a sad affair it was difficult sad yes he thought that was exactly what it was he paid more attention perhaps he thought there is more to this man than i had thought which was just what simbal had on his mind everyone at central is very grateful to you for what you did especially rodger i imagine so jake said carefully especially donovan you dont like him i dont like what he represents simbal was very still he could hear the rasping breath of the old man as he sank further and further away from them which is what the old ways are the best ways not precisely jake said i recall that one of the old mans watchwords was change beridien felt that flexibility in a network such as the quarry was essential he was convinced that the kgbs major defect was that it never changed invalid thinking he called it jake pronounced it with the emphasis on the first syllable its more donovans attitude that i dont like the old man thought about his people he could be ruthless and i suppose at times even cruel but through it all his heart beat for his field executives he was once with wild bill donovan he knew what it was like rodger donovan hasnt a clue what its like out here but hes smart simbal said smarter than any of us thought that could be true simbal admitted coming to a decision he pulled out a sheaf of papers take a look at these jake riffled through the flimsies that max threnody had given simbal what are they bliss wanted to know evidence jake said proof that someone has been systematically blowing quarry networks to the kgb then apollos for real bliss said jake looked up it would appear so apollo simbal said henry wundermans legacy jake told him a deep asset inside the kremlin my asset now simbal produced a photo this was with the evidence he handed it over its a surveillance shot of daniella vorkuta jake said right simbal sighed when we were younger rodger was hung up on a girl in college leslie she and daniella vorkuta could easily be sisters thats how donovan was recruited through daniella vorkuta her and a seurat in paris simbal said it seems so yes he gave jake an odd look it occurs to me now that if apollo really was wundermans asset hedve known that wunderman could not have been chimera jake nodded thats true enough then this evidence can be corroborated by another source it already has jake confirmed then max wasnt lying simbal thought and then can i trust this man hes exquarry does he still hold a grudge for his abrupt dismissal threnody had called simbal a paladin and now he recognized in this man standing before him a kind of kindred spirit but donovan cant be why youre here now jake said no simbal admitted it was easier this way he was not yet certain what he would do when he met up with rodger donovan im after the end product of two voodoo spooks peter curran and edward martin bennett theyve sold out joined the diqui now theyre set to meet the naga were here to find the naga jake said hes set out to destroy me my work and everything my father built bliss was by his side staring into his face chen ju whos chen ju simbal interrupted the naga the head of the diqui he was incredulous you know who he is yes jakes voice was hoarse as if he had been screaming for hours my father my family knows him he wiped at his face it all boils down to kam sang my fathers secret you see kam sang is a nuclear project in guangdong province ostensibly work is being done there on a radical way to desalinize water in a costeffective way for hong kong but there is another far more secret side to kam sang it is a discovery that my father told me had already changed the world until this moment i did not truly understand how irrevocably it had been changed in the ringing silence the noise of the rain reverberated eerily through the smokefilled house repository for dreams of faith and now abruptly of fear daniella vorkuta hugged the honeycolored rabbit to her breast its shining brown eyes stared up at her with an inherently adoring expression hes perfect mikhail carelin said he was obviously anxious to leave daniellas lips pressed inward in a pout how do you know its a he i think its a she fine he said shes perfect buy her i dont know martinas particular about her animals your uncle vadims grandchild is going to be seven isnt that what you told me how particular could she be daniella put the rabbit back among her sisters and they moved on it was not so easy they were in detsky mir childrens world what was renowned throughout the soviet union as the largest childrens department store in the world it seemed more crowded than lenins tomb unarguably the most popular tourist attraction the entire country had to offer its damned hot in here danushka carelin said i hope were not going to spend all morning looking he had more time to spend with her now that his wife had gone to visit her mother in leningrad when i find martinas gift ill know it immediately she said personally i liked the rabbit because it was the easy thing she said lightly taking his arm no i quite fancied her face i could see her whiskers twitch she laughed her eyes scanning the counters on either side of the aisles you know she said sometime later after running the daunting gantlet of the stores stock you were right and led him back to the counter full of honeycolored rabbits she picked up the stuffed creature how do you know your cousin will like it carelin asked daniella stared into the rabbits face she could not tell him that this rabbit was for her unborn baby that she had wanted him here with her this one last time so that together they would choose a creature that eventually the baby would come to love and by which daniella could someday recall this moment encysted within time free of anger rancor or regret take her he said shes perfect daniella produced her party card and received immediate service while the rabbit was being gift wrapped she opened her purse and took out a square manila envelope she handed it wordlessly to carelin he glanced at her then opened it cautiously good god he said softly he flipped through the photos feeling a sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach it was disorienting seeing himself and daniella in intimate embrace he too was drawn to the facial expressions his embarrassment was acute when he came to the last one he said where are the negatives i burned them daniella said paying for the rabbit how did you manage that dont ask danushka i want to know now he sounded like maluta trust me you dont how did you get these steal them hardly she said taking possession of the bulky beribboned box he gave them to me something serious had to have happened for maluta to just hand them over to you he thinks im cute daniella he went after her as she began to walk away he hates your guts she said nothing he took her elbow turned her to face him the crush of shoppers pushed them quite close and daniella was obliged to switch the package from one arm to another i want to know why abruptly she felt put upon why must you know everything do you tell me everything yes of course youre a liar she said hotly how do you expect me to put my trust in a liar i dont understand she put her head closer to his i know mikhail do you understand i know who you are what are you talking about stop it she snapped lets get out of here abruptly the huge store with its surging crowds was making her feel claustrophobic she took him to the hermitage garden along karetny ryad because it was less crowded than gorky park at this time of the year she had had enough of crowds they sat on a woodandironwork bench near the openair puppet theater it was near dinnertime gray squirrels scampered down the boles of oak and beech trees to sit near them hoping for scraps nearby pigeons waddled pecking now and again at nothing at all the sound of childrens laughter was strong on the air and unconsciously daniella touched the firm roundness of her lower belly imagining the little life growing there she had almost broken down and cried at childrens world all the toys all the children running pointing laughing wanting she felt a longing deep inside her large fleecy clouds drifted above their heads and there was only the occasional rumble of the large diesel trucks what will you do now that you know he did not look at her i want you to understand something mikhail she said deliberately maluta is no longer a factor in anything i do or say he looked at her do i have to guess at what that means i think you already know she said simply how did you find out about me mitre signaled me he knew that mitre was her code name for sir john bluestone there was no reason not to tell him now you were blown somewhere in hong kong a little girl came racing by her arms stretched out to grab the tail of the dog that raced barking happily just in front of her her cheeks were red her eyes wide with delight tell me carelin said envying the girls innocence do you love me his back was ramrod straight he knew that it would be many years before that girl would have to ask such a question have you ever loved me i think she said that is a question that we are better off not asking one another daniella he said seriously i dont believe that i have sinned it is importantessential eventhat you understand that do you hate russia so i hate what russia does to its people to all people it comes in contact with and russia is what russia does we have not come so far from stalin as we would like to believe we russians are very adept at selfdeception no more than any other people mikhail in that i think you are quite wrong our capacity for i will notwill notdebate the morality of this with you she said sharply it was my choice my decision only and i do not regret it he looked away for a moment at least very little of it to answer your question whatever you are has nothing to do with what i feel inside he looked down to see the smallcaliber pistol with its silencer pressed against his coat it was between them no one could see it but them daniella saw that his expression had grown sad is this how you disposed of comrade maluta this is the answer mikhail daniella said the only answer in the corners of her eyes liquid diamonds danced there are only lies between us and thats all there ever could have been lies are all that are allowed us in our profession we knew that when we chose to be who we are nothing can change that are you so certain he said i have the power now mikhail what deadly secrets maluta once possessedwhat made him rich what made him strongare mine so thats it he said softly you got more than the photos in the end you got everything he watched her eyes for signs of life and when he was certain that she would give him nothing he offered her all he had left you may know who i am he said but you know nothing of my final directive he looked from the pistol she held at his side to her face it was such a strong face he thought and thought again of circe the ancient sorceress out of greek mythology in whose image he felt she had been molded how well she had manipulated everything and everyone around her he marveled it was to terminate you danushka he saw the shock forming in her features and pressed home whatever advantage it might have given him what else would jake maroc want of me in a moment he rose goodbye koshka daniella watched him walk away wending his way past the running groups of whooping children whose nannies were vainly attempting to gather them up it was time to go home hours later she found herself in her office without having any idea of how she had gotten there she remembered her mother in just such a dazed state after she had been in an auto accident for a moment daniella wondered why she had come here instead of to her apartment then as if a veil had lifted from her consciousness she remembered she went to the window and looked out at the night stars spangled the heavens she felt somehow grateful that she was far enough from the center of the city to see those of first magnitude below them the dark mass of the forest blacker even than the night sky part of her wished that she could lose herself in that stygian maze she thought of the onion domes gleaming in the spotlights the crenellated walls within which crouched like a savage beast the power to change the world now she had within her grasp the means to tame that beast she turned and picked up the phone spoke into it for some time she thought she knew in which direction carelin would choose to flee he was heading for hong kong after all that much was obvious but even if he chose another route her people would intercept him she had faith in them one more thing lieutenant she said into the phone i want the traitor shot on sight terminated do you understand terminated at that moment she felt something that she could not possibly feel a stirring in her belly she gave a strangled little cry and put down the phone feeling as if she had come to the very edge of the world youre right simbal said into the silence kam sang is what it has been about from the beginning what do you mean jake asked kam sang was the reason donovan brought me into this two of his agents went underground in the diqui they were killed but just before that they managed to report to donovan that the diqui was interested in the kam sang project jake nodded thats why and now you know where donovans interest in kam sang comes from daniella vorkuta right jake said vorkuta again simbal shifted his position but what is it exactly that was discovered at kam sang the green bower dripped all around them the jungle weeping with moisture fell away from them in a hard line it devolved here and there as it descended in raggletaggle fashion into rocky scree upon which great black birds sat cawing theyalong with perhaps a score of shan warriorshad come some fifteen kilometers from the tiny village of the tribe loyal to simbal in that time they had ascended perhaps a further five hundred meters the air now had about it the tang of ozone that scoured the back of the throat and tended to sear the inside of the nostrils one had to be in good shape here or the relative scarcity of oxygen would inordinately tax the cardiovascular system were very near jake said according to uncle tommy the storm had not blown over merely seemed to be taking a breather but for now at least the air was calmer than it had been for the past twentyfour hours the two dozen or so shan soldiers were grouped loosely through the small clearing simbal had set guards every fifty meters at a onehundredmeter perimeter were into general kuos territory now he said wisely he saw no point in pressing the kam sang issue deeds not words he had learned in the shan were the only basis of trust hes the head man all over these parts he said very bad dude were going to have to go right down his throat then jake pointed assuming uncle tommy was giving me the straight goods through the dense foliage within which they crouched they could just make out patches of a structure looks like an opium factory jake said sniffing the air bingo maybe the biggest one in the golden triangle kuos the only one fanatic enough about security to keep his factory at his base of operations the other generals like to take it down the mountain before refining it simbal shifted his position we havent got the firepower you know he said kuos men will chew us up and spit us out i dont give a shit about general kuo jake said i wasnt thinking about taking your shan soldiers with me you mean just us dont you jake looked at him what did he really know about this man at the killing ground fo saan said trust no one thats entirely up to you jake said simbal waited a minute youre a hard one arent you what do you think youre trying to prove jake kept his eye on the opium factory it was important to get a sense of the minutetominute movement around the site youve got a bad attitude you know that simbal tore a bit of fern in two thats going to get you killed one of these days he jerked his head in blisss direction i hope youve provided for your lady love cause shes going to need some comfort after youre gone do you always talk so much only when i have something on my mind okay jake said youve done your duty feel better now that wasnt for me buddy simbal said it was for your benefit jake said nothing in five minutes he had counted no less than forty shan at the factory not a good sign what weve got to do jake said is find some way in and out of there simbal snorted how about a couple of pine boxes thats the only way were coming out of that fortress if you insist on doing a duo number unless maybe youve got a couple of those miniaturized nuclear warheads we could lob at them youd better go to a movie for that jake said were not likely to get any help here at that moment they heard voices raised quickly stifled they left their position went back through the jungle they saw a man standing on the periphery of their makeshift camp he wore a bush jacket over a buffalo plaid flannel shirt nike sweat pants and eddie bauer hiking boots on his head was the kind of expedition fedora harrison ford made famous in raiders of the lost ark bliss who had been given a spare ak from one of the shan had it trained on him i found him lurking in the underbrush she said when she heard them approach jesus simbal said what the hell are you doing here rodger there was no reason to let him know he had been expected rodger donovan put his hand out and gingerly pushed the muzzle of the submachine gun aside time for a little vacation from washington he said coming up to them turned his head hello jake i havent see you in a while he redirected his gaze the information you gave the cuban was quite detailed from that i gather you never expected me to make it out of my directors chair youre not a field man rodger simbal pointed out donovan frowned have i dressed wrong simbal laughed if only this were a movie set never mind that donovan said im here arent i now i want an update on the diqui he saw the look pass between jake and simbal i mustve missed plenty since youre here jake whats your interest in this what happened donovan jake said things get a little bit too hot for you back home meaning what meaning this simbal said thrusting the sheaf of incriminating evidence at him donovan took it and slowly went through the documents whats this supposed to be he said your epitaph jake told him he handed over the photograph gave a silent prayer that simbal would not get carried away and mention apollo donovan looked down at daniella vorkutas slightly blurred face not a very good likeness he said and you should know simbal said archly you know what your mistake was rodger hanging that damned seurat in the office if youd left it at home youd be okay now but max saw it and knew it for the real thing right off hed seen it before you see at an auction in paris he was there when it was sold to a kgb lieutenant named daniella vorkuta i see i see simbal cried is that all you have to say youre chimera jake said youre vorkutas mole you always were he was trembling visibly you set me up to kill henry my best friend my mentor you he leapt at donovan who threw up his hands to ward off the attack simbal jumped between the two turning toward jake pushing him back stop it he shouted jake that wont solve anything jake thought of the moment in time when he had first met henry wunderman the man had come to hong kong to seek him out tell me he had said why are you still on this rock running errands for the triads because im half chinese a very young jake had said and if you were fully chinese wunderman had asked id find a way to make the triads work for me wunderman had smiled suppose i can show you a way to do that he had said would you be interested jake sure was and then wunderman had said to him this also might be the way to find out what happened to your father wunderman had known that about him jakes secret desire theres henrys death to be accounted for jake said at length and your guilty conscience simbal said jake allowed himself to be pushed back he felt bliss at his side hes right jake she said sure simbal said a gleam in his eye now that we know about you rodger heres what were going to do with you were going to put you back in place as director of the quarry only now youll be running for us donovan grunted nice touch he said but someones already thought of that yeah simbal said like who donovan looked at him the president of the united states what he turned to jake i wasnt the one who set you and wunderman against one another and it wasnt daniella either though she thought it was it was the president i dont believe you jake said on the face of it i dont blame you donovan admitted but think about it for a minute what better way to cement my ties with daniella henry was a sacrifice jake said incredulously and i was the stalking horse that was it yes donovan said and who better than you jake daniella hates and fears you with you in the picture she never suspected a thing simbal thought about all this for a moment one thing doesnt make sense rodger if youre a triple working for the president how is it that max wants you dead so it was threnody who gave you this evidence donovan sighed i should have known hed get to you somehow you were always his fairhaired boy tony how he resented my taking you away from him im still getting interdepartmental memos about agency raiding come on rodger thats not what this is about simbal said skeptically in a way it is donovan said you see max wants my job hes got access to the president now himself well im sure he told you that its been maxs lifelong dream to get that kind of power what are you handing us jake said someone outside the quarry sphere would never have a chance its simply not the way things are done there donovan had a sad look in his eyes youve been away a long time jake it wouldntve been the way in the old days beridien never would have permitted it but hes long gone and times have changed the president needed to appoint someone unconnected with the quarry to head the inquiry into antony beridiens assassination he needed someone who commanded respect who had seniority he chose max threnody ever since max has been working on the president to have me replaced once exposed so intimately to the russians he maintains my loyalty remains suspect does max know about leslie simbal asked he seems to know bloody everything about me donovan said so there it is i had an affair with a kgb lieutenant in paris she looks amazingly like a girl i was hung up on in college max put two and two together you make it all sound very innocent simbal pointed out you cant tell me that you werent aware of what you were getting into i wanted her donovan said in a selfrighteous tone she knew all the right strings to pull you had no choice simbal said is that what you want us to believe donovan stared at them oh come on fake said donovan watched him wary for another attack he almost flinched when he said it shes beautiful sexy andtony youll understand thisso much like what leslie was in my mind i would have to have been inhuman to turn her down when did you start tripling jake asked now donovan averted his head the dripping of the water was a doleful sound not for a long time how long jake pressed jesus donovan said rodger youd better tell us simbal advised ive got orders from max to terminate you and jake would just as soon see you dead it sounds odd but at this stage were likely to be the only friends youve got donovan plucked the fedora off his head flung it into the jungle why the hell am i wearing that anyway one of the shan sentries retrieved it stuck it on his head he didnt look any more ludicrous than donovan had not until after after what jake said beridiens assassination ah shit jake said i should kill you right now you and vorkuta cooked that up donovan nodded silently rodger simbal said softly when max ordered me to terminate you he said that it was on the presidents authority i suppose he knew you were in no position to check donovan said meaning this is strictly internal the president wants the matter settled one way or the other wouldnt the president rather keep you in place as a triple agent simbal asked donovan nodded all things being equal but theyre not max has seen to that hes put a doubt in the presidents mind as to my loyalty so its between me and max donovan said a fight to the finish max wants me out any way he can he knows its not going to be easy but this was a perfect way i would have done the same thing whos going to conduct an official inquiry out here in gods boondocks he gave a dry ironic laugh the truth would never come out plus youd be tied to him forever if you managed to kill me hed have something on you for the rest of your life there was a defiant look in his eyes still want to go through with it simbal turned to jake what do you think is he lying or telling the truth theres one thing that bothers me jake said you said that threnody told you bennett and curran pickpocketed the dea computers of names places networks well theres something i can straighten you out on donovan said sometimes half a truth is the best lie there is what those bastards also took are all the strategic deployment directives for the presidents newly formed elite antiterrorist unit what am i missing jake wondered drugs and kam sang and the theft of antiterrorist directives ive got pieces but no whole nothing fits outwardly he showed nothing of his confusion simbal too had some hard thinking to do he recalled runrun yis words bennett is the jinn who opens the door with antiterrorist strategic deployment directives how these weapons yi had said will have the power to destroy the world blackman t antipersonnel rocket launchers how and again he thought what have i fallen into he felt like a rat in a darkened maze i dont know he said why would max lie to me about that max probably doesnt know donovan said hes the consummate bureaucrat tony you know that right now hes concentrating on getting me out of his hair any way he can theres too much at stake jake said to take either of these bastards at their word donovan looked at him i see i have more bargaining to do he nodded all right do you recall that henry wunderman had a deepcover asset codenamed apollo yes jake said he dared not glance at simbal he wanted to give donovan no clue at all daniella knows he exists and his identity she told you this jake said damping down on his anxiety she did whats his name what good would it do you tell me jake said and dont ask questions mikhail carelin dear god jake thought carelins a dead man when did she find out he asked we spoke before i left donovan said she had just gotten the intelligence jake what do you think simbal said is donovan telling the truth about everything jake asked himself or is he taking his own advice and feeding us half truths as lies if you believe me tony donovan said it means aligning yourself against max threnody i dont know whether youre prepared for that i want a chance to get to daniella vorkuta jake said donovans the only path that is he thought unless apollo can get to her before she kills him is it worth the risk simbal wondered aloud to get to the head of the kgbs first chief directorate jake said id mortgage heaven and hell simbal thought of max threnody of what he had done to monica to the cuban to simbal himself that was all part of the game in maxs book was this too just another ruse who was using him now max or rodger all right simbal said at last making his decision he called out softly and two of the shan came and took donovan youll be in their custody until this is all over rodger he said in the meantime dont do anything stupid and make us sorry we kept you alive the rain had come again the storm backing around from the south and sitting athwart the mountains banging on them like a gleeful child with a new set of drums from where jake and tony simbal crouched in the heavy undergrowth they could scent the opium cooking its stench permeated the heavy air hanging like pollution over the clearing their shan escort hidden from view was entirely silent around them if we can get to general kuo simbal said i think well have a chance of what jake asked of getting out alive simbal stretched a cramped muscle in his thigh i dont know about you friend but i have no death wish is that what you think i have if the shoe fits simbal shrugged dont worry jake said simbal shifted the aky on his lap he was checking its mechanism for the third time it was important to do that the combination of the atmosphere and the laxity of the shan in cleaning their weapons could be lethal jesus he laughed what the fuck do i have to be worried about jake thought about that for a time what do you suggest he said after a time you and i will go in all right simbal said but not until my shan have created a diversion at the other end of the compound that will do two things first it will draw general kuo out in the open where we have a chance of getting to him second it will keep his men busy while we try to find bennett and curran and chen ju jake said and chen ju for a long time jake watched the encampment at last he said i think you deserve to see the whole picture what the scientists at kam sang have come up with is a way to make a mobile nuclear warhead that can be slipped into existing weaponry such as handheld rocket launchers the project directors felt that what they had come up with was essentially useless since the radiation fallout resulting from the percussion would undoubtedly kill the initiating soldier as well as his target christ simbal breathed it had all come rushing in on him thats why the diqui have begun stockpiling blackman t antipersonnel rocket launchers with the kam sang payloads those ts will have the power to destroy the world what that was it the missing piece where did you hear that so this wasnt about drugs at all chen ju had a far different objective in mind jakes eyes bored into simbal from a man named runrun yi the diquis late new york boss late what happened to him edward martin bennett happened to him simbal said he recounted the incident at the trilliant thats chen jus strategy jake said so appalled that he felt sick to his stomach members of the diqui will be supplied with stockpiled blackman ts loaded with the miniature nuclear ammunition with the stolen information bennett and curran have provided them a single man could infiltrate any major american city hold it for ransom destroy half its population god in heaven simbal said knowing the antiterrorist directives he could make himself virtually invisible hed be unfindable jake nodded his mind was whirling with what they had uncovered the audacity of the man this is what chen ju is after much more than the destruction of the yuhnhyun he thought he will infiltrate city after city making his demands members of the diqui are fanatics death means nothing to them chen ju wants nothing less than the entire world its the ultimate stage of terrorism hes not going to sell this new technology to the highest bidder simbal asked i dont think so jake said simbal agreed hes changed the objective of the diqui from merely transshipping opium to disseminating the ultimate terrorist army with the technology from kam sang chen ju can hold the entire united states for ransom if he wishes and he does make no mistake jake said grimly but i think youre wrong on one point chen jus strategy for his diqui did not change at all i see that clearly now this is not something one just jumps into i think his little toy has grown up into this monstrous weapon jesus simbal whispered weve got to stop him lets get started simbal went off to give orders to his shan warriors when he returned he watched jakes profile for a time he thought hed give a great deal to know what was going on inside that mind the clocks ticking down he said eventually theyre all there the informations got to be changing hands he glanced down at his aky his hands had told him everything in place jake nodded the shan warriors had departed in absolute silence to take up their station simbal glanced at his wristwatch time he said together they broke cover general kuo first became aware of the attack through the bird call the sentries were well trained that was general kuos first rule sentries were imperative in his line of work wars had been lost because of lax sentries there were no lax sentries in general kuos army at least none who were still among the living the bird callone of his ideasgalvanized him it had come from the north and he stepped out onto the veranda of his house and shouted orders they were quick precise but unhurried precipitous action general kuo had been taught most often led to defeat he was further prepared for all eventualities he possessed a cool mind in all matters especially battle which he loved he did not know the identity of the enemy burmese chinese russian american even a ragtag army of one of his competitors it did not matter his response was the same victory was assured general kuo felt no anxieties in these situations but rather an odd kind of elation that was akin to a superbly sharp knife piercing the flesh close to his heart the thrill took his breath away strapping on his us armyissue colt he stepped off the veranda the northern perimeter of his encampment was where the mule trains departed for their trek down the shan to market loaded down with the processed opium it was most often here that attacks against him were begun the tears of the poppy were after all his lifes blood it was what they all desired no matter their nationality three of his men went trotting by and he shouted to them sending them off to the northeast perimeter no sense in taking chances he did not want to be enfiladed in defense general kuo believed it was better to err on the side of conservatism he went quickly in the opposite direction toward the factory it was where they all were huaishan han chen ju and the two americans they liked to talk business surrounded by their wares general kuo had discovered like the clusters of sapphires and rubies he kept in his pocket it gave them a physical sense of their own wealth it was a way of gaining face it could be no other way general kuo twisted the imperial jade ring on his finger it was good luck to have the mystical stone prized above all others by the gods against ones flesh it brought health and prosperity to the wearer this was in his mind when he turned the corner and felt the muzzle of a gun bite into the back of his neck he began to turn his head but was dissuaded by a sharp jab to his kidneys dont do that a voice in his ear said general kuo winced and bit his lip so that he should not cry out and thus lose face to his unseen enemy he wondered briefly who it was who had the skill to infiltrate his camp so successfully but was distracted as the flap of his leather holster was unsnapped and his prized colt taken from him i will kill you for this he said through lips compressed with pain i will have you strung up in the center of the compound and there watch the nocturnal animals tear you to pieces big talk tony simbal said keeping the pressure heavy at the back of the chineses neck he risked a glance at the gun jake had taken from the general the standard stocks had been replaced by ones made of carved imperial jade very impressive he said to jake in english then to general kuo in dialect send the men guarding the factory back to where the fighting is but oof pain lanced through general kuos side making his eyes water he did as he was told when the men had left their position simbal said get going where general kuo asked he was wondering how he could reverse his current position into the factory jake said for emphasis simbal jabbed him hard again with the muzzle of the ak and the chinese stumbled forward for the first time general kuo began to worry these two men were not cia and not kgb they had infiltrated his camp therefore they were not fools when it came to foreign devils general kuo was used to dealing with fools and morons this was a new experience for him and he did not like it he was a creature of habit a man who lived by strict rules that he himself had set down he controlled a vast fiefdom of staggering worth any hint of anarchy was anathema to him what do you want his tone had changed it was softer most reasonable perhaps he thought i can strike a bargain with these two there is a shipment set to depart tomorrow morning six hundred kilos of excellent quality number four if this is why you have keep going simbal said jabbing him again so that he lurched heavily against the corrugated tin wall of the factory general kuo gritted his teeth and put his left hand against his heavy belt buckle felt the comforting configuration of the tiny caliber pistol secreted there his fingers twitched not yet he thought it would do him no good to get one man only to be shot by the second man he needed an opportunity to shoot both of them at once what do you want with the factory he said this is not where the tears of the poppy is stored its where they all are jake said general kuo felt a little thrill of fear shoot down his back buddha he thought they are not after the opium at all his fingers closed over the butt of the soon he thought as he led them around to the front door very soon now here is the entrance he said they went up the wooden steps he quested with his senses felt both of them close behind him at the doorway they were crowding forward as he had expected he could physically feel both of them now knew where each stood he put his right hand on the door handle and pulled outward as he did so his left hand jerked the small pistol out of his waistband and he whirled he was already pulling the trigger it was pointblank range there was no question of missing either of them chen ju was in the process of receiving from the two americans the intelligence data which he so keenly desired when he heard the gunshots he whirled as did they all as the front door to the factory flew open rain spattered inward the wind howled then general kuo came in and stared at them each in turn with eyes wide with surprise annoyed at being interrupted at such a crucial moment chen ju barked at him what is it what are you doing here general kuo said angrily when and vomited up a river of blood he took two exaggerated strides into the cavernous room and lurched against one of the zinctopped trestle tables his left arm struck outward sliding across the stained surface his white grasping fingers knocked over a bunsen burner then he looked down at the mess he had made of his uniform said shit his knees buckled and he slid to the floor his eyes stared at them accusingly but did not blink they were already filming over then the doorway was filled not with rain and wind but with the bulk of two men jake and tony simbal came into the factory simbal leveled the ak in the direction of the group of four men jesus fuckin christ edward martin bennett said long time no see simbal said coming quickly into the room jake behind him knelt beside general kuo felt for a pulse hes dead he said and simbal nodded chen ju who was standing almost directly behind peter curran kicked viciously at the american curran taken completely by surprise stumbled toward simbal who immediately opened fire with the submachine gun the boyish face was caught in midexpression the body jerked stood up straight then under the force of the fusillade was thrown backward as if by a high wind to one side came a crackling jake looked around saw the bunsen burner general kuo had upended had been lit flames were spreading along the wooden floorboards in a moment they leapt upward along the line of freestanding wooden cabinets filled with glass bottles and metal containers lets get out of here jake yelled at simbal some of these chemicals are highly flammable i want these fuckers simbal said now jake went past him pushed bennett toward the doorway the old man with the one shoulder higher than the other looked at jake with the expression of a sphinx shi jake he said in a reedy voice jake took him up he did not look like he could go anywhere fast he had about him already the smell of the grave smoke had engulfed the inside of the factory it was a virulent gray acidic sparking singeing the eyes inflaming the back of the throat there was a heavy roar off to one side and a crash the chemical cabinets jake rushed huaishan han outside put him down it was raining heavily and the wind had picked up the roiling sky looked to be at treetop height jake saw simbal and bennett turned remembering the fourth man undoubtedly the naga chen ju he took two paces toward the factory and with a great muffled roar the roof blew off one wall collapsed entirely and now the flames licked upward unmindful of the storm it was impossible to get near the place the heat and the thick acrid smoke penetrated the entire clearing jake turned away saw the old chinese propped against the bole of a tree pain made of his face a lopsided mask he knelt beside him youre huaishan han he said in mandarin the old man seemed surprised surely your late father never mentioned my name it was given to me at the point of death jake said by one of your diqui network the diqui is yours is it not mine the old man said and chen jus it gave him power and you jake said what did it give you old man me why it gave me back my life huaishan han reached out with a taloned claw and drew jake toward him a life that had been taken from me by your father he took everything from me my wife my child my career he ruined me utterly the diqui brought me a reason to live it brought me back into the good graces of a communist chinese regime whose memory had grown dim i was no longer remembered the old guard was all gone purged or died of natural causes except your father he was the only one who would remember and seek to stop my rise to power again inside china he cocked his head as if the barking crackle of the gargantuan fire were speaking to him he had to die you see only he could have stopped me and of course you you had my father murdered only the mountain knows hige moro had said the shan revenge huaishan han said is its own reward your father destroyed me once he did more than destroy me he destroyed my future as well my wife my dearest senlin and my unborn child in the well at shuang jing he threw me down into darkness into hell the old mans eyes were fever bright the chemical flames were reflected in their glossy depths he had done something to senlin you see your father something despicable something unspeakable her mind her entire personality was twisted beyond recognition still i wanted her still i loved her she was the only one i ever loved it was a wail a terrorfilled anguished sound unlike any jake had ever heard before the rain beat a solid tattoo against huaishan hans white face he breathed as if he were running a race he could never finish in the well he said i lived in that hellish place for almost a week my back was broken i could barely move but when i fell i took my senlin with me his eyes were filled with tears they made the flames in reflection seem chimerical changing shape in the manner of windblown clouds she was above me my own battered body protected her from serious injury the same stone outcropping that broke my back now saved us from an endless descent into the depths his head drooped on his stalklike neck his sharp chin brushing his fluttering chest oh he cried she could have saved me she could have saved us both but no she began to fight me she was under your fathers spell some terrible unimaginable sorcery he had worked on her i could scarcely believe it i begged her to save us it was in her power to do so i could hear your father calling to her from above how i hated him i sent my hate upward as if it could entwine itself about him and strangle the life from him but my senlin was gaining in strength and she began to pummel me she was a madwoman i looked in her face and knew that she was no longer sane no longer mine no longer senlin at all she was a stranger huaishan han panted a stranger who was trying to kill me he looked up at jake i did the only thing i could you see she had told me that she was pregnant and at that moment i too must have gone mad i remember thinking it is his child not mine so i killed her and killed it the baby the future in an instant it was all gone everything and for a week afterward they were my sole companions now the old mans head came up and he clutched more firmly at jake so you see it was not enough to kill your father shi jake the tears were gone the eyes were clear and colorless in their passion jake imagined that huaishan han had gazed upon his senlin with such a baleful expression in the split instant before he reached out and snuffed out her life and that of the baby growing inside her abruptly nauseated jake broke the old mans hold on him but huaishan hans taloned claws sought to hold on it was like being in a field of nettles it was not enough shi jake the old man screamed your father took from me not only my love my life but my future is it not fitting that i destroy his now with a great effort jake pushed the demented old man away from him he was disgusted horrified at the depths to which the human soul could sink he turned away toward the flickering fire he meant to find simbal and bennett but instead he saw a figure walking slowly toward him the hair was cut short the fire threw it into stark silhouette against the pelting downpour then it turned and he saw it was a woman the figure came steadily toward him and at last he could see the face that familiar face that had haunted his dreams from the moment nichiren had shot her at the sumchun river four years ago lan his daughter alive lan he said elation filling him lan hello bahba she said and as colonel hu had instructed her pulled out the automatic aimed it and pulled the trigger when tony simbal heard the shot he whirled around the rain flying off him he got the briefest glimpse of jake facing a shadowy figure then bennett took off and simbal went after him the combination of the storm the explosion and the shan diversionary raid at the other end of the compound had put the area into chaos bennett chose to dart in the direction of the fire it was the smart move the factory was on the southern perimeter of general kuos encampment any other direction would take bennett into the compound where he ran the risk of being stopped by kuos men or worse shot by simbals shan warriors simbal had this figured as well so he did not follow bennett directly but rather made for the place beyond the burning factory he would have gone to were he in bennetts place he was at the edge of the jungle already a tangly web of undergrowth was building its way toward the side of the factory although there was ample evidence that it had been hacked back quite recently in the trees he turned moving the muzzle of the ak in a slow steady arc the rain destroyed perspective and the continuing conflagration just meters away cast bizarre shadows that rose and fell with sickening rapidity bennett was nowhere to be found and simbal cursed himself he moved off farther into the jungle began a sweep that would take him parallel to the shell of the factory saw a darting movement and crouching down began to move as quickly as he could toward the spot in that moment felt all the breath go out of him he doubled over as bennett kicked him a second time in the kidneys lost hold of the ak and saw bennetts bulk diving after it simbal went after bennett he grabbed hold of the big mans legs and twisted bennett went down but he was already rolling kicking upward in a vicious thrust the toe of his cowboy boot brushed simbals cheek and then the heel slammed into his jaw simbal reeled backward and bennett lunged for the ak took it up and aimed it hurriedly simbal leapt at bennett as the big man pulled the trigger felt the heat the disintegration and he was inside the spray of bullets used the edge of his hand under bennetts chin in a short sharp chop bennett let go with a whoof of surprise and pain and simbal brought him down jamming an elbow into his sternum but bennett used the stock of the submachine gun smashing it into simbals groin simbal saw stars his breath was steaming in his throat and sickening bile rose upward threatening to choke him bennett scrambled to his feet trained the ak downward christ tony but you were always a pain in my ass what a fucking white knight you are i really think im doing you a favor now by killing you im saving you from a life slaving away in the gray corridors for men with little minds and even littler pocketbooks he curled his forefinger around the aks trigger so long tony simbal his right hand holding his aching lower belly flicked his arm upward and the thin throwing knife stuck to the hilt in bennetts chest he looked utterly astounded and died with that expression imprinted on his face taking three deep breaths simbal got to his knees he took the ak from bennetts grip and staggered back toward the encampment jake felt the blood running along with the rain it pumped from him his life draining away he slipped to his knees regained his feet lan he called lan oh buddha saw her leveling the pistol at him and thought this is a dream some terrible nightmare from which i will awake at any moment but the pain was real and with every beat of his laboring heart he could feel his strength ebbing how could this be happening he thought how he struggled toward her the wind and the rain scoured him he was beaten again to his knees gasping vision blurred he tried to assemble his thoughts but the sight of his daughter and then the knowledge of what she had done to him unnerved him he was frozen shock and despair gripped him unshakably lan he called lan i love you had he ever told her that when was the last time he had held her the last time she had come to him for comfort had he given it even then probably not he had not wanted a daughter he realized now had been disappointed in his first wife that she bore him a female child instead of a male so he had deliberately set about making her as hard in spirit as a man now he knew that he had squeezed all the joy all the life out of her what was left had fled his unhappy household to join the radical triad the steel tigers at the border of the mainland and now insanely she was going to kill him he looked up through his pain and his grief to see the muzzle of the pistol coming down it was aimed at a spot between his eyes there was nothing in his daughters face no recognition no rage no emotion at all she was a machine programmed to perform this hideous task jake made one last attempt to reach her got to his feet and took three quick unsteady steps toward her then toppled to the muddy earth at her feet he was the only thing of which qi lin was aware she heard him calling a name but was hardly aware that it used to be hers instead he seemed to be mouthing some alien tongue which struck her much like the rain she was indifferent to its effect in her mind colonel hus hand stretched out along the cradle of the night caressing her while his mind talked to hers he told her what to do and she listened her finger tightened on the trigger and for the second time she began the slow squeezing motion that would ensure a perfectly placed shot then she was lying prone on the ground gasping in air staring up at another female face bliss had come at her from the blind side slamming into her with the full force of her body she had led with her shoulder driving her weight up from her planted right foot she had no thought other than to save jake breaking away from the diversionary attack at the north end of the encampment she had been searching through the chaos for jake she had been angry that he had placed her away from the main conflict but had seen no reason to argue with him at the time she knew there were other matters occupying him she knew she would get her chance the explosion at the factory had provided her with that and she had taken it she had seen jake shot and had instinctively leveled the ak she carried at his assailant then she had heard him cry out and had recognized lan at first there was no thought of harming the girl merely subduing her but as soon as she came in contact with lan bliss knew that something was very wrong now that she had been openly attacked her lips drew back in a rictus she snarled deep in her throat bliss spoke to her as they wrestled along the ground but the girl either would not or could not respond she was almost certainly mad the decision was instantaneous for the last time bliss entered dahei over the heaving bosom of the moonlit sea she flew toward the strange presence and saw the world turning the world changing herself changing felt the great karmic wheel lurch into motion begin its swing forward always forward carrying her onward toward the edge of the moonlit sea and the unknown that was beyond waiting now she was at close quarters with bans qi and recoiled in horror through the twisted tendrils she recognized the endless war that raged like a ravening beast in and out like a pristine moon revealed through storm clouds bliss could feel glimpses of the true spirit of the girl but the movement of the beast always cut it short the essence of lan was dying inside a mind that had been tortured beyond all reason this wanton destruction was so cruel it made bliss want to weep with pity and rage at the same time she knew what she must do knew now why shi zilin had drawn her into dahei and why she felt the qi of the ages roiling through her like a howling wind she set about doing what shi zilin had trained her to do in the back of her mind was the suspicion that he knew that this moment would eventually come because now she was no longer bliss no longer jakes beloved no longer even shi zilins godgranddaughter she was all these things and more she was the messenger of the celestial guardians of china the wisdom of the ages resided in her the ancient magic of an ancient race the animus of genius that lived on that must be maintained now she was all spirit while quite apart her body continued its physical struggle with lan her qi spread out across the shining skein of dahei began to infiltrate the tortured spirit of lan who had taken the name of qi lin the mystical malefemale beast of chinese mythology the beast who possessed lans spirit had incalculable strength but bliss was not alone shi zilin was with her and someone else another female spirit ancient of ancients the two slim forms rolled and battered one another in the mud while the real struggle was carried on in a secret harbor that no human eye could pierce jake dragging himself centimeter by painful centimeter to where the two women fought could only find fear in his heart in the killing ground there could be only one victor death to the defeated he loved both of them almost more than he could bear and he had to defuse them before the unthinkable tragedy occurred he lurched forward but pulled up short startled he heard the voice that was not a voice repeating stay away jake i can save her if you stay away bliss he went on stumbled over a root on his knees he heard it again jake please stay where you are you will kill your daughter otherwise his head reverberated with the words and he thought i must be hallucinating but knew that was not so now the changes that had worked themselves through bliss leapt up to his consciousness ever since his father had died bliss had been a different person it was as if some mysterious current was running through her she could tell lies from truth what else was she able to do bliss through the rain his agony he called to her as his father had done with senlin i dont want to leave you alone i am not alone jake this must happen if you are to have your daughter back i dont want to have to choose joss jake the wheel has turned bliss i love you bliss the sky was a sheet of iron reverberating with the howls of the beast a rain of zinc hurtled down upon forms inimical to one another clouds of tin and antimony tore at them and a moon of mercury dripped painful illumination bliss or rather the essence of bliss had made her pact with buddha it was time to die she could feel the comforting presence of shi zilin inside her lan was the chosen one the descendant of the line of the guardians of china it was blisss responsibility to cleanse lans mind to rid it of evil just as fazhan had done with senlin so many decades ago to keep the conduit of wisdom and magic alive that would guide china safely into the twentyfirst century by transferring all that resided in her into lan bliss was one with the universe totally immersed within dahei she felt the connection with the generations she was young and old at once large and small male and female she became the continuum of which life and death were but an infinitesimal fraction the passive receptacle rather than the fierce avenger she stole the light from the world she sought the low ground became the rivers to the sea and the sea became her mantle of power the wind as well the rain the storms the dragons of the night rose to her beckoning their fierce breath startling the stalking beast within lan it had been made manifest to her that to cleanse the evil that ran rampant within lan to transfer the power she now possessed she must relinquish her hold on her own corpus that was the only way and bliss found a joy in this for she was playing a key role in the continuum of china because she now knew the folly of the concepts of life and death ideas conjured up by the limits of the human mind now bliss was much more she was the energy of the universe moving and forming in an infinite number of directions cradled within the bosom of the eternal elements she understood how much more there was to existence than mere life bliss was all color swirling greenblue of the seas bluegray of the sky grayblack of stone redorange of fire orangebrowngreen of the foliage in her vision now was the hideous noncolor of the evil that gripped lans mind she flew toward it bliss embraced the evil felt its inimical chill and for an instant sensed her qi begin to shrivel in fear of what it could do to her then thunder rolling through her heart she understood it all that fear was another human idea that it had no meaning in the place within which she dwelled gathering her power like a cloak she opened her arms she engulfed it running through it and in the end absorbing it in a burst of lightenergykineticism that shook her that roared through streams and fields oceans and mountains that thundered in her world for all eternity jake heard something then like the snapping of a twig unmindful of the pain and her warnings he made it to his feet and stumbled the last paces to where the two of them lay bliss was on top and groaning jake went to his knees he pulled bliss off his daughter brought her into his arms bliss he saw the hole ripped in her chest at the spot where her heart was somehow the wound had been instantly cauterized there was no blood only inexplicably the scent of the sea oh no no the rain beat against him and every drop seemed like a reminder of his sins oh bliss he whispered it was impossible to believe that she was gone i will take care of her elder uncle he had said to three oaths she is most precious to me your bousehk until this moment of utter loss he did not know just how precious jake turned his head are you okay jake simbal said i dont know simbal knelt at jakes side his fingers feeling for the wound what happened jake looked down at blisss beautiful face i dont know that either bennetts dead and the old guy with the broken backs where you left him under that tree hes laughing his head off wont stop for anything i think hes lost it jake barely heard a word simbal leaned forward hows this other girl who is she my daughter jake said shes still alive simbal said checking her pulse jake carefully moved bliss off his lap he was very tired with an effort he bent over his daughter her face so long in his memory seemed subtly altered somehow familiar in an altogether unfamiliar way lan he said lan her lids fluttered open her eyes were filled with him bahba she said softly disbelievingly and began to cry times gone so slowly she whispered oh how ive missed you summer present hong kong jake was going to go alone but lan insisted on accompanying him the sun was shining with a fierce intensity the stench of airdrying fish was everywhere the waves of the south china sea were chips of beaten brass where the sunlight hit them in the troughs deep aquamarine shadows crept stealing the light jake still did not walk well the bullet had entered his right side just above the hip perhaps it had chipped off a tiny piece of bone or pierced a nerve it was impossible to say in any case the pain stayed with him not that he minded that it was proof that what had occurred up in the shan had really happened lan when she awoke could not remember seeing him moments before let alone shooting him in fact she was a wholly different person the anger and rage had all been expunged from her she was his little girl again or perhaps he had returned to being her father simbals shan had taken the head of general kuo from its corpse and had held it before them as they had advanced into the camp without their general the army could not exist those not already dead or wounded were disarmed and beaten and sent scrambling down the rocky scree the old man with one shoulder higher than the other was flung like a rag doll after them the shan had no use for a chinese jake and simbal had found him fifty meters down the steep slope head down his neck broken by an outcropping of granite it was an ignominious death for a man who had wielded such awesome power jake crouching over the frail figure could only wonder at the furies of the mind which drove human beings to such lifelong quests his father had been such a man so had been his enemy huaishan han that was ironic and at the same time terribly sad huaishan han had been the darkness to zilins light but they were two sides of the same coin and that was a sobering thought indeed it made jake wonder whether the zhuan should retire at this moment he did not want to look back on a life filled with interminable sorrow as his father and huaishan han had he recalled the session at mckennas house with whiteeye kao and wondered how he ever could have done so much vicious damage to one human being the cause was just or was it the line was blurring for him and that was a danger sign it frightened him that he could justify the means through the end was that a product of being in the dark and the cold on the mountain huaishan han had been like that had his father felt that way as well jake thought he knew the answer perhaps it was time then for him to step aside let someone else shoulder the burden of being tai pan of all tai pan he felt lans hand warm inside his now felt the weight of the urn he held against his chest he breathed deeply abruptly overcome by sadness simbal and rodger donovan had come with jake to hong kong but not for long there was another battle to be won the one involving the power struggle at the quarry alone jake and simbal had shaken hands its not over yet is it jake no jake had said the world wont be safe from kam sang until weve managed to dismantle what theyve built dispersed the scientific team that worked on the project the shan simbal said the shan won out this time the killing ground jake said the place where it all began on the mountain it is cold and dark zilin had cautioned him that is where you are now the shan im going to need your help simbal said theres more than friendship between us jake had said theres trust after simbal and donovan had left jake learned from his hospital bed that bluestones combine had at last succeeded in acquiring more than fifty percent of interasia stock but to do that the tai pans investors had mortgaged their businesses to the hilt he had thrown his head back and laughed for the first time in many weeks so hard in fact that he had almost popped several stitches let them have it he had said to a semihysterical andrew sawyer theyre finished now it is we who are finished sawyer said in a lament on the contrary jake said wiping his eyes he could scarcely believe it the strategy had worked his father had said yes my son gamble everything but father if i lose there is no point zilin had said in gambling pennies bluestone and his combine have paid almost a billion dollars for a company useless for their purposes sawyer was whitefaced have you lost your mind zhuan the entire fortune of the yuhnhyun is tied up in interasia is it jake said this afternoon i want you to go to our lawyers tell him that you require the redstone file jake was studying the others astounded face it was running the gamut of emotions in it you will find all the applicable papers you remember the meeting when my father insisted that all the yuhnhyun assets be signed over to me sawyer nodded no one was very happy about that even your uncle i know jake said but now you see why it had to be done our assets are no longer in interasia over a period of months after the public offering they were moved from their various holding companies even the kam sang holdings are no longer within pak han min in fact interasia trading is nothing but a shell the yuhnhyuns profits flow through it but it owns nothing outright i hope you dont mind bluestone taking a one percent cut thats a helluva good dividend but i think its a small price to pay for the collapse of five star pacific and pacific overland trading as well sawyer cried sir byron nolinkelly has been a thorn in my side for years now we have them all zhuan you are a genius you are a genius those words echoed in jakes mind now as he laced his fingers with lans they had a mocking ring to them a genius he was nothing of the kind he was no more than a zombie now his daughter had returned to him but bliss was gone he clutched the urn tighter to him it was decorated with calligraphy in blue if the seasons did not change the world would cease to breathe the universe would give out and the buddha would close his eyes in the urn were blisss ashes bliss who had died in order that his daughter might live he was grateful for her selflessness but oh he missed her with a sharpness that was almost unbearable they came to the spot where he and three oaths and t y chung threw out the remains of zilin upon the water three oaths and his family were already there prayers had been spoken into the wind the sea breeze rustled lans hair during the time she had been here she had allowed it to lengthen it shone like black gold drifting off her face in ethereal wisps there was no laughter when jake had confronted three oaths there was little to say jake had no explanation for what had happened he no more knew why lan had tried to kill him than he did how bliss had been shot he had not found the pistol in lans hand and no one else had been around to pull the trigger a gun does not go off by itself none of this of course allayed his uncles grief but in this at least they were united she wanted to go three oaths had said she wanted only to be with you i could not forbid her to go he shrugged she did as she wished as she always has done it was her way he turned away wiping the tears from his cheeks i know that you blame yourself younger nephew in this you are wholly western it was her joss i assign no blame i am proud of what she did father lan said now it is time jake nodded he held the urn in front of him a solid breeze was at their backs an orangesailed junk was leaning into the wind heading for the typhoon shelter further out tankers were steaming toward japan on the beach children played building castles out of sand and dreams with an inward sigh he inverted the urn scattering the ashes over the bosom of the ocean reaching out lan touched the shining side of the urn in her mind was a buzzing a pleasant cacophony that reached down to the soles of her feet she was warmed by it calmed it was almost as if the voice of buddha spoke directly to her she heard the calling of the world around her she opened her eyes father she said shi zilin bliss i feel them theyre all around us jake put his arm across her shoulders i know they are lan but perhaps he would never know what it was she truly meant
